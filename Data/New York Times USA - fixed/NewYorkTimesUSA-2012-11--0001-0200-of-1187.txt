HEADLINE: Seeking a Solution, One Tiny Tube at a Time

BYLINE: By CANDICE RAINEY

 BODY:
LAST year, Liz Corry, a product manager for an e-commerce site who lives in Pittsburgh, realized she needed to do something about her sprawling stockpile of beauty samples. She emptied two drawers in her bedroom dresser and transplanted roughly 600 Lilliputian tubes of moisturizers, eye serums, lip glosses and other miniature promises of reinvention.
''I had to go to Ikea and buy organizers just to keep them in place,'' said Ms. Corry, 27, who spends around $200 a month on beauty-sample subscription services like Birchbox, GlossyBox and Julep (which specializes in nail polish), and reviews each tissue-swaddled package delivered to her to doorstep on her hobby blog, My Subscription Addiction. ''I totally got hooked.''
The sample, by design, is meant to leave the customer wanting more. It is why Estée Lauder herself often slipped miniature sizes of silky lotions and creams to strangers, trusting her product to be the most persuasive marketing strategy. 
Now an increasing number of subscription services have cut out the awkward dance of approaching makeup-counter personnel for a freebie. And some customers are getting carried away.
Ms. Corry started with Birchbox, the New York-based beauty club with more than 100,000 members who have filled out a questionnaire to determine what kind of samples are best suited for their skin type, hair color and ''level of beauty knowledge.''
''When I realized they have variations they send out every month, I was jealous about the samples other people were getting,'' she said. ''So I signed up for my second subscription with them.'' She is also a fan of GlossyBox, which at $21 a month is one of the more expensive services, distributing ''deluxe travel size'' and even full-size products from international cosmetic and skin-care companies including Illamasqua, Phyto and Burberry Beauty. Evelyn Nguyen, 25, a part-time adviser for a consumer advice company, who lives in Manchester, England, can relate. She once subscribed to five beauty-of-the-month clubs but reluctantly scaled back to two (JolieBox and Amarya, which is focused on organic products) when she decided to pursue a degree in environmental science. ''It's very addictive,'' said Ms. Nguyen, who stores her haul in a Wonder Woman lunchbox whose lid she can't shut. ''If I had a full-time job, I would be very tempted to keep up with the five.''
Sybil Yang, 36, an assistant professor of hospitality and tourism management at San Francisco State University, subscribes to three sample services and has found herself awash in ''not quite a hundred'' samples,'' she said. ''Half the things I get I'm not going to use because I'm not a lipstick or makeup person, really,'' she said. ''For me, it's the variety you get. There's no way I'm going to be buying five bottles of $200 moisturizer.
Birchbox was started in 2010 by two graduates of Harvard Business School, Katia Beauchamp and Hayley Barna. ''We feel attached to the small miniature element of it,'' Ms. Beauchamp said. ''You get to engage and interact with the product without committing, and it's really delightful.''
But she said the company's ultimate goal was to persuade sample-happy customers to buy full-size products from its Web site, which doles out points for reviews.
''Fifty percent of our subscribers have shopped with us for a full-size product, so a lot of people are transacting,'' Ms. Beauchamp said. ''Of course there's going to be different people who use the service for different reasons.''
Indeed, many women have become so preoccupied with cultivating their collections that they have taken to the Internet to set up swaps with other subscribers. ''It's a big community at the moment,'' said Ms. Nguyen, a member of the Facebook group Beauty Box Swaps.
''I really don't use a lot of makeup stuff, so I try to trade it away,'' said Ms. Yang, who occasionally uses the chat forum MakeupTalk.com, a popular site for the sample hungry who gush or complain about their subscription boxes, share woes about delayed shipping and set up trades with other subscribers. ''It's kind of a way to try even more products. I had very little to lose except for postage, which is two bucks.''
Linda Hoare, 26, a nurse's assistant who lives in Bremer, Wash., and maintains four subscriptions, has mailed out 68 swaps since May. ''If I get one of my boxes and there's a product or something that I really like but I want to do more road-testing, I try to trade for it,'' she said. ''I found this deep conditioner that I like, and I did a swap with a girl, and she ended up sending me, like, eight packages.''
Ms. Hoare, a moderator for MakeupTalk.com, has also joined in more intricate ''circular'' swaps: a sort of Sisterhood of the Traveling Samples. Overseen by volunteers and arranged on chat forum threads, a swap begins with a box starter, who inaugurates the package with 20 to 30 beauty samples and mails it to the next participant. Upon receiving the migrating goody bag, she can take anything she likes as long as she replaces it with samples she is looking to unload, and so on down the list. Ms. Hoare said it was like the thrill of a chain letter, only ''you're doing it with a box of beauty products.''
But some industry professionals do not want to play along.
''I hate samples personally,'' said Jessica Richards, who is an owner of Shen, an upscale beauty boutique in Brooklyn that carries luxury lines like Amanda Lacey and By Terry. ''How am I supposed to understand your brand and feel a weight of your bottle and the texture of your packaging?''
Since many of the brands on Shen's shelves are independent lines, Ms. Richards has to pay for her testers; she charges customers $1.50 for a two-use mini jar. Most return to buy, she said, but a few take advantage.
''They come in and ask all the questions and want a sample of every single thing,'' Ms. Richards said. ''And then they'll come in a few weeks later and they're asking for samples of the things that they sampled last time, so you know they like it but they aren't going to buy it. And I understand. Maybe you're a little cash-strapped. It's a bad economy. But everybody notices, and we all know who they are.''

HEADLINE: Grover Cleveland's Hurricane

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ALGEO. 
Matthew Algeo is the author of ''The President Is a Sick Man: Wherein the Supposedly Virtuous Grover Cleveland Survives a Secret Surgery at Sea and Vilifies the Courageous Newspaperman Who Dared Expose the Truth.''

 BODY:
A DEVASTATING storm slams into New York City; within days, another hits the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. The president refuses to allow the federal government to coordinate relief efforts. No, it's not a glimpse into a future without the Federal Emergency Management Agency under a Romney administration. It's what happened in August 1893, and the consequences of the government's inaction offer valuable lessons today. 
On Tuesday, Aug. 22, in the Atlantic Ocean, four hurricanes were swirling simultaneously, an event never before recorded, and one that would not happen again until 1998. Two would peter out, but over Wednesday night, one of the hurricanes slammed into New York City. At least 30 people were killed. A storm surge swept across southern Brooklyn and Queens, destroying virtually everything in its path. Railroad tracks near Brighton Beach were washed away, along with bath houses and sections of boardwalk.
Four days later, on Aug. 27, the last, even more powerful hurricane made landfall near Savannah, Ga., devastating coastal island communities. As many as 2,000 people were killed, many swept out to sea, never to be seen again. Corn and cotton crops were ruined, and wells were contaminated with seawater.
In the wake of these twin tragedies, however, President Grover Cleveland did nothing.
Cleveland, a Democrat and former governor of New York, opposed government intervention in natural disasters. In his first term he had vetoed a bill that would have given drought-stricken Texas farmers $10,000 for seeds. ''Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character,'' Cleveland wrote in his veto message.
Given his aversion to ''paternalism,'' it's not surprising that the federal government was unresponsive to calls for assistance after the two hurricanes struck. When the South Carolina senator Matthew Butler asked Secretary of War (and Cleveland confidante) Daniel Lamont for help, Mr. Lamont responded that it would be unconstitutional for the government to provide direct aid without an act of Congress -- though he did offer to lend some spare tents to the homeless.
Into the void stepped Clara Barton, the 72-year-old nurse who had founded the American Red Cross 12 years earlier. Almost single-handedly, Ms. Barton organized relief efforts -- distributing food and clothing and supervising the construction of new homes (first for widows and the infirm). Her heroic work, especially in the South, saved countless thousands from disease and starvation.
Grover Cleveland paid a price for his inaction. At the time of the hurricanes, the country was mired in an economic crisis now known as the Panic of 1893. Cleveland's position, while hardly unorthodox -- many Democrats and Republicans at the time shared a similar distaste for government intervention -- did nothing to endear him to a public weary of financial misery. He did not run for a third term in 1896. By then he was so unpopular that even his own party repudiated him. At the Democratic convention in Chicago that year, delegates hurled more insults at Cleveland than at the Republican presidential nominee, William McKinley.
Grover Cleveland was never accused of sacrificing his principles for political expediency. But in politics, sometimes principle has a price.

HEADLINE: Writer's Reservoir: Mill Town and Mother

BYLINE: By JOHN WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Richard Russo's first memoir, "Elsewhere," tells the story of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist's loving and difficult relationship with his mother, Jean. Mr. Russo's parents separated when he was a child in upstate New York. Raised by his mother, he served as her emotional wellspring, for better and worse. As Mr. Russo became a professor and a successful novelist, he remained deeply devoted to Jean, bringing her with him to Arizona and then back to the East Coast. In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Russo discussed his decision to write about his mother, the autobiographical elements of his fiction and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation:
Q.
Why did you decide to write this book about your mother's life now? 
A.
In the months after my mother's death, I thought about her constantly, and she was visiting my dreams, as well. All of which suggested there was unfinished business. My last three novels had all featured characters who were puzzled by destiny, asking themselves, "How did I end up here?" Now I found myself puzzling over the same issues with regard to my mother's life and my own. We shared both a genetic (highly obsessive) nature as well as strikingly similar nurture, having grown up in the same small upstate New York mill town. How could our destinies have diverged so radically? It seemed worth investigating.
Q.
Your mother "was deeply mystified by how many people apparently wanted to read stories set in the kind of industrial backwaters from which she'd worked so hard to escape." Did she express a lot of reaction to your novels? And what was the reaction like?
A.
My mother's reaction to my novels was, as you might expect, complex. She enjoyed seeing the town that shaped both our lives (Gloversville, N.Y.) through the prism of my imagination. Recognizing her husband (my father) in "Nobody's Fool," she remarked that she was far fonder of him on the page than in real life. But my returning to Gloversville in my fiction troubled her. It meant, I think, that she'd failed in what she saw as her primary duty - to get me the hell away from that place and those people.
Q.
It will be tempting for readers familiar with all your work to experience "Elsewhere" as, among other things, a skeleton key to your fiction. As one of those readers, I'm now wondering if your first two novels, "Mohawk" and "The Risk Pool," are your most autobiographical, or are there equal amounts of your own experience in each book?
A.
It will please me immensely if readers feel as if they've been granted an insight into a writer's creative process. Like every writer, I'm always being asked where I get my ideas from; well, here's the answer, or part of it. "Mohawk" and "The Risk Pool" are my most literally autobiographical novels, if by autobiography you mean shared facts and data. Still, while there's far more invention in "Bridge of Sighs," I think of it as the novel that most deeply probes who I am, as a man and as a writer.
Q.
Is there a particular character in any of your novels that was most strongly based on your mother?
A.
Anne Grouse, in "Mohawk," is my mother on a good day - brave, faithful, lovely, determined. Ned Hall's mother in "The Risk Pool" is the same woman on those days when the demons closed in - unhinged, terrified, needy, ill.
Q.
You inherited your mother's deeply conflicted feelings about Gloversville. What's the best thing about the place in your opinion?
A.
This should be an easy question to answer, but it isn't, because I've spent very little time in Gloversville since 1971. In a sense "Elsewhere" is about a place that doesn't exist anymore. The town itself is real enough, but my firsthand knowledge of it is 40-some years out of date.
Q.
Your dad was a frequent gambler but, aside from one stretch you describe, you don't seem to have caught that bug. Is that true, or do you consciously resist the pull of gambling?
A.
No, I think (knock on wood) the bug is gone. A few years ago an academic colleague of mine invited me to come to Vegas with him. A tournament-caliber bridge and poker player, he'd always wondered how he'd fare at a table with pros. We arrived in the afternoon and headed to the casino with plans to meet for dinner that evening. After an hour or so of throwing coins into slots, I got bored and returned to my room, thinking I'd take a nap, and there was my friend. He'd won about 500 bucks in the first hour and gotten bored, just like I had. What happens in Vegas, we concluded, didn't happen to us, at least not anymore.
Q.
How do you think screenwriting has changed your process of writing fiction or changed the final product of your fiction, if it has?
A.
Screenwriting, which demands economy above all else, has made me even more expansive as a fiction writer. I love writing dialogue and putting characters in motion, so for me writing scripts is a lark. But when I return to fiction, I'm free to visit the recesses of my characters' lives that the camera has no access to. It's much more difficult, but also more rewarding.
Q.
There's a theme of "moral outrage" in "Elsewhere" about how industries treat the residents of places like Gloversville. Do you have to consciously make those feelings less polemical in your fiction than the way you feel them in real life?
A.
I think that theme of moral outrage is also present in "Empire Falls" and "Bridge of Sighs." You can be pretty polemical in a novel. What you have to be careful of is appearing, as author, to intrude upon your narrative. When readers sense a writer pulling strings, then they start thinking of the characters as puppets, not really people. I never want to pull readers out of the dream.
Q.
You mention in the book that, as a novelist, you don't consider plot a dirty word. How did you approach plot in nonfiction, given the length and complexity of your relationship with your mother?
A.
I think the best memoirs read like novels, which means, among other things, that the writer must decide what fits the narrative arc and what doesn't. The fact that something actually happened doesn't mean it should be included. A memoirist isn't free to invent, but the shape of the story is up to him. He decides - as in a novel - how and where the story begins (near the end, in this case). He also chooses, just as a novelist does, when to summarize and when time should slow down for a dramatic scene.
Q.
Did this book get nonfiction out of your system, or did it inspire you to want to write more of it?
A.
I never say never, because that's an invitation to the gods to make a fool of you, but "Elsewhere" seems to have satisfied my need to tell that particular kind of truth.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Like Other Automakers, G.M. Has Earnings Hurt by a Loss in Europe

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors on Wednesday reported profits in every region of the world except Europe, where it once again extended one of the longest losing streaks in the auto industry.
G.M., the nation's largest automaker, said its third-quarter earnings fell 14 percent because of another large loss in Europe, as well as slimmer profit margins in its core North American market.
The company said its net income for the quarter was $1.48 billion, down from $1.73 billion in the period a year earlier, but ahead of Wall Street's expectations. 
Global revenue increased to $37.6 billion, up from $36.7 billion in the third quarter of 2011.
Like those of many other automakers, G.M.'s losses broadened in the troubled European market, where sales have dropped to their lowest level in almost 20 years. The company said its pretax loss in the region was $478 million, compared with $292 million a year ago.
Unlike some of its rivals in Europe, G.M. has a long record of losses predating the economic crisis on the Continent.
G.M. has lost $16 billion in the last dozen years in Europe. And while the company has turned around its North American operations and is thriving in Asia since its government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009, its European business has continued to decline.
The company now expects full-year losses in Europe of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.
Nevertheless, G.M. executives said Wednesday that G.M. was more committed than ever to fixing Opel, its principal European brand, and returning the division to profitability by mid-decade.
''Opel is not an island unto itself,'' said Stephen J. Girsky, G.M.'s vice chairman and acting chief executive of the European unit. ''It is an integral part of the company.''
Mr. Girsky declined to say whether G.M. was considering large-scale job cuts and factory closings to better align its production and market share.
The Ford Motor Company, G.M.'s Detroit rival, last week said it would close three plants in Europe and eliminate 5,700 factory jobs in an effort to revitalize its European business.
Mr. Girsky reiterated earlier promises to trim costs in Europe with shorter workweeks, better inventory management, and fewer bottlenecks in management.
''This company used to build cars without dealer orders,'' said Mr. Girsky. ''We don't do that anymore.''
Analysts said the price of G.M. shares is now linked directly to its troubles in Europe and its strategy to revitalize the business. ''G.M. urgency and investor patience are key ingredients for the stock to work,'' Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note to investors.
G.M. shares rose nearly 10 percent in Wednesday trading, closing at $25.50, up $2.22.
Even with the European loss, G.M.'s quarterly performance exceeded analysts' expectations.
The company reported pretax income of $1.82 billion in North America, down from $2.19 billion last year.
Some of that decline was anticipated, as Toyota and Honda have regained market share they lost to G.M. and other companies last year because of inventory shortages caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, called the third quarter ''solid'' and said the company was gaining traction with new vehicles while addressing financial challenges like pension costs.
Mr. Akerson said new products, particularly passenger cars like the Chevrolet Malibu, will help G.M. stabilize its market share in the United States.
In the first nine months of this year, G.M. had 18.1 percent of the domestic market, compared with 20 percent during the period a year ago, according to the research firm Autodata.
''Customers around the world love our new vehicles, and we're also seeing green shoots take hold on tough issues like complexity reduction, pensions and Europe,'' Mr. Akerson said in a statement.
G.M.'s other overseas operations fared far better than Europe. The company said its international unit, which is anchored by its large Chinese business, earned pretax income of $689 million, compared with $365 million last year. Its South American division reported pretax income of $114 million, in contrast to a loss of $44 million in the period.
G.M. also said that about 30 percent of eligible salaried retirees in the United States had elected to take lump-sum payments in exchange for giving up regular pension benefits.
Pension obligations for the rest of the salaried retirees will be transferred to Prudential Insurance next month, the company said. G.M. will take a $2.9 billion pretax charge in the fourth quarter for the pension changes.
The company sold 2.23 million vehicles worldwide during the quarter, a slight increase from the 2.22 million sold a year ago.
Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the automobile research site Edmunds.com, said the automaker's results were in line with the rest of the industry.
''G.M.'s global performance is hardly out of line with any other automaker, whether it's the company's strength in the North American market or its weakness in the European market,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Where Creations Faced Destruction

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN; Randy Kennedy and Carol Vogel contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The first thing you noticed walking through the streets lined with art galleries between 10th and 11th Avenues in Chelsea, on Wednesday, was the constant, undulating roar of generators, and the hoses, in clumps of three or four, snaking out of just about every gallery, from which cold water that had come flooding in from the Hudson River now gushed into the street. But if you peeked into the darkened galleries -- no one here had electricity -- you got a sense of the toll Hurricane Sandy has taken on the district, an important part of the arts economy.
Gallery owners and employees -- some calm and philosophical, some too distraught to speak -- spent Wednesday sorting through the artworks that had been hanging on their walls or were packed in their storage rooms, separating those that were irrevocably damaged from those that stood a good chance of being restored. Some owners described themselves as lucky, having suffered less extensive damage than their neighbors. But scarcely a gallery was unscathed. 
''We were expecting a foot of water, and we got four,'' said David Zwirner, who was about to mount an exhibition of works by Luc Tuymans and Francis Alÿs at his gallery on West 19th Street. ''There was a lot of damage, but it would be impossible at this point to say how much. I have a feeling that many of the pieces can be restored.''
Mr. Zwirner said that he had ''prepared diligently'' and had moved much of his art to his warehouse in Queens, which he said was untouched.
''But the gallery itself was hit hard,'' he said, despite his having piled up sandbags in the hope of keeping the water out. Besides artwork, he lost computers, furniture and flat files that had been stored on the ground floor.
Across the street at Chambers Fine Arts, a gallery that specializes in contemporary Chinese works, Jeff Schweitzer walked across the main gallery room, where a handful of large paintings were drying in the middle of the floor. He pointed out that because four stairs lead up from the entrance to the gallery floor, the water level in the gallery was only about two feet.
''The stuff on the walls was O.K.,'' he said, ''but the work we had in storage was lost, although it's possible that some pieces can be restored. In a lot of cases, once the pieces are stretched, they'll be fine.''
Two buildings west, at the large space run by Klemens Gasser and Tanja Grunert, the scene was one of complete devastation, partly because the main showing space was at the basement level. Upstairs, at the street-level part of the gallery, large pieces leaned against the walls, and workmen cleared out debris.
''We put everything upstairs,'' Ms. Grunert said, ''but we had five feet of water at street level.'' She said that she had storage facilities elsewhere too, but had not had time to check their condition.
Gallery owners declined to speak in terms of the number of works destroyed or the financial value of the pieces that were lost, partly, they said, because they simply won't know until they do complete annotated inventories.
''I haven't even seen everything yet,'' said Zach Feuer, whose gallery is on West 22nd Street, midway between 10th and 11th Avenues. ''But I would say that perhaps 2 percent of my inventory escaped damage.''
Mr. Feuer pointed to a five-foot water line on his wall and noted that the gallery sloped down in the rear -- something other owners pointed out about their own spaces -- so the water was deeper in the back, where many have storage and office space.
''When I got here, I found things that were in the back room were up against the front window,'' Mr. Feuer said.
Tony Coll, the property manager for the building that includes Mr. Feuer's gallery, as well as the Franklin Parrasch Gallery and the CRG Gallery (it is the former home of the Dia Center for the Arts), said that artworks aside, the storm caused damage to the building that would have to be dealt with before many of the galleries could get back to business.
''For starters, we have no power,'' Mr. Coll said, ''and there was potential damage to the electrical systems. We will also have to repair damage to interior walls and doors, and exterior glazing.'' He expected the costs for his building to be about $200,000.
Mr. Feuer was not alone in noting the force with which the overflowing Hudson filled space. Rachel Churner, who opened a gallery, Churner & Churner, a year and a half ago at 205 10th Avenue, between West 22nd and West 23rd, said that water rushed so violently into her basement storage that it tore shelves and cabinets from the walls and piled them up at one end of the space, destroying work that had been put in waterproof boxes and bags and put on high shelves.
''We must have had at least five feet of water in the basement,'' Ms. Churner said. ''To be honest with you, we're not even sure yet what happened down there.''
''There's a lot of stuff that's just not going to be salvageable,'' she said, adding that among the pieces destroyed were works from her own collection. ''The fury of the water was tremendous. We were definitely caught off guard.'' Like most other galleries, hers will remain closed at least until the power comes back on and probably for many days after that. ''Then we'll start our mammoth insurance claim and try to go from there.''
Larry Gagosian, the superdealer with galleries at three locations in Manhattan, said he had been coping with downed phone lines at his gallery on Madison Avenue and had not had a chance to visit his two Chelsea galleries. But he said that employees on the scene told him that while the 21st Street gallery had about four feet of water, the 24th Street gallery took in only a few inches.
''Thank goodness we had warning this was coming because we moved a lot of art high up on the walls before the storm,'' he said.
One owner, Andrew Freiser of Fredericks & Freiser, on West 24th Street, said he felt lucky, and noted that a border of electrical tape around his doors and windows had reduced the amount of water that got into the space.
''Who'd have thought?'' he said, pointing to a four-foot water line on the outside of his door, and a one-foot water line just inside. ''We were very lucky.''
Many galleries, like Elizabeth Dee, on West 20th Street near 11th Avenue, were trying to find locksmiths to help them get into their galleries, which were sealed shut behind powerless security gates. (Late on Wednesday, workers were able to get into the gallery, where there was some water damage but none to art work, Ms. Dee said.)
And at least one business in the area, the nonprofit art book shop Printed Matter, has taken to Facebook in the hope of getting art fans to help in the business of cleaning and salvaging.
''The basement of Printed Matter was severely flooded during the Hurricane,'' a note on the store's Facebook page said. ''We could definitely use some extra pairs of hands if anyone is in the neighborhood and can spare a few hours to help.''

HEADLINE: One Result of Hurricane: Bipartisanship Flows

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
The power of the image could not have been lost on a politician as savvy as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey: With days to go before a cliffhanger election, a Democratic president was giving the handshake-back pat to his Republican opponent's most aggressive campaigner as they prepared to embark on a tour of damage from a catastrophic storm.
Mr. Christie had been scheduled to campaign for Mitt Romney, but he embraced the moment. When President Obama praised the governor after they finished their tour -- ''I want to let you know your governor is working overtime'' -- the two were soon swapping compliments. 
''It's been a great working relationship,'' Mr. Christie said.
''I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state,'' he added during a brief news conference. He said it was ''my honor'' to turn the podium over to the president and then stood just behind him, occasionally nodding and smiling at his jokes.
For all the disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy, the most unexpected may have been its unsettling effect on a presidential campaign winding into its final days. Perhaps nothing demonstrated the sudden upending of a political landscape years in the making so much as Mr. Christie's unexpected and effusive praise of Mr. Obama. Only last week he dismissed the president as ''clutching for the light switch of leadership.''
The scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management -- only it was run free of charge. And for those who missed it, Mr. Christie repeated his praise again and again in television interviews, saying the president had been ''outstanding,'' ''incredibly supportive'' and ''deserves great credit.''
As pundits mused about the political implications for the presidential race, few of those watching, including campaign aides to the president and Mr. Romney, could do more than guess about the latest wild-card move from a wild-card governor.
Was he just a selfless leader making sure that he and his state had the ear of the man holding the federal purse strings? Or a selfish climber who figured he could run for president in 2016 if Mr. Romney were to lose this year? Or maybe he saw it in purely local terms, as a way to scare away a potentially strong Democratic challenger, like the popular Newark mayor, Cory A. Booker, at a time when the state's unemployment rate hovers well above the national average.
As Mr. Obama stood beside Mr. Christie and gushed about ''his extraordinary leadership,'' Romney aides were eager to make nothing of the partnership.
''He's a governor focused on his job,'' said Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser. ''He has said he's not looking at this through the lens of politics. He's right, and I expect most folks are looking at it just like the governor is.''
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the visit should not be seen as a political event. ''This is a time to focus on what was a devastating storm and the terrible aftermath of that storm,'' he said.
But Mr. Christie did not completely set aside politics: he has blasted Democrats in the State Legislature for not allowing him to raise fines on utilities that do not respond quickly enough to power failures, and he has picked a fight with the Democratic mayor of Atlantic City.
Part of it may be that Mr. Christie still feels like a youngster in a candy shop about being governor -- he tells audiences at home that when he sees his name and title etched in gold on his office door, he asks himself, ''How the hell did this happen?'' When the president calls, it's still a pinch-me moment. Even when he wakes you up.
''It's O.K., he's allowed to,'' he told reporters.
Before the visit Wednesday, Mr. Christie mentioned several times that he and the president had talked ''just the two of us,'' and that the president had insisted that if he had any problems, he was to call him directly.
Mike DuHaime, an adviser to Mr. Christie, said the governor was acting true to form. ''He calls 'em as he sees 'em,'' he said. ''If they're working well together, he's going to say it.''
Mr. Christie has not announced whether he will run for a second term, but if he does, Election Day is a mere year and five days away. His approval ratings are high in New Jersey, but Mr. Obama's are higher.
It would not be the first time that Republicans have accused him of putting his own interests first: many criticized him after he delivered the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention, when it took him 15 minutes to mention Mr. Romney's name.
But one Republican close to Mr. Romney said that Mr. Christie would have been accused of playing politics if he had said no to the president's post-storm visit, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York had.
Still he seemed at times almost dismissive of Mr. Romney. When a host of Fox and Friends asked whether Mr. Romney would come visit New Jersey, the governor replied sternly: ''I have no idea,'' he said. ''Nor am I the least bit concerned or interested.''
As the president and the governor flew over the devastated Jersey Shore, at least one resident seemed to be staying on message. At the north end of Point Pleasant Beach, someone had etched in the sand: ''ROMNEY.''

HEADLINE: Beginning a Laborious Comeback: Sudden Demand for Builders Is Keenly Felt in Wake of Destruction

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL and SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Bad news for hurricane-ravaged homeowners is good news for at least one contingent: construction companies and the army of workers they plan to hire, many of whom have been idled and ailing from the housing bust for nearly half a decade.
Two days into the destruction from Hurricane Sandy, phones were ringing nonstop at Garden State Public Adjusters in Marlton, N.J., ProStar Residential Disaster Cleanup in Milford, Conn., and other businesses along the Eastern Seaboard. Construction crews cannot get into many of the affected areas yet, because of flooded streets, detours and debris. Even so, customers were lining up, begging for help to pluck branches out of windows, suck water from basements and living rooms, and rebuild damaged roofs and homes. 
It is an exercise many contractors had been through before.
''I always look forward to a natural disaster,'' said Doug Palmieri, owner of Palmieri Construction in Middlefield, Conn. ''The last two storms we had around here, the snow we had included, helped out the contracting business quite a bit.''
Construction companies and insurance adjusters that are newer or less known have begun circling waterlogged neighborhoods in their cars and trucks and distributing fliers, handshakes and condolences.
''I drove around with my truck and a couple people stopped me and asked me for a business card,'' said Mayara Goncalves, owner of Queiroga Construction in Bridgeport, Conn. ''Unfortunately for everyone else, it's going to be good for us.''
The five-person Queiroga Construction is hoping to meet demand with longer hours and subcontractors. Many construction companies along the East Coast, though, say they expect to hire, although the magnitude of the work and the number of additional laborers are still to be determined.
''There is going to be so much manpower required, and we are already spread so thin,'' said Bill O'Connell, president of Elite Public Adjusters, which runs both an insurance adjustment company and a restoration and construction business in North Wildwood, N.J. He expects at least a million dollars of work from this storm. ''I'm a little worried about being overwhelmed. The phones are ringing off the hook and we won't be able to get to a lot of people.''
Some companies expressed concern about finding enough workers quickly, given that the slowdown in construction over the last few years has caused workers to seek their fortunes elsewhere.
''Over the course of the recession, 60 to 75 percent of construction workers left the area because there was no work to keep them busy,'' said Pat Broom, owner of Phoenix Restoration, a 15-year-old company in Kill Devil Hills, N.C., on the Outer Banks. ''That's the first thing we worried about this morning when we got in: Where do we get the people?''
Even in areas where people are desperate for work, some companies say they have trouble finding workers with the skills and motivation for hard physical labor.
''The challenge is going to be finding help,'' said John Scotti of Scotti Brothers Custom Home Renovation in Cumberland County, N.J. ''The phone doesn't stop ringing with people looking for jobs, and then you bring them in and they don't want to work. The only ones that want to work are those who are here illegally.''
Businesses are hoping that the burst of construction work will draw back workers to their areas. Last year, the rebuilding efforts from Hurricane Irene attracted construction workers and insurance adjusters from as far away as Texas.
So far, though, companies said they have been inundated with more calls for work than job applicants. Some expect workers to start flowing into affected areas later this week when transportation returns to normal.
While some pleas for service are coming in steadily and urgently, it will probably take awhile for the bulk of the construction jobs to get going in earnest.
First, the areas need to dry out sufficiently for crews to begin work, which could take days to weeks. After Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, said Ms. Broom of Phoenix Restoration in the Outer Banks, it took two weeks for the standing water to dry in some areas. In the meantime, septic systems overflowed and bacteria festered, making the jobs more complicated and expensive.
Many homeowners are also waiting for insurance companies to come through with money or at least an assessment, a process that can take days or months.
''Especially with the way the economy is, people don't have money just sitting in the bank to pay for a $20,000 or $30,000 job,'' said Victor Rosado, owner of Professional Home Builders in Milford, Conn. And often, people struggle to come up with the costs that insurance does not cover.
''No one's ever whole after something like this,'' Mr. Rosado said. ''They tend to think that the insurance company will come in and make everything whole, but that never happens.''
He said that money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency may help hasten the pace of reconstruction, since President Obama authorized federal aid for parts of the country struck by the storm.
The other reason reconstruction may drag on over the next year is that many of the affected areas -- like the Jersey Shore or the Outer Banks -- are vacation areas, and the vacation season is over. Some owners have started calling construction companies and claims adjusters to survey the damage. Others are hundreds of miles away and out of touch.
Even those in the affected area or somewhere nearby may not have power and are having difficulty contacting contractors, insurance companies and other services.
While construction companies and their new hires may profit from the destruction, homeowners and companies are out billions of dollars for their physical damages and lost business hours, which can ripple through local economies. But one longer-term benefit might be new building stock that is better than what was swept away, as was the case in rebuilding along the Outer Banks in North Carolina after previous storms.
''When government authorities facilitate rebuilding quickly and effectively, the process of economic renewal, in many tangible ways, can leave communities better off than before,'' said Peter Morici, an economics professor at the Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland.
He estimated that the economic losses from Sandy would be $35 billion to $45 billion, but that economic benefits from reconstruction and its ripple effects would total about $27 billion to $36 billion, not including gains of about $10 billion ''from a more modern and productive capital stock.''

HEADLINE: 'Ex-Gay' Men Fight Back Against View That Homosexuality Can't Be Changed

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- For most of his life, Blake Smith said, ''every inch of my body craved male sexual contact.''
Mr. Smith, 58, who says he believes homosexual behavior is wrong on religious grounds, tried to tough it out. He spent 17 years in a doomed marriage while battling his urges all day, he said, and dreaming about them all night.
But in recent years, as he probed his childhood in counseling and at men's weekend retreats with names like People Can Change and Journey Into Manhood, ''my homosexual feelings have nearly vanished,'' Mr. Smith said in an interview at the house in Bakersfield, Calif., he shares with his second wife, who married him eight years ago knowing his history. ''In my 50s, for the first time, I can look at a woman and say 'she's really hot.' ''
Mr. Smith is one of thousands of men across the country, often known as ''ex-gay,'' who believe they have changed their most basic sexual desires through some combination of therapy and prayer -- something most scientists say has never been proved possible and is likely an illusion. 
Ex-gay men are often closeted, fearing ridicule from gay advocates who accuse them of self-deception and, at the same time, fearing rejection by their church communities as tainted oddities. Here in California, their sense of siege grew more intense in September when Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law banning use of widely discredited sexual ''conversion therapies'' for minors -- an assault on their own validity, some ex-gay men feel.
Signing the measure, Governor Brown repeated the view of the psychiatric establishment and medical groups, saying, ''This bill bans nonscientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide,'' adding that the practices ''will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery.''
But many ex-gays have continued to seek help from such therapists and men's retreats, saying their own experience is proof enough that the treatment can work.
Aaron Bitzer, 35, was so angered by the California ban, which will take effect on Jan. 1, that he went public and became a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the law as unconstitutional.
To those who call the therapy dangerous, Mr. Bitzer reverses the argument: ''If I'd known about these therapies as a teen I could have avoided a lot of depression, self-hatred and suicidal thoughts,'' he said at his apartment in Los Angeles. He was tormented as a Christian teenager by his homosexual attractions, but now, after men's retreats and an online course of reparative therapy, he says he feels glimmers of attraction for women and is thinking about dating.
''I found that I couldn't just say 'I'm gay' and live that way,'' said Mr. Bitzer, who plans to seek a doctorate in psychology and become a therapist himself.
Many ex-gays guard their secret but quietly meet in support groups around the country, sharing ideas on how to avoid temptations or, perhaps, broach their past with a female date. Some are trying to save heterosexual marriages. Some, like Mr. Bitzer, hope one day to marry a woman. Some choose celibacy as an improvement over what they regard as a sinful gay life.
Whether they have gone through formal reparative therapy, most ex-gays agree with its tenets, even as they are rejected by mainstream scientists. The theories, which have also been adopted by conservative religious opponents of gay marriage, hold that male homosexuality emerges from family dynamics -- often a distant father and an overbearing mother -- or from early sexual abuse. Confronting these psychic wounds, they assert, can bring change in sexual desire, if not necessarily a total ''cure.''
(While some women also struggle with sexual identity, the ex-gay movement is virtually all male.)
Major mental health associations say teenagers who are pushed into therapy by conservative parents may feel guilt and despair when their inner impulses do not change.
Reparative therapy suffered two other major setbacks this year. In April, a prominent psychiatrist, Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, publicly repudiated as invalid his own 2001 study suggesting that some people could change their sexual orientation; the study had been widely cited by defenders of the therapy.
Then this summer, the ex-gay world was convulsed when Alan Chambers, the president of Exodus International, the largest Christian ministry for people fighting same-sex attraction, said he did not believe anyone could be rid of homosexual desires.
Joseph Nicolosi, a psychologist and clinical director of the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic in Encino, Calif., which he describes as the largest reparative therapy clinic in the world, disagreed.
''I don't believe that anybody is really gay,'' he said. ''I believe that all people are heterosexual but that some have a homosexual problem, and some of these people attempt to resolve their conflict by adopting a sociopolitical label called 'gay.' ''
By unearthing family trauma, Dr. Nicolosi said, many patients find their homosexual urges dissipating.
Jeremy S., 34, a corporate contract officer in Dallas, says he is among them. Jeremy, who did not want his last name printed to avoid embarrassing his parents, said that from his teens until three years ago he lived as a gay man, at times having sex almost daily. ''It wasn't working for me,'' he said.
After two years of therapy via Skype with Dr. Nicolosi's clinic, he said, ''my attraction to men was drastically diminishing.'' He said he has not had sex with a man for more than two years and does not think about it more than once a month, adding that his Catholic faith has also deepened.
Critics like Wayne Besen, the executive director of Truth Wins Out, which fights antigay bias, liken such therapy to faith healing, with apparent effects that later fade away.
They also point out that the failures of such therapy are seldom reported.
S. Marc Breedlove, a neuroscientist and psychologist at Michigan State University, said there was overwhelming evidence that sexual orientation is affected by both biology and environment. Clearly, he said, reparative therapy helps some people alter sexual behavior. But that is far different, he noted, from transforming instinctive sexual desires, something never proved in scientific studies.
Cameron Michael Swaim, 20, said he is in the early stages of his struggle to overcome homosexual desires. Mr. Swaim is unemployed and lives with his parents in Orange County, Calif., where his father is a pastor of the Evangelical Friends Church of the Southwest.
He tried the gay life, but ''it just doesn't settle with me,'' he said, and ultimately decided ''there's got to be a way to heal this affliction.''
Through weekend retreats and participation in a Southern California support group Mr. Swaim has started to explore his family relations, he said, something that has been painful but seems to be helping.
''I'm building my confidence around men,'' he said, '' and that has built my confidence around women.''
Five years from now, Mr. Swaim hopes, he will be engaged or married. In the meantime, he is trying to scrape together enough money to start seeing a reparative therapist.

HEADLINE: The Trade: After Bailout, Giants Dominate the Mortgage Business

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER, PROPUBLICA. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Mortgage rates are so low that it may seem like a great time to get a mortgage. For banks, however, it probably is the greatest time ever.
The profit margin on the rates that they can charge customers and the price they can earn for selling those mortgages to investors is at a record. This is measured as the "spread," or difference, between mortgage securities yields and mortgage rates.
Given that housing prices are beaten up and borrowers must put down bigger cushions than in recent years, it is "the most profitable, safest time ever to be a mortgage bank," says Scott Simon, who is the head of mortgage investing at Pimco. 
In the old days, there used to be a word for this kind of thing: price gouging.
And who is doing the gouging? Mainly, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. In the third quarter, reported in the last several weeks, both banks earned robust profits from the mortgage business.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, vented this frustration in a recent speech, blaming the concentration of mortgage-making power at a few big banks.
Mr. Dudley is right. But what he didn't say was that his own institution (the Fed), his former boss (Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner) and the Bush and Obama administrations delivered us this mess.
The broken mortgage market is the unintended consequence of the flawed banking bailout and the flaccid regulatory response in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
The government and the regulators have had two broad approaches to banking oversight during the crisis and its aftermath. First, regulators coddled the troubled big banks. The two weak behemoths, Citigroup and Bank of America, were granted time to work off their bad loans. Regulators practiced forbearance, overlooking the self-inflicted debacles - mostly housing related - on their balance sheets.
Regulators, meanwhile, encouraged the healthy giants to get even bigger by gobbling up the small and weak. So Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, and JPMorgan snapped up Washington Mutual.
It would be foolish to blame Wells Fargo and JPMorgan for this situation. Restaurants with 100 customers waiting in line outside the door wouldn't, and shouldn't, be expected to lower their prices; why should banks?
Yet allowing takeovers without forcing weak competitors to get healthy quickly leads to an oligopoly. Exhibit A: Wells Fargo and JPMorgan dominate the mortgage business. They should face some competition. Instead, their biggest threats, Citigroup and Bank of America, are, astonishingly, pulling out.
Citigroup and Bank of America appear to have made a profound mistake. It's one of the many strategic errors that ultimately got Vikram S. Pandit ousted as Citi's chief executive. Mr. Pandit viewed mortgages as a "noncore" business for Citigroup. Whoops.
But it's not a surprising one. These are traumatized institutions, limping along, preoccupied by the past and unable to look forward, says Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and author of the new crisis account, "Bull by the Horns." She rightly calls it "another downside of the bailouts. We simply propped up weak institutions instead of making them restructure."
The odd twist is that the Federal Reserve is a victim here, too. Despite its move to buy mortgage-backed securities in its latest round of extraordinary measures to lower interest rates, it can nudge them only so far because of the dysfunctional, noncompetitive market.
Regulators could have broken up Citigroup and Bank of America, spinning off their mortgage operations into well-capitalized, nimble competitors. Perhaps they could have forced those banks to take big write-downs on their mortgage assets, settled their lawsuits and moved on, putting the past where it belongs.
Bankers, of course, don't like this analysis. It's common for them and others to argue that what's really ailing the mortgage market are delays in putting new Dodd-Frank mortgage rules in place, like the ones that define the standards for mortgages that can be bundled into securities.
And, yes, that is probably hindering new competition from entering the market, though it certainly can't fully, or even mostly, explain Citigroup and Bank of America abandoning the field. And, of course, the banks themselves bear much of the blame because they went all out to obstruct the rollout of new regulations. But, ultimately, the Dodd Frank delay is yet another example of how the government's inefficient postcrisis process has hurt the marketplace.
There has been plenty of talk about how the government saved the financial system after the crisis. And it did. Now the question is: Is this what we saved it for?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Island Havens for Investment Citizenship

BYLINE: By DANIA SAADI

 BODY:
DUBAI -- While the London Olympics opening ceremony was under way in July, a Syrian businessman in Dubai watched the team from the Caribbean island federation of St. Kitts and Nevis parade on his television screen.
''I had never heard of St. Kitts until I started researching the country last year, but now I expect to become a citizen in a few months,'' said the businessman, who said he had applied in July for second citizenship there. He declined to be identified because his application was still being processed.
While some Western billionaires may emigrate or adopt new nationalities for tax reasons, rich citizens from the Middle East, North Africa, Iran and Pakistan have other reasons. Since the 2001 attacks on the United States, many have become wary of visa problems, the disruption caused by international economic sanctions against Iran and, more recently, the political and economic instability following the Arab revolutions. 
To escape the region's troubles, they are paying from $100,000 to millions to qualify for citizenship-by-investment programs -- known as economic citizenship -- offered by several countries, including Canada and St. Kitts and Nevis.
St. Kitts and other Caribbean island states, like Dominica, have some of the most popular economic citizenship programs, handing applicants' passports a few months after they have invested in certain programs.
In the past five years, political and economic conditions in the Middle East and North Africa, ''such as the financial crises of 2008 and of course the Arab Spring, were the key factors explaining the phenomenal increase of demand for residency and citizenship by investment programs,'' said Armand Arton.
Mr. Arton, chief executive officer of Arton Capital, a financial advisory business based in Montreal dealing in immigrant investor programs, said his firm had provided advice to more than 500 families in 2011 and that 75 percent of them had been from the Middle East.
Lebanese citizens, Syrians caught in a bloody civil war and Iranians suffering from ever-tightening U.N. and Western sanctions aimed at Tehran's nuclear program are among the people most eagerly seeking second citizenship.
''The first choice for Iranians and Syrians right now who need a fast solution to their problem is to have another nationality and passports so they can move their families and money without sanctions and restrictions,'' Mr. Arton said.
Some countries, like Bulgaria, Britain and Canada, offer economic citizenship programs but take years to process applications, he noted. Others, with a pressing need to cut public debt and attract foreign direct investment, move faster. St. Kitts and Nevis, with a population of about 55,000 and a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of 154 percent at the end of 2011 -- one of the highest in the world, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund -- is a case in point.
The international consulting firm Henley & Partners, which specializes in real estate, residency and citizenship services, has seen the number of its Middle Eastern clients seeking second passports more than from one year to the next since the start of the Arab revolution, said Marco Gantenbein, a partner based in Dubai.
''Applicants are usually from unstable countries where they are afraid their family will be blocked from traveling outside a country and they are afraid their assets could be frozen,'' Mr. Gantenbein said.
Citizenship demand has spawned a lucrative business for law firms, financial intermediaries and even banks like HSBC, which offer investor immigrant services.
Range Developments, a hotel developer based in the United Arab Emirates, joined with Hyatt Hotels this year to promote a luxury resort hotel project in St Kitts. Investors putting a minimum $400,000 into the Park Hyatt St. Kitts program will qualify to apply for economic citizenship.
Rising demand has recently prompted some countries to raise the entry bar and tighten regulatory controls: Dominica, for example, increased its minimum investment threshold this year, while Canada temporarily suspended its federal immigrant investor program in July and has started to strip citizenship from people found to have lied about their residence qualifications in their applications to the program.
''Everyone prefers Western citizenship,'' said Sam Bayat, managing director of Bayat Legal Services, a Dubai law firm specializing in immigration law, referring to the United States, Canada, Britain and other European countries.
But, he noted, ''migration to Western countries has become more difficult,'' because of an increasingly strict application of physical residency requirements: ''Getting citizenship has become almost impossible without staying -- and of course the second problem is international travel and sanctions.''
As a result, economic citizenship programs offered by states like St. Kitts and Nevis, which apply no physical residency requirements, have become ''extremely popular,'' Mr. Bayat said.
Yet even there, some would-be citizens are starting to find that the door is closing.
Responding to the tightening of sanctions on Tehran, St. Kitts stopped accepting Iranians living in Iran a year ago. It now processes applications only from Iranians already living abroad.
Advisory firms have also become more choosy: Henley & Partners says it stopped accepting Iranian clients last year, while Mr. Arton said his firm had turned down a Libyan client after due diligence found that he had links to the slain Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Still, the loss of potential clients has been offset by a surge in applicants from countries like Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt, who increasingly see the benefit of holding multiple nationalities.
''Passport collectors are always sophisticated businessmen,'' Mr. Arton said. ''Because they have had limitations with their passports of origin, now that they can afford it, they prefer to have more than one passport and apply in parallel in two or three programs.''
Multiple applications protect against the risks that programs might be canceled or passports withdrawn. Grenada, in the Caribbean , for example, halted a program in 2001 amid U.S. security concerns and Canadian concerns over money laundering.
Still, Grenada's government has proposed a new immigration program to help its debt-hobbled economy. Other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America are also likely to join the pack: Mr. Gantenbein said he expected one country to announce a program in November, though he declined to say which.
''With the actual Syrian and Iranian political situation worsening, and upcoming elections in Pakistan, the region is not looking more stable in the next five years, which means demand will continue to rise at least by 30 percent to 50 percent per year,'' Mr. Arton said.

HEADLINE: Passage to Asia Opens in London

BYLINE: By GINANNE BROWNELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Tsherin Sherpa's works are swirling juxtapositions of colors, history, themes, religion and politics. The painting ''Untitled, 2012,'' made from gold leaf, acrylic and ink on linen, is aptly unnamed, as there are so many images in the painting that choosing one name to sum it up would be impossible. A Buddhist spirit, dressed in polka-dotted underpants, stands in a ''Saturday Night Fever'' pose while in the background there are depictions of everything from Spider-Man to the Dalai Lama. Another 2012 piece by Mr. Sherpa, the son of Tibetan refugees who grew up in Nepal and now lives outside San Francisco, is titled ''49 Cans.'' The painting features seven rows of seven multicolored gasoline cans, each marked with the enraged face of a spirit. It is set up to be reminiscent of colorful Tibetan prayer flags, but the cans suggest a darker meaning, an allusion to the recent spate of self-immolation by Buddhist monks protesting Chinese rule in Tibet. 
Both works are part of ''Tibetan Spirit,'' a solo exhibition of Mr. Sherpa's work, which is one of two shows (the other is ''Gods and Demons of the Himalayas'') on display at Rossi & Rossi Gallery in London. The family-run Rossi & Rossi, which deals in both classical and contemporary artworks from across Asia, is one of more than 50 galleries and auction houses participating in the 15th edition of the annual Asian Art in London event, which opens Thursday and runs through Nov. 10 and is focused on Asian art from antiquity until today.
The participating galleries in the Asian Art event -- mostly from London, but also galleries from Europe and Asia whose works are installed in temporary spaces -- are holding special exhibitions, while auction houses (including Christie's, Sotheby's and Bonhams) are holding sales pitched toward Asian art enthusiasts and collectors.
Coinciding with Asian Art in London, many museums and academic institutions are putting on a wide range of cultural, academic and social events related to Asian art.
''When you go to an international big city like London, you eat fantastic food from every culture to excite the tongue,'' said Martin Clist, the gallery director at Rossi & Rossi who also serves as a director for Asian Art in London. ''It is the same with art -- people want something to excite their eyes. Art is a doorway to somewhere else.''
Over the past decade, Asian art has been a doorway to big money as much as cultural stimulation. This autumn, Sotheby's and Christie's held Asian art auctions in New York that brought in a combined total of $90 million, reassuring those who had been predicting a downturn in the Asian art market. According to a report released in January by the French research company Artprice, two Chinese artists -- Zhang Daqian and Qi Baishi -- were the top-selling artists at world auctions last year with their combined sales totaling almost $1 billion. (Andy Warhol placed third and Pablo Picasso fourth.) Jonathan Stone, the chairman and international head of Asian Art for Christie's, said that Asian art in 2011 was the second-largest sales category for the auction house, after postwar and contemporary art. ''Those are indicators of the power of Asia,'' he said.
Michael Frahm, of the London- and Basel-based art advisory firm Frahm Ltd., said that in the last decade, the prices, particularly for Chinese contemporary art, had jumped exponentially. ''From 2006 to 2008, the prices went through the roof,'' he said. ''From a purely commercial perspective, it was one of the most significant developments we have ever seen. A Chinese contemporary artist who would sell for $100,000 in the 1990s was being sold a decade later for almost $10 million.''
There are, of course, major distinctions in terms of classical Asian art, which encompasses works from ancient dynasties through the 19th century, and the modern and contemporary Asian art markets. ''The two markets have very different rhythms, and it should be made quite clear -- in the way that you would not match up Dutch 17th-century painters as you would with the market for Warhol,'' said Colin Sheaf, the head of Asian art at Bonhams.
Interest in classical Chinese art, the most widely collected, is global. In the past, much of that interest was driven not only by Western collectors but also by art enthusiasts in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the global Chinese diaspora. But in recent years, there has been a huge increase in interest from mainland China. ''Chinese buyers have the wherewithal to acquire back their cultural heritage,'' said Mr. Stone of Christie's. ''It is fueled by the economic success in China over the last few years. That being said, it does not mean that older collectors have fallen away -- though the mainland has to an extent driven the market, older regions like Europe and America have kept pace.''
There has been a collecting shift in the contemporary scene as well. Many major Western institutions that used to focus on European and North American art are now turning east. ''The Tate has a series of curators who specifically look at India and the Far East,'' while the British Museum is ''buying contemporary works of art on paper from the Near East, like India and Pakistan,'' said Mr. Clist of Rossi & Rossi. ''For me, the biggest change is that major institutions are sitting up and saying: 'Hold on. What does it mean to be international?'''
While Western collectors have been turning to contemporary Asian art over the last decade (Christie's held its first contemporary Asian art sale in 2005, Sotheby's in 2006), things have begun to shift eastward. Auction houses in mainland China -- notably Beijing Poly and China Guardian -- have been biting into what used to be a Western-dominated auction market. China Guardian had a coup last year when it sold Qi Baishi's ''Eagle Standing on Pine Tree'' for 425.5 million renminbi, or about $68 million.
These days, most Western auction houses and several of the world's most prominent galleries have outposts in Hong Kong to keep close to the Asian scene. The success of contemporary Asian art auctions and the economic crisis are seen as key factors in changing the market. ''In 2008, things changed completely and that was the first time we saw a huge influx from the mainland,'' said Mr. Frahm, the art adviser. ''The prices for Chinese contemporary art went up by 1,000 percent. I think Western collectors took a step back, saying, 'We are not going to pay millions of dollars for a Chinese artist.' It became too expensive for a lot of them.''
Though Mr. Frahm said he had seen interesting things happening in contemporary art in places like Singapore and Indonesia, China continues to dominate. It is Chinese painting and sculpture that garner the most interest from Chinese collectors, with conceptual art having less of a draw. ''There is a particular emphasis on Chinese contemporary ink paintings,'' said Michael Goedhuis, whose gallery is participating in Asian Art in London. ''Good ink painters are linked to Chinese classical civilization via the material, but they are expressing the new China in aesthetic terms.''
While Indian and Southeast Asian collectors have long been interested in purchasing Buddhist art from across wider Asia, mainland Chinese collectors have also recently become interested in buying classical pieces -- including works from Tibet.
''It is not necessarily done in a nationalist way,'' said Mr. Clist, the gallery director. ''They are buying because they are interested in the Buddhist element there.''
While some observers speculate that the Chinese art bubble could already be stretched to the bursting point, others feel it has just begun to inflate.
''There is a real cultural revolution in art, and it is having huge ramifications for the rest of the world,'' said Mr. Goedhuis. ''The reality is that -- whether old or new -- Chinese art will become the most expensive art in the world. Chinese art is the dominant narrative.''
Exhibitors at Asian Art in London certainly hope so. ''I think we are at the peak of our form,'' Mr. Clist said. ''This year we have more exhibitors than we have ever had, which I think speaks a great deal.''

HEADLINE: Singapore Nurtures Art With Bureaucratic Touch

BYLINE: By SONIA KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP

 BODY:
SINGAPORE -- As part of its continuing quest to become a key player on the global arts scene, the Singaporean government has in recent years worked with various partners to develop the infrastructure for a major Asian contemporary art hub.
SAM at 8Q, an extension of the Singapore Art Museum dedicated to contemporary art, opened in 2008; the Singapore Biennale started to wide acclaim in 2006, with next one in 2013; and the international fair Art Stage Singapore had its inaugural edition in 2011, with more than 120 galleries and 32,000 visitors (the next fair runs from Jan. 24 to 27). 
Among private initiatives, the Singapore Freeport, which opened in 2010, offers a dedicated storage space for fine art and high-value collectibles, with special tax arrangements.
In September, a new piece of the art-hub jigsaw fell in place with the opening of Gillman Barracks, a cluster of contemporary-art galleries spread over several former military barracks, a 15-minute drive from the city center.
As often in Singapore, the development of the new art enclave was carefully managed by the government, with the renovation of the site, overseen by multiple agencies, including the Singapore Economic Development Board.
Eugene Tan, a director of the board, said the project was in line with government's wider plans to make Singapore an important arts destination. He added that a top-down approach to planning the space was necessary in a place like Singapore where land is scare and a vibrant art cluster would be hard to develop organically. The arrival of new galleries ''will have a significant effect, not only on art in Singapore, but in the region as well,'' he said.
The new art cluster opened with 13 galleries, including ShanghArt, which represents the Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi; Ota Fine Arts of Japan, which represents Yayoi Kusama; and Sundaram Tagore Gallery of New York. Two others, Pearl Lam Galleries of Hong Kong and Kaikai Kiki Gallery, an offshoot of the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami's art production company, are due to open next year.
In total, Gillman Barracks will eventually house 19 or so galleries, Mr. Tan said, along with restaurants, cafes and the Center for Contemporary Art, which is set to open in mid-2013 and will offer residency programs, exhibition spaces and a research center.
Sundaram Tagore, who has had an outpost of his New-York based gallery in Hong Kong since 2008, said he had chosen Singapore over Shanghai or Beijing to open a new branch ''purely because of the transparent manner of doing business in Singapore.''
''Taxes are reasonable and predictable, shipping artwork in and out of the country is straightforward,'' he said, ''and other bureaucratic hurdles you would face in places such as China, India or Indonesia don't exist here.''
More important, he added, ''I can understand the language. English is the medium of all communication.''
These comments were echoed by several other gallery owners, like Sueo Mizuma of the Mizuma Gallery in Tokyo. He opened an outpost in Beijing in 2008.
''In Beijing, there are restrictions on whom I can show and I always have to show Chinese artists,'' Mr. Mizuma said. ''I have tried to show international artists, in particular Japanese artists, but it's very hard to import the works because of the tax.''
The import tax in China is 20 percent to 40 percent depending on the type of artworks imported, said François Curiel, head of Christie's in Asia. The standard value-added tax in China is 17 percent. Singapore has no import tax, Mr. Mizuma noted, and he pays only 7 percent VAT on the work he sells here.
Michael Janssen, who has a Berlin gallery, said having a foothold in Singapore would help him get closer to a new generation of artists in Southeast Asia who had not yet been fully discovered by collectors. His plan is to present exhibitions that combine Western artists with artists from the region.
But Valentine Willie, a Malaysian gallery operator who since 2008 has had a gallery in Artspace@Helutrans, in Singapore, expressed caution, pointing out that the regional art market was ''soft'' and likely to remain so for the next two years at least.
Initial visitor traffic to Gillman Barracks has indicated that the ''if you build it, they will come'' concept might take longer than expected. Several galleries reported virtually no visitors on weekdays but an increase during weekend afternoons. This low level of activity partly reflects Gillman's noncentral location and current lack of food and drink services, say critics of the enterprise.
''Whether the barracks will succeed as an arts hub depends on many factors,'' Mr. Willie said. ''Not the least of which is how long the government will subsidize and market this venue.''

HEADLINE: Manchester City Has Gone Global

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LONDON -- When Manchester City appointed Txiki Begiristain last week as its new director of football, some observers concluded that this was the English seeking to follow the path, and the style, of Barcelona.
It may be. City had recruited Ferran Soriano, Barcelona's former financial vice president, as its new chief executive officer three months ago. And speculation grew that Barca's erstwhile coach, Pep Guardiola, currently taking an extended family break in New York, could in time complete the virtuous circle of Barcelona's former executives in Manchester.
Hold that thought. At the moment, City has a team manager, the Italian Roberto Mancini, and his contract was recently extended to the summer of 2017. 
In fact, something more worldly is taking shape in the neighborhood where Manchester United had long been deemed king. Some, including Forbes magazine, place United as the richest club in the world. But City, which ousted United by a tiny margin to win the English league title this year, appears to be redefining the dimensions of soccer on a global scale.
Already, its finances, its head office management and its team are headed that way.
The owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and his appointed chairman at the club, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, have American university degrees in political science and economics respectively.
Both are domiciled in Abu Dhabi, from where City's new wealth emanates.
And though Sheikh Mansour is spotted around City's Etithad stadium less often than a golden eagle in downtown Manhatten, his stewardship has revolutionized the English club. City, to put it kindly, has always been the poor cousin to United in Manchester.
Then along came Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled former prime minister of Thailand, who briefly owned City before selling out to Abu Dhabi in 2008. From then until now, the upward spiral has been extraordinary.
The sheikh has spent £481 million, or about $776 million, on 30 players in those four years. The current squad, led by a Belgian, Vincent Kompany, has players from 10 different countries, and a new academy -- once again emulating Barcelona -- is under construction.
Everything about ''Abu Dhabi'' City suggests the goal is long term. The past is respected, thus far, in the fact that the owners acknowledge that City supporters have been a long-suffering, incredibly loyal breed. And if the stadium name has been rebranded, the shirts remain sky blue.
Yet year by year, month by month, the changes coming down from the boardroom take the club further away from its roots. The owner, chairman, chief executive, director of football, team manager and captain do not have English as their first language.
The backup staff, in areas like marketing and commerce, are also different from the homely origins of a club that for years -- generations -- seemed to just muddle through.
At times, City courted financial disaster and smiled chirpily in the face of comparisons with what its fans considered the imported wealth of big brother United.
Now not only are the heroes on the field men like Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, and David Silva, but the people helping to shape a very different structure also come from abroad, and come highly qualified in foreign fields. The roles that Soriano and Begiristain may play in bringing Barcelona expertise to City either will gel with Mancini's coaching mentality or, as is entirely possible given the Italian's restless and volatile nature, lead to a change of team management.
Last weekend, following City's defeat against Ajax in Amsterdam, the crowd at the Etihad booed the team at half time before it eked out a 1-0 home victory over Swansea City. That, too, was symptomatic of the new City, supporters who for decades tolerated failure now expecting to be winners every time out.
For all we know, similar pressures permeate the back room. The connections between the owner and chairman, who were educated in the United States, is maintained by the fact that Soriano also studied business in New York, and Tom Glick, City's chief commercial and operating officer, is a native of Colorado and a former chief marketing officer with the New Jersey Nets basketball franchise.
All these connections, blending America's winning mentality with its keen eye on the dollar, is now at work under Middle East control in the blue half of Manchester.
The push last season to win England's league for the first time in 44 years is considered only a platform toward the Champions League, where Mancini has yet to prove his credentials.
The Italian had shown with Inter Milan that he knew how to build a team to win the domestic competition, Serie A. He left there because he did not translate that into Champions League success, and his successor Jose Mourinho used largely his team to deliver that European trophy.
So now, with two new arrivals from Barcelona in decisive roles, in terms of recruitment and player development, the speculation will rise that, regardless of how much it would cost to pay off Mancini's new five-year contract, Soriano and Begiristain know a man who knows how to win the Champions League.
Guardiola will not lie idle in New York for long. The whispers are that he fancies a crack at English soccer management, and that London -- most likely Chelsea -- would be his preferred destination.
Manchester City, though, is the coming project. The sheikh rarely talks about soccer as much as he talks, and rides, thoroughbred Arabian horses. But his ambitions appear to be beyond winning in England. And there are signs that this sheikh is bedding down for the long term.
He might ultimately be a better owner than Russians who use soccer to create a new image for themselves, or Americans who look for dividends in return for investment. And there are precious few English owners of English teams who can compete in their own backyard anymore.

HEADLINE: A Suburb Faces a Fight On Becoming Its Own City

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
MILLCREEK, Utah -- The campaign has been brutal. Names have been called, insults hurled, yard signs stolen. In these final days, volunteers are out knocking on doors, and undecided voters are awash in leaflets warning about big government and higher taxes, or the loss of crucial government services.
Romney versus Obama? Hardly. Here in the mini-malls and rolling cul-de-sacs south of Salt Lake City, the election dividing friends and neighbors is one to decide whether the suburb of Millcreek should abandon its loosely organized ways and knit itself into a bona fide city. 
It is a campaign rife with many of the same fundamental issues roiling the presidential campaign: taxes, spending and the right size and role of government in people's lives.
To supporters, a city would cobble together a few suburban neighborhoods into a more perfect union. After years of living at the whims of county codes and tax rates, residents of Millcreek said they would, for the first time, be able to keep their tax dollars inside their own borders and write their own future.
''We don't have any say,'' said Gloria Kuhn, who supports the measure that would make Millcreek a city. ''It's not the way our country was designed. It's taxation without representation.''
Opponents say the status quo works fine. Forming a city would heap municipal rules and expenses atop existing layers of county, state and federal bureaucracy. They say a new city would need money for lawyers, accountants, city buildings and other services now provided by the county, and ultimately be forced to raise taxes.
They say there is too much uncertainty: would a new city create its own police force? Would it fight its own fires? If not, if it continued relying on the county for those things, why bother?
''Why are we trying to force more government?'' said Roger Dudley, a leading member of the opposition group (motto: ''NO to new taxes, NO to extra government, NO to City of Millcreek'').
At its core, the election here next Tuesday is a fight about what happens as America's suburbs grow up.
A century ago, residents said, Millcreek's orchards provided apricots, pears and apples to the rest of Utah, and wealthy residents of Salt Lake City retreated here to vacation homes near the steep canyons and shaded mountainsides. It gradually became a bedroom community for the state capital, with ruggedly named neighborhoods like Canyon Rim and Mount Olympus.
Today, it is one of the few unincorporated stretches of land left in Salt Lake County. Like countless other American subdivisions and exurbs that sprang from sod farms and potato fields, Millcreek is now a dense quilt of big front yards, gated communities, McMansions and Brady Bunch-era homes, Chinese buffets and strip-mall nail studios. But the decisions about fixing roads, land codes and tax rates are still made by county officials who live outside the community.
If the ballot measure passes on Election Day, Millcreek will become Utah's 10th largest city by population; it has 63,500 residents across 41 square miles, though its eastern half is mostly national forest land and steep, scrabbly mountainside. It would, for the first time, have a mayor, its own council and a city hall.
Over on Upland Avenue, Anna Clare Shepherd, a supporter of cityhood, has pushed aside her white baby grand piano and converted her living room into a war room. A map of the area's voting precincts hung on the wall, and long folding tables were stacked with fliers and brochures. One afternoon late last week, she and her husband, Earl, folded leaflets and delivered them to volunteers who had promised to ring doorbells and paper their neighborhoods.
One of them is Daniel Marriott. As he went from house to house, he told voters that their property taxes were actually $300 to $400 higher than other communities that had decided to become cities. It was a convincing pitch, delivered with the cheerful persistence that Mr. Marriott had cultivated years ago as a Mormon missionary.
''This is very familiar,'' he said.
It has taken four years of petition drives, public meetings and studies of the area's projected expenses and revenues to get to this point.
In 2011, an independent study said that Millcreek's economics, population and geography would make it a ''viable and sustainable'' new city. But it also said the area was mostly built-out and had few new opportunities for development, raising the prospect that its expenses would outstrip the money it takes in. If Millcreek goes its own way, the surrounding county would also stand to lose $30 million in annual revenues from one of its wealthiest areas, and be forced to cut services or raise taxes on other residents.
If the measure fails, some residents say they are worried the community will be torn apart. At a time when city budgets are strained, they say that Millcreek's Home Depot, its for-profit hospital and supermarkets would make ripe targets for annexation by nearby cities.
''This is our last chance if we want to stay together and become a city,'' Ms. Shepherd, one of the leading organizers, said.

The race, the world's largest with a field of nearly 50,000 runners, is scheduled for Sunday morning -- barely six days after Hurricane Sandy left parts of the city in ruins and crippled its transportation system.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and marathon organizers have said the race will go on as scheduled, as it has every year since 1970, as a symbol of the city's ability to rally after hard times.
''It's a great event for New York, and I think for those who were lost, you know, you've got to believe they would want us to have an economy and have a city go on for those that they left behind,'' Bloomberg said. 
But that plan has been met with a backlash from area residents and even many runners registered for the marathon who believe it is in poor taste to hold a road race through the five boroughs as hundreds of thousands of people in nearby areas continue to suffer the damage wrought by the storm.
Critics of the plan to hold the marathon also say that diverting the police and fire crews to perform marathon duties is a misuse of precious public services.
''As an emergency room nurse, I've witnessed devastation,'' said Barbara Cowman, a 48-year-old from Austin, Tex., who, along with four friends, decided this week to drop out of the race. ''I think it's wrong to ask police officers and the fire department to make sure that the racecourse is supported for those runners.''
She added, ''I get the resilience piece, but it just seems like you should be catering to the needs of those in the area rather than all of these out-of-town people descending to run the race.''
While Bloomberg reiterated Wednesday that the race would be held Sunday, New York Road Runners said it was still waiting for official approval from the city. The group was also considering whether to cancel two annual events that are held in conjunction with the marathon: the opening ceremony in Central Park on Friday evening and the Dash to the Finish Line 5K on Saturday morning.
''The hope is the marathon goes on,'' Mary Wittenberg, chief executive of Road Runners, said Wednesday. She added, ''The mayor will make the right decision, and the decision is in his hands.''
In a statement, the public advocate Bill de Blasio said he supported the decision to hold the race, citing the economic benefits.
But James Molinaro, the Staten Island borough president, called on the mayor's office to reconsider holding the marathon this weekend, according to The Staten Island Advance. ''I just assumed it was canceled,'' Molinaro told The Advance. ''My God. What we have here is terrible, a disaster. If they want to race, let them race with themselves. This is no time for a parade. A marathon is a parade.''
The five-borough race is actually more than a parade, with 47,000 runners, 8,000 volunteers, 1,000 staffers and 2 million spectators. And putting it on just days after a devastating storm will be challenging as the police and fire departments, electric utilities and transportation agencies attempt to get the city back on its feet.
''I do appreciate that the marathon brings in money to local business, but let's be honest, it's a huge draw on our resources,'' said state Senator Liz Krueger, who represents part of Midtown, which will be affected by the final portion of the marathon's course. ''It's a huge draw on our other resources. None of the boroughs is near up and running.''
Krueger called the mayor's decision to hold the race ''a glaring misstep in the context of so much effective, successful emergency response.''
Wittenberg said her organization had contingency plans in place, including adjusting the course and hiring private companies to handle some of the services provided by the city. If subway services are not restored to Lower Manhattan, where many runners travel to get on the Staten Island Ferry, more buses could be added.
Wittenberg said that runners who withdraw from the race would be guaranteed a spot in next year's marathon but would lose their entry fee from this year and have to pay a new entry fee next year. The marathon generates about half of Road Runners' annual revenue of nearly $60 million, and refunding potentially thousands of entry fees would put a dent in the organization's budget.
For those who are running, marathon registration is expected to open Thursday at the Jacob K. Javits Center on the far west side of Manhattan, where sponsors like Asics hope to sell millions of dollars worth of merchandise. A recent study showed that the marathon generates $340 million in economic activity in the city, one reason the mayor is a backer of the race. It is unclear whether Road Runners has insurance that might pay for any lost revenue if the race were canceled.
Wittenberg said she has not seen a large spike in cancellations, but clearly runners are having trouble reaching New York. Only a handful of the 250 elite and wheelchair athletes had arrived by Wednesday. Six Kenyan runners, for instance, flew from Nairobi to London to Boston and drove to New York. Tatyana Arkhipova, who finished third in the marathon at the London Games, was stuck in Moscow, while Tiki Gelana, the gold medal winner, was still in Amsterdam.
While some have compared this year's marathon to the one after the terrorist attacks in September 2001, David Monti, who coordinates elite runners for Road Runners, said this year was different. In 2001, he pleaded with frightened runners to show up. This time, elite runners want to get here, especially because their appearance fees make up a big part of their annual income, he said.
The few elite runners who had already arrived in New York said they hoped the race would provide a sign of hope for the region.
''I think after this tragedy, the best thing we can do is come together and celebrate and try to work together to try to create a positive experience through all the aftermath,'' said Molly Pritz, who drove from Detroit to get to the race.
Others disagree.
''I think they should cancel it,'' said Mark Plaatjes, 51, the 1993 world marathon champion, who lives in Boulder, Colo., and has run the New York City Marathon several times. ''I know I'll get a lot of stuff for saying that, but we've been watching the last few days and looking at all the people who lost power, who lost their homes. I feel all the energy of the city should be directed at the people who need it, instead of using essential services for the race.''
His wife, Shirley Plaatjes, 50, a massage therapist, has been training for the marathon since March, but she said she would not run, even if the race was held. She and her husband believe that this year's entry fees should be donated by Road Runners to the relief effort in a magnanimous gesture to those who lost family members, homes and power.
''All the things I've seen have made my heart too heavy to run this race,'' Shirley Plaatjes said. ''I feel like I'm disrespecting the people of New York.''

HEADLINE: In Dwindling Days of the Race, Romney Takes a Softer Tack

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney used to talk up the ''crucial'' importance of having two parents in the home, saying ''a mom and dad together'' have a big impact. But over the past week, he has been extolling the virtues of single mothers at every turn, holding them out as examples of Americans ''living for something bigger than themselves.''
Mr. Romney once delivered partisan-tinged zingers about how President Obama takes inspiration from socialist Democrats in Europe.
There are no traces of such barbs in the dwindling days of the race, however, even as a devastating storm buffeted the campaign and much of the country. Instead, he promises to make frequent and personal outreach to the rival party a signature of a Romney presidency. 
''Democrats,'' he says, ''love America, too.''
As elections near, candidates change in ways big and small.
Mr. Romney's 20-minute stump speech in the final stretch is a case study in such modulation, offering a stark illustration of his long journey from the partisanship of the Republican nominating contest toward the measured and less controversial middle of American politics.
It is a speech, revised and refined over time, that offers sometimes vivid contrasts with the words, messages and style that Mr. Romney has employed at various stages of his two-year presidential campaign.
(Two words that nobody has heard over the past week: ''severely'' or ''conservative.'')
There are plenty of carry-overs, of course: he dings President Obama's health care law as cumbersome and bemoans the size of the federal debt as immoral, as he has since 2011, when he entered the race.
But even if the extent of the evolution is up for argument, there is little debate that Mr. Romney is finishing the presidential campaign as a milder candidate than when he started.
A third of likely voters in a New York Times/CBS News poll this week said Mr. Romney had become more moderate in his positions since he became the nominee, a shift that may be a political necessity but one that holds peril for Mr. Romney.
The tone and substance of his closing argument risks raising the questions about consistency and authenticity that have dogged him, tracking with his muddied stance on issues like amnesty for young illegal immigrants, Pell grants for college students and limits on abortions.
The man who once mocked Mr. Obama for ''trying to transform America'' is himself embracing ''big change'' as a mantra -- using the phrase up to a dozen times in each speech.
On Wednesday, while campaigning at a rally here, Mr. Romney took it further, calling for ''bold, aggressive change.''
Getting Personal
Crowds are riveted during Mr. Romney's rhetorical finale, in growing numbers: 4,000 in Kissimmee, Fla.; 12,000 in Defiance, Ohio; 15,000 in Land O' Lakes, Fla. They cheer for his conspicuous talk of bipartisanship, his praise for judicious regulation and his personal stories, which he used to studiously avoid but now tumble off his lips with ease.
Several times a day, Mr. Romney talks about his sister Lynn, a widow, and her 43-year-old son, Jeffrey, who has Down syndrome. ''I think of Lynn as a hero of mine because she has given herself to that boy,'' he says, as the audience becomes quiet. ''Given him a full life, takes him to work, makes his life fulfilling.''
He pauses. ''She lives for her son.''
The audience thunders, drowning him out.
Emily Bores of Avon, Ohio, sat in rapt attention on Monday. ''That story is familiar to anyone who has ever been touched by tragedy,'' Ms. Bores said. ''He shares a piece of everyone's heart by having that experience so close to his own.''
Loving the Opposition
Lately, Mr. Romney cannot stop talking about how much he wants to work with Democrats.
''I will meet regularly with Democrats in Washington, with their leaders, and my party's leaders, and battle together to find ways to help the American people,'' he said a few days ago.
Rewind to the primaries: Mr. Romney sounded much less centrist. He said then that Tea Party members, known for their uncompromising rigidity, would find him ''the ideal candidate.'' He also questioned his rival Rick Santorum's conservative credentials, citing a vote to fund Planned Parenthood.
At the Conservative Political Action Conference in early 2012, Mr. Romney emphasized, ''I fought against long odds in a deep blue state, but I was a severely conservative Republican governor. I have been on the front lines and I expect to be on the front lines again.''
These days, when Mr. Romney talks about his record in Massachusetts, it is not as a deeply conservative governor, but as a leader who welcomed communication and compromise.
''I knew from the very beginning, to get anything done I had to reach across the aisle,'' Mr. Romney said on Monday.
Sitting in the audience, Carla Dickard, 61, said she was drawn to Mr. Romney's put-down-the-pitchforks message. ''It wasn't always like this, everyone so divided like they are,'' she said. Ms. Dickard views Mr. Obama as overly partisan, setting off the birth of the Tea Party. Mr. Romney, by contrast, she said, ''seems to understand that we won't get anything done unless we work together.''
The message does not always sink in. On Wednesday in Tampa, as Mr. Romney talked about bipartisanship, a man shouted from the audience: ''Fire Obama!''
Measured Criticisms
Mr. Romney still builds a forceful case against the president. But he is noticeably gentler.
Gone are the accusations that Mr. Romney made during the primary race: that Mr. Obama does not understand what makes America ''such a unique nation,'' that he is trying to redistribute wealth or that he ''takes his political inspiration from Europe, from the socialist-democrats in Europe.'' Instead, Mr. Romney is attacking the president largely on substance and policy.
To college students: ''Because the president has been spending about a $1 trillion more every year in this country than we are taking in, he is putting debt on you that you didn't even know about. Each man women and child in this country has about $50,000 worth of government debt.''
To the elderly: ''If you happen to get sick and you need to see a specialist, if Obamacare gets installed and you call,'' Mr. Romney said in the last week, ''the receptionist is likely to tell you that the doctor isn't taking any more Medicare patients.''
(An audience member shouted, ''That's right!'')
Still, Mr. Romney gets in a few pointed jabs. His favorite centers on the president's campaign slogan, ''Forward!''
''The president says 'Forward.' I call it forewarned,'' he says, with a wry smile.
Sometimes, he manages to squeeze two Forward-related digs into a single speech.
''Things don't feel like they are going forward,'' Mr. Romney said in Ames, Iowa, on Thursday. ''It feels more like backward.''
An Inevitable Evolution
Presidential candidates' messages inevitably evolve: the fight for the ideologically rigid in the primary yields to a contest for apolitical independents in the general election.
Mr. Romney, for instance, has talked about single mothers from time to time. Last year, he told them to "hold on" as he prepared to deliver economic help. Now, he generously praises single mothers for scrimping to put ''a great meal at the table for her kids.''
Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said the possibility of becoming president had influenced how he was talking.
''You probably never get acclimated to or comfortable with the rigors of campaigning, but the idea of actually getting to work governing has helped him elevate and crystallize his closing argument,'' Mr. Madden said. ''The closing argument that Governor Romney has been engaged in is an embrace of the notion of actually governing.''

HEADLINE: Region Faces Rescues, Looting, and a Rising Death Toll

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Reporting on the storm was contributed by Peter Applebome, Jack Begg, David W. Chen, Annie Correal, Alison Leigh Cowan, Karen DeMasters, Ann Farmer, Joseph Goldstein, Jeff Gordinier, Michael M. Grynbaum, Henry Fountain, Ariel Kaminer, Thomas Kaplan, Corey Kilgannon, Randy Leonard, Patrick McGeehan, Colin Moynihan, Sarah Maslin Nir, Richard Pérez-Peña, Julia Preston, William K.

 BODY:
New York faced the reality of life after Hurricane Sandy on Wednesday: horror in still-waterlogged neighborhoods, where rescue workers pulled bodies from wreckage, and exasperation elsewhere as more than 3.75 million people entered a third day without electricity.
The storm was blamed for more than 70 deaths in the United States, including 24 in New York City, 8 in New Jersey and 4 in Connecticut. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said initial damage estimates ''project up to $6 billion in lost economic revenue'' in New York State. 
The death toll seemed certain to rise as rescuers checked basements that had flooded, trapping homeowners inside. The wall of water driven ashore by the storm even flooded three police stations, two in Brooklyn and one in the Rockaway section of Queens.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said a steamfitter was rescued from one station house as water crashed in. The steamfitter, whom he identified as Kevin Hunter, had been working in the boiler room, two levels below the first floor, trying to shut off steam pipes before the surge of cold water rolled in.
But Mr. Hunter's leg became caught, and he was ''completely submerged underwater, unable to get free,'' Mr. Browne said in an e-mail. Another steamfitter, Anthony DiMaggio, sought help, and he and Lt. Peter O'Neill freed his leg and carried him out in chest-high water. With help from other officers, ''they literally swam Hunter to Neptune Avenue, where the water wasn't as high,'' Mr. Browne said.
Eventually they loaded him onto a city bus that carried them out of the flooded area, and later into an ambulance that took him to Maimonides Hospital. He was treated for cuts, muscle strains and hypothermia.
Fifteen people in the Far Rockaway section of Queens and nine in Coney Island were charged with burglary and other offenses in connection with looting at stores. Among them was a 29-year-old woman who faced a weapons charge ''after the safe she was carrying from a store was found to contain a firearm,'' Mr. Browne said.
For those who did not have basements that flooded or buildings that slipped off their foundations, there were lines at the gasoline stations that have power to pump fuel for generators and for cars. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie's office warned drivers to be careful because lines were so long that they had stretched onto the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. One Twitter feed that had been following the hurricane on the Jersey Shore began sending out updates about where to buy gas.
A wide stretch of Lower Manhattan remained dark, as did the Jersey Shore, waterfront neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, and most of Long Island.
But the first section of Manhattan that lost power on Monday night, after an explosion and fire at a substation on East 14th Street, had had its lights turned back on, a Consolidated Edison executive said. Doing that restored power to about 2,000 of more than 220,000 customers below 39th Steet in Manhattan. The rest will probably have to wait until Friday or Saturday, said John Miksad, Con Ed's senior vice president for electric operations.
Power also returned to the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. But repairing all of the downed wires in other boroughs and in Westchester County could take another week, Mr. Miksad said.
In New Jersey, executives at Public Service Electric and Gas Company said 900,000 customers were still without power, down from a peak of 1.7 million on Tuesday. Some of the company's main lines, carrying power to substations for local distribution, still needed to be repaired, officials said. But they said electricity was on again in Newark, Elizabeth and parts of Jersey City, and they expected to have all power restored by Nov. 9.
Another big utility, Jersey Central Power and Light, said nearly 950,000 customers did not have electricity. About half were in Monmouth and Ocean Counties along the shore.
Connecticut Light and Power reported that more than 318,000 customers were out, including about two-thirds of its customers in Greenwich and New Canaan and 9 out of 10 in Weston.
Mr. Cuomo said restoring power to Long Island, where the storm knocked out power to 90 percent of the Long Island Power Authority's customers, posed particular difficulties. He said 1,800 utility workers from other areas, mostly upstate, were being sent there to provide extra help.
It was clear that it would be a while before many of the small businesses that were so much a part of the city -- visually, with their kaleidoscope of street-level storefronts, and economically -- recovered. It was just as clear that it would be days before many restaurants reopened. Some lost large inventories when the power went out and food in their walk-in refrigerators began to spoil.
Some lost more than food. Before the storm, Andrew Carmellini, the chef at the Dutch in SoHo and Locanda Verde in TriBeCa, rented a car for around-town transportation. He left it on West 23rd Street. ''The car got destroyed in the flood,'' he said. ''The water went over the dashboard.''
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said his evacuation orders remained in effect for low-lying communities from Coney Island in Brooklyn to Battery Park City in Manhattan. Mr. Bloomberg said they would not be lifted until the Buildings Department had had time to inspect buildings in those areas. ''I know it's annoying to everyone,'' he said at a briefing, ''but we don't need more loss of life.''
Would the city be back to normal? Perhaps, he said -- but not for families who were missing a child, a parent, a brother, a sister.
''For all we do to recover, it's fair to say we can't replace the lives of the people lost in the storm,'' he began, speaking in a softer voice than he had used at earlier briefings. ''Any loss of life is tragic; sadly, nature is dangerous, and these things occur. The best thing we can do for those who did die is make sure this city recovers for those who come out of this and build a better life for those left behind.''

HEADLINE: Romney Versus the Automakers

 BODY:
When General Motors tells a presidential campaign that it is engaging in ''cynical campaign politics at its worst,'' that's a pretty good signal that the campaign has crossed a red line and ought to pull back. Not Mitt Romney's campaign. Having broadcast an outrageously deceitful ad attacking the auto bailout, the campaign ignored the howls from carmakers and came back with more.
Mr. Romney apparently plans to end his race as he began it: playing lowest-common-denominator politics, saying anything necessary to achieve power and blithely deceiving voters desperate for clarity and truth. 
This started months ago when he realized that his very public 2008 stance against the successful and wildly popular government bailout of G.M. and Chrysler was hurting him in the valuable states of Ohio and Michigan. In February, he wrote an essay for The Detroit News calling the bailout ''crony capitalism on a grand scale'' because unions benefited and insisting that Detroit would have been better off to refuse federal money. (This ignores the well-documented reality that there was no other cash available to the carmakers.)
When that tactic didn't work, he began insisting at the debates that his plan for Detroit wasn't really that different from President Obama's. (Except for the niggling detail of the $80 billion federal investment.)
That was quickly discredited, so Mr. Romney began telling rallies last week that Chrysler was considering moving its production to China. Chrysler loudly denounced it as ''fantasies,'' saying it was only considering increasing production in China for sale in China, without moving a single American job.
''I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China,'' Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said in a statement. ''Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand. It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.'' In fact, 1,100 new jobs will be added in Toledo to produce a new generation of Jeep.
The Romney campaign ignored the company, following up with an instantly notorious ad saying President Obama ''sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China.'' If the false implication wasn't clear enough, the campaign put out a radio ad on Tuesday saying ''Barack Obama says he saved the auto industry. But for who? Ohio or China?'' What happened, the ad asks, ''to the promises made to autoworkers in Toledo and throughout Ohio?''
What happened was that those promises were kept. Nearly 1.5 million people are working as a direct result of the bailout. Ohio's unemployment rate is well below the national average. G.M.'s American sales continue to increase, and Chrysler said this week that its third-quarter net income rose 80 percent. These companies haven't just bounced back from the bottom; they are accelerating.
What Mr. Romney cannot admit is that all this is a direct result of the government investment he would have rejected. It's bad enough to be wrong on the policy. It takes an especially dishonest candidate to simply turn up the volume on a lie and keep repeating it.
By doing that in a flailing, last-minute grab for Ohio, Mr. Romney is providing a grim preview of what kind of president he would be.

HEADLINE: Worrying Beyond Hurricane Sandy

 BODY:
It is small comfort to sodden and stranded New Yorkers that Hurricane Sandy's flooding of the city's infrastructure, from power lines to subways to low-lying communities, was predicted in grimly precise detail by scientists in the latest state and city climate studies. Deeper and more frequent flooding from Rockaway to Lower Manhattan and the city's transit tunnels has been a repeated warning that largely went unnoticed by the public and most politicians. 
But now, with the floods from Sandy and Tropical Storm Irene last year on his watch, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pointedly stressing what he considers the inevitability of more such disasters. ''Climate change is reality,'' the governor said Wednesday, estimating Sandy's economic damage up to $6 billion. ''Given the frequency of these extreme weather situations that we've had -- and I believe that it's an increasing frequency -- for us to sit here today and say this is a once-in-a-generation and it's not going to happen again, I think would be shortsighted.'' Mr. Cuomo admits that he does not have all the answers nor enough government money for all the proposed solutions. And we can all hope that he is wrong in his forecast. But the urgency of his warning is rooted in a basic fact of nature underpinning the government studies: New York's coastal waters, which rose an inch per decade in the last century, are heading toward rates of 6 inches per decade as the oceans warm and expand. That would be a disastrous rise of 2 feet across the next 40 years, for anyone planning ahead. And there aren't many in government planning ahead as the postrecession political debate grinds along the question of how to slash government improvements, not expand them.
Just last September, Klaus Jacob, an adviser to the city on climate change, warned of the certainty of flooded Manhattan highways and tunnels and of stranded subway riders and subway commuters if the next storm surge topped Irene's. ''I'm disappointed that the political process hasn't recognized that we're playing Russian roulette,'' said Mr. Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute and an author of a 2011 state study that predicted tens of billions in economic losses from worsening floods.
This is why the problem underlined by Mr. Cuomo deserves heightened public debate. Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed. "What's clear is that the storms that we've experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before,'' the mayor said. ''Whether that's global warming or what, I don't know. But we'll have to address those issues.''
Mr. Cuomo proposed consideration of the sort of storm surge barriers in use in Europe. Gates like those guarding London's riverfront could be closed in disastrous weather at three main points of ocean inflow -- the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the upper East River and the mouth of the Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey. This idea and others involve billions of dollars, which could be a bargain if Sandy and Irene truly are harbingers of more frequent disasters eating deeper into the city's heart.
The governor offered far more welcome words in an announcement that limited parts of mass transit would go back on line. But he did not and should not retreat from his climate agenda, even if a surge in political resolve is lacking. ''I don't think most people would agree with me at this point,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''First, you have to convince the citizenry, then get the elected officials to move.''

HEADLINE: Idealism Harder to Find From Young Volunteers

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
ARLINGTON, Va. -- With his wire-rimmed glasses and Salvador Dali mustache, Caleb Cunningham does not exactly look like the stereotypical young conservative. He crochets his own stocking caps, and after graduating from Brigham Young University last spring he spent six weeks trekking through Cambodia, Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia before landing in Washington with a used BMW and a job waiting tables. He currently shares a two-bedroom apartment with three roommates (only two of whom pay rent).
Mr. Cunningham says he is not really politically attuned and wants to go back to school. But lately he has been taking time to volunteer for Mitt Romney, a man he supports, well, because of a lot of little things, including -- but not limited to -- concerns about the national debt, Mr. Romney's experience as a businessman and the fact that Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Romney are both Mormons.
''I'm just maybe not too satisfied with how the last four years have gone,'' said Mr. Cunningham, 26, who speaks with a kind of smiling, ''what-me-worry'' whimsy, before adding, ''I just think someone needs to be responsible.'' 
He said he wanted ''someone that can balance a book,'' in a financial -- not literary -- sense.
In this election -- like every election -- both campaigns claim thousands of young volunteers, often doing the grunt work of phone banking, canvassing and pamphlet-to-pamphlet combat. But compared with 2008, when President Obama stormed to victory with the help of hordes of hope-and-change true believers, this year's crop of young volunteers can seem more than a little world-weary. They have been buffeted by the bad economy, remain worried about their future and work mostly temporary jobs -- in Mr. Cunningham's case, at an Olive Garden.
''I'm looking for a more steady job,'' he said.
In interviews, many college-age volunteers, giving up their free time between studying, testing and survival jobs, often seem driven more by realism than idealism, leavened by their own family histories and the awkward contradictions of young adults trying to find their way.
''A lot of young people got really fired up for the president,'' said Robert Sylvester, 19, an Upton, Mass., native and Republican volunteer who was wearing a Red Sox shirt at Romney headquarters in Arlington, Va. ''I remember on Inauguration Day I was just like, 'I didn't want this guy to win but maybe he can do it. Maybe he can do what he promised. Maybe he can be this change.'
''And I think for a lot of people, it was really a huge letdown when he wasn't able to deliver.''
Kathryn Tinker, 20, is the president of the College Democrats at American University in Washington, which prides itself on being the most politically charged campus in America. And sure enough, Ms. Tinker said she had become obsessed with politics since coming to Washington, despite spending most of her life overseas as the daughter of an investment banker and a mother who is a government affairs specialist.
She believes in Democratic policies, she says, because ''my family wasn't always in the 1 percent,'' mentioning her father's modest Massachusetts roots and that her mother's father was a Filipino civil servant.
''If you take the Republican Party, and take out all the religious language in there, there are good ideas,'' she said. ''But the Democratic Party is much more suited for the future.''
A junior, Ms. Tinker has been active canvassing for the president, registering voters and phone banking. She identifies herself as just ''centrist, but pulled left a bit.''
But, she admits, she admired Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination. (And she's the president of the Democratic club.)
''It's a constant identity crisis,'' she said.
Such dissonance is not totally unexpected: college is often a time to test drive belief systems and fiddle with flexible convictions. Add to that a race in which many social issues -- traditionally important for young voters -- have been largely on the back burner, and the resulting justifications for supporting a candidate can seem somewhat stitched together.
Mr. Sylvester, a sophomore at Catholic University, said he had serious reasons for disliking Mr. Obama, but also traced his initial affection for Mr. Romney to his father, and a fishing show.
Mr. Sylvester's father was the onetime executive producer of ''Charlie Moore Outdoors,'' which features the wisecracking fisherman Charlie Moore (a k a The Codfather). In one episode, Mr. Romney, then the governor of Massachusetts, played along as an avid angler and is seen canceling budget meetings to help Mr. Moore land a big one. And while the episode was not particularly presidential, Mr. Sylvester's father was impressed.
''He said he's a great man, and really someone who is a leader,'' Mr. Sylvester said.
Thadius Main is led by his political convictions -- which leads him to check ''none of the above'' this presidential campaign. The campus coordinator at American for Students for Liberty, a libertarian-leaning organization, Mr. Main says he plans a silent, ballot-free protest on Election Day.
''Not voting, in a sense, is voting,'' said Mr. Main, who is from Lake Orion, Mich. ''It's taking a stance against the system as a whole.''
A sophomore at American, Mr. Main is a self-described Buddhist and anarchist who favors an Indian kurta and a set of mala prayer beads. He hopes to be a stockbroker, and while he rejects big government, he does accept student loans. ''Sometimes you have to use the system to fight the system,'' he said.
Political ardor can be felt in a quieter way, insists Zack Carroll, campaign director for the District of Columbia Federation of College Democrats. He likened Mr. Obama's second run to a rock band or a movie whose second album or sequel simply proves why people liked the original.
''I don't necessarily think Obama supporters are 'less enthusiastic' about the president, I think their enthusiasm is more concentrated,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''It's less engrained in a vague message and more engrained in policy and values specifics.''
But Mr. Carroll admitted that Mr. Obama's accomplishments -- which he described as saving the economy from an even worse recession -- may not be the sexiest issue to run on. The president's record, he said, was a ''very relevant, yet not-euphoric fact.''

HEADLINE: In His Own Words

 BODY:
From a speech Wednesday at a campaign rally in Tampa, Fla.:
My view is pretty straight forward and that is, I believe that this is time for America to take a different course, that this should be a turning point for our country. And I say that because I look at where we are and with 23 million Americans -- you think about that. 
These are real people. These are folks trying to put food on the table. Twenty-three million people struggling to find a good job. This is something that requires in my view a different path than we've been on. Likewise, we have half our kids coming out of college who can't find work. This hasn't happened before in our history. We're at a 30-year low in new business formations. This is a real challenge for a nation that normally grows through innovation and risk-taking and start-ups of all kinds.
We also have one out of six people living in poverty. We need to take a new course. We have 47 million people on food stamps. Think of that -- richest country in the history of the earth, largest economy in the world, and yet 47 million people need food stamps? So I believe that this is the year for us to take a different course. I will bring real change and real reform and a presidency that brings us together. Now, I don't just talk about change; I actually have a plan to execute change and to make it happen.

HEADLINE: Wary of Future, Professionals Leave China in Record Numbers

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON; Amy Qin, Adam Century and Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- At 30, Chen Kuo had what many Chinese dream of: her own apartment and a well-paying job at a multinational corporation. But in mid-October, Ms. Chen boarded a midnight flight for Australia to begin a new life with no sure prospects.
Like hundreds of thousands of Chinese who leave each year, she was driven by an overriding sense that she could do better outside China. Despite China's tremendous economic successes in recent years, she was lured by Australia's healthier environment, robust social services and the freedom to start a family in a country that guarantees religious freedoms.
''It's very stressful in China -- sometimes I was working 128 hours a week for my auditing company,'' Ms. Chen said in her Beijing apartment a few hours before leaving. ''And it will be easier raising my children as Christians abroad. It is more free in Australia.''
As China's Communist Party prepares a momentous leadership change in early November, it is losing skilled professionals like Ms. Chen in record numbers. In 2010, the last year for which complete statistics are available, 508,000 Chinese left for the 34 developed countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That is a 45 percent increase over 2000. 
Individual countries report the trend continuing. In 2011, the United States received 87,000 permanent residents from China, up from 70,000 the year before. Chinese immigrants are driving real estate booms in places as varied as Midtown Manhattan, where some enterprising agents are learning Mandarin, to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, which offers a route to a European Union passport.
Few emigrants from China cite politics, but it underlies many of their concerns. They talk about a development-at-all-costs strategy that has ruined the environment, as well as a deteriorating social and moral fabric that makes China feel like a chillier place than when they were growing up. Over all, there is a sense that despite all the gains in recent decades, China's political and social trajectory is still highly uncertain.
''People who are middle class in China don't feel secure for their future and especially for their children's future,'' said Cao Cong, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham who has studied Chinese migration. ''They don't think the political situation is stable.''
Most migrants seem to see a foreign passport as insurance against the worst-case scenario rather than as a complete abandonment of China.
A manager based in Shanghai at an engineering company, who asked not to be named, said he invested earlier this year in a New York City real estate project in hopes of eventually securing a green card. A sharp-tongued blogger on current events as well, he said he has been visited by local public security officials, hastening his desire for a United States passport.
''A green card is a feeling of safety,'' the manager said. ''The system here isn't stable and you don't know what's going to happen next. I want to see how things turn out here over the next few years.''
Political turmoil has reinforced this feeling. Since early this year, the country has been shocked by revelations that Bo Xilai, one of the Communist Party's most senior leaders, ran a fief that by official accounts engaged in murder, torture and corruption.
''There continues to be a lot of uncertainty and risk, even at the highest level -- even at the Bo Xilai level,'' said Liang Zai, a migration expert at the University at Albany. ''People wonder what's going to happen two, three years down the road.''
The sense of uncertainty affects poorer Chinese, too. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, 800,000 Chinese were working abroad at the end of last year, versus 60,000 in 1990. Many are in small-scale businesses -- taxi driving, fishing or farming -- and worried that their class has missed out on China's 30-year boom. Even though hundreds of millions of Chinese have been lifted from poverty during this period, the rich-poor gap in China is among the world's widest and the economy is increasingly dominated by large corporations, many of them state-run.
''It's driven by a fear of losing out in China,'' said Biao Xiang, a demographer at Oxford University. ''Going abroad has become a kind of gambling that may bring you some opportunities.''
Zhang Ling, the owner of a restaurant in the coastal city of Wenzhou, is one such worrier. His extended family of farmers and tradesmen pooled its money to send his son to high school in Vancouver, Canada. The family hopes he will get into a Canadian university and one day gain permanent residency, perhaps allowing them all to move overseas. ''It's like a chair with different legs,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''We want one leg in Canada just in case a leg breaks here.''
Emigration today is different from in past decades. In the 1980s, students began going abroad, many of them staying when Western countries offered them residency after the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising. In the 1990s, poor Chinese migrants captured international attention by paying ''snakeheads'' to take them to the West, sometimes on cargo ships like the Golden Venture that ran aground off New York City in 1993.
Now, years of prosperity mean that millions of people have the means to emigrate legally, either through investment programs or by sending an offspring abroad to study in hopes of securing a long-term foothold.
Wang Ruijin, a secretary at a Beijing media company, said she and her husband were pushing their 23-year-old daughter to apply for graduate school in New Zealand, hoping she can stay and open the door for the family. They do not think she will get a scholarship, Ms. Wang said, so the family is borrowing money as a kind of long-term investment.
''We don't feel that China is suitable for people like us,'' Ms. Wang said. ''To get ahead here you have to be corrupt or have connections; we prefer a stable life.''
Perhaps signaling that the government is concerned, the topic has been extensively debated in the official media. Fang Zhulan, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, wrote in the semiofficial magazine People's Forum that many people were ''voting with their feet,'' calling the exodus ''a negative comment by entrepreneurs upon the protection and realization of their rights in the current system.''
The movement is not all one way. With economies stagnant in the West and job opportunities limited, the number of students returning to China was up 40 percent in 2011 compared with the previous year. The government has also established high-profile programs to lure back Chinese scientists and academics by temporarily offering various perks and privileges. Professor Cao from Nottingham, however, says these programs have achieved less than advertised.
''Returnees can see that they will become ordinary Chinese after five years and be in the same bad situation as their colleagues'' already in China, he said. ''That means that few are attracted to stay for the long run.''
Many experts on migration say the numbers are in line with other countries' experiences in the past. Taiwan and South Korea experienced huge outflows of people to the United States and other countries in the 1960s and '70s, even as their economies were taking off. Wealth and better education created more opportunities to go abroad and many did -- then, as now in China, in part because of concerns about political oppression.
While those countries eventually prospered and embraced open societies, the question for many Chinese is whether the faction-ridden incoming leadership team of Xi Jinping, chosen behind closed doors, can take China to the next stage of political and economic advancement.
''I'm excited to be here but I'm puzzled about the development path,'' said Bruce Peng, who earned a master's degree last year at Harvard and now runs a consulting company, Ivy Magna, in Beijing. Mr. Peng is staying in China for now, but he says many of his 100 clients have a foreign passport or would like one. Most own or manage small- and medium-size businesses, which have been squeezed by the policies favoring state enterprises.
''Sometimes your own property and company situation can be very complicated,'' Mr. Peng said. ''Some people might want to live in a more transparent and democratic society.''

HEADLINE: Long Gas Lines, Clogged Roads, And Slim Hope for a Better Day

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
With commutes that took hours, half-mile lines at suburban gas stations and city buses stuffed beyond capacity, the transportation systems in most of the region slowed to a crawl on Wednesday, amid promises that some subway and commuter rail services would be restored by the Thursday morning commute.
On Wednesday night, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a transportation emergency and said all fares on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's commuter trains, subways and buses would be waived on Thursday and Friday.
Beginning at 6 a.m., some service will resume on 14 of the city's 23 subway lines, but several critical lines -- the No. 3 and 7 trains and the B, C, E, G and Q trains -- remain entirely dark. Many trains will have gaps in their routes, including the No. 4 train, which will have no service between 42nd Street in Manhattan and Borough Hall in Brooklyn. 
And if New Yorkers want to try their luck at driving into Manhattan on Thursday, most will require company: Beginning at 6 a.m., the city planned to bar private vehicles carrying fewer than three people from entering Manhattan over most major bridges, like the Robert F. Kennedy, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Williamsburg Bridges.
But on Wednesday, as many businesses resumed normal operations for the first time since the storm, commutes were a mess.
''I left at 8:30 this morning and got here at 11:30,'' said Eddie Malae, 29, who drove from Forest Hills, Queens, to the salon on Lexington Avenue near 77th Street where he is a stylist. ''And I did tricks, shortcuts.''
Mr. Cuomo said that the goal of the fare waiver was to help alleviate the kind of traffic that clogged city streets on Wednesday.
''The gridlock was dangerous, frankly,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
Joseph Lhota, the chairman of the M.T.A., said that roughly half of the commuters who take Metro-North trains would see regular service starting Thursday morning. The Harlem and the New Haven lines will both be running normal schedules to Grand Central Station, he said.
The storm damage had a synergy of its own. Efforts to pump floodwaters from subway and automobile tunnels were slowed by electrical shortages. Hastily arranged car pools became bogged down on highways and city streets clogged with other commuters. Many gas stations, without power to operate their pumps, could not open for business, eerily evoking the fuel crisis of the 1970s.
Only bicycles seemed to be rolling.
The delays were ''the equivalent of a subway strike with several of our major tunnels closed,'' said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner known as Gridlock Sam, who said he could only recall one instance -- when there was a powerful storm during a transit strike in 1980 -- when traffic had been as bad.
City buses, the only piece of the mass transit network operating in earnest on Wednesday, often bypassed waiting commuters, unable to take on more passengers. Those who did make it on board often got off well before their stop, reasoning that they could walk faster.
''Maybe when it turns green, people will start moving,'' Abraham Riesman, 26, said as he rode an M10 bus stopped at a red light along Central Park West. Then the light turned.
''Nope.''
Eric Bourne, 27, waited 30 minutes for the M4 bus at 138th Street and Broadway before he realized there was a path of less resistance: walking to his job at Parsons Dance in Times Square, where he is a modern dancer. Woe was to the less fit.
Parking garages filled early, with lines of cars in front of some gates before they opened near dawn. Diego Trilleras, the manager at a Manhattan Parking Group garage at East 56th Street, said he had not seen such a business boom since before the economic downturn. Some customers, he said, would probably have to wait an hour to get their cars out again. ''They understand,'' he said hopefully.
With no underground route from Queens to Manhattan and car traffic stalled, some crossed the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge on bike or foot. One Twitter user described cycling over the bridge as ''escaping zombie apocalypse.''
Others attempted cab sharing, the delicate art of piling into a yellow taxi with strangers. Some cabs declined. At a red light at 86th Street and Broadway, one man approached several cabs that already had passengers at a red light, and the drivers refused to open their doors. Finally, one cabby rolled down his window. There were three passengers already in the back, but the man persuaded the driver to let him sit in the passenger seat, before the car began staggering downtown.
At 102nd Street and Lexington Avenue, a passenger happily waited as Khandoker Ahmed, a driver with his off-duty lights on, took a bathroom break. As he drove to Fifth Avenue, car flow was quickly outpaced by pedestrians walking their dogs.
As power returned to some areas of the city, wildcat entrepreneurial spirit flourished. Nail salons in darkened parts of Manhattan offered mani-pedis by dim natural light, and outside the Old Homestead Steakhouse in the meatpacking district, Louis Moreta cooked steaks on sidewalk barbecue grills and waved them to the cars on Ninth Avenue, generating a line that stretched down the block. In Lower Manhattan, where the traffic lights still were not working, pedestrians dodged in between cars or crossed with their eyes forward, daring the cars to hit them. Most of the time, both sides played nice. Kerry Beauchemin, an antique dealer, excepted one car, whose driver provided a hostile arm gesture as Mr. Beauchemin crossed First Avenue at 12th Street, seeking a place to charge his cellphone. ''I don't know why there are so many cars.''
As usual, a special strain of misery troubled travelers at the area's airports. La Guardia Airport remained closed on Wednesday because of flooding, while some flights resumed at Kennedy International and Newark Liberty Airports, though they were operating well below their usual volume. All three airports were expected to be open on Thursday.
On the Long Island Rail Road, shuttle service was available between Jamaica and Atlantic Terminal around 2 p.m. on Wednesday. The transportation authority said it was cautiously optimistic about restoring service from Jamaica to Pennsylvania Station on Thursday.
On the Metro-North Railroad, the New Haven line was expected to resume service on a nearly normal schedule from Stamford, Conn., to Manhattan. The Harlem line was scheduled to run from Mount Kisco to New York City. Service on the Hudson line remained suspended, as did most service for New Jersey Transit's rail operations. Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that he expected PATH trains to be unavailable for at least 7 to 10 days.
Subway riders should expect delays because of work on the seven tunnels beneath the East River that were flooded. The city planned to set up dedicated bus lanes between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Brooklyn-Battery, Queens-Midtown and Holland Tunnels remain closed.
Even where partial services were returned, for most people there remained the slog of coping. The loss of everyday essentials -- elevators, lights, cellphone service, Wi-Fi, refrigeration, hot showers -- created conditions of subacute stress around the city.
Food, prescription drugs, home health assistance, surprise houseguests, restless children home from school -- all became nodes of anxiety that most likely will loom larger as the days wear on.
In New Jersey it was the half-mile lines at the few gas stations open. The Police Department in Morristown sent out a text alert that the town was out of gas, and people should not come looking for it.
In the East Village in Manhattan, where power remained out, it was the frustrating hunt for a working pay phone or a cellular hot spot. Crowds with laptops or tablets huddled around the W hotel on Union Square, where doormen kept them out of the lobby.
Other New Yorkers hunkered down for another night without power, without certainty of what would happen to their homes.
Marie Clausen, who was ordered to evacuate her building in Battery Park City on Sunday, went first to a friend's on the Lower East Side, which also lost power. By Wednesday morning, she made her way north to a friend's house on the Upper East Side to shower, still not sure of the fate of her home downtown. ''My nerves are frayed because they said the repairs could take a month,'' said Ms. Clausen, an executive in the music industry.
''We are allowed to enter the building to collect our belongings today from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. but were told to bring a flashlight,'' she said. ''People are looking into hotels. But for a month?''
Mr. Malae, the stylist who had the three-hour commute, said that on Thursday morning, he would consider driving ''to the Queensboro Bridge and walk or take a cab from there.''
''But tonight,'' he added, gesturing around the salon, ''I might sleep here.''

HEADLINE: As Focus Turns Local, G.O.P. Is Poised to Increase Edge in Governorships

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- If the votes go their way in the 11 elections for governor next week, Republicans could have their strongest statehouse hand in decades.
It is partly about the numbers. With 8 of the 11 seats currently held by Democrats -- and 4 of those with Democratic incumbents leaving office, in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Montana and Washington -- Republicans have far less turf to defend.
And with popular Republican incumbents in conservative states like Utah and North Dakota considered likely to hold on, that could make this year something of an aftershock to 2010, when the Republicans picked up six seats in the midterm elections, to give the party 29 governors, to 20 Democrats and 1 independent. 
But in many other ways, academics and polling experts said, the 2012 elections for governor are nothing like those in 2010, when a national wave of Republican passion swept newcomers into office from statehouses on up to the United States Senate, or in 2008, when enthusiasm for Barack Obama filtered down to state races. That is putting the emphasis back on local issues, personalities and campaign strategies, and making the outcomes harder to predict.
The three governor's races considered the tightest, in New Hampshire, Montana and Washington, involve seats being vacated by incumbents who were first elected in 2004, a relative lifetime ago in the storm-tossed politics of recent years, in which insurgent newcomer governors have battled over pensions, public employee unions and voter ID laws.
''Neither party has a clear advantage on their brand,'' said Matt A. Barreto, a political science professor at the University of Washington and the director of the university's Washington Poll.
The most recent Washington Poll, conducted from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, reflects that reality.
The poll, of 782 registered voters, 644 of whom said they were likely to vote, showed Mr. Obama ahead, with 52 percent of likely Washington voters either certain that they would support him or leaning toward it. That sounds like blue-state predictability, until you get to the governor's race, for which the poll showed a dead heat between the Republican, Rob McKenna, at 46 percent of likely voters, and the Democrat, Jay Inslee, at 47 percent, with a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.
Washington voters have not elected a Republican as governor since 1980.
In New Hampshire, a swing state in the presidential race, a blast of national television advertisements has swamped the candidates for governor, who won their primary elections only last month. New Hampshire has not elected a Republican as governor in a presidential election year since 1992.
''It's a tough spot to be in when you're a candidate for governor and you have very little control over your destiny,'' said Andrew E. Smith, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire and the director of the university's Survey Center. With late primary elections there, on Sept. 11, the candidates seeking to replace Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat who is retiring, have had little time to introduce themselves, Mr. Smith said.
In Montana, a hard-fought, closely watched election for the Senate between Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent, and Representative Denny Rehberg, a Republican, is keeping attention and money away from the race to replace Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat who cannot run again because of term limits.
And while the presidential contest has focused relentlessly on how voters feel about the economy, the filter could be different in the states.
A report in September by State Policy Reports, which tracks state government, ranked all 50 states in ''economic momentum,'' as measured by personal income growth, employment growth and population growth.
Of the top eight, five -- Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Washington -- have elections for governor. Three of those -- Indiana, North Dakota and Utah -- are considered likely or solid in their support of the Republican candidate, while the other two are either candidate's to win, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.
Democrats, by contrast, are placing their best hopes on governors where the economic momentum has been less than stellar: Jack Markell of Delaware (46th in economic momentum), Jay Nixon of Missouri (35th), Peter Shumlin of Vermont (37th) and Earl Ray Tomblin of West Virginia (47th). All four states, according to the Cook Political Report, are leaning or are solid in their support for the Democrat.
There are suggestions that national winds are blowing in some places. In North Carolina, where Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat elected in 2008, is not seeking re-election, the Republican candidate, Pat McCrory, has a nearly 3-to-1 edge in fund-raising over his Democratic rival, Walter H. Dalton, according to followthemoney.org. Mr. Obama won narrowly there in 2008, but this year he state is leaning toward Mitt Romney.

HEADLINE: Revolution Brings Hard Times for Egypt's Treasures

BYLINE: By FARAH HALIME

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Cairo's salmon-colored Egyptian museum is a conspicuous landmark on Tahrir Square, where it stands in almost perfect condition despite the intense protests that took place on its doorstep almost two years ago.
At the height of the revolution last year, a human chain formed to protect the priceless artifacts within the museum. A few yards away, the burnt out husk of former President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party headquarters is a reminder of a different possible fate.
But the revolutionary, carnival enthusiasm of the square has since given way to neglect and disrepair and the difficult job of retrieving stolen antiquities is proving to be an uphill struggle.
Despite the efforts of its protectors, looters managed to make off with 50 of the museum's treasures, including a statue of King Tutankhamun carried by a goddess, and a sandstone head of a princess from Amarna, a vast archaeological site in the southern province of Minya. 
Of the stolen pieces, 29 have since been recovered. The most valuable, a statue of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, was found by a protester soon after it was taken and returned to the museum, the Antiquities Ministry said at the time.
At the same time, however, reports have started to come in of sophisticated and systematic looting occurring across major Egyptian archaeological sites, according to Egyptian and U.S. officials involved in the repatriation of antiquities.
The number of illegal excavations and thefts has worsened to the point that groups are organizing heavy machinery to carry out extensive digs.
''This wasn't just someone taking their shovels and digging holes in the sand,'' said Deborah Lehr, chairman of the Capitol Hill Archaeological Institute at George Washington University, who has been charged with helping the Egyptian government protect its antiquities. ''These were bulldozers, and gangs of men over a period of time.''
Illegal digs have long been a problem for Egypt, where 5,000 years of history lie buried: but since the start of the uprising against Mr. Mubarak in early 2011, the number has ballooned. The collapse of security has emboldened criminals to target landmark areas without fear of reprisals. Illegal digging has taken place near the Great Pyramids in Giza and the grand temples of the southern city of Luxor.
Satellite images from before and after the revolution show a marked increase in looter holes: in fact, parts of the landscape are starting to look like ''Swiss cheese,'' Ms. Lehr said.
Attempts are being made to clamp down on the thefts with more stringent laws. The Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of Parliament, has asked the government to issue new regulations to protect archaeological heritage sites from theft and smuggling. The antiquities ministry says it is modifying legislation to cope with the problem.
Osama El Nahas, who heads the ministry's department tasked with recovering stolen artifacts, says the most immediate solution is to enlist the help of international organizations.
''We are due to sign agreements with countries including Mexico and other Arab countries in the next few weeks,'' covering repatriation of stolen objects, he said. Egypt was also working closely with the United States and Europe, where many stolen pieces end up, he added.
''In this critical moment we need the help of the international community to return Egypt's treasures,'' Mr. El Nahas said.
But with the country struggling to get a grip on a long list of more pressing problems, including the widest budget deficit in the Middle East, a ballooning balance of payments deficit and drawn-out negotiations over international loans, its antiquities risk being forgotten.
After a meeting in Cairo in May last year, Ms. Lehr and her team worked out a proposal with the Egyptian government to provide training and equipment for making inventories of the country's antiquities and digitizing the existing records.
But nearly 18 months later that agreement has yet to be officially approved by the Egyptian authorities. Until that happens, the project remains stalled.
''We want to make sure that we have a signed and cleared agreement by the Egyptian government before we move forward. We are optimistic and hopeful that it will happen soon,'' Ms. Lehr said.
The push to curb the illicit excavation and sale of the country's treasures is potentially very important for Egypt, where tourism has traditionally been one of the top foreign currency earners, accounting for more than one-tenth of the country's gross domestic product before the revolution.
For tourists who want to visit Egypt's antiquities, immortalized in historic towns such as Luxor and Aswan, the missing artifacts are another black mark against a destination already hit by political insecurity.
Last year, during the worst period of instability for decades, tourism revenues dropped by almost a quarter to $9 billion, from $12.5 billion in 2010. Once-popular destinations were deserted.
In an attempt to revive the industry, the government has reopened some sites and pyramids that were previously closed, including the Serapeum of Saqqara, a subterranean necropolis where bulls were believed to have been buried in giant sarcophagi. The site had been closed for a decade for renovation.
The Pyramid of Chefren, the second largest pyramid in the Giza necropolis, and around six other ancient tombs at the Giza site have also reopened after a long restoration project.
Egypt's tourism minister, Hisham Zaazou, said that while short-stay beach holidays along the Red Sea coast make up the bulk of tourist activity in Egypt, long-haul markets -- where tourists fly in from as far afield as China and the United States and tend to stay longer -- are crucial to earning much-needed revenue.
''That's why preserving these monuments, which are actually a man-made heritage, is extremely important for us,'' Mr. Zaazou said.
Yet archaeologists in Egypt say the government is still doing far too little to protect the nation's monuments. They are keeping a close eye on auction houses, looking out for stolen artifacts.
Zahi Hawass, who was promoted to become minister of antiquities in a cabinet shake-up as the revolution got underway, was among the first people to make his way to the Egyptian museum as protests broke out in Tahrir Square.
But fast forward almost two years, and Mr. Hawass, who has been replaced as minister, is awaiting the conclusion of an investigation into corruption allegations that he has denied.
''The most important thing Egypt doesn't have is a strategy,'' Mr. Hawass said in an interview in his Cairo office, lined with glossy Egyptology books, several of which he has written himself.
Mr. Hawass, whose normally bright white hair was dyed with a purple tinge, appeared emotional at times, with his voice breaking and eyes tearing up.
''I'm not a politician, I'm an archaeologist for everyone. What is more important, above anything else, is not me or the people, it's the monuments,'' he said.
Mr. Hawass, who often likens himself to Indiana Jones, was one of Egypt's top archaeologists while also earning himself a celebrity reputation through his often flamboyant behavior. Since the revolution, he has come under attack because of his closeness to the former regime and allegations that he profited from deals relating to his archaeological work.
Dismissing those attacks, he said Egypt's heritage was better protected under his watch than now.
''I had the passion and the determination,'' he said. '' I'm not sure the people who are doing the job now have it.''

HEADLINE: Smooth Reopening of New York Stock Exchange Reassures Investors

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Susanne Craig and Ben Protess contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Judging by the day's closing stock index numbers, Wednesday seemed boring for the markets. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index both fell less than 1 percent.
But by a more important measure -- that they were up and running at all, with few visible glitches -- it was a hugely significant day.
All the major American stock markets opened for trading on Wednesday, after Hurricane Sandy and its aftereffects led to a two-day shutdown. 
Global investors were eager to see how the United States indexes would react after two days without trading. With power failures, destruction and disruptions still gripping much of the Northeast, the reopening of the New York Stock Exchange served as a small sign of reassurance and resilience.
For the 9:30 a.m. opening bell, a bevy of television news crews and camera-toting tourists thronged the exchange. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York was on hand to ring the bell, flanked by NYSE Euronext's chief executive, Duncan L. Niederauer, and a deputy mayor, Robert K. Steel. When the mayor pressed the button, a small cheer broke out from the floor.
The dozen or so staff members at the ramp, an important nerve center on the floor of the exchange, scanned a wall of monitors to check on market activity but they showed a relatively normal amount of activity.
As far as the investor reaction to the shutdown, panic did not seem to sweep the markets. The Dow ended the day down 10.75 points, or 0.08 percent, at 13,096.46. The Nasdaq closed down 10.72 points, or 0.36 percent, at 2,977.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, meanwhile, ended fractionally higher, closing at 1.412.16, up 0.02 percent.
As may have been expected, shares of insurers were down. The Travelers Companies, for instance, whose stock had been trending down for several days, closed down 0.87 percent to $70.94.
Prices of Treasuries, which investors normally buy in a flight to safety, were stable. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed up 8/32, pushing its yield down to 1.69 percent.
Trading volume was average, with about 6.3 billion shares exchanging hands. The daily average for 2012 through last Friday was 6.51 billion shares, according to Thomson Reuters.
The relatively flat close of the markets was an improvement on opening days after previous unplanned market closings. The S.& P. 500 fell nearly 4.9 percent after markets reopened after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. However, it rose 0.79 of a point the day after the Big Board closed because of Hurricane Gloria in 1985, the last market closing because of weather.
Investors will now most likely focus on macroeconomic factors like the economy. On Friday, the monthly unemployment data as well as other delayed government economic reports will be released, which may have an impact on the presidential election. In an indication that the economy could be losing some of its steam, the Dow was down 2.5 percent for the month of October, while the Nasdaq was off 4.5 percent and the S.& P. was down 2 percent.
For their part, exchange officials were pleased with the trading on Wednesday. Lawrence E. Leibowitz, NYSE Euronext's chief operating officer, wandered about the floor, checking on operations.
''There have been very few, very isolated problems,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. He pointed to blank monitors that were shut off because the data provider, Thomson Reuters, was delivering incorrect market data.
''If that's the worst of our problems,'' he added, ''we're in good shape.''
The specialists who handle market orders for the Big Board were back as well, darting about the trading pits in their usual colored jackets. Many gathered outside -- not to smoke, but to try to grab a cellphone signal that was impossible to find inside. But getting to the relative calm of Wednesday's open took significant work. For days, exchange officials traded lengthy conference calls with trading firms, regulators, and city and state officials about how best to resume trading in the nation's financial heart.
Originally, the officials had planned to open the electronic exchange but not the trading floor on Monday, after having consulted with regulators, city officials and other exchanges. But, Mr. Niederauer said, the trading industry quickly asked for a full trading halt, citing the potential danger to employees called into work.
Still, preparations were well under way days before the storm hit. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main trade group, ran multiple calls throughout the weekend to coordinate plans for reopening the markets. An executive of the group was stationed at the city's command center in Brooklyn, along with Bloomberg administration officials.
The group dispatched emergency fuel to firms in Jersey City that needed to jump-start their generators on Tuesday night in preparation for trading on Wednesday.
Staffing was a concern for Big Board officials, too. The exchange dispatched 20 cars on Tuesday to bring in critical personnel before the opening. Others, like Mr. Niederauer, dialed in remotely but went in Wednesday morning at 5:15 a.m.
Jonathan D. Corpina, a senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners, came armed with a flashlight to navigate the darkened streets of Lower Manhattan. But he found it easy to find the exchange, which was illuminated by power from backup generators.
''We're here filling orders, and it's business as usual,'' he said.
Some hiccups emerged, however. One issue was the reliability of member firms' data connections, something that had been tested repeatedly Monday and Tuesday. At about 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, held a call with exchange officials to discuss potential problems with Verizon's network.
Ultimately, both sides concluded that the problems were not severe enough to delay trading.
''The connectivity testing gave us comfort,'' Mr. Niederauer said. ''There was always concern that it may not work.'' Verizon technicians were on hand to patch spotty communications and network connections, while many trading firms resorted to sharing working Internet and phone lines.
The day ended with relatively little pomp. To recognize their work during Hurricane Sandy, Mr. Niederauer asked members of the exchange's facilities and security teams to ring the closing bell.

HEADLINE: Part D, Part 2

BYLINE: JANE GROSS


HIGHLIGHT: Why don't more Medicare beneficiaries pick the right drug plans? Complexity, experts say -- and here's a small example. 

 BODY:
If time is money, then Medicare Part D, which I have yet to use even once, has already cost me more than I will ever cost the government.
First, you may recall, was my quest of many days for the perfect drug plan. In retrospect, it does not seem coincidental that I chose to do this while others were celebrating the Fourth of July -- a holiday that reminds us this is a great country, and one that since 1965 has provided its venerable old folks with health care in the form of Medicare. 
A few years back, in its first major refinement, drug coverage was added to the program: Part D. But it's a Rube Goldberg contraption in which private insurance companies, on behalf of the government, manage the plans.
Even though I'm new the game, it's already clear these private insurers don't do their part nearly as well as the government itself handles Parts A and B, hospital and physician care. I've twice used Part B, and effortlessly. Part D, alas, has already made me wonder if the people who simply throw up their hands and sign up for the first solicitation to arrive in the mail aren't smarter than smarty-pants me. 
They may be saving themselves some aggravation but not, it turns out, much money. In the October issue of the journal Health Affairs, researchers report that only 5.2 percent of Medicare Part D beneficiaries manage to choose the most economical plan. There are 1,736 plans nationwide, with different deductibles, premiums, formularies and the like. Among the researchers' speculations as to why people were making such bad decisions was how much time and research it takes to sort through all these options. 
Older people, the researchers found, tended to overspend the most. Some government assistance for navigating this maze, the journal said, would be helpful.
And how. If you've any doubt about it, let me tell you about my long quest for the simplest imaginable service: to have my $26 monthly premium billed to my credit card. Even this turns out to be like a scene out of Kafka.
What with trying to figure out which drugs are covered in which amounts by whom under what circumstances - well, I had already spent a lot of time talking to my insurer. Each of those conversations left me with another list of reference numbers, authorization numbers, confirmation numbers - none of them ever the same. I dutifully wrote the numbers down and kept them in a file. I have no idea what they are for and yet am terrified that I might lose them. 
The nice gentleman who signed me up in July gave me a 19-digit confirmation number, which filled three lines on a supersize Post-It. He also gave me his sales department phone number in Pittsburgh -- because I insisted. His point of view was that his duties had ended now that I was enrolled. The phone number that mattered to me henceforth, he said, was for "member services.'' 
Back then, he instructed me that when my second monthly bill arrived (Why second? Should I have asked?) I was to call member services and transfer the billing onto a credit card or some other automatic means of payment. When that day rolled around, I found the toll-free number for members and, after a routine amount of "press 1 if you're calling about this," I got a live person. Lucky for me she was lovely, as we were on the phone for a very long time. 
First she needed my member ID, which I didn't even know I had but found on my bill. Since it is a series of letters, we read it back and forth repeatedly: "M, as in mother; E as in elephant, B as in boy'' -- eight little alphabet games in all. The day was sunny when we started but dark when we were done with Part 1 of our transaction.
Then I gave her my credit card number, expiration date and secret Dick Tracy code. That went fast, since there were no letters. But to my dismay, this took care of only the October payment. She would next send me an official letter authorizing the credit card process to go forward. 
Associated with that letter, expected in 5 to 10 business days, was, yes, a 9-digit number. I don't know if it was a "reference," "confirmation" or "authorization" number. I was too tired to ask. 
Once I received, signed and returned the official letter, two or three billing cycles would pass before the credit card deduction went into effect. I will get an invoice each of those months, then will call member services again and repeat this process. For this bit of business, I am in receipt of a reference ID, a string of 12 numbers that, of course, match none of the others I've gotten already or may get in the future. When the invoices stop coming, I'll know the credit card setup is in effect. 
In addition, the helpful rep gave me an authorization number, apparently attesting that I understood what had just transpired. That number was a mere six digits. Of course, I wrote it down. Of course, I understood the conversation -- even if I remain doubtful I can have it two or three more times without shrieking like a crazy person. 
But all of this mystic numerology has left me with the nagging sense that I won't get those monthly invoices. What if something goes wrong? How long before I find myself in the crosshairs of a collection agency, my credit rating at risk over my unpaid $26 monthly Part D plan? 
The lady on the phone clearly was more optimistic than me, still chipper several hours and many mysterious numbers later. She wished me a belated happy birthday. She told me the number I was to call when the next invoice came: good old member services again. I'll be spending more time with them, apparently. 
"Would you be willing to take a customer service satisfaction survey before we hang up?'' she asked. 
"No, thank you,'' I said. "But you're a very nice lady and it was lovely to talk to you.''

HEADLINE: 'Too Big to Fail' Remains Very Real

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Despite declarations from the financial industry that the risk of "too big to fail" institutions has been removed, government subsidies make that a hollow claim, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
Prominent voices within the financial sector are increasingly insisting on one point: We have ended "too big to fail." The idea is simple: through a combination of legislation (the Dodd-Frank legislation of 2010) and supportive regulation (particularly regarding how big banks would be handled in the event of "liquidation"), very large financial institutions are no longer perceived by investors to be too big to fail.
Unfortunately, while tempting, this idea is completely at odds with the facts. The market perception that some financial institutions are "too big to fail" is alive and well. If you want to remove that perception, you need to break up our biggest banks.
In a high-profile paper prepared recently at the behest of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), the lobbying group for the securities industry, Federal Financial Analytics Inc. argues that "too big to fail" has effectively been ended. 
"U.S. bank holding companies and other financial services firms, regardless of size or the nature of their operations, can no longer be rescued at long-term cost to the federal government or otherwise supported in ways that undermine meaningful market discipline." (From the first paragraph of the executive summary.)
The implication of this report is that there is no need to push for further reforms on this dimension. But when I discussed the specifics of this issue on a panel at George Washington University last Friday with Karen Shaw Petrou, an author of that report, she conceded that creditors still believe that the government stands behind very large bank holding companies and other big financial companies. (There was C-Span coverage of the panel discussion.)
Ms. Petrou's report deals with what the law and regulations could mean - under her interpretation, which seems close to the Sifma line (although Ms. Petrou speaks only for herself). But we should be more concerned with how the rules are actually understood by investors in financial markets.
You can theorize that "too big to fail" should have been removed by the recent reforms or will be eliminated by the passage of time. But as a practical matter - looking at what investors really believe - "too big to fail" is still with us. This implicit government guarantee lowers the funding costs for very large financial institutions because investors are convinced that debt issued by these firms is less risky than, for example, debt issued by small and medium-size banks. Ms. Petrou agreed with me on Friday that this is the current situation, although she also argues that there are additional reasons why big banks have a funding advantage (such as more liquidity in the market for their debt). 
Over all, I side with Richard Fisher and Harvey Rosenblum of the Dallas Fed, who argue that "too big to fail" is very much here to stay under the current arrangements (see this recent piece I wrote about their work).
In effect, the government is providing a form of insurance that encourages financial institutions to become even bigger - and thus even more likely to be protected by some combination of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and other agencies. This is an unfair, nontransparent government subsidy that encourages excessive risk-taking and creates a very large potential downside for the nonfinancial side of our economy.
Ms. Petrou points out that there are new legal barriers to some forms of bailout. That's correct, but the general machinery of potential support - for example, from the Federal Reserve - remains absolutely intact. Sometimes this is discussed in terms of "liquidity" support only, but the line can become blurred between liquidity support and helping a nearly insolvent financial institution. When the Federal Reserve also has the ability to inflate asset prices - for example, through conventional or unconventional monetary policy (including buying assets directly) - this distinction may sometimes become meaningless.
My conversations with senior officials, both recently retired and currently in place, confirm that they are of one mind on the key issue. When the choice is between global calamity on the one hand and unpalatable, unpopular and perhaps even illegal support for big banks on the other hand, these officials expect to go with the bailout. 
Market participants are smart to understand this.
The question is how to take this choice off the table - or at least to make it significantly less probable that we ever reach such a decision point.
In an e-mail exchange on these issues, Ms. Petrou sent this statement:
Just because markets think they'll get bailed out doesn't make it so. This is one more case of markets getting it wrong and doing so with systemic consequence. Regulators should finalize the U.S. resolution regime and, as they do, make it very, very clear what the law says and how much it hurts so that markets prepare to take risk, not continue to expect bailouts that not only shouldn't come, but also won't, at least not here.
In a recent speech, "On Being the Right Size," Andrew Haldane from the Bank of England suggests a different emphasis for how we move forward.
It is not the case that the Dodd-Frank reforms were "the biggest kiss" to Wall Street (as Mitt Romney suggested in the presidential debates). Prominent figures on Wall Street fought fiercely against the broad contours of financial reform legislation in 2009-10 and fight now on every line of every detailed regulation; their estimated 3,000 to 5,000 lawyers and lobbyists work very hard and earn a great deal of money for a reason. This is not any kind of kiss that they want.
In the Haldane view - with which I fully concur - the Dodd-Frank changes were steps in the right direction, including the Volcker Rule (limiting what banks can do) and the new resolution authority. The latter empowers the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to create rules governing how any financial institution can fail - with a view to imposing losses on creditors and avoiding broader disruption to financial markets.
The F.D.I.C. has worked hard on resolution issues - and it is no criticism to point out that these rules are as yet unproven and not fully believed by the markets. In the absence of a cross-border resolution framework, these rules also do not adequately cover what would happen if a global megabank went down. (I'm a member of the F.D.I.C.'s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee; this is unpaid work and our meetings are televised.)
The point is to have multiple fail-safes in the system - do not rely on any one reform too much. You really do not know what will prove effective, particularly as the financial system continues to evolve and the nature of risks changes.
As Mr. Haldane emphasizes, it is therefore entirely complementary to propose a cap on the size of the largest financial institutions.
We need to have a credible commitment to let any financial institution fail - in the sense that it will go out of business, wiping out shareholders and imposing losses on creditors.
But any promise for global megabanks that we would "just let them fail" is completely hollow. Standard or even modified bankruptcy procedures are not a credible threat because of the damage this would cause to other financial institutions and to confidence around the world.
Make banks and other financial institutions small enough and simple enough to fail - this is the point stressed by Messrs. Fisher and Rosenblum.
As Mr. Haldane documents, when measured properly, there are no economies of scale for banks over $100 billion in total assets. As a society, we are not losing anything by imposing a size cap on our largest banks, which currently have assets in excess of $2 trillion. Of course, there are private benefits that are being lost - meaning lower subsidies for large financial firms and the powerful people who run them.
But we should welcome, not mourn, the elimination of such subsidies.

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Long-Term Unemployed

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Why has there been so little notice paid to this long-suffering group? Maybe they have become so isolated and politically powerless that most voters don't really care about them. 

 BODY:
Annie Lowrey and I have an article in Friday's paper about the gigantic, overlooked underclass of long-term unemployed workers, whose safety net has now frayed bare and whose troubles are probably holding back the overall jobs picture as they become less and less employable. This 4.8-million-strong group has gotten very little attention during the presidential campaign, despite the candidates' purported focus on the economy.
In fact, in the second debate, when Candy Crowley directly asked the candidates how to alleviate long-term unemployment, Mitt Romney offered some broad statements about joblessness in general before quickly switching topics to the Detroit auto bailout. President Obama never addressed the question at all.
Why has so little notice been paid to this long-suffering group?
Maybe it's because politicians think this is too daunting a problem to promise they can solve. Maybe it's because solving it would require some money, and proposing more spending is an unpopular step when deficit reduction is in vogue. Or maybe it's because this group has become so isolated and politically powerless that most voters (and by extension, politicians vying for votes) don't really care about them. 
As a general rule, people who are unemployed vote in lower numbers than do people who have jobs.
In addition, while unemployment rates remain quite high, unemployment is much more concentrated today than it usually is in poor job markets. Typically in recessions and recoveries, people are churning in and out of joblessness rather quickly. But now once they're out, they're stuck. The fact that fewer people are afflicted (even if the affliction is much worse) means they are a smaller, less visible political constituency.
"There are fewer of us experiencing unemployment, but those who are are out a lot longer," said Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas, Austin. "They then become increasingly isolated, which decreases the will to do anything because they are a less important group. If there were more people experiencing this, politicians might be more interested in doing something about it. That fact that they're not doing something is making it worse, of course, so the problem just feeds upon itself."
Here's a look at the total number of unemployed people during any given month since January 1948, arranged by the length of time they've been looking for a job:
As you can see, there are about as many people very recently unemployed -- looking for work for less than five weeks -- today as there were in the few years before the recession: around 2.5 million. That makes sense, given that layoffs was at a record low just last July and remained relatively low in August.
Meanwhile, the number of people out of work for 27 weeks or more has surged. As of September, the most recent month for which data are available, 40.1 percent of the unemployed had been looking for work for at least 27 weeks. That's not very far from the all-time high of 45.5 percent in March 2011.
On Friday, we'll get the last jobs report before the election. It seems unlikely that the number of long-term unemployed workers will budge much. But even if it rises, I doubt we'll be hearing much from politicians about ways to hasten the re-employment of this struggling group of Americans.

HEADLINE: The Jobs Picture, as a New Report Awaits

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Whatever Friday's jobs report shows, the fundamental picture of the economy is expected to be unchanged: continued recovery, but sluggish growth. 

 BODY:
Here is what we know about the economy, and in particular the jobs situation.
Employers are adding workers at a fairly sluggish clip, at a pace of about 146,000 jobs a month in the past three months. That's probably more jobs than is necessary to keep the unemployment rate stable, given the natural growth in the size of the labor market. But it is fewer jobs than is necessary to pull the unemployment rate down from its elevated level of 7.8 percent very quickly. 
Of late, consumers have been feeling better. Home prices have bottomed out in many markets, and are picking up in many others. The ranks of the jobless have shrunken, and millions of workers are seeing their wages increase, though not by much. Households have worked their way through the worst of the "deleveraging process." The campaign seems to be having an effect, too: Democrats are feeling especially good. 
But businesses are feeling worse. Executives are very concerned about the "fiscal cliff," the huge tax increases and spending cuts looming in January. Manufacturing and exports, two of the bright spots in the recovery, have weakened of late. Overall growth in the American economy remains sluggish, and the major emerging-market countries that fueled the global rebound from the recession have cooled off. 
Friday's jobs report for October -- the consensus forecast of economists, according to Bloomberg, is a net gain of 125,000 jobs -- will be met with a deluge of political spin and hyperbolic analysis. Campaigns and their surrogates are eagerly awaiting the numbers, their narratives pre-written and their talking points sharp. 
Surrogates for Mitt Romney's campaign will argue that the current pace of jobs growth is too slow to bring us anywhere close to full employment any time soon. They will argue that the recovery is anemic in historical terms and that households are still feeling extraordinary pain. They will pick out especially weak numbers, in payrolls or wages or employment in certain sectors. 
Administration officials and advisers to President Obama's campaign will argue that the economy is slowly but surely recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression. They will argue that the economy is adding jobs steadily, with increases in private-sector payrolls for the past 31 months -- probably 32 months, as of Friday's report. They will pull out especially strong numbers, in payrolls or wages or employment in certain sectors.
But it is highly unlikely that Friday's jobs report will do much to change our understanding of the current state of the broader economy -- even if the numbers come in surprisingly high or surprisingly low, as they often do given the noisiness of the data.

HEADLINE: Storm Aftermath: Live Updates

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The patchy recovery from Hurricane Sandy exposed a split region. Lights flickered on in Manhattan and subways rumbled, but in stretches of Staten Island, Queens, New Jersey and Long Island, gasoline and electricity remained scarce as temperatures dropped. 

 BODY:
On Monday morning, commuters returned to work on the city's buses and trains, which were operating on normal or modified schedules, and the majority of students were able to return to classrooms. 
Over the weekend, hundreds of would-be marathon runners wearing numbers ran to the cheers of crowds in Central Park and others went to Staten Island and other storm-ravaged areas to help. 
Power began to return to the Rockaways, one of the hardest-hit areas, and Manhattan had most of its power back. But much of the region remained without power or heat as the temperature plunged overnight, gas remained scarce -- and rationed in New Jersey. And tempers in many places were short. 
Tracking the storm that has disrupted power and transportation for millions of people in more than a half-dozen states, leaving behind the daunting task of cleaning up. 
 4:26 P.M. | City Approves $85 Million in Emergency Storm Contracts 
The city has approved $85.4 million in emergency contracts to repair damage caused by the storm and buy equipment to respond to the disaster, according to the office of City Comptroller John C.Liu. 
The contracts include $30.3 million in work on the city's beaches and money for all manner of equipment - laptops, sandbags, oxygen, new pumps at sewage treatment plants, 
A spokesman for Mr. Liu said the largest contracts had been approved for the parks department, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Sanitation Department and the Department of Design and Construction.
The comptroller's office approved $30,362,965 in parks department contracts to repair damages to various beaches, including Rockaway, Manhattan Beach, Coney Island and along Shore Parkway.
For the Department of Environmental Protection, $15 million in contracts were approved for pumping equipment and work at sewage treatment plants and satellite phones, while the $14 million in Sanitation Department contracts was for heavy equipment and for workers to augment the agency and provide replacement disposal capacity, the spokesman said.
The spokesman said $12 million in contracts for the Department of Design and Construction was for heavy equipment and construction-related services.
- William K. Rashbaum 
 4:11 P.M. | Signs of Progress in the Financial District 
At lunchtime along Wall Street on Monday, tourists far outnumbered office workers looking for lunch, but some wandered in and out of the boutiques.
There were signs of progress. The Battery Park Underpass, completely flooded for days after the storm, with a submerged City Department of Transportation dump truck stuck at the entrance to the westbound lanes, was clear and a police officer guarding it said it would be open in a few days.
The Café Water, a deli on the corner of Cedar and Water Streets, was getting ready to open, perhaps on Tuesday, the owner said.
But other businesses faced obstacles. The historic Fraunces Tavern, at the corner of Pearl and Broad Streets, where George Washington gave his farewell address to officers of the Continental Army, was struggling.
"If we don't get power, we're in trouble," said one of the owners, Eddie Travers, who said he was struggling with the city's Buildings Department to get the power turned on and trying to hold onto his staff.
Minas Polychronakis, a 72-year-old Greek immigrant who runs a shoe repair business at 67 Wall Street, just 40 or so yards from where the waters of the East River stopped in their storm-surge-fueled travels up Wall Street, sat behind the counter in his empty shop early Monday morning. 
Mr. Polychronakis, who has been repairing shoes since 1954, first in Crete and then, after coming to the United States in 1969, in New York, was philosophical. He is no stranger to disaster and loss and the lack of something that has in recent years come to be called "business continuity." He had a shop on the concourse below the World Trade Center for 25 years until the attacks in 2001.
"They say in life we do the best we can," he said. "We start today. I hope we do O.K. It depends on how many people come to work."
This is the busy season in his business, he said. "Boots," he explained. The season in which people get ready for cold weather is the shoemaker's friend.
As for government assistance, he was more cynical. 
"The money goes to the big guys, and who pays the price?" he asked, his eyebrows rising to answer his own question.
But he still has hopes and ambitions.
"In a year and a half, my lease expires," he said. "I hope by then the trade center is open and I open my store again and retire."
- William K. Rashbaum 
 3:57 P.M. | Limited PATH Service Resuming Tomorrow 
 Limited PATH train service will be reinstated Tuesday between Journal Square in Jersey City and 33rd Street in Manhattan, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
The authority said fares would be waived on Tuesday. Stops will not be made at Christopher and Ninth Streets, and disabled passengers will have access only to platforms at Journal Square and 33rd Street. The trains will run between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m.
PATH service is not being restored yet at Newark Pennsylvania Station, Hoboken, Exchange Place or the World Trade Center.
- Matt Flegenheimer 
 3:29 P.M. | Bloomberg Reports Typical School Attendance and Updates Housing Needs 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking at a public school in Brooklyn, P.S. 195., said on Monday that school attendance throughout the city for the day was about 86 percent, about the same as one year ago.
He also said that about 94 percent of the city's schools were open and he expected both attendance and the number of open schools to be higher when classes resumed again on Wednesday, after they close Tuesday for Election Day.
"It was a relatively successful first day," Mr. Bloomberg told reporters.
Mr. Bloomberg said that most of the 16 schools used as shelters should be ready to accommodate their students on Wednesday, by moving people elsewhere or separating evacuees from students. Forty-eight buildings were structurally damaged, and 19 schools are without power.
Dennis M. Walcott, the New York City schools chancellor, said the city was continuing to work on its schools, and there were 7,400 buses helping students get to their classes. Students were given MetroCards to help those in shelters with their transportation needs, the mayor said.
In a news briefing, the mayor and other city officials also discussed the latest efforts in the recovery.
About 115,000 people remained without power in total in the city, he added.
As for the longterm need for housing, Mr. Bloomberg said more than half of the people who need emergency housing were in city public housing, and most of that housing should have electricity restored this week, perhaps in two days, with about two-thirds of the residences with heat and hot water a few days later, with more next week.
He said a worst-case prediction for those who might need temporary housing was 40,000 people, with 20,000 of them from New York City Housing Authority units, but he called that a "guesstimate," with better numbers to come after a survey.
In public housing, 114 buildings with 21,000 residents still do not have power, and 174 buildings lack heat and hot water.
As for longer term housing, Mr. Bloomberg announced the appointment of an employee who had also helped the city get back on its feet after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Mr. Bloomberg said many problems were on their way to being solved, and "those who have much more serious needs, we are not going to walk away from you."
Dozens of polling places are being moved as well. Asked whether he was confident that people could get to the substitute polling places, Mr. Bloomberg said: "I think they can. The question is will they make the effort?"
He also said that 21 million gallons of gasoline was unloaded this weekend but it would take time for it to reach gas stations. Lines at the pump probably will remain long, he added, saying the city was asking motorists to be patient and to use mass transit as long as they can. In the city, the temporary allowance of multiple passenger and street pickups by taxis and livery cabs was suspended as of midnight, he added.
- Christine Hauser 
 3:37 P.M. | Moratorium on Foreclosures Ordered in Storm-Hit Areas 
The federal housing secretary directed all mortgage lenders that work with the Federal Housing Administration on Monday to stop any foreclosure action for 90 days on any homeowners in the region hit by the storm.
 "We don't want families to be victims twice, once by disaster and once by foreclosure," said the secretary, Shaun Donovan. HUD had previously announced more limited foreclosure relief for homeowners in the storm area.
- Eric Lipton 
 2:48 P.M. | MTV Special to Raise Money to Rebuild 'Jersey Shore' Hometown 
Their house was spared, but much of their stamping grounds, including their beloved Seaside Heights Boardwalk, were not. And so the cast members of "Jersey Shore" have been pitching in to help victims of the storm. 
Snooki has already opened her capacious closet to those in need (of a wardrobe like hers).
Cleaning my closet today to donate clothes and whatever I can do the victims affected by sandy! I'm comin with clothes!!!! - NiC0LE P0LiZZi (@snooki) November 1, 2012
And on Monday, MTV announced that it would broadcast a live on-air special, "Restore the Shore," on Nov. 15 to raise money to rebuild Seaside Heights.
"The town and its residents have been nothing but gracious over the years, and now it's time to return their kindness and generosity," the network said.
MTV is working with Architecture for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that provides design and construction services after natural disasters. The show will be broadcast from MTV's studios in Times Square.
I can not believe this footage I am seeing ugh what happened to my jersey shore! :( I hope everyone is alright! - Samantha Giancola (@MTVsammi) October 30, 2012
- Andy Newman 
 2:02 P.M. | New Storm, Expected to Hit Area Wednesday, May Set Back Recovery 
The Northeast is now bracing for a potentially lethal Northeaster that is expected to bring punishing winds and high tides, adding to the misery of residents still reeling from last week's disaster and possibly setting back the restoration of power throughout the region.
Forecasters are tracking a storm developing off the Southeast coast that is expected to make a turn northward and intensify Tuesday before hitting the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region by Wednesday and continuing into Thursday.
The National Weather Service predicts the storm could produce sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles an hour and gusts up to 60 miles an hour in the New York region by Wednesday afternoon. The storm, coming in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, could cause more power failures and minor to moderate flooding along the coastal areas devastated last week, said David Stark, a meteorologist with the Weather Service.
Mr. Stark said tidal surges of two and a half feet to four and a half feet at the peak of high tide on Wednesday night could play unpredictably along the southern shores of Long Island and western Long Island Sound, coastal landscapes altered by last week's storm.
"Some of the dunes are gone," he said, "so there is some definite uncertainty there on what the impacts will be with a moderate coastal storm surge." 
Temperatures along the coast are expected to dip into the high 30s on Wednesday night and climb into the 40s by Thursday morning and into the 50s later in the day. The storm system is expected to move out by Thursday afternoon.
Inland areas in the lower Hudson Valley, northeastern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut could get a mix of sleet and snow on Wednesday morning, changing to rain later in the morning.
The Northeaster and its damage are not expected to approach the hurricane's devastation. But given the damage last week to homes, businesses, coastlines, the electric grid and the spirits of people without power for a week, a second storm seems certain to compound the damage from the first one.
- Peter Applebome 
 2:12 P.M. | U.S. Transportation Dept. to Provide 350 Buses in New Jersey 
The federal Department of Transportation plans to provide 350 buses to help ease what has been a difficult return to work for New Jersey commuters. As many people returned to work on Monday for the first time since Hurricane Sandy, many of the usual commuting routes were still shut down, or overwhelmed. 
New Jersey Transit normally runs 63 trains in and out of New York City during the morning peak hours; on Monday it was able to run just 13. New Jersey Transit had added train cars to lines that were running, and began running emergency buses between northern New Jersey and Manhattan on Monday to make up for lost service, but trains were crowded anyway. The New Jersey Coast Line and trains from Woodbridge had to be shut down in the middle of the morning rush because so many commuters crowded the trains and platforms. Gov. Chris Christie said the buses provided by the federal government could accommodate half of the usual number of cross-Hudson commuters.
Trains in northern New Jersey were expected to remain out of service for several weeks, after sustaining extensive damage during the storm.
The buses were arranged through private contractors, and the first 70 will arrive today, according to the office of Senator Frank Lautenberg, with the rest to follow later in the week.
- Kate Zernike 
 1:55 P.M. | Still Housing Evacuees, an S.I. School Isn't Ready for Students 
Even as most New York City public schools reopened on Monday for the first time since Hurricane Sandy struck the region, some schools were not ready for students because they were still serving as shelters.
Susan E. Wagner High School on hard-hit Staten Island is one of those schools.
Jeff Pedersen, facility manager for the evacuee shelter that was set up at the school, said on Monday that some people were still arriving at the shelter, even as more left. The shelter had about 190 people on Monday, down from 250 Sunday night.
"For every two that come in, three leave," he said. "As the coastal areas are inspected and more residences are condemned, those families come to us. But then more people are finding places to stay with relatives, or a hotel room, or they get a FEMA stipend for temporary housing."
Mr. Pedersen said he didn't know what the plan was for students returning to the school. "Right now it's unclear," he said. "Our options are either to move the students to another school site, or have school here on a half-day basis, or bring them all day but with modified lunch."
He said modified lunch was when students would be served cold, ready-to-eat food somewhere other than the cafeteria.

 01:22 P.M. | Halloween 2012: One Trick Is Just Sorting Out When It Is 
Never mind that it's November, that Christmas decorations went up at malls across the country last week. It is Halloween in New Jersey - so decreed by Gov. Chris Christie, who signed Executive Order 105 last week ordering all observance of the holiday to be postponed until today because of Hurricane Sandy.
Happy Halloween. Because today is Halloween. Because Gov. Christie said so, that's why. fb.me/20ToWYq3Z

But with power lines and trees still down, and one in five New Jersey homes remaining without power, many towns canceled or reshaped the holiday, or postponed it again, turning Halloween into The Holiday That Refused to Die.
It was the second year of so much confusion over Halloween - after last year's freakish snowstorm prompted some towns to try to postpone it (only to be disobeyed by defiant parents and their plastic-pumpkin-toting offspring).
Nutley, where a young Martha Stewart developed her love of the holiday, has canceled Halloween outright, as did Linden, where many homes remain dark.
Glen Ridge pushed Halloween to this Friday, while Westfield, where nearly 100 roads remained blocked by trees or power lines, has postponed it "until further notice due to safety."
Other towns, including Brick, along the shore, as well as Clark, Verona and West Milford in northern New Jersey, have changed trick-or-treat to "trunk or treat" - inviting parents to parking lots where candy will be doled out of the back of cars. ("No need to decorate your car," Brick's mayor, Stephen C. Acropolis, said.) 
Some towns that are allowing Halloween to go forward today have recommended it not go late - ending at dusk in Oradell and 8 p.m. in Wanaque.
And in towns that do plan to have Halloween as revised, parents and treat-givers were confused on how to comply with the executive order, which declared Halloween between the hours of noon and 5 p.m. - starting just as many trick or treaters head out in a typical year. 
All this led some people to wonder whether this was worth the fuss.
A Twitter message from The Star-Ledger asking whether Halloween should be canceled got a range of opinions. Some argued to move on.
@njdotcom halloween is still delayed for many towns and will be celebrated this weekend. it's honestly not priority and should be cancelled

Others said doing so would make things only harder for children already suffering from cabin fever after a week home from school and other activities.
@njdotcom nah, the kids need it. mine have been really really looking forward to it, esp. since we still have no power.

 1:15 P.M. | U.S. Fund for Unicef Continues Work Despite Flooded Office Building 
The United States Fund for Unicef which has not been able to return to its offices at 125 Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan due to flooding at the building, said it had continued to function in space it has uptown for just such emergencies.
The group, which supports Unicef's work to help vulnerable children around the world, put in motion a business continuity plan. Within two days of the storm, staff members were working out of office space the organization rents in Harlem. The fund's Web site never went off line.
About 50 of the fund's more than 200 employees are at the Harlem office, and the number is expected to increase to 80.
Other members of the staff have been working remotely. What's more, the group's six offices outside of New York are all open.
"The U.S. Fund for Unicef was built to deal with emergencies," said Caryl M. Stern, its president and chief executive. "When something goes wrong anywhere in the world, we turn up the volume. Our teams flood into our offices and we work 24/7 to get help to the world's children when they need us most. This time, the flood was on us - but when Hurricane Sandy shut down our offices in New York, our team didn't miss a beat."
The organization said it was unsure when it would be able to return to its Lower Manhattan offices, though it was able to retrieve documents from the building.

 12:55 P.M. | In Haiti and Cuba, Hundreds of Thousands Are in Need of Help 
Hurricane Sandy's destructive path through the Caribbean was especially acute in Haiti and Cuba, leaving hundreds of thousands in need of assistance, a top United Nations relief official said Monday.
"The Caribbean has been very badly affected," said the official, John Ging, director of operations at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Briefing reporters at the United Nations, Mr. Ging said the hurricane left at least 50 dead in Haiti, destroyed 27,000 homes and left "hundreds of thousands depending on our assistance."
Mr. Ging said the United Nations, which has an extensive operation in Haiti dating to the 2010 earthquake, was formulating a new appeal for donations to both Haiti and Cuba, where he said the hurricane had left 500,000 people in need of help.

 12:01 P.M. | Construction Resumes at World Trade Center; Progress Is Reported on PATH 
Construction at the World Trade Center site, which was inundated along with much of Lower Manhattan during the storm, resumed on Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced this morning.
About 750 construction workers were able to return to ground zero now that more than 95 percent of the water from the storm surge at the 16-acre site has been pumped out, the governor said.
The pumping operation at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, which was submerged under seven feet of water, has also been completed, Mr. Cuomo said, with about 16 million gallons removed. 
The governor announced on Saturday that crews completed dewatering at One World Trade Center, the PATH track bed and the Vehicle Security Center, which is where the storm surge entered the site. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the PATH trains, expects to complete the dewatering process at the PATH transit hub within the next two days, the governor said.

 12:01 P.M. | Power Companies Contend With a New Storm and a Minor Earthquake 
What's next: locusts?
Before officials of the region's utility companies could restore power to all of the customers who lost it because of Hurricane Sandy, they now have to contend with an assortment of lesser challenges from Mother Nature, including an onrushing northeaster and a minor earthquake.
Just after 1 a.m. Monday, a minor temblor rattled residents of the Ringwood area, near the northern border of New Jersey. The quake did not appear to have ruptured any gas lines but crews from PSE&G were checking the area, said the utility's president, Ralph LaRossa.
The storm, which is scheduled to hit the region on Wednesday, posed a bigger threat to the work in progress to restore about 375,000 PSE&G customers still without power, Mr. LaRossa said. If the storm packs winds up to 55 miles per hour as forecast, he said, it could knock down more overhead wires and halt the restoration effort.
"When it rains, it certainly does pour," Mr. LaRossa said. "Our organization has been stretched this week like it never has in the past."
He said the company had about 3,000 workers from out of state helping to clear trees and branches and replace poles, wires and transformers. The company is still seeking reinforcements including about 120 line workers from West Virginia who were en route to New Jersey on Monday morning, he said.
The crews would continue working through a rainstorm, but would have to stop using bucket trucks to reach wires once winds get to 40 miles per hour, he said. Winds that strong could send dangling branches down onto wires that have just been repaired or replaced, he said.
"Many of the repairs that we've made to the system will be challenged," Mr. LaRossa said.
He said the company still hoped to have power back on for almost all of its customers by the end of the week, but he added that the work was going particularly slowly in Montclair, South Orange and Maplewood in Essex County because many of the wires in those town run through backyards. Crews cannot get trucks into those backyards, so they must carry poles and wire into the yards, he said.
'There will be pockets of that that I think will go into this weekend," Mr. LaRossa said.

Intercity bus operators BoltBus and Megabus, which offer low-cost fares to passengers between Washington, New York and Boston, have restored full service along the heavily traveled Northeast corridor, spokesmen for both companies said Monday. The companies say they restored full service into New York City on Friday after hundreds of trips into the city were canceled following flood damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

 10:46 A.M. | How N.Y.U. Kept the Lights On 
When much of Manhattan south of Midtown was blacked out, the lights were on at most of New York University, as was the heat and hot water. That's because last year, the school installed a small cogeneration network of its own, burning natural gas in a unit that not only made electricity but also delivered the heat that would otherwise go to waste for use in heating and cooling.

 9:26 A.M. | A Scramble to Prepare for Election Day 
Dawn Sandow was bleary-eyed late Sunday afternoon in the Board of Elections main offices, at 42 Broadway.
"We're all working 12 hours a day, seven days a week," said Ms. Sandow, the board's deputy executive director. She paused for a vital piece of business: A staff member was going on a coffee run.
Even during normal circumstances, the scramble begins more than a week in advance for the city's Board of Elections to put all the working parts into motion for Election Day.
"Nobody has a clue how complex this is, the logistics of it all," Ms. Sandow said.
Simply by the numbers, there are about 1,200 polling sites, and 40,000 poll workers and 57,000 pieces of equipment, including voting machines, tables and chairs, to transport, she said. Then throw in one vicious storm that blacked out 42 Broadway, the board's command and nerve center, and has thrown the setup of polling sites into chaos.
Even as she spoke on Sunday, the phone lines were still down, as was the voter hotline, and the office's main computer system, which holds voter lists, polling site information and other vital data. A technology team had been working since Tuesday to try to repair it.
Office communications have been shifted to staff members' cellphones and personal e-mails, and many staff members have been sent to other borough offices, including Queens, where a backup server offers limited access: workers can see information, but cannot work with it and or make changes in the system.
Staten Island, for all its devastation, did not pose huge difficulties, Ms. Sandow said, because few sites had to be changed. Same for the Bronx, although a tented location was set up in the Locust Point section, near the base of the Throgs Neck Bridge.
But there were dozens of sites to be relocated in waterfront areas of Brooklyn and Queens, particularly the Rockaways, with its major devastation and widespread power losses. Regarding the ruined polling sites for Breezy Point and nearby areas, officials considered setting up a tented voting site at the Aqueduct Racetrack, but this was ultimately rejected, Ms. Sandow said, partly because of the difficulty in getting voters to travel there.
"If people didn't leave their house in a storm, do you think they are going to get on a shuttle bus to vote?" she said. "Our concern is that we service everybody. I'm sure there will be complaints - there are complaints during a normal election."

 10:10 A.M. | A Train Is Packed Far Before Its Destination 
"That's it! No more!"
Under the modified schedule the Long Island Rail Road has cobbled together to restore service despite the damage wrought by last week's storm, train No. 6413 bound for Manhattan was supposed to stop at all 12 local stations on the Port Washington branch Monday morning. And stop it did, even though by the time it left Great Neck, the fourth on the list, the train's ten cars were already packed to the gills.
As the train approached each remaining station, knots of hopeful commuters would crowd around, and at first, one or two intrepid souls might even manage to shove their way aboard. But soon the people already jammed into the train were calling out pre-emptively as soon as the doors opened that there was no more room for anyone, prompting a mixture of slumped shoulders and dirty looks from the disappointed and frustrated. The train's conductor tried announcing on the train's P.A. system that another would be along in 20 or 25 minutes, but her voice did not carry far out onto the platform, and it was anyway small consolation: if a train due in to Penn Station before 8 o'clock was like this, what would the next train be like?
"We're leaving a trail of broken hearts," one man in the first car said wryly.
When the train reached the Murray Hill station in Queens, whose platforms are only four cars long, the conductor's usual announcement - "Passengers in the rear of the train must walk forward to exit at Murray Hill" - was met with derisive laughter in the crowded aisles.

 10:15 A.M. | In Coney Island, the Mundane Joys of a Warm, Bright School 
Ella Kharmats, 8, a third grader at Public School 100 in Coney Island, walked anxiously to school Monday morning with her father, Alex Kharmats. They passed scores of ruined cars, toppled trees, filthy streets and ribbons of yellow caution tape flapping in a very cold wind.
"When you go to school, things start to get a little better," said Ella, who lived for days without heat or power.
She said in-class assignments on her first day back would include "writing papers about what happened to you." 
Mr. Kharmats, 41, an accountant who lost his car to the floods, said the everyday act of walking his daughter to school in such a devastated setting was "a little surreal."
Inside P.S. 100, also called The Coney Island School, the lights burned bright and radiators pumped out comforting heat. School buses ran around a half-hour late, but breakfast for hungry students was served on time. 
Just after 8 a.m., every student faced a flag and recited the Pledge of Allegiance, which a girl led on the public-address system. The principal, Katherine Moloney, said it was too soon to tell whether attendance was normal.
One parent, Diana Novak, 49, hugged Ms. Moloney in a hallway and said she had prayed for the school during the storm.
"I prayed you would be open, thank God," she said. "It's more safe here than in our house."
Many students who normally are driven arrived by foot or by bus, either because their family cars were destroyed or because their parents are trying to save gas. Kaitlyn Romero, 9, a fifth grader, usually got a ride to school with her grandparents, but their car was ruined. Her mom's car was too. She said she felt "tired" Monday morning because she'd worried through the night.
"I didn't sleep because I was thinking about school," she said.
Kaitlyn's mother, Ella Mandel, 40, a substitute teacher, said she boiled water in the morning so her daughter could brush her teeth in an apartment still without potable water or heat. 
Mary Ann Spinner, 47, a music teacher, wept a little as she stood outside the cafeteria door and welcomed back almost every student by name. Every child that got within five feet got a hug.
"Some of it is tears of joy because I'm happy to see they're O.K.," she said.
Natasha Moussa, 10, a fifth grader, rode the bus to school along with her brother, Musa Moussa, 14, a ninth grader at Leon M. Goldstein School nearby. Their family car had been destroyed, and they had spent days in a cold, dark, dirty apartment in a high-rise along battered Neptune Avenue.
"Last week was terrible because I live in Coney Island," Natasha said. "But I like school, and it's boring staying home, so I like going back."
- Nate Schweber 
 9:45 A.M. | Bundled Up and Happy to Return to School 
In front of the Lower East Side building that houses Public Schools 134 and 137, parents led small children bundled in extra coats and animal hats through the blue metal doors Monday morning for the first day of school since Hurricane Sandy hit.
For many, it was a relief to have someone else take care of the children for the first time in days after a week spent playing Uno by candlelight and listening to the radio.
"'Mommy, I can't take this!'" Aura Salcedo, 43, recalled her 8-year-old son saying as he endured a week with no computer or TV, rolling her eyes. "I tell him, 'Honey, back in the day this is how people lived!'"
Her son, too, was happy to return - though the chilly morning and lack of heat in their apartment did not ease the transition.
"My son gave me a hard time today to get up this morning; it was so cold," Ms. Salcedo said. And guessing that the school, on East Broadway, also had no heat, she bundled him in two shirts, a sweater, a coat, a scarf and a hat. Her suspicions were confirmed Monday morning.
Other parents, too, had anticipated a cold school building. Christine Chan, had layered three shirts onto her fourth-grade son. Mohamad Obad, 32, led two puffy children by the hands - his 7-year-old daughter, in a black sequin vest, boots and purple panda hat, and his 9-year-old son, in a dark vest and alien hat. He said he had spent $500 outfitting his three children with new winter clothes. And given that his neighborhood had no heat - forcing the whole family to sleep in one bed - he had dressed the children warmly in case the school had none, he said.

 9:53 A.M. | On One Subway Line, a Near-Normal Commute 
In with all the commuter chaos, there were patches of near-normalcy. 
At about 7:15 a.m., the Q train leaving from the Seventh Avenue subway station in Brooklyn was crowded, but no more so than most other Monday mornings. Crowds were sparse on the platform, so when the trains came - two within 10 minutes - the passengers on the trains were able to inhale deeply enough to let those on the platform enter. 
In at least one car, a few seats even opened up at Atlantic Avenue and again at Canal Street - where again, as usual for that time of the morning, the platforms were busy but not overflowing. 
- Diantha Parker 
 9:36 A.M. | In Newark, Long Lines and Alternate Routes 
At Pennsylvania Station in Newark, the line for trains going to Penn Station in New York went down the stairs from the platform deep into the area below - with hundreds of people waiting for each train that left every 20 to 30 minutes. With PATH service between New Jersey and Manhattan still suspended, commuters were struggling to devise alternate routes, which also included buses.
Sharon George, 50, who works at New York Life Insurance, was waiting in line with a friend. When her power went out, she stayed with her daughter in Brooklyn. She got it back last night, and today is her first day back to work.
"I felt so displaced," Ms. George said of the past week. "Now I got my power back and I'm going to work," she said with a smile as the line began to move.
- Daniel Krieger 
 9:40 A.M. | Cold Halls and Thawed Frozen Food, but School is Open 
At Public School 2 in Chinatown, power was on, but there was no hot water. "We expect to carry on as usual," said the acting interim principal, Bessie Ng. She had e-mailed teachers telling them to dress warmly. "The students normally come with many layers," she added.
if they don't, the staff will find something warm for them, Ms. Ng said.
Lunch was an issue, too. Because power was out, food in the freezer had to be thrown out. Ms. Ng expected a delivery for student meals shortly. "A number of teachers brought in food, just in case," she said.
A reporter visiting parts of the school Monday found the main hallway fairly comfortable; a classroom with windows and basement hallway were cooler, requiring a sweater or coat. The school relies on central city steam for heat and hot water, a custodian engineer, Chris Swift said. The system is controlled by Con Ed; the utility had e-mailed him to say they were working on the problem. 
Kids played outside in a chilly breeze as others ate breakfast - cereal with shelf-safe milk - most with their coats still on in a basement cafeteria. 
"Put on your coat if you're going outside," the principal told one student in the basement. "Where's your coat?," she asked another.
The P.T.A. president, Maggie Chin, said that some parents had power interruptions even after lights came on for most the area, and some in nearby buildings still did not have heat. "But it seems O.K." inside the school, she said. 
The school is also a polling place. Workers were delivering cartons stamped "Emergency Ballot Box" from the Board of Elections Monday morning. Tomorrow, the city schools will be closed once again, this time for voting.

 9:23 A.M. | Departing From Jamaica: The Sardine Special 
The Long Island Rail Road resumed modified service on most branches for Monday's commute, and at the Jamaica hub in Queens, where most of the railroad's trains stop on the way into Pennsylvania Station or Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, the rush-hour crowds were all but impenetrable. 
Often, a passenger would watch five trains come and go before being able to get on. 
"Doors must close!" railroad workers yelled as people crammed their way in.
"It's like in Japan - the attendants push you in and bow at you," said Armando Perez, a flight attendant. 
 Except, of course, no one was bowing.

- Mr. Aye Dee (@MrAyeDee) November 5, 2012
But all things considered, commuters remained relatively civil. They bantered quietly about the damage to their homes or their eagerness to get back to work, and tried to help one another.
One woman got into a screaming match with a train worker and stuck her camera phone in his face. "Why won't you let us on?" she demanded. The man held up his badge and told her to go ahead and put the video on YouTube.
Mr. Perez, 54, who had just flown from Bogota into Kennedy International Airport and was headed for Atlantic Terminal to catch a subway home to Bensonhurst, watched a train depart. "I'm too tired to push and shove," he said. 
Danielle Jelley-Rettman, an English teacher in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had walked half an hour - "to save gas" - from her home in Sea Cliff, where she still has no power, to the train station there.
Trains went by. Ms. Jelley-Rettman would miss her first-period class.
For Ms. Jelley-Rettman, 30, her school, the Brooklyn School of Music and Theater, would provide many of the comforts her home still lacks.
"I am looking forward to work because I will have heat, Internet and a printer," she said.

 8:41 A.M. | In New Jersey, Buses Go By, Too Full to Stop 
Across northern New Jersey, oversubscribed buses were the order of the day.
At a bus stop in Union City, about three dozen people waited as several overcrowded New Jersey Transit buses passed by. Even some of the private minibuses that compete with the buses were too full to accommodate any more passengers. 
In Montclair, the private Decamp line commuter buses passed dozens of potential passengers at corner after corner, leaving folks groaning at the curb. Some people were waiting well over an hour.

 8:35 A.M. | Along New Jersey's Coast, a Fraught Commute 
In coastal Monmouth County, N.J., which was hard hit by the storm, commuters headed through a transformed transit landscape for New York City, sometimes with one eye over their shoulder.
"I had this weird and uneasy feeling this morning leaving my wife and two young daughters home alone in the dark," Nick Caputo, 44, an engineering supervisor at the United Nations, said as he boarded a 6 a.m. bus in Aberdeen to the Port Authority. "But I had no choice; I had to get back to work." 
Shortly after 6, David Cairo, 43, an electrician in Manhattan who lives in Matawan, was about to get into his car and drive to the Woodbridge train station for a connection to Penn Station. 
"There are no trains running out of Matawan so I need to drive to Woodbridge," he said. "This is pretty inconvenient, but at least power was restored to home last night - that makes life a lot more tolerable." 
By 7:15 a.m., New Jersey Transit had shut down its trains out of Woodbridge, too, because the platforms were too crowded.

 8:05 A.M. | In Williamsburg, Girding for a Four-Hour Commute 
Somewhere in New Jersey, there is a Victoria's Secret fashion show set that needs to be painted. And so just after 6 a.m. on Monday, Jacqueline Marolt, 27, a freelance scenic artist, was standing at the B62 bus stop on Bedford and Manhattan Avenues in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, headed to work.
For many, this is the first day back on the job after Hurricane Sandy. But with the G train down and the L train unable to reach Manhattan, a large swath of north Brooklyn is without reliable public transportation.
At this bus stop, about half a dozen people typically gather at 6 a.m. But on Monday, Ms. Marolt stood with approximately 60 fellow commuters. 
Hell on earth today. (@ MTA Bus - B62 w/ 2 others) 4sq.com/U3Sr55

Just two buses crammed with people passed by between 6 and 7 a.m. 
Fewer than 10 people were able to shove their way on to the first bus. The second one flashed a "Next Bus Please" sign, and simply flew by. "That's the only bus over the Pulaski Bridge!" shouted one woman.
Everyone in Williamsburg & Greenpoint is depending on the #B62 we need double buses with more frequent service #nycmta @nycmayorsoffice

Ms. Marolt's plan: take the B62 from Brooklyn to Queens, switch to the No. 7 train and head into Manhattan, change to the A/C/E, get off at Penn Station, and hop a New Jersey Transit train to Secaucus Junction. She'd mapped out the route in a large notebook.
She faced at least four hours in transit, she said. 
"I'm frustrated," she said, but: "There's people who don't have anything. Who's out there with those people? In contrast to that, what are you going to do do? Five or six hours in transportation is a small thing."

 8:00 A.M. | Road Traffic Very Heavy 
Traffic into New York City is somewhere between bad and terrible this morning, with particularly excruciating delays of 60 to 90 minutes on the inbound Lincoln Tunnel from all approaches, according to radio reports.
Here are some other delays being reported:
*Staten Island Expressway eastbound: bumper-to-bumper all the way across.
*Goethals Bridge from New Jersey to Staten Island: jammed.
*George Washington Bridge: 20-minute delays inbound from Routes 80 and 95; better from other approaches.
*B.Q.E./Gowanus: heavy from 65th Street up to the Brooklyn Bridge, and southbound from Queens Boulevard to the Kosciuszko Bridge.
*Throgs Neck Bridge: very heavy Queens-bound.
Remember, too, that the Holland Tunnel is closed except to buses, and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Queens Midtown Tunnel remain shut entirely.

 7:45 A.M. | New Jersey Transit Shuts 'Overcrowded' Coast Train Line 
New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line resumed limited service on Sunday from Woodbridge on north. But at 7:15 a.m. today, the agency shut down the line, then issued an alert:
"Due to overcrowding, NJCL service temporarily suspended. Woodbridge customers should use Metropark station for service to/from Newark and New York."
Hard as it might be to understand why the railroad could not simply keep trains running and fit as many people as possible onto them, a spokeswoman, Nancy Snyder, said there was a "safety factor" because of the crowds at Woodbridge Station.
"We have to transport our customers safely," she said. " We were unable to handle the mass crowds at Woodbridge."
Ms. Snyder said that it was not yet clear when service would resume.
At Metropark, Ms. Snyder, commuters have two options: the Northeast Corridor train, which is also completely jammed this morning, and free shuttle bus service to Hoboken, Weehawken and Manhattan.

 7:13 A.M. | Back to School for Most Students 
While many of the city's 1.1 million students will return to their normal classrooms on Monday, others that attend classes in one of 57 schools that were damaged by the storm or the 16 schools that are serving as emergency shelters will relocate temporarily to other schools on Wednesday. As of Sunday night, 29 schools still remained without power and many were without heat.
Go to the New York City Department of Education's Web site to find out if your child's school will be open or download the PDF or an Excel spread sheet of temporary locations.
Elementary and middle school students who have been displaced from their homes can enroll at the zoned school for their new temporary residence. To find the zoned school for an address, visit schools.nyc.gov or call 311, or visit an enrollment office. 
Displaced high school students who would like to attend school close to their temporary residence should also visit an enrollment office, listed on the Education Department's Web site.

 11:48 P.M. | Back to School, Bundled Up, But With Lingering Questions 
Cots lined the hallways, and toilets were limited or clogged, so some evacuees went to the bathroom on the floor. Volunteers, gagging at air made more fetid by unwashed bodies, took to wearing masks. "We gave them wipes," a volunteer said, "but there's only so much you can do with wipes."
Custodians spent Sunday scrubbing and mopping, preparing this makeshift storm shelter in Hell's Kitchen, which at one point housed some 1,000 displaced men, women and children, for the return to its day job - as the High School of Graphic Communication Arts.
The rush to sanitize the school was just one piece of the sprawling, shifting logistical puzzle, some would say nightmare, as the city's 1.1 million public school students faced an educational landscape drastically altered by Hurricane Sandy. The city said that 57 schools were too damaged to reopen, which meant the city had to find new places for their 34,000 students. Eight buildings that normally house 24,000 students currently serve as shelters, and are set to reopen on Wednesday, a target several educators believed unfeasible. It was still unclear on Sunday whether students and teachers would be sharing their buildings with people now using them for shelter. (Graphic Communication Arts housed people evacuated from Bellevue Hospital Center.)
As of Sunday afternoon, 29 schools remained without power, with parents, teachers and students - many of them storm victims themselves - unsure when classes might resume, though the Department of Education said they were hoping to open Wednesday. Some of those that will reopen Monday might not have heat; the mayor advised that students wear extra sweaters.

 10:30 P.M. | Sixth Day on the 10th Floor in Coney Island 
They met five years ago, over the Internet. She was in Russia. He was in New York. After Marina Kozlova and Oleg Kharak got married and she moved to the United States, the couple settled into a happy routine that revolved around their home in the Coney Island Houses, a complex of brick public-housing buildings on Surf Avenue and West 30th Street, right off the sea. 
Ms. Kozlova, who is 38, exercised every morning on the Boardwalk, toning her arms. She and her husband, who is 46, would go grocery shopping and run errands together.
All of that changed last Monday, when Sandy left them stranded on the 10th floor. Many thousands in the city are without elevator service. But their predicament had another fold. Both Mr. Kharak and Ms. Kozlova are in wheelchairs. 
"Our decision was 'stay here,'" Mr. Kharak said. "Last year, Irene wasn't so bad. We saw our neighbors. They have water, some candles. They help us. Every two days, my cousin comes. He has chargers for cellphones, food."
The situation was bearable, if not pleasant, but things began to grow more dire with the days. First the medical-supply company that delivered their diapers and other vital items failed to come. And then temperatures began to drop. 
But they only grew discouraged when the buildings surrounding theirs began to light up, while they were still sitting in the dark. "Sometimes we feel, we think that everyone forget about us," Mr. Kharak said.
The Coney Island Houses were still shrouded in darkness on Sunday night. Consolidated Edison said that it had no timetable for restoring power to the buildings.
As the temperatures dipped nearly to freezing, Mr. Kharak had turned on the gas burners of the stove to heat the apartment. Ms. Kozlova lay under a blanket in the bedroom. A candle illuminated two prints by Gustav Klimt on the walls. "Sometimes we are upset," she said. "We think, 'We are not getting power because our neighbors are not rich?'" 
Their building, which they had not seen, was a sight to behold. The halls were gritty with sand and lined with black garbage bags. The narrow stairwell, now the only way to get down to the street, was as dark as a cave and reeked of urine. Outside, half-buried cars poked their noses out of sand dunes on the street, and workers in hazmat suits went in and out of the first floors, which were completely flooded.
They had not received any help, other than that of their neighbors and relatives, until Saturday, when someone knocked on their door and was surprised to find two wheelchair users there. They were asked what their needs were, and today, "volunteers came four times," Mr. Kharak said.
Despite moments of frustration, Ms. Kozlova said she had no intention of leaving. Her husband had offered to buy her a ticket back to Russia, to escape and recuperate for a few weeks, but she had refused. "I am not going alone, " she said.
The couple said they had not bickered or taken out their stir-craziness on each other over the last six days. "It's a little like a honeymoon," Mr. Kharak said. "Why not?" 
"If we are not too cold, we will stay five days more," he added. "It's not so bad, but cold."
 Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated Marina Kozlova's surname as Tozlova.

 8:47 P.M. | Street Where Crane Collapsed Is Reopened 
On Sunday night, New York City police reopened the segment of West 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan that was closed off after a construction crane collapsed at the top of a high-rise under construction.
The block, which is home to Carnegie Hall, had been closed to pedestrians and cars since the high winds from the storm that blew through on Monday night left the crane's boom dangling vertically. Crews had been working to secure the crane so that it was not a danger to traffic below.
At about 8:30 p.m., the police said pedestrians could again traverse the block and automobile traffic would be flowing through soon.

 8:33 P.M. | Tolls Suspended on Bridges to the Rockaways 
No tolls will be collected on the bridges to the Rockaways for the rest of November, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Sunday.
The governor said that tolls would be suspended on the Marine Parkway - Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge and the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge because the main transit link to those beach communities was knocked out by the storm.
"The people of the Rockaways suffered tremendously from Hurricane Sandy, and with the loss of A train service, there is no easy way for many of them to get back and forth to the rest of New York," Mr. Cuomo said. "We are taking action to suspend these tolls to make the recovery easier for both Rockaways residents and the people helping them."
The suspension of the tolls - $3.25 per car in cash or $1.80 for cars with E-Z Pass - will be retroactive for E-Z Pass customers to when the bridges reopened after the storm, according to Joseph J. Lhota, chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The bridges are operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The bridges were closed to traffic on Monday evening as the storm drew near. The Marine Parkway bridge reopened on Tuesday evening and the Cross Bay on Wednesday afternoon. Tolls paid since then will be credited back to customers' accounts, Mr. Lhota said.

 8:46 P.M. | Celebrating an N.F.L. Sunday, No Matter What It Took 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Tunes from Bon Jovi wafted over the rooftops of thousands of vehicles in the sun-washed parking lots outside MetLife Stadium early Sunday afternoon, accompanying the hiss from smoking grills, the hum from tiny generators and the din from a thousand conversations seemingly centering on two topics: gasoline and football.
The lots for Sunday's Giants-Steelers game opened at 11 a.m. Eastern, more than five hours before kickoff, and in the northwest corner, in section L11, Peter Berger and his party of 40 arrived shortly thereafter. They planted a white tent and began cooking.
"We made these plans a while ago," said Berger, a chiropractor from Hawthorne, N.J., "and we weren't breaking plans for nothing."
Such seemed to be the prevailing sentiment among the fans here, many of whom remain without power in their homes or fuel in their gas tanks. Still, they packed MetLife for the first N.F.L. game in battered New Jersey since Hurricane Sandy, and tried to recapture a bit of normalcy despite several obvious differences.

 7:22 P.M. | Despite Personal Toll, a Low Police Absentee Rate 
More than 500 officers in the New York Police Department suffered "catastrophic damage" to their homes due to Hurricane Sandy, Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman said.
Mr. Browne said that the number is based on a preliminary count and is expected to rise as additional commands within the 34,000 member Police Department determine how their officers' fared during the storm.
Despite the personal toll that the storm took on individual officers, the department has found that its men and women were reporting to work last week at an unusually high rate. On Friday, the number of officers who were out sick or taking time off was 72% lower than the same day last year, Mr. Browne said.
"We're seeing a low absentee rate and people reporting to duty despite these catastrophic losses," Mr. Browne said.
The Police Department lost an off-duty officer to the storm: Artur Kasprzak died as he checked on the basement of his house in Staten Island after leading seven relatives upstairs to the safety of the attic.
On Sunday the Police Department's relief and recovery efforts continued. Officers deployed 174 light towers - the same equipment that is used to light up highways for nighttime road work - to neighborhoods still without electricity, Mr. Browne said.
Other storm-specific assignments involved maintaining order at gasoline stations and escorting military vehicles that are distributing food and relief supplies.

 7:21 | Disaster Tourism? 
Two of the city's sightseeing companies were running double-decker buses through the hurricane-stricken streets of lower Manhattan on Sunday night, as tourists bundled up in hats and scarves against the evening chill gawked at the ravages of the storm.
The buses, from CitySights NY and Gray Line New York, were wending their way through the giant, thrumming generators and temporary boilers set up along Water Street and on nearby thoroughfares, through a neighborhood that was starting to smell from the piles of garbage, giant containers of debris and gallons of diesel fuel that have leaked into building basements.
Between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., more than half a dozen of the buses crawled north through the slow-moving traffic on Water Street.
As scores of neighborhood residents hauling wheeled suitcases hailed cabs and walked to the subway, the buses wound their way through an obstacle course of Con Ed workers laboring in the middle of the street under floodlights
Representatives of the companies did not return e-mail messages seeking comment.

 7:17 P.M. | A Storm-Battered Supply Chain Threatens Holiday Shopping 
The economic effects of Hurricane Sandy are reverberating beyond areas hit by the storm as businesses warn customers of delays, try to get merchandise out of closed ports and face canceled orders.
In addition to shutting down shipping terminals and submerging warehouses, the storm also tangled up deliveries due to downed power lines, closed roads and scarce gasoline in parts of New York and New Jersey.
The supply chain is backing up at a crucial time, just as retailers normally bring their final shipments into stores for the holiday shopping season, which retailers depend on for annual profitability.
"Things are slowing down," said Chris Merritt, vice president for retail supply chain solutions at the trucking company Ryder. "This whole part of the supply chain is clogged up."

The minimum occupany rule for motor vehicles driving into Manhattan has been lifted. There is no longer a need to find two extra passengers for the ride over the bridge. You may drive solo if you wish. 
But with mass transit still not fully recovered, and several crossings, including the Holland, Brooklyn Battery and Queens Midtown Tunnels, still closed, traffic is expected to be heavy.

 4:29 P.M. | Request to Allow Donations Through Payrolls 
The American Payroll Association has asked the Internal Revenue Service to allow American employees to donate, through payroll deductions, their vacation and sick pay to organizations assisting with Hurricane Sandy relief efforts.
The I.R.S. has allowed such donations twice before, with special rules adopted under President George W. Bush after 9/11 and then again after Hurricane Katrina. Under these temporary rules, employers contributed money to charitable organizations in exchange for employees forgoing vacation, sick or personal leave time. 
The American Payroll Association, a nonprofit association representing payroll professionals and payroll service providers, said in a letter sent Sunday evening than such rules create a greater tax incentive for employees to donate. 
Normally, donations can be deducted from one's income taxes, but they are still subject to payroll taxes (taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare). Under these special rules, donations would be subject to neither income nor payroll taxes. Instead, employees would transfer some of their salary back to their employer - which could run its own designated Hurricane Sandy relief fund - or to a designated charity like the Red Cross. 
Under this process, employees would never need to take an actual deduction on their income tax return since they never received the income in the first place. They American Payroll Association also suggested that employees be able to donate money from their wages in addition to donating specific leave days, particularly since many workers do not have leave days. 
Under existing tax rules, employees can already give their own sick or vacation days to their coworkers who might have been affected by the hurricane. The employee who is donating does not have to pay income or payroll taxes on the gift, but the leave is subject to both kinds of taxes when received by the employee being gifted the leave. 
The American Payroll Association is asking the I.R.S. to change how these kind of donations are treated as well, so that both the donating and receiving employees are not subject to income and payroll taxes for the donation.

 6:36 P.M. | New Storm May Threaten Power Restoration 
 Just as crews working for Consolidated Edison have reduced the number of the utility's customers without power to fewer than 200,000, the company's officials are warning that another storm is threatening to impede the restoration, and possibly undo some of the work.
 The storm, a northeaster due to hit the region on Wednesday with winds of up to 50 miles per hour, could slow the work that crews are doing to repair overhead lines and may even take down more power poles and lines, said John Miksad, Con Edison's senior vice president for electric operations.
 "The first concern is slowing the army that we've got down; the second is more outages," Mr. Miksad said. "It certainly does complicate the restoration."
 He said that by Sunday evening, the company had restored power to all but 198,000 customers who lost their electricity when Sandy blew through the region on Monday. Of those, the largest number, 86,000, were in Westchester County, he said.
 For the city, he provided this breakdown of the remaining customers without power:
 Queens: 54,000
 Brooklyn: 23,000
 Staten Island: 19,000
 The Bronx: 11,000
 Manhattan: 5,000
 Most of the customers in Manhattan still without power were in buildings that were too flooded or damaged to accept electricity from the company's system, Mr. Miksad said.
 He did, however, say that Con Edison was asking customers in three areas in Lower Manhattan, below the Brooklyn Bridge on the east side and the World Trade Center on the west side, to use as little power as possible on Monday because the networks there were still "compromised."
 Crews were racing to get electricity flowing again to schools and polling places, Mr. Miksad said. But he said that nine schools in the city and six in Westchester County would still be without power on Monday morning.

 6:14 P.M. | N.Y. Lists Relocated Polling Places 
Just as the city Board of Elections has released a guide [pdf] showing where to vote if your polling place was damaged in the storm, so has the state. It is here.
So far, the sites list 72 relocated polling places: 60 in the city, nine in Suffolk County, two in Orange County and one in Rockland County. But the state site does not list Westchester or Nassau County changes, and those counties' board of election sites (here is Westchester's; here is Nassau's) don't either.

 5:52 P.M. | Police Department Is Recovering 
The New York Police Department, even as it stretches itself to the limit to safeguard devastated neighborhoods, maintain order at gas station lines and help storm victims, all while performing its other duties, is gradually rebuilding its operations that were damaged by the storm. 
The department said today that:
*194 police vehicles, including the ones in this video above that were swamped outside a Coney Island headquarters for public housing police, have been replaced. 
*28 police horses have been returned to their stables on the Hudson River in Manhattan and in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn after being evacuated in advance of the storm. "All returned to their stables uninjured and fit for duty, chomping at the bit," the department said.
*The 60th Precinct station house in Coney Island has been completely evacuated, with personnel now operating out of a temporary headquarters vehicle in front of the severely damaged building. Two floors of the station house were flooded, and three walls in the basement collapsed. 
*The 100th Precinct in Rockaway will also require a new boiler, generator, water heater and more general repairs before it is reopened. Personnel there have been relocated to temporary quarters.

 4:45 P.M. | FEMA Offers Temporary Housing Assistance 
The federal government over the weekend stepped up its efforts to help alleviate two of the most pressing problems that have emerged in the aftermath of the storm: a sudden housing crisis and a shortage of gasoline.
W. Craig Fugate, the FEMA director, said in an interview Sunday that the officials were still assessing how many people altogether will need temporary housing.
But as of Sunday at 3 p.m., 182,000 residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have applied for disaster assistance, and a total of $158 million has been approved. Some share of that total will need a temporary place to stay, Mr. Fugate said, adding that he is well aware that there is a shortage of vacant housing in many of the areas hit by the storm, particularly on Long Island.
"This is really going to have to be neighborhood by neighborhood," Mr. Fugate said.
To help, FEMA announced over the weekend that it is offering victims of Hurricane Sandy vouchers good for up to two weeks in a hotel or motel, with the bills to be paid directly by the federal government.
The federal subsidy will cover the room only, not meals or other incidentals. In New Jersey, anyone displaced by the storm whose home is uninhabitable and is approved for coverage by FEMA is eligible, a federal official said Sunday. But in New York, the federal official said, families must apply through an emergency shelter to be eligible for the hotel program, at the request of state officials.
Either way, displaced families must pre-register with FEMA before they check into a hotel, as the agency will use computer databases to confirm that they live in the zone hit by the storm. 
Victims of the storm can register for disaster assistance by calling the agency at 1-800-621-FEMA, visiting one of its registration centers that have been set up in the disaster zones, or by enrolling over the Internet at www.disasterassistance.gov. Mobile phones can also be used to enroll at m.fema.gov.
In cases where families move into temporary apartments, which state and local officials are helping them find, FEMA will in many cases provide rental assistance directly to the families, which will then be responsible for paying the landlords, a federal official said Sunday. This program will last up to 18 months.

 4:52 P.M. | FEMA Expects Improving Fuel Supply 
Though lines for gasoline remain long in New York and New Jersey, "Tomorrow and Tuesday, we will continue to see improvement," W. Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said on Sunday.
The Defense Department, which has been authorized to purchase up to 12 million gallons of gasoline and 10 million gallons of diesel fuel, said it would also supply emergency generators to gas stations that have gas but no electricity to power their pumps.
It was unclear how many stations are in that predicament. Industry officials said the lack of power was the biggest problem at many stations. But in a by the federal Energy Department, no stations reported that problem, though 17 percent did not respond to the survey, some of them perhaps because they lacked power. 
On Sunday, the federal Department of Energy set up a toll free number that gas station owners can call to help them get temporary generators until power is restored.
Mr. Fugate said that with the Port of New York opening late last week to petroleum shipments and various fuel depots and refineries coming back on line, he expects the supply problem to be eliminated soon. But long lines will remain a problem in isolated spots, he said, due to the number of gas stations that remain closed, and also because of excessive purchases by area residents who are filling up tanks even if they are not low.

 4:17 P.M. | 1.85 Million U.S. Homes Still Lack Power After Storm 
Power has now been restored to nearly 80 percent of the 8.5 million homes in 16 states that lost power in last week's storm, the federal government said. But that still leaves more than 1.85 million homes in the dark, nearly a week after Hurricane Sandy struck.
Here are the state-by-state totals as of 3 p.m.:
*New Jersey: 1 million homes without power, down from 2.5 million.
*New York: 655,000 without power, down from 2.3 million.
*Pennsylvania: 78,000, down from 1.2 million.
*Connecticut: 65,000, down from 615,000.
*West Virginia: 42,000, down from 271,000.
*Ohio: 10,000, down from 250,000.
*Maryland: 7,000, down from 290,000.

 3:50 P.M. | N.J. Offers Town-by-Town Guide to When Power May Return 
A town-by-town, day-by-day guide to when power is expected to be restored across New Jersey is now available on a state Web site. 
The status updates, listed by utility under "Utility Restoration Plans" on the state's storm-recovery Web page, list how many homes in a given town are without power and how many are expected to be restored in the coming days.
Some residents are questioning the reliability of the information, though. For instance, Montclair is listed as having all its power back as of yesterday. Sunday evening, there were quite a few Montclair residents in darkened homes who would dispute that assertion.
More than 1 million New Jersey homes remained without power this morning, The Star-Ledger reports, including 493,000 PSE&G customers, 485,000 JCP&L customers, and 10,000 Atlantic City Electric customers. At the height of the power losses, about 2.5 million homes in New Jersey lacked power.

 3:15 P.M. | Gas Flowing In, but Lines Remain Long 
Across the region, gas shortages continued to create long lines at gas stations, further snarling transportation.
At a Sunday morning briefing, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that tankers and barges were on their way to New York area ports carrying fuel to ease the situation. Port Newark-Elizabeth in New Jersey reopened on Sunday. The Inwood terminal and the Northville terminal at Port Jefferson, which funnel fuel to Long Island, are open, and 1.5 million gallons of gasoline are scheduled to be delivered to the Northville terminal today.
 Mr. Cuomo warned against unnecessary driving and gas hoarding, adding that he expected the fuel shortage to continue for several more days. "Now is not the time to be using the car if you don't need to," Mr. Cuomo said. "Now is not the time to be hoarding fuel."
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which has been surveying gasoline availability in the region surrounding New York, estimated on Saturday that 38 percent of gas stations in the area had no gas to sell, down from 67 percent on Friday. Three percent had gas, but no power to pump it.
 Anecdotally, however, the quest for motor fuel continued to be a frustrating one.

 In New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie's rationing system remains in place, gas lines seemed slightly shorter in Essex County, but many stations were still closed. Authorities have set up three fuel depots in New Jersey so that doctors and nurses can get up to 15 gallons of gas to go to work. 
In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Julio Guerrero, 57, a car service driver, waited in line for two hours Sunday to get gas for his brother, who is also a car service driver. The station had a 10-gallon limit, but Mr. Guerrero was planning to fill six 1-gallon containers purchased at Home Depot. His car still had half a tank of gas, which, he said, would see him through the rest of the day.
In New Jersey, some residents adjusted by flouting the state's longstanding law against pumping your own gas. Others drove far from home to places where gas was more plentiful or to counties where the odd-even rationing regime was not in place, The Associated Press reported.
At a Lukoil station in Lakewood, in Ocean County, which is outside the rationing zone, there were no lines early Sunday afternoon, although the station manager, Syed Uddin said customers had waited more than 30 minutes in the morning, according to The A.P.
At one pump, Lew Thompson of Toms River was pumping his own gas into two plastic canisters so he could power his generator.
"Makes it a little quicker," Thompson said of his self-service. "Like the governor said, sometimes you've got to cut through the bureaucracy and get it done."

 "Look in on neighbors who might have a problem with the cold, because the next few days it is going to be cold," Mr. Bloomberg said, before leaving his lectern at City Hall. 
Power is slowly returning to the city, but City Hall officials remain concerned about those colder temperatures, which could pose serious risks for elderly residents in buildings that still do not have heat.

 02:48 PM | Mayor Expects a Rocky Back-to-School 
Mr. Bloomberg is predicting a, well, unpredictable day on Monday as the city's schoolchildren return to classes.
 "Some of the buses were damaged in the storm; some of the bus drivers are new and won't know the routes," the mayor said.
 There are 65 schools that will remain shut, and the mayor encouraged parents to dial 311 to find out if their child's school is affected. (Robocalls will also be made to those families.)
Mayor: To find out info about school locations, go here: schools.nyc.gov/default.htm, call 311 or text NYCSCHOOLS to 877-877.

 And some school buildings may not have heat, or have not been heated for several days. "Please dress your children with that in mind," said the sweater-clad mayor.
Why re-open schools at all? Mr. Bloomberg said it was important for children and parents to try to resume normal routines, and he noted that students have missed a week of classes already.

 02:44 PM | City Giving Out Blankets, Offering Other Aid to Cold Residents 
About 145,000 homes in New York City remain without power, Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 The city is undertaking an all-hands-on-deck effort to help residents without heat as temperatures start to fall. Mr. Bloomberg said that police officers would use loudspeakers to encourage residents to move to a warm place, and distribution centers around the city are handing out bottled water, food, clothing, and blankets.
Mayor: All sites are distributing blankets, and many are distributing batteries and baby supplies now: nyc.gov/html/misc/html
- NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) November 4, 2012
 City workers are also "going door-to-door," Mr. Bloomberg said, to try to help elderly residents in housing complexes.
"Getting floodwater pumped out of housing developments is a crucial task to getting power back on there," the mayor said.

Mayor Bloomberg, who received a cool reception from angry Rockaways residents on Saturday, said he has walked through damaged areas of Staten Island, including Midland Beach, with the borough president, James Molinaro, a state senator, Andrew Lanza, and a city councilman, James Oddo. 
"I went inside a few to see what the basements look like," the mayor said.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has suspended the so-called Blue Laws that require many retail businesses in Bergen County to close on Sundays.
"During this time of recovery and rebuilding, our citizens must have adequate access to the supplies they need to help return their lives to normal - particularly those residents who are still without power," the governor said in a statement today.

 1:40 P.M. | 'Stout' Northeaster May Bring Some Flooding and High Winds 
As the region continues to reel from one unwelcome weather pattern, another looms. 
Even as those left without power or homes by the storm struggle to cope with temperatures that are supposed to drop into the low thirties tonight, as my colleague Michael Schwirtz writes, a "pretty stout nor'easter" is heading this way midweek, said Joey Picca, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
The storm, expected to hit Wednesday night, while nothing like Hurricane Sandy, could bring moderate coastal flooding and is expected to pack an inch or two of rain, as well as sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles an hour, with gusts across parts of coastal Long Island of up to 60 miles an hour.
"That's plenty strong enough that any trees that are hanging weakened by Sandy, power lines, anything like that - these wind gusts could have the potential to take those down and hamper the recovery from Sandy," Mr. Picca said.
The next storm is not expected to bring much relief from the cold. Lows in the upper thirties and highs in the 40s are expected through Thursday. The average low temperature in New York City this time of year is about 45.
In one slightly encouraging note, any flooding from the northeaster will be mitigated by the fact that there is now in a lull in the lunar tidal cycle, between the full and new moons.
On Sunday night, Mr. Picca said, low temperatures could dip into the 20s on Long Island and the Hudson Valley, both areas where many tens of thousands of homes remain without power. Wednesday night's storm could be accompanied by a few snowflakes in the city's northwestern suburbs, he said.

 12:20 P.M. | Dispatches From a Darkened Peninsula 
Power began to return, little by little, to the Rockaways late on Saturday night. But most of the area, an 11-mile-long peninsula attached to southeastern Queens, remained shrouded in darkness. 
Outside a police station house on Beach 94th Street, a dozen or so people gathered around a police generator that offered both street light and a place to charge phones. 
Amanda Victoria, 30, stood by it with one of her daughters, age 11. It's better here, said Ms. Victoria, than inside her home on Beach 99th Street, where it was even colder. "They have Manhattan up and running," she said. "Why can't they help us? There's homes here, too."
Beside her stood Brian Donohue, 26, who lives on the 16th floor of an apartment building on Beach 8th Street with his 81-year-old grandfather and has been carrying water and food up 16 flights since Monday. "I know he can go down the stairs," said Mr. Donohue. "But there's no way he's getting back up."
Shortly after 11 p.m. Zakeem, who gave only his first name, was traveling from Rockaway Beach to Ozone Park, Queens, on a bus driven by a police officer. This is public transportation in the absence of the A train. "See that skyline?" said Zakeem, 22, pointing toward Manhattan. "They have everything. Come to the Rockaways. We have nothing."
One van driver, Lou Luton, took commuters and volunteers from Ozone Park to the Rockaways for $10 each. "My place is washed out completely," he said of his home in Rockaway Beach. "It looks like sand and dirt." He added, "I don't know where to start, how to build back. But God bless, we still got life."
By the generator, several men boarded a police van bound headed northward, away from the disaster and into Ozone Park, where there was electricity and heat. Traveling over the Cross Bay Bridge, they discussed where they might sleep. 
And then, right around the time the van passed the Belt Parkway, lights began to appear: Stoplights shone. Bars lit up. Car dealerships flashed marquees. There was a shoe store and an open Dunkin' Donuts. And then just by the Rockaway Boulevard A train station - which was operational - the police van dropped the exiles from Rockaway Beach back into the rest of New York.

 11:36 A.M. | Trying to Manage a Running Herd of Helpers 
At the same time the New York City Marathon would have started Sunday morning, a ferry filled with volunteers pulled into Staten Island. More than a thousand would-be marathoners were on board. 
People from the Bronx to Norway had gathered to help. Maybe too many people at once, actually.
"The police and other emergency personnel are worried that large groups of people will descend on neighborhoods," one organizer told a group at the bow section of the ferry. "It is really important not to just run out there all together and want to do some good."
That organizer suggested that volunteers form groups of 12 just outside the ferry dock, near the Sept. 11 memorial. The volunteers gathered in groups, depending on how far they wanted to run-six to eight miles, 10 to 14 miles. 
Right away, one large group of several hundred boarded a Staten Island Railway train to more quickly reach the most affected sections of the island. They headed away from the marathon course, with the Manhattan skyline and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge receding into the distance.

 11:25 A.M. | Last Two Bellevue Patients Evacuated 
The were moved out of Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan early Sunday morning by elevator, a spokesman, Ian Michaels, said. The patients were moved as some of the hospital's elevators, which had been flooded by the storm, began operating again. 
Mr. Michaels declined comment on the condition of the patients. But others said that one was a heart patient and the other was a 500- to 600-pound woman, and that they were too sick to be carried down the stairs with hundreds of other patients who had been evacuated after the storm knocked out power at Bellevue, the nation's oldest public hospital.
The hospital, near the East River at 27th Street, had been operating on backup generators until power was restored on Saturday. Officials have estimated that the hospital will not reopen for two to three weeks at best, and Mr. Michaels said Sunday that that estimate remained in effect.

 11:06 AM | Mayor and Governor Disagree on Preventive Measures 
Governor Cuomo has said the state and city should start thinking about barriers and gates in New York harbor that could prevent a storm surge like the one that has caused such destruction.
Mayor Bloomberg has been more skeptical, and, despite sitting several inches away from the governor at Sunday morning's briefing, he had no qualms about expressing his doubts.
 "I don't know that it's practical," the mayor said, suggesting that there were few ways to fully protect Staten Island and the Rockaways from these types of storms. "No strategy that I know of other than not building there."
The mayor and the governor on Sunday offered a study in contrast: Mr. Cuomo wore a blazer, Mr. Bloomberg a sweater. Whereas Mr. Cuomo took pains to end his statements on uplifting notes, speaking about the strength and resilience of New Yorkers, Mr. Bloomberg was his usual candid self, telling suburban residents that it simply takes longer to restore power to overhead lines because of the way the electrical system is designed. (Mr. Cuomo reiterated his displeasure with utilities that were taking a while to bring back power.) 
And Mr. Bloomberg, who can be easily bored, often sat with his head tilted, a hand to his cheek - although perhaps, after more than a week of nonstop briefings and emergency procedures, he is simply showing a few signs of fatigue.

 11:00 A.M. | Runners and Cheers in Central Park, Marathon or No 
The cancellation of the New York City Marathon did not stop hundreds of runners from showing up at Central Park this morning, many celebrating as if the event had not been canceled at all. 
Portable bathrooms, tents and even the famed finish line were still in place and provided a photo opportunity for many runners. 
"We came from Lima, Peru, to run," Gonzalo Larrain, the president and founder of Peru Runners, said Sunday as he and three travel companions posed in front of the statue of Fred Lebow, the founder of the marathon. "We understand why they canceled, but we thought we should come out today. We had no idea there would be so many people here." 
Security guards asked people to clear a path for the hundreds of runners trotting by, many in orange shirts, waving flags of their respective countries and cheering each other on. Some asked for donations for the Red Cross as they jogged by, others noshed Power Bars. It made for a barrage of languages spoken and an assemblage of athletes from grade schoolers to the older adults. Some at the finish line cried. 
Bleachers set up at the finish line hosted hundreds of fans, who clanged cowbells and yelled encouragements to the runners. Most toted their own water bottles and some used pedometers to mark how many laps they needed to complete to hit the 26.2 mile mark.
Greg Osborn, a 62-year-old from Melbourne, Australia, came to the park in his custom-made white and green shirt bearing his name. His wife, Yvonne, came to cheer him on. 
"It took a long time to get here," Yvonne said. "Then we found out it was canceled. But standing out here with the sun and all these people? It's beautiful."

 10: 40 A.M. | Finding Good Neighbors in Wake of Disaster 
LONG BEACH, N.Y. - Veronica McGuire stood shivering in the doorway of her apartment late Saturday night on East Broadway, nearly a week after the Hurricane Sandy pushed up the East Coast. The storm swept Long Beach clear of modern-day amenities, leaving residents to cope in a harsh new environment, Scenes of hardship and emotional strife are now commonplace.
But amid this new landscape, residents said they are increasingly finding that their best and closest resource is each other. "If it were not for my neighbors, I don't think I would have ever made it out of this," Ms. McGuire said from the doorway of a five-family building. 
On the street before her, sirens screeched and lights from service trucks flashed, as they have for the last six days. 
"I'm so nervous and scared, but I see joy in the face of disaster," Ms. McGuire said. "I look at my daughter with my three grandchildren making hopscotch drawings with chalk in the street. That's all the fun they can have right now, but I think you have to find the good things."
Across the street, Patricia Restrepo, 40, a veterinarian, tended to abandoned animals. In her kitchen, she warmed cans of cat food above a candle. "I also use it to heat ravioli," she said with several open cans nearby bearing witness. 
Some residents were shocked by the new look of their coastal city. "It's disgusting," said Michael Parrone, 34, as he walked on Franklin Avenue. "Long Beach was a beautiful town," he said. "Now it looks like a third-world country. It's like literally a war zone." 
"It's just not inhabitable," said Edward Ferra as he shoveled out his garage wearing shorts. "My pants are filthy," he said. "I have no sweats left. I've been working here all week in the dirt, sand, and muck." 
Others maintained a sense of humor as well as hope. 
"We had three feet of water in the house - I literally had fish in my living room," said Steven Harris, 60, a urologist who lives in the canals neighborhood. "What's nice is the gratitude we feel with everyone offering help. My buddy couldn't get a prescription. So I called it in for him at CVS." 
Dr. Harris said he and his wife could not get lodging near J.F.K. because hotels were filled in anticipation of the marathon. "We had to come back here," he said, where the couple was holed up with his two dogs and two cats.
"I had to kick the fish out of the way," he said. "It's terrible but it's funny." Dr. Harris scrambled back to a reporter and with his breathe turning to smoke from the cold said, "I do have a good supply of cigars so I'm lucky."
As residents struggled with packages and emergency vehicles whisked passed him, one man who asked not to be identified handed out bottles of water to passersby from a package he had paid for. Perplexed when asked why, he replied, "I have to help the people, don't I?"

 10:33 AM | 'Massive, Massive Housing Problem' in Public Complexes 
Up to 40,000 residents of public-housing buildings run by the city housing authority are expected to be homeless - their buildings rendered temporarily uninhabitable by the damage from Sandy - and the governor and mayor agree that the re-location process will be a significant challenge. 
"This is going to be a massive, massive housing problem," Mr. Cuomo said. "You are going to need a number of options for a number of situations, short-term and long-term. We'll get through it, but it's a true challenge."
And Mr. Bloomberg compared the situation to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. "I don't know that anybody has ever taken this number of people and found housing for them overnight," the mayor said.

The No. 1 train has been extended south to 14th Street, and transit officials hope to extend the route down to Rector Street by Monday. (The South Ferry station, although dried out, remains unusable for now.) 
Mr. Lhota said that trains would appear at stations less often than on a normal weekday. "We are in uncharted territory here," he said. He suggested that travelers take account of longer travel times. "Leave a little bit earlier, or leave a little bit later," Mr. Lhota said.

Perhaps sensing all the commentary on social media about his sometimes-cool relationship with the governor, Mr. Bloomberg preemptively told reporters that he and Mr. Cuomo have been getting along just fine. 
"Andrew and I aren't working more closely today than we were before, because we've always worked closely together," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
In what could be interpreted as odd praise, the mayor added: "I can't fault anything the state has done. I think they've been very helpful for the city, and we appreciate it." Mr. Cuomo, for his part, warmly thanked the mayor for his remarks.

 10:01 AM | Tomorrow's Commute Forecast: Not Normal 
Commuters should expect a hectic trip to work on Monday, Governor Cuomo said. 
 Although many subway lines in New York City have been restored, "Service will not be normal tomorrow," he said, because of gas shortages increasing subway ridership, and mechanical woes.
 The South Ferry subway station in Lower Manhattan, which had been entirely filled with water after the storm, has been "pumped dry," the governor said.
 The M.T.A. will have to inspect signals and the trackbed in that station before any train service can be restored.
 Mr. Cuomo said he expected the fuel shortage to continue for several more days, before the situation returns to the pre-Sandy normal. "Now is not the time to be using the car, if you don't need to," Mr. Cuomo said. "Now is not the time to be hoarding fuel."

 09:57 AM | Lights Back for 1.4 Million N.Y. Customers, but 730,000 Still Dark 
As of Sunday morning, about 730,000 utility customers in the region still do not have power, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, down from 2.1 million in the hours immediately following the storm.
Long Island remains the hardest hit portion of the region, in terms of electricity: in Suffolk County, 138,000 residents do not have power; in Nassau County, 266,000 people are without power. About 105,000 residents of Westchester County are also waiting for restoration. 
Nearly all of Manhattan, save for 7,000 customers, has had power restored, the governor said. But many New York City residents are still waiting for Consolidated Edison to make repairs: 86,000 in Queens; 20,000 in Brooklyn; 12,000 in the Bronx; and 20,000 in Staten Island.
 "Until you have your power on, the problem isn't resolved," Mr. Cuomo said.

By 8 a.m. Sunday, Richard Zeroth of Brooklyn had gathered about two dozen runners at Grand Army Plaza. His wife, Sarah, was bundled up in a knit hat and jacket, brandishing a cardboard sign that read "Make your own marathon" in red letters. She had commandeered a cart with bananas, bottled water and solicitations for Red Cross donations. The group had raised slightly more than $7,000 so far. 
The plan, Mr. Zeroth told the group, as a normal smattering of dog walkers and casual joggers looped the park, was to run 7.7 laps around the park, roughly the equivalent of the marathon's 26.2 miles. 
"There will be cute old couples on the path," he cautioned, "So please be respectful. We've already had one marathon canceled." 
The groups's coach, Anthony Henriques, said that while running this Sunday at their normal training venue was not his original plan, he understood the decision. "It's heartbreaking," Mr. Henriques said. "But I'm glad we can raise money for charity." 
With a countdown and cheers from a smattering of onlookers, by 8:10, the group was off, and running.

On Sunday morning, runners dressed in orange New York Marathon gear overtook the Staten Island Ferry as they headed to the storm-ravaged borough looking to help.
They packed blankets, food, water, and flashlights in shoulder bags. Some planned to run to battered areas once the ferry docked.
"There are people suffering of Staten Island and we've got to so something about it," said Neil Cohen, 42 from Riverdale in the Bronx.
Cohen, whose mother and uncle are from Staten Island, had planned to run the marathon today, starting on the island. Instead, he was heading there with groceries, water and candy for the kids (and not energy bars)
Lots of it.
"I figured a lot of kids missed out on Halloween, so I brought a lot of candy with me," he said.

 8:32 A.M. | Power Being Restored in Rockaways 
The lights are coming back on in the Rockaways.
Some power to the peninsula was restored last night, and the rest should be fully restored by the end of the week, the Long Island Power Authority said this morning.
The utility has been a punching bag for elected officials lately for its response to the storm in the Rockaways, the peninsula in Queens that was devastated by the storm. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that LIPA " has not acted aggressively enough" or offered a timetable for power restorations and suggested it could be as long as two weeks before power was restored. The Nassau County executive, Edward P. Mangano, called the utility's lack of communication with customers "." And the Queens borough president, Helen Marshall, said she had been told by LIPA that it wouldtake seven weeks to restore power to the peninsula.
But speaking on 1010 WINS radio this morning, the utility's chief operating officer, Michael D. Hervey defended its efforts and said that power was being restored in the Rockaways "incrementally throughout the week" with a goal of full restoration by week's end. 
"It will definitely be no type of multiple weeks," Mr. Hevery said. "Lights started going on last night."
On Long Island, Mr. Hervey said, he expected 90 percent of customers to have their power back "by the end of the day Wednesday."
Mr. Hervey declined to strike back at his critics. 
"We're focusing on restoring the power," he said, "not focusing on trying to trade barbs."

As Hurricane Sandy churned toward the East Coast, many couples putting the finishing touches on their weddings suddenly became all too aware that natural disasters do not respect a date circled on a calendar any more than they do electrical grids, transportation systems, homes, cherished possessions or even lives.
Meticulously detailed plans had to be scrapped immediately, revised and sometimes revised again. Improvisation ruled. Some receptions or religious ceremonies were postponed; others were moved (one of them hundreds of miles); presents were destroyed; and many, many names had to be crossed off guest lists. Yet in the end, the most common emotions expressed among brides and grooms were relief and gratitude that they and those they cared about had survived an ordeal that just a week earlier had seemed unimaginable.

 11:38 P.M. | Evoking 18th-Century Drama, Bounty Finds Storm Tragedy 
A fateful meeting of the maritime past and present began amid the Monday morning dread of Hurricane Sandy, when distressing word came from the murk of the roiling Atlantic: the captain and crew of the H.M.S. Bounty, a vessel of timber rigged to evoke 18th-century adventure, were abandoning ship.
Before long, a Coast Guard helicopter equipped with 21st-century search and rescue technology was hovering in the predawn dimness over a choppy disaster site, some 90 miles from shore. A life raft here. A life raft there. A man in a survival suit, floating like a red starfish. And the 115-foot main mast, jutting from the mostly submerged Bounty.
As the helicopter descended to begin its mission, its four-person crew could see the 30-foot waves of the coffee-black sea coming from all directions. "Like a washing machine," recalled Randy Haba, 33, a Coast Guard rescue swimmer who grew up in a farming community outside landlocked Denver, and whose job was to leap into that rinse-cycle turbulence.

 11:24 P.M. | For Fans, Debut Is More of an Escape Than a Celebration 
The chance for an idyllic debut for the Nets in Brooklyn had left with the storm clouds, chased away at a time when the city needed many things, but not yet basketball.
Saturday's consolation opener against the Toronto Raptors was never going to be the same. Too many pockets of the region were dotted with devastation. Too many lines of the transit network remained quiet. Too much Andrea Bargnani, not enough Carmelo Anthony.
Even the most irrepressible cheerleader, the Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz, acknowledged that the Nets' season-opening game would not, and should not, unfurl as the party he had once hoped it would be, before the lingering effects of Hurricane Sandy led to the postponement of Thursday's game against the Knicks.
"You can't just party away and ignore how many people are suffering," Markowitz said. "How much sweeter it would have been if everyone in the borough were living the lives they were living before the storm."
And so it was that the return of professional sports to Brooklyn, a moment more than a half-century in the making, arrived Saturday with something more than a thud and as something less than a celebration.

 11:09 P.M. | Burglary Arrests on Staten Island 
Crime during Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath declined in New York City by 32 percent compared with the previous year, the police said on Saturday, but even the storm's fury did not stop some from trying to take advantage of the confusion and chaos that followed. 
In the Midland Beach section of Staten Island Saturday morning, a man dressed in a Red Cross jacket was caught checking the front doors of unoccupied houses, the police said in a statement. The police arrested the man and charged him with burglary. 
Nearby, police arrested three people who were observed "auto surfing," checking car doors to see whether they were unlocked. Police said the two men and a woman were in possession of stolen property, including keys to a Mercedes Benz that they may have been planning to steal. 
Burglary, the police said, is the only type of crime to have risen in the last week, up 3 percent from Monday through Friday compared with the same period last year. 
Thousands of police have been deployed to patrol the areas of the city left darkened and destroyed by the storm. Many officers are on extended tours, doing duties outside their normal beats to help with the recovery. They have been deployed to maintain order at gasoline stations and to distribute portable street lights to areas without power. With traffic lights out across the city, 500 police academy recruits have stepped in to direct cars. And 100 New York Police Department retirees have been mobilized to distribute food and do other storm-related tasks.

 9:50 P.M. | New Jersey Residents Will Be Allowed to Vote by E-mail 
New Jersey residents who have been displaced by Hurricane Sandy will be able to vote in the election on Tuesday through e-mail or fax, the administration of Gov. Chris Christie announced on Saturday.
The New Jersey Department of State has instructed county clerks to accept applications for mail-in ballots via e-mail or fax until 5 p.m. Tuesday, and to provide mail-in ballots the same way. Voters will then have until 8 p.m. on Tuesday - when polling places close in New Jersey - to submit their ballots via e-mail or fax.
A list of county clerks is available on the Web site for the New Jersey Department of State. The Christie administration also said that any voter displaced by the storm would also be allowed to cast a provisional ballot in person on Tuesday in a county other than the one in which he or she is registered to vote.

 9:19 P.M. | Living on the Waterfront 
The Times's Real Estate and Metropolitan sections look at how the storm will affect the future of living along the waterfront.
 Real Estate If Tropical Storm Irene last year was an eye-opener,Hurricane Sandy was a reality check.
Waterfront property in the New York area is some of the most coveted in the nation, but after back-to-back years of supposedly once-in-a-generation storms, public officials, developers, brokers and homeowners are being forced to re-evaluate.
Although real estate experts say property values are unlikely to suffer in the long term, it is possible that new zoning and planning regulations - and buyers' expectations - could reshape how residential housing along the water is built, marketed and sold. Read more here.

 8:19 P.M. | No Marathon Means No Prize Money 
Tens of thousands of weekend warriors will return to their day jobs, having lost only travel costs and entry fees with the cancellation of the New York City Marathon. But contenders missed a chance to earn what amounted to half a year's salary.
A number of elite runners said they understood why the marathon was called off, given the public outcry against using essential services to monitor a race while many in the region are struggling to recover from Hurricane Sandy. Still, cancellation brought a significant shortfall to the best runners in the field. Read more here.

 8:09 P.M. | Connecticut Ready for Elections, Governor Says 
The fallout from Hurricane Sandy is certain to complicate voting on Tuesday in some parts of New York and New Jersey, but Connecticut appears to be in better shape. At a news briefing in Bridgeport on Saturday afternoon, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said the state was moving to hook up generators at a small number of polling places that remained without power. But he said the generators were being installed only as an insurance policy of sorts. "I believe that all of the polling places will be open on Tuesday with regular current," Mr. Malloy said.

 6:53 P.M. | Some Power Restored, but Much Left to Do 
Out of the nearly one million Consolidated Edison customers who lost electricity during Hurricane Sandy, 670,000 have had power restored, John Miksad, the company's senior vice president for electric operations, said in a teleconference on Saturday evening.
About 270,000 customers were still without power, as many as had lost electricity during Hurricane Irene last year, he said. About 40 schools and 70 polling places remained in the dark.
"We still have in front of us another hurricane's worth to restore," Mr. Miksad said. "We are not done by any stretch of the imagination and will be at it for a very long time."
He said the electricity networks for those with restored power were still "precarious" given the current lack of redundancy in both distribution and transmission.

 6:46 | Volunteers Descend on Staten Island Neighborhood 
Since Tuesday, residents of storm-ravaged neighborhoods on Staten Island's eastern shore have been hauling debris from their homes and assessing how much Hurricane Sandy had altered their lives. Some families have worked alone, others with the help of a few neighbors, friends or relatives.
But on Saturday, hundreds of people from around the city and region poured into these beleaguered neighborhoods, offering a hand to strangers in need.
By late morning, the narrow lanes of Midland Beach, one of the most affected areas on Staten Island, were buzzing with activity. Groups of volunteers carrying hoes, rakes, brooms and shovels went door to door offering their labor. Others circled the blocks in pickup trucks full of food, blankets, clothes and cleaning supplies. Impromptu distribution centers piled high with food and secondhand clothes sprung up on every other corner.
"Anybody need anything?" a man shouted from a truck to a group cleaning out a house on Olympia Boulevard. A few minutes later, two women pulling rolling suitcases paused in front of the same house. "Need anything?" one said. "Toiletries?"
There appeared to be more volunteers offering help than residents who actually needed it.
At a house on Hunter Avenue, Alfredo Zapata, 60, his wife, Beatriz, 47, were cleaning out the remains of their battered bungalow when a small group of strangers showed up and asked if they needed a hand.
One of the volunteers, Katie Nguyen, 32, an employee at an investment bank, said they were among about a dozen friends who had traveled together from Manhattan that morning to help out. They had brought food and clothes to donate.
"I've never been to Staten Island," Ms. Nguyen said.
But they said volunteering their services and making donations had been more difficult than they had anticipated.
One of the volunteers, Samuel Palmer, 31, said that earlier in the week he had helped rally a group of friends and colleagues for a mission to Staten Island.
"I spent two days online trying to figure out where to bring all the people who wanted to help," said Mr. Palmer, a management consultant. Unable to find a single point of coordination, he said, the group decided to simply go to the borough and figure out once they got there how they could be most helpful.
Once on Staten Island, however, they visited an American Red Cross distribution center near Midland Beach, but coordinators turned the group away, saying they did not need any more donations. The group then stopped by a Federal Emergency Management Agency command center but got little guidance from the authorities there, Mr. Palmer said.
So the volunteers decided to break up into small groups and head out into the neighborhood to see how they could be of service.
Mr. Zapata had a rental apartment behind his house still crammed with furniture and belongings destroyed by the storm, and the group slipped on rubber gloves, strapped on dust masks and got to work.

 5:47 | Bloomberg Chastises Long Island Power Authority 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg blasted the Long Island Power Authority, which provides power the Rockaways in Queens, saying the utility has not worked hard enough to restore power in the neighborhood, which was among the hardest hit by Hurricane Sandy.
He said the utility could not give him a timetable for when power would be restored there and suggested it could be as long as two weeks.
"In our view, L.I.P.A. has not acted aggressively enough," Mr. Bloomberg said. "When it comes to prioritizing resources, we think they should be first in line," he said of the Rockaways.
With the weather getting colder, Mr. Bloomberg said the situation for many was growing more precarious, and he urged people to go to city shelters if they needed.
"The cold really is something that is dangerous," the mayor said. "If you find yourself shivering uncontrollably, these are the signs of hypothermia."
Earlier in the day, when visiting the Rockaways, Mr. Bloomberg was confronted by angry residents who said they felt forgotten. In his remarks Saturday, Mr. Bloomberg did all he could to reassure them that was not the case.

 4:53 | Bellevue Down to Last Two Patients 
Two patients remained in the evacuated Bellevue Hospital Center on Saturday afternoon because they were too sick to be carried down the stairs, according to several people familiar with the East Side hospital.
One of the patients was a woman who weighed 500 to 600 pounds, and the other was a man who was scheduled to have open heart surgery via emergency generator, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Bellevue employees had received an e-mail threatening them with dismissal if they spoke to the news media.
Ian Michaels, a spokesman for Bellevue, said power had been restored to the hospital, at First Avenue and 27th Street, on Saturday, as it was to much of Lower Manhattan. He added that officials hoped to transfer out the last two patients as soon as the elevators, which had been flooded, were back in service. But he declined to say anything about the patients or their condition.
The sources also said that after Hurricane Sandy hit, the Bellevue morgue was under water, so the bodies of patients who died of their illnesses after the storm had to be kept elsewhere. Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner, confirmed that the Bellevue morgue had been flooded, but that with the assistance of the medical examiner, the bodies had been put on higher racks to keep them out of the water.
She did not know how many bodies there were. Ms. Borakove said the medical examiner's morgue, which is separate, remained dry.
On the night of the storm, Bellevue, which housed 725 patients, lost power and went on backup generators. But within a short time, the basement flooded, the fuel pumps feeding the generators failed and elevator shafts flooded.

 3:25 | On Second Thought, No Free Gas 
The plan for the military to distribute free fuel to the public in New York was put off after the swarms of people that showed up for gasoline proved overwhelming.
"We have asked the general public to no longer come to these distribution centers," said Eric Durr, the director of public affairs for the New York Division of Military and Naval Affairs.
At a news conference on Saturday morning, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that four mobile distribution stations would be established in four spots around the city. Under the plan, each motorist could receive up to 10 free gallons of gasoline. But not long after that, the location in Queens was swamped by motorists.
As a result, Mr. Durr said, the decision was made to provide fuel only for emergency workers. He said that with 28 million gallons of gas on its way to the state, as the governor had announced, there soon will not be a need for the emergency fuel.
It is also a cumbersome process to pump.
The way it works, Mr. Durr said, is that at each site there are two trucks - one that holds 8,000 gallons and another that holds 2,800. The smaller truck distributes gas to vehicles and when it runs dry, it needs to be refueled by the bigger truck.

 3:01 pm | Christie Not Sure How Long Gas Rationing Will Last 
Gov. Chris Christie said that he could not estimate how long New Jersey's gas rationing system would have to remain in place, adding that the biggest problem for the state's gas stations was power even more than supply at this point.
In northern New Jersey, Mr. Christie said, many of the stations do not have the ability to be connected to generators, something the governor said he was unaware of until the storm hit.
"In New Jersey, no one had a complete list of all the gas stations," he said. "You can bet we are going to have one now."
Stations that can get power from a generator, Mr. Christie said, have been hooked up by the National Guard.
He defended the decision to ration gas with the odd-even system.
"I wanted to see if this could resolve itself without the odd-even system," he said. But as he toured the state and saw the lines snaking for miles, he decided that he had to take extraordinary measures.
The state will also receive 11 million gallons of gas from the military but instead of setting up distribution centers, as New York is doing, he said the plan was to deliver gas to the distributors.
Mr. Christie also offered an update on the progress restoring power.
"There are now 1.2 million people without power," he said. That is down from 2.7 million immediately after the storm hit.
He said more workers continue to come into the state and soon there would be 11,000 people working to "get done what they need to get done."

 1:02 p.m. | A Letter From the Gas Station Line 
I live on Staten Island and have been trying to help my neighbors as best I can. But I cannot continue to do that on an empty gas tank.
So I'm waiting in line at the Hess station at New Dorp Lane and Hylan Boulevard.
Though Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other state officials have made assurances that relief is on the way, my needle is hovering a hair above a quarter tank now, and the gas station isn't even in my view. According to Google Maps, I'm exactly a half mile away.
Tensions are high. As I wait, I can see volunteers walking with water to a devastated area a few blocks away. The past few days, all you hear are sirens and helicopters, and it makes you feel even more nervous about being trapped without transportation.
Like the guy I heard about who waited for five blocks at a BP station in Grasmere. He was right at the entrance of the station when it ran out of gas - and so did his car.
"When we sold out at 3 a.m., one guy was screaming because his car died," Nori Levy, a mechanic at the BP gas station told me. "They had to tow it away."
That could have easily been me. Just before midnight on Friday, I received word that a station had just gotten a delivery. I jumped in the car and raced there. Mine was one of the few cars turned away at 3:30 a.m. They had just sold out, and I had wasted gas sitting there, waiting.
These gas lines have become a familiar sight on Staten Island, and the amount of gas left in your car is among the first questions asked of strangers after, "Are you O.K.?"
At a Getty station in Grant City, just a few blocks from my apartment, people were lined up every day after the storm, snarling traffic along Richmond Road. But I didn't understand why those people were waiting.
Orange tape was strung across the pumps. A cardboard sign read: "We are closed. Out of gas."
"We're just standing on line with the promise of gas," a customer named Greg Ferraioli told me earlier in the week.
He had arrived at the station at 5 a.m. on Thursday with his Ford F-150. "I'm on E, so I'm prepared to wait all night."
The station's owner, Nino Cutillo, said a delivery was expected soon, but hours later, nothing had arrived - not even an update on when a fresh supply would come.
"We will get gas sometime this afternoon," is all he could offer. I called the station back at 9 p.m. that day. "No, no gas," Mr. Cutillo said.

 12:56 a.m. | As Gas Rationing Begins, Confusion Reigns 
At an Exxon station in Bayonne, N.J., police officers and people waiting in line for gasoline argued over the meaning of Gov. Chris Christie's new policy regarding gas rationing.
The police had been given an interpretation of the policy that read: "If your vehicle's license plate ends in a letter (A,B,C...), you are only permitted to fuel the vehicle on odd-numbered days." 
The problem: All license plates in New Jersey end in letters, except for vanity plates. So on Saturday, most everyone in the state could buy gas. Or so it seemed. But according to the actual state policy, the last number on a plate is supposed to determine odd or even status, not the letter.
 Correction: A previous version of this post contained a misinterpretation of the New Jersey rationing policy. The Bayonne police were using a summary of the policy that said the days motorists could get gas was based on the last letter of their license plate. Actually, the days are determined by the last number on the license plate, not the last letter. A previous correction also referred erroneously to the summary. The police were quoting that, not state policy.

 12:08 p.m. | Costs of Canceling Marathon Are Unknown but Immense 
The finish line for the 43rd New York City Marathon stood silent in the stillness of Central Park on Friday night, its signs listing the sponsors of a race that had been canceled hours earlier. The statue of Fred Lebow, the race's founder, overlooked the empty scene.
"Few things in life match the thrill of a marathon," read a quotation from Lebow, placed beneath his statue.
Few things in New York life, however, have matched the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. And no matter how the city's officials and marathon organizers tried to soften its impact to preserve this year's 26.2-mile race through five boroughs, its end came abruptly Friday.
Earlier last week, in the face of mounting criticism, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood firm in his defense of the marathon, saying it would lift the city's spirits and fill its coffers. Mary Wittenberg, the president and chief executive of New York Road Runners, the organization that directs the race, championed the event as a symbol of resilience.
Now the city, along with Road Runners, will be forced to reckon with significant losses, ones officials could not even begin to calculate in light of the natural disaster. Read More

The list, available on the parks department's Web site, included Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan and Kissena Park in Queens. 
All city beaches and boardwalks remained closed, and even in parks that were open, some parts were still off limits, a department spokeswoman said.

Before dawn, the runners were circling Central Park in throngs.
As 8 a.m. approached, the time many parks across the city were supposed to reopen, the runners were joined by throngs of dog walkers, weekend strollers and tourists. Everybody itching to get back into the place that is for many, the heart of Manhattan.
"The people have been coming all morning, asking if they can get in," said Rich Brown, who has been working security at a gate at Columbus Circle. "I have to tell them they can't go, that the police may arrest them."
It will be nice, he said, not to have to do that any more.
"I grew up in Manhattan. I love Central Park," he said. "If Central Park were not here, the city would be more crazy than it is."

At 6:30 on Saturday morning in Union Square, a staging area for utility workers after the storm, the air thrummed with idling engines and the whoosh of an occasional bus. Electricity had been restored to the area on Friday evening.
Ralph Godbee, 60, a security guard from Georgia Power, was looking forward to a coffee from McDonald's, the first restaurant to open, just before dawn, since the storm knocked out power. He spent the night patrolling the square but said he spent most of his time answering questions about when the electricity would be restored.
"People have been real friendly," he said. " They write 'welcome Georgia Power.' And 'please turn our lights on' with a picture of a bulb. It's like getting a thank-you note."
As the neighborhood was beginning to get back to normal, the farmers' market, a fixture at Union Square since the 1970s, prepared for its first day of business since the storm in a new, temporary location: Madison Square Park.

 12:33 A.M. | Songs of Sympathy and Local Affirmation 
On Friday night, NBC presented an hourlong telethon, "Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together," to raise money for the American Red Cross. It was just four days after the storm made landfall in New Jersey on a course that would smash coastal and riverside neighborhoods all the way up to Rhode Island. "One of the great ironies of this telethon is that the people who need the help most can't watch it," said the host, Matt Lauer. "They don't have power."
Many of the musicians came from places affected by the storm: Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi from New Jersey, Billy Joel from Long Island and Christina Aguilera and Mary J. Blige from New York City, along with an Englishman, Sting, and three members of Aerosmith, from Boston.
Between the songs were calls for donations, affirmations of Jersey roots - from Jon Stewart, Brian Williams and Danny DeVito - and news montages of destruction and desperation: surging waters, demolished carnival rides, tearful families sorting through the wreckage of destroyed homes.

The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy is threatening to create Election Day chaos in some storm-racked sections of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut - and some effects may also be felt in other states, including Pennsylvania, where some polling sites still lacked power on Friday morning.
Disrupted postal delivery will probably slow the return of absentee ballots. And with some polling sites likely to be moved, elections officials were bracing for a big influx of provisional paper ballots - which could delay the vote count in places. Read more here.

 11:12 P.M. | For Some After the Storm, No Work Means No Pay 
While salaried employees worked if they could, often from home after Hurricane Sandy, many of the poorest New Yorkers faced the prospect of losing days, even a crucial week, of pay on top of the economic ground they have lost since the recession.
Low-wage workers, more likely to be paid hourly and work at the whim of their employers, have fared worse in the recovery than those at the top of the income scale - in New York City the bottom 20 percent lost $463 in annual income from 2010 to 2011, in contrast to a gain of almost $2,000 for the top quintile. And there are an increasing number of part-time and hourly workers, the type that safety net programs like unemployment are not designed to serve. Since 2009, when the recovery began, 86 percent of the jobs added nationally have been hourly. Over all, about 60 percent of the nation's jobs are hourly.
Even as the sluggish economy has accentuated this divide, Hurricane Sandy has acted as a further wedge, threatening to take a far greater toll on the have-littles who live from paycheck to paycheck. Read more here.

 10:51 | Survey Finds No Gas at Two-Thirds of Stations in Region 
A government survey has found that roughly two-thirds of the gasoline stations in the New York metropolitan region do not have fuel to sell.
With gas lines stretching for hours, frustrated commuters often searching for open stations in vain and little reliable information about where gas can be found, the U.S. Energy Information Administration began conducting a survey of supply conditions on Friday.
Its first report was not good.
"Of the stations sampled, one-third had gasoline available for sale, 3 percent were not selling gasoline because they had no power, 10 percent had power but no gasoline supplies, and 53 percent did not respond to attempts to contact them," the agency said.
The full survey can be found here.

 10:42 | As Power Is Restored for Some, Others Face Grim Outlook 
Four dark days after Hurricane Sandy blew through the New York region, residents and businesses in the lower end of Manhattan began to get power back on Friday, starting to unite a borough that had been divided between the light and the darkness.
As lampposts, streetlights and storefronts flickered to life, cheers could be heard across whole neighborhoods.
"The first thing we did was the coffee machine," said Ali Salah, 40, who works at his family's deli Chelsea. "Then we plugged in our phones."
This past week, he said, it did not feel like he was living in New York City, but rather it was more like a small town in his native Yemen.
But when the lights came back on, he could barely contain his joy.
"Today is like New Year's," he said. "Like a new holiday."
Of course, hundreds of thousands of people in the region remained without power. And as temperatures dropped Friday night, anger mounted.
In other boroughs and in the suburbs, the prognosis for full restoration was grimmer. In many parts of the region, utility companies forecast that people might be without power until the middle of November.
In Lower Manhattan, the power restoration started around 5 p.m. in the East Village. The network in the East Village, known as Cooper Square, serves about 67,000 customers between 14th and Canal Streets. The Chelsea neighborhood sparked to life about 45 minutes later, bringing back power to an additional 25,000 customers between 14th and 31st Streets on the West Side.
The next big network came back to life around 7:30 p.m., when 30,000 customers east of Fifth Avenue between 14th and 31st Streets were once again able to turn their lights on.
Throughout the night, Consolidated Edison's crews raced to make good on a promise that company executives made to restore power to all of Manhattan before Saturday. As each network came online, they got a bit closer to getting power back to all 220,000 people below 39th Street who lost it.
Outside Manhattan, the challenges were in some ways more difficult, with crews having to contend with thousands of lines that were mangled, damaged or ripped down in Monday's hurricane. Con Ed said it could take until mid-November to bring electricity back to all of its customers. In Westchester County, where 120,000 people have no power, the utility said navigating downed trees and dealing with connections cut off by limbs and branches was simply going to take more time. On Long Island, more than 500,000 customers of the Long Island Power Authority still had no power on Friday evening, or any estimate of when it would return.
In New Jersey, Public Service Electric and Gas had restored power to over a million customers by Friday morning, but nearly 600,000 still had no electricity by night. In Newark, about 100,000 customers had service restored at around 9:45 p.m., according the Mayor Corey Booker.
Jersey Central Power and Light had over 685,000 customers without power on Friday night.
In Connecticut, repairs were moving quickly. Only about 140,000 customers of Connecticut Light and Power still had no electricity.

 10:05 P.M. | A Rise in Burglary Reports Follows Storm 
On the night that Hurricane Sandy hit New York, burglars broke into Kixclusive, a shoe store on the Lower East Side where rare pairs of basketball shoes are priced as high as $1,400. The proprietor told the police that 30 pairs of sneakers were stolen, saying the shoes were worth $30,000 in all, according to the police.
The storefront, on Mulberry Street, was quickly boarded up with plywood. Then on Wednesday, an alert police officer, Charles Hofstetter, spied four men moving aside the plywood and entering the store.
All four were arrested on charges of burglary.
Across the city, there have been reports of looting since the storm hit, leading to a 7 percent rise in burglary complaints from Monday through Thursday, compared with the same period last year. Over all, reported crime is down, although some police officials caution that a full accounting is not yet possible.

 9:44 P.M. | New South Ferry Subway Station Still Deep Under Water 
It was one of the subway system's glistening jewels, the modern descendant of a century-old hub greeting New Yorkers at the tip of Lower Manhattan.
But on Friday, the South Ferry station was navigable only by flashlight. Sea grass wrapped around a telephone cord, connected to a worker's booth.
Wooden boards as long as 15 feet, some still bundled together by black wire, lay scattered across the mezzanine. No one is sure where they came from.
Chunks of a concrete wall had floated some 150 feet, through a turnstile, it seemed, around a corner, and down a flight of stairs funneling toward the platform for the No. 1 train.
As the Metropolitan Transportation Authority scrambles to get much of its system back to work, there are few dots on the subway map more wounded than this one. Earlier in the week, Joseph J. Lhota, the authority's chairman, said that water was "literally up to the ceiling" at the station, which is connected to the R train station at Whitehall Street.
On Friday, 20 to 25 feet of water remained above track level, said Frank Jezycki, the authority's chief infrastructure officer for subways, as he led a small tour. The surface of the pools sloshed about four steps up at the higher of two staircases leading down to the platform.
"We don't know what's downstairs yet," Mr. Jezycki said.

 9:33 P.M. | In New York's Public Housing, Fear Creeps in With the Dark 
Perhaps more so than in any other place in the city, the loss of power for people living in public housing projects forced a return to a primal existence. Opened fire hydrants became community wells. Sleep-and-wake cycles were timed to sunsets and sunrises. People huddled for warmth around lighted gas stoves as if they were roaring fires. Darkness became menacing, a thing to be feared.
A lack of friends or family in areas with power, or cars or cab fare to get to them, meant there were few ways to escape. Dwindling dollars heightened the pain of throwing out food rotting inside powerless refrigerators, and sharpened the question of where the next meal would come from. Some had not left their apartments since the storm swept in.
"Where am I going to go?" said Miguelina Newsam, 71, who subsists on food stamps and $661 in monthly Social Security payments, outside her building in Red Hook, Brooklyn. "My son is on Staten Island and they have the same problem."
Thousands of public housing residents in New York City defied evacuation orders because they underestimated the ferocity of Hurricane Sandy; now they make up a city within a city, marked by acute need. Read more here.

 8:53 P.M. | Anger Grows at Response by Red Cross 
The American Red Cross struggled on Friday to reassure beleaguered New York City residents that its disaster-relief efforts were at last getting up to speed, after the agency's delayed arrival in devastated areas of Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens drew intense criticism.
As of Friday, the Red Cross said, 25 of its emergency response vehicles - retrofitted ambulances each carrying 2,000 pounds of water, meals and snacks - had begun making their way through the hardest hit parts of the five boroughs. More were on the way, the agency promised.
The Red Cross had not yet opened the three temporary mobile kitchens that it announced on Thursday would be set up on Staten Island, in Riis Park in the Rockaways, and at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, the agency confirmed. The kitchens, which can produce 10,000 meals a day, would begin operating by Saturday, it said. Read more here.

The return of power to apartment buildings in New York was greeted with cheers in many parts of the city, according to multiple reports from witnesses on social networks.
Out-of-towners from Pat Robertson's Christian relief group, Operation Blessing, captured some of the rejoicing on video after initially guessing that the sound of loud screaming from a housing project on the Lower East Side "might be a riot."

 8:10 P.M. | Lights Go On, and New Yorkers Learn a Geography of Power 
As Consolidated Edison restored power to several parts of all five boroughs of New York on Friday, residents of Manhattan neighborhoods that emerged from the dark suddenly learned the names of the various networks beneath the city streets they usually take for granted.
In a series of Twitter updates, the @ConEdison feed announced that power was back on in the Cooper Square network, the Chelsea network, the City Hall network and the Madison Square network. In response to questions from customers, the company explained the boundaries of those neighborhoods in terms of power lines.

The New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects has reached out to its members to recruit registered architects and professional engineers to help in the daunting challenge of evaluating damage to 35,000 buildings affected by the storm. The chapter is looking both for those who are already certified in damage assessment and for those interested in receiving necessary training through the city Department of Buildings. They are asked to contact the chapter, with their A.I.A. member number, at dfrr@aiany.org. (The e-mail address stands for "design for risk and reconstruction.")

 6:46 P.M. | New York Health Department Guidance on Returning Home 
As power starts to return for thousands of New Yorkers, the city's health department issued safety guidelines that it hopes will help residents avoid problems.
"When reoccupying a building that lost water due to the power outage, residents and occupants should let their water run until it is cold and clear," the department said. "In buildings where water tanks were depleted, owners have been directed to flush them before resuming water supply to the building."
The department said people should throw away any perishable food (such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, mayonnaise or leftovers) that has been above 41 degrees Fahrenheit for four hours or more.
People should also throw away any food (including packaged food) that was touched by flood water.
"Given that many residents have been without power since Sunday or Monday, we recommend that all perishable food be thrown away - whether it was in your refrigerator or freezer," the department said.
- Marc Santora 
 6:57 pm | Helping Out Neighbors Without Water in West Chelsea 
When the power went out downtown because of Hurricane Sandy, Andy Humm, a former human rights commissioner in the Dinkins administration, learned a curious thing: The water in New York City buildings naturally rises to a certain level, often six stories, without being pumped.
Pressure from the city's upstate water supply pushes water up a few floors, but for higher floors, buildings rely on the ubiquitous rooftop towers to gravity-feed sinks, toilets and showers. But without electricity, water could not be pumped up to the towers.
Mr. Humm had working sinks and toilets in his fourth-floor apartment at London Terrace, the huge, now-fashionable apartment complex in West Chelsea. But many of his neighbors did not.
So Mr. Humm, a reporter on gay and civil rights issues and an activist by nature, went on a crusade to open up a lower-floor bathroom to be used by higher-floor tenants, particularly the elderly.
"If you're above the sixth floor, the toilets don't flush," Mr. Humm said. "Yes, people were advised to fill your tubs, but this has been going on for days."
By his own account, he began pestering Ellen Gribben Bornet, general manager of Rose Associates, the management company for 1,000 apartments, to provide this public service.
"I'm still working to see if it's logistically feasible," Ms. Bornet said Friday afternoon. "It may be a moot point as Con Ed is advising that we will have power tonight."
When she did not immediately come through, Mr. Humm called the city's Office of Emergency Management, which told him where he could buy some portable toilets.
"I said, 'Me?'" he recalled, noting that he could hardly afford it.
In desperation, he called the district office for Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, who represents the area.
At about 4 p.m. Friday, Mr. Humm got a call to go downstairs and receive 20 Porta Potties, courtesy of Ms. Quinn, who lived in London Terrace until last year.
Jamie McShane, a spokesman for Ms. Quinn, reached as he rode his bike home Friday evening from City Hall to Sunnyside, Queens, said he did not know how the speaker intended to pay for the portable toilets, or whether she had arranged for other constituents to have them as well. "Listen, I think she was glad to be able to be responsive to the concerns and needs of the tenants association," he said. (After checking, Mr. McShane said that Ms. Quinn had obtained portable toilets for other locations, including a Chelsea housing project.)
Power was restored to the building around 6 p.m., though the Porta Potties would still come in handy, because it was expected to take a few hours for pumps to replenish the water towers. When that happened, the portable toilets would be moved elsewhere, Mr. McShane said.

 6:17 P.M. | Students at Severely Damaged Schools to Start Class Wednesday 
Students at 65 "severely damaged" public schools will be temporarily reassigned to new schools, and will resume classes on Wednesday, Dennis M. Walcott, the schools chancellor, announced late Friday afternoon.
The rest of the city's schoolchildren will return to class Monday, but the logistical challenges of relocating students from those hardest-hit schools require an extra two days, Mr. Walcott said. On Tuesday, all city public schools are closed for Election Day.
High on the list of those challenges is transportation. "Especially in severely hit areas, schools may not be next door," the chancellor warned. Younger children will be delivered to the new locations by bus; high school students will get a MetroCard. Mr. Walcott did not rule out the possibility that some students will have shortened school days, to fit as many as possible under the same roof.
Notifying those students of the changes will also be a challenge. Many live in areas that do not yet have electricity. Mr. Walcott said the schools would be using every resource to reach the affected families, working through parent coordinators and parent associations; broadcasting the news in print, online and over the airwaves; using robocalls and text messages; and keeping 311 call takers informed. 
"We understand and feel for those individuals that may not have power, may not be in their homes, but that doesn't mean they're totally isolated," he said, though he allowed that "there's going to be some folks who may not get" the information in time.
Compounding the difficulties, some students in affected areas are now homeless and may be scattered around the city; some have lost loved ones; many have experienced trauma. The Education Department is working with other city agencies such as the Department of Homeless Services as well as with grief counselors to attend to those students' needs.
In addition to the currently inoperable schools, an even greater number were left intact but without power. Mr. Walcott said that "Con Edison has provided a dedicated individual to work solely on powering up our schools." He expected that "a sizable number" of those schools would be up and running by Monday, especially the large number that are located in Lower Manhattan, an area that by Friday afternoon was already coming back on line.
Mr. Walcott also answered questions about the handful of schools that are currently serving as shelters for people left homeless by the storm. They will be there while school is in session, but will not occupy the same areas as students.
"We want to make sure there's isolation between those who are in a building for shelter purposes," he said, and those who are there to study. Responding to concerns about possible security risks and unsanitary conditions, he said all would be addressed by Monday morning: "If it's not sanitary then it will be sanitary, and the conditions have to be met."
Teachers citywide showed up for work Friday to make preparations for their students' return. "I'm pleased to report that based on a survey of 1,300 schools today we had 80 percent attendance," Mr. Walcott said, noting that many of those teachers overcame their own flood-related challenges to show up. Teachers and staff of the severely damaged schools will report to work Monday, at their new locations, in advance of their transplanted students.
The list of those 65 schools, which the department intended to release Friday night, includes some with basements or even first stories underwater, boilers that are submerged or no longer functioning, and electrical systems that were destroyed by fire. An earlier estimate tallied 79 schools, but in the interim some have been brought up to code.

 5:49 P.M. | Obama Orders Release of Diesel Fuel to Storm Responders 
The Obama administration late Friday authorized opening up what is called the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve to provide two million gallons of diesel fuel to government emergency responders to help keep electricity generators, water pumps, federal buildings, diesel trucks and other vehicles running.
"This loan from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve will help ensure state, local and federal responders in the impacted area have access to the diesel fuel they need to continue response and recovery efforts," Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement Friday evening.
The oil reserve, created by the federal government in 2000, holds 42 million gallons of ultra-low-sulfur diesel, located at terminals in Groton, Conn., and Revere, Mass. This is the first time fuel has been released from the reserve. The Defense Department will be in charge of drawing down the fuel from the reserves, which will then be distributed to state, local and federal emergency responders in the New York and New Jersey area.

 5:21 P.M. | Price-Gouging Complaints Pursued in New Jersey and New York 
The Christie administration said Friday that it had sent subpoenas to 65 businesses in New Jersey as part of investigations into more than 500 complaints of price gouging.
In New York State, the attorney general's office is investigating hundreds of complaints of price gouging on food, ice, water, generators and hotel rates, though complaints about gasoline have been the most prevalent amid the maddening shortages.
Jeffrey S. Chiesa, New Jersey's attorney general, said his office had received complaints from all parts of the state, but said they were particularly heavy in Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and Passaic Counties.
"We expect that, by the end of the weekend, we will have issued 100 subpoenas to gas stations, requiring them to provide their receipts and other information to demonstrate their prices, and the costs they faced, both before and during the state of emergency," Mr. Chiesa, a gubernatorial appointee, said in a statement.
The office of New York State's attorney general, Eric. T. Schneiderman, who is an elected official, has received complaints from Long Island to the Hudson Valley.
"Our office has zero tolerance for price gouging," Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. " We are actively investigating hundreds of complaints we've received of businesses preying on victims of Hurricane Sandy, and will do everything we can to stop unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage of New Yorkers trying to rebuild their lives."

 4:26 P.M. | 2 Men on a Mission to Find Generators 
With so many people struggling to cope with a lack of power, the plan devised by two New Jersey men was probably not unique.
Desperate to restore power to their homes, they got in a car about 2 a.m. on Thursday and began driving south on Interstate 95 in search of a Home Depot that still had electricity generators for sale.
The men, Michael Lapinski, 41, and Dave Hunter, 42, both of Aberdeen in central New Jersey - a region hit hard by the storm - found their first generator some six hours and 170 miles later at a Home Depot in Towson, Md.
"We were calling and visiting Home Depots all along the way based on phone numbers and store locations from a phone application," said Mr. Lapinski, who, like Mr. Hunter, had been without power since Monday.
Before leaving Aberdeen, they had used Mr. Hunter's credit card to order two generators from a Home Depot in Warrenton, Va., 262 miles away.
"Just in case our journey had taken us that far, we knew we had two generators locked in," Mr. Lapinski said.
After finding a 5,500-watt generator in Towson, Mr. Hunter, who had been making the calls from his cellphone during the ride, soon realized that a second generator could be found at a Home Depot 13 miles away in Edgewood, Md. Once there, Mr. Hunter tried to pay for a 6,000-watt generator, but his credit card company initially blocked the transaction.
"I had to get on the phone with someone who wanted to know why I was purchasing generators all over the place," Mr. Hunter said. "I had not yet canceled the order I had made in Virginia, so my credit card company thought it was a case of fraud. It was kind of embarrassing."
"By the time we got back to Aberdeen, many of our neighbors were still searching for generators and some were still on Home Depot's waiting list," Mr. Lapinski said. "So our trip, though it may have been a long one, was well worth it."

 4:49 P.M. | Martha Graham Sets and Costumes Damaged by Storm 
Most of the sets and costumes of the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, stored in a West Village basement, were submerged under 6 feet of water in Hurricane Sandy flooding, company officials said on Friday.
The material included programs and posters and a number of sets designed by Isamu Noguchi, one of Graham's most important collaborators. One Noguchi set, for "Clytemnestra," was built by the artist himself, the company said. Most of the company's costumes were also inundated. The materials were stored in a nearly 4,000-square-foot basement at the Westbeth artists complex, where the center had moved in July. Other submerged productions were "Cave of the Heart," "Embattled Garden" and "Errand into the Maze."

Ms. Napolitano said 1.6 million meals and 7.1 million liters of water had been "positioned" to be distributed in New York. She said 657 housing inspectors were already at work in New York and 3,200 employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been sent to the Northeast.
She said she had visited a shelter and had had "a round table to discuss the nuts and bolts" with local and regional officials. The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and the Staten Island borough president, James Molinaro, also attended the briefing.

 3:53 P.M. | Flooding Upsets Resumption of 9/11 Museum Construction 
The main floor of the National September 11 Memorial Museum, still under construction nearly 70 feet below the memorial plaza at the World Trade Center, filled with at least seven feet of water during the storm, its president said Friday. The flooding nearly immersed two fire trucks that have already been placed in the museum and it surrounded the symbolic last column taken from the twin towers.
"It was shocking," said Joseph C. Daniels, the president and chief executive of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, which is responsible for both the museum and the memorial. He said he had gone to bed Monday believing the museum was safe. He awakened Tuesday to word that the site had flooded overnight. Later that day, he witnessed it himself from a balcony overlooking the enormous Foundation Hall on the main floor, now filled with thick, black water on which wood planks and other debris floated.
Four days earlier, Mr. Daniels had been standing in the hall with members of the memorial foundation board, showing them renderings and explaining which displays would go where. Construction was finally resuming on the museum after the resolution of a protracted financing dispute between the foundation, of which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is chairman, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is partly controlled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The authority owns the World Trade Center site and is building the museum on behalf of the foundation.
The view from the balcony showed water reaching almost to the top of the fire truck used by Engine Company 21 to respond to the attack in 2001, and the truck on which Ladder Company 3 arrived. A Fire Department ambulance was also surrounded with water. All three had been shrink-wrapped in plastic before they were installed in the museum. With the floodwaters still standing, there was no way on Friday to assess how much additional damage the already battered vehicles had sustained, or whether the plastic enclosure had protected them.
The archipelago of partly submerged artifacts includes the last column of the original twin towers. This 58-ton piece, more than 36 feet high, was removed with funereal ceremony in May 2002 to symbolize the end of the first phase of recovery, the clearance of the World Trade Center site. It was then stored in a climate-controlled area of Hangar 17 at Kennedy International Airport while undergoing conservation. It is still in a climate-controlled enclosure, so its condition has not been assessed. Many of the personal effects that had been taped to the column were removed long ago for safekeeping. But the column is also covered in spray-painted graffiti from first responders, rescuers and recovery workers.
The last column, the steel cross, the damaged vehicles and the so-called survivors' stairway were all hoisted down into the subterranean museum during the early phases of construction. They could not have been moved in after the completion of the memorial plaza, which doubles as the museum rooftop.
Mr. Daniels said Friday that the pumping out of the museum was "fully under way," but that it was still far too early to say when construction might resume or, for that matter, when the 9/11 memorial might reopen to the public.

 4:06 P.M. | Broken Crane Expected to be Secured This Weekend 
Riggers and engineers expect this weekend to finish securing the broken crane boom that has dangled precariously over 57th Street since Monday and reopen the surrounding streets.
Work crews will climb up to the top of the 74-story residential tower next to the crane at 157 57th Street Friday evening or Saturday morning and start strapping the crane to the frame of the building.
A strong gust of wind twisted and snapped the boom Monday afternoon 1,000 feet above 57th Street, causing city officials to close streets to protect motorists and pedestrians. The developer, contractor and building inspectors have been meeting ever since to devise a plan for securing and then dismantling the crane.
"Work to secure the crane is expected to begin shortly," said Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the city's Buildings Department. "We expect the operation will take about 36 hours."

 3:21 P.M. | Sanitation Crews Complain of Working on Marathon 
 Some New York City sanitation workers who have expressed a desire to work on Staten Island and in Queens neighborhoods hit hard by Hurricane Sandy are complaining to their union about being assigned instead to clean up after the New York City Marathon, the union president said on Friday.
The workers have called their shop stewards to complain, according to the union president, Harry Nespoli, who heads Local 831 of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association. The union represents the 6,200 workers at the Department of Sanitation.
"Many of our workers have similar problems that these other people have," Mr. Nespoli said, referring to the New Yorkers whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the storm. "They have no lights, they have water in the basement, but they're coming to work and doing their jobs."
"They just feel, 'Why are they doing the marathon when they can be helping other people?'" he said. "They feel we should be focusing on this particular part of the cleanup and not the marathon."
Mr. Nespoli said he understood "it's a tough call," but he said that he, like the members of his union, believed that the residents of the Rockaways, Staten Island and other neighborhoods in distress deserved priority when it came to the use of city resources.
City officials declined to offer a response. 
"I know this administration is looking to show the public that they can perform," Mr. Nespoli said. "The thing is, I've been out and the mayor's been out there, too, and I see that people are hurting out there."
Mr. Nespoli said he expected that his union members, who have been working 12-hour shifts since the storm hit, to follow orders and carry out their assignments.

 2:41 P.M. | 'We Need to Do What We Need to Do for Our Neighbors,' Hotelier Says 
"We have 700 people in our hotel that don't have a place to go right now," Richard Nicotra explained on Friday. They are stuffed into 310 rooms in the Hilton Garden Inn he owns on Staten Island and a sister property.
Much as he would like to honor bookings that runners and others associated with Sunday's New York City Marathon made long ago, accounting for 160 rooms alone this weekend, Mr. Nicotra said dispossessed New Yorkers must come first.
"It became evident to us on Wednesday that all these people that we took in are not going to be able to go home on Thursday or Friday,'' he said. "So we had to make a decision to throw our neighbors out in the cold or give a room to an out-of-town marathoner. That was an easy decision to make.''
He said he understood Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's desire to remind the world of New York resilience, but said allowing the marathon to proceed as scheduled was "a bad decision for Staten Island" and other parts of New York that are experiencing much hardship because of Hurricane Sandy's furious punch.
"A race is important,'' he said, "but not as important as if you have three kids that are sick in need of shelter. We have a guy here who is 101 years old and his son said if you didn't take him in he would have died."
Mr. Nicotra noted that his hotels were also housing Brendan Marrocco, a quadriplegic veteran whose handicapped-accessible house flooded in the storm. "He had nowhere to go." 
With the full backing of Hilton Garden Inn's corporate president in Memphis, Mr. Nicotra's staff has notified runners affected by the hotel's decision. They have been offered makeshift accommodations, like cots in the ballroom, or busing to the race from other hotels, but those being bumped were not all taking the news in stride.
"The word they use is they're very 'disappointed,'" Mr. Nicotra said. "I don't know if I'm going to get sued, but we need to do what we need to do for our neighbors."
On Friday night, the Hilton Garden's 40,000-square-foot ballroom, which can ordinarily seat 1,000, will be doing double-duty.
On one side, Red Cross workers will be trying to sleep on 50 borrowed cots. On the other side, a bride will be escorted down the aisle by her parents, whose home was lost in the storm, so that she can marry a New York firefighter.

 1:53 P.M. | Bloomberg Defends Marathon Decision as Opposition Grows 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered an extensive and full-throated defense of his decision to hold the New York City Marathon on Sunday. "We have to have a city going forward," the mayor said, adding, "New York has to show that we are here, that we are going to recover."
Mr. Bloomberg said the marathon would use "a relatively small amount of Sanitation Department resources," and he added that there were plenty of police officers available "who work in areas that aren't affected; we don't take all of them and move them into areas that are affected." The marathon would "give people something to cheer about," the mayor said. "It's been a dismal week for a lot of people."
But even as Mr. Bloomberg made his remarks, there were signs that the opposition to the marathon plans were continuing to grow. The city's public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who had originally supported the mayor's decision, e-mailed during the mayor's briefing to say he had changed his mind. "The needs are simply too great to divert any resources from the recovery," Mr. de Blasio wrote. "We need to postpone the marathon and keep our focus where it belongs: on public safety and vital relief operations."
And Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who had remained silent on the issue until Friday, also decided to weigh in against the plan. "The decision to move forward with the marathon is not a decision I would have made," Ms. Quinn said.
For his part, Mr. Bloomberg said the city had a responsibility to "help companies that need the business, to still generate a tax base," and he evoked the example of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decisions in the months after the 9/11 terror attacks.
"I think Rudy had it right," Mr. Bloomberg said. "You keep going; you have to do things. You can grieve, you can cry, you can laugh, all at the same time. That's what human beings are good at."

 1:46 P.M. | A Dispatch From the Rockaways 
Kevin Boyle, a former editor of one of the city's oldest newspapers, The Rockaway Wave, whose "Ideas Wanted" project was featured in a City Room post in August, sent out an update on the dire situation in the Rockaways by e-mail today. In part of his long note, he described the difficulty of getting solid information on the peninsula:
There is no power and won't be for some time. Some guesses are two weeks (bearable) to two months (not bearable as winter rolls in).
Rumors fly about looting, buildings being condemned (large apartment buildings), Breezy Point people being told to leave within 48 hours (and because they have cesspools there is conjecture that it will be a very, very long time (if ever) before that community is allowed to come back. Things like that are hard to substantiate for a few reasons. We have little or no cell service and most people are so busy with their own houses and circumstances no one has the time to check on anyone past their own block.
Mr. Boyle also complained about the lack of aid, though according to the Rockaway Wave Twitter feed, both the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were offering help to residents on Friday.

 1:44 P.M. | How Did Your Dog Brave Hurricane Sandy? 
As the storm approached, some dogs were jumpy; others seemed depressed or even bored. But what did dogs actually experience?
Alexandra Horowitz has been considering that question. An associate professor of psychology at Barnard College, she runs a dog cognition lab and is the author of the book, "Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know." And, not surprisingly, as the owner of two large dogs - the mutts Finnegan and Upton - her research often starts in the apartment near Columbia where she lives with her husband and their 3-year-old son.
Upton, for example, who is about 4, is startled by sudden sounds.
"He knew about the storm before we told him," Dr. Horowitz said. "He could have told us about the storm, if we hadn't been paying attention to the news."
Upton stopped sitting by the window of their sixth-floor apartment because there were a lot of sudden sounds below, Dr. Horowitz said. "It took us a little while to pick up on that."
He also probably paid attention to the increase in sudden gusts of wind that seeped into the apartment through a closed window pane, or the sounds of a random piece of scaffolding dropping on the street, she said.
Dogs, Dr. Horowitz said, live in a "kind of sensory parallel universe, noticing and reacting to things that we cannot even detect." Much of that, she says, is because of a dog's heightened sense of smell; and she notes that the winds that preceded Hurricane Sandy carried odors.
"Now, do they know it is a storm coming? No, I mean I don't think they're defining things that way," Dr. Horowitz said. "That's our world." But they do notice a difference, she said.
Dogs with anxious owners may have also become stressed and hyper-vigilant. "One of dogs' great adaptations is that they look to us to determine how they should act," Dr. Horowitz said.
Hurricane Sandy has offered dogs one silver lining. As Dr. Horowitz walks Finn and Upton near Riverside Park and on other familiar routes, she navigates carefully around downed trees, broken branches and leaf effluvia.
While humans she meets may have an emotional reaction to a fallen tree, the dogs are sniffing what is to them "like this new mystery object that's appeared from outer space."
"The first dog that passed marks it - then suddenly it's the new bulletin board for the neighborhood," she said.
She added: "And the dogs and the humans are just having a really different experience at that moment, I think."

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has taken a hard line with state utilities, telling them they could lose their licenses if electrical service is not quickly and efficiently restored. Mayor Bloomberg, who has appeared several times this week with the chief executive of Consolidated Edison, sounds a more sympathetic note. 
"From what we've seen, Con Ed is doing as much work as they possibly can safely," the mayor said, adding, "I always stop when I see a Con Ed worker and say, 'Thank you for taking care of us.'"

Time-lapse video of the storm hitting New York this week showed the sudden plunge of half of Manhattan into darkness on Monday night.
Consolidated Edison hopes to have power restored to "most" of Manhattan by midnight, as in 11 hours from now, Mayor Bloomberg said. About 460,000 New Yorkers remain without power, with half in Manhattan, according to the mayor. He said that power could return to some parts of Lower Manhattan on Friday afternoon, but that utility workers were being careful to avoid any accidental fires at buildings where electrical equipment may be damaged. Residents who live in areas served by overhead lines will have to wait "a lot longer" for power to return, Mr. Bloomberg said.

The city plans to start securing the dangling crane on Saturday, and the operation is expected to take 36 hours. The building's developer will eventually have to construct another crane next to the damaged one to dismantle it, the mayor said.

The city had enforced strict limits on those cars from entering Manhattan over most bridges and tunnels. Mr. Bloomberg believes that enough subway lines will be restored by Monday that the restrictions will not have to be reinstated. 
In addition, the Holland Tunnel will be reopened "on a limited basis for commercial drivers and buses," the mayor said. The Staten Island Ferry will resume a normal schedule on Saturday.

The mayor is warning New Yorkers that, even after electricity can be restored, there is a risk of fire in certain homes where electrical equipment remains wet, damaged or underwater. "We have already seen some cases where electricity was turned on, there were fires, and we lost some other houses," Mr. Bloomberg said, although he did not specify in what areas those fires occurred. He said the city would be cautious about turning on electricity at sites where a fire risk remained.

 12:38 P.M. | Wildlife Officials Debate Evacuation at a Flooded Aquarium 
 It was a scene out of "Water World": thousands of gallons of water in the exhibitions of the New York Aquarium at Coney Island and, just outside the doors, the Lower Bay of New York Harbor.
During Hurricane Sandy, the two met. Sea water poured into the aquarium from the storm surge, flooding the 14-acre complex, knocking out power and jeopardizing the sea mammals and fish that rely on intricate filtration systems. On Friday, the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the aquarium, was debating whether to evacuate some of the animals to other aquariums in the region.
"Using generator power, we are making progress toward restoring life-support systems to our aquatic exhibts," Jim Breheny, executive vice president of the society's zoos and aquarium, said in a statement. "We are facing a critical period when we will have to decide if we are going to move some of our animals. We are still working around the clock to accomplish what we need to do."
Staff members continued to pump water out of the areas that house the critical operating systems. In photographs released by the society on Thursday, several inches of water still covered the floors of the darkened aquarium as large fish swam in the eerily lighted exhibits.
Questions have swirled all week about the fate of Mitik, the orphaned baby walrus that the aquarium acquired last month from Alaska. The walrus was still being bottle fed and required round-the-clock care when the storm swept in. According to a statement from the aquarium, Mitik "weathered the storm without incident and seemed interested and amused by all the activity around him."
Aquarium officials also reported that the adult walruses, sharks, penguins, sea turtles and seal lions all survived the storm. "Our fish collection is also doing well as we have been able to maintain temporary life support on our tanks and exhibits since we lost power," Mr. Breheny said.

 12:46 P.M. | Obama Administration Acts to Relieve Fuel Situation 
The Obama administration on Friday sought to use what leverage the federal government has to rapidly increase the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel in the New York metropolitan area, including lifting rules that prevent certain foreign-flagged ships from moving gasoline along the East Coast.
The moves - including at least four federal agencies - reflect the urgency of immediately increasing the fuel supply in the New York area, which is already suffering from historic flooding and the loss of power.
W. Craig Fugate, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that in addition to temporarily lifting the so-called Jones Act rule that normally prohibits foreign-flagged ships from transporting goods from one United States port to another, federal officials are working with Colonial Pipeline, one of the biggest pipeline companies in the country, to help get a critical fuel pipeline in the Linden, N.J., area operating again.
"We are working this as a team," Mr. Fugate said Friday morning, in a news conference.
The Environmental Protection Agency has also lifted air-pollution rules that normally regulate what kind of gasoline can be sold - different mixes are used at different times of the year to reduce smog - to try to rapidly increase the supply. It is also allowing fuel oil to be used as diesel fuel, Mr. Fugate said.
As of Friday morning, a conference call was underway led by the Department of Energy with major fuel suppliers to see how many additional ships can come to the East Coast to move fuel, how much additional capacity they can provide and how quickly they can get to New York.
So far, at least one foreign-flagged tanker is on its way to the New York area from the Gulf Coast, one White House official said.
FEMA is also trying to work with power companies to try to get electricity back on at gasoline stations in critical areas, or to providing generators to these spots - as in many cases it is simply a lack of power that is preventing the sale of gasoline.
On Thursday, the Department of Defense and the National Guard, using military transport planes, moved about 60 power company trucks and other equipment from California to Stewart International Airport, west of Newburgh, N.Y., so that they can then be deployed across the New York region. Utilities trucks had already come to the metropolitan area from the Southeast but crews and trucks from the West were flown in to get them here faster.

 12:28 P.M. | Musicians Reunite With Their Instruments, and the Show Goes on 
On one side of the police barricade at West 57th Street and the Avenue of the Americas: an oboe, a flute, a French horn, a bassoon and two clarinets.
On the other side stood Max Artved and his students from the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen - Ragnhildur Josefsdottir, Anne Sophie Jensen, Arvid Larsson, Soren-Filip Hansen and Morten S. Jensen - pleading in vain to be reunited with the instruments and baggage they left behind on Monday after they'd checked into the Salisbury Hotel, 123 West 57th Street.
They had been dining at a nearby Italian restaurant Monday when a tower crane boom upended near the top of the 73-story One57 apartment tower at 157 West 57th Street. They heard a tremendous crash. The next thing they knew, firefighters were ordering them out of the restaurant. They ran out into the storm as debris rained down on the street. "It was like an action movie," Mr. Artved said. But when a police officer ordered them off the block altogether, it dawned on the visitors that this particular movie wouldn't have a happy ending, at least right away.
They found new lodging quickly enough, though they had to spend the first night together in one room. And they watched suspiciously as the daily rate increased from $200 a night to $400 a night. They canceled a concert of Danish music at Flushing Town Hall. They returned time after time to the barricade, seeking admission to the frozen zone. "We know almost every policeman in New York," Mr. Artved said. "Without going to prison."
Finally, on Thursday evening, the Office of Emergency Management and the Police Department allowed residents and hotel guests from the frozen zone to return briefly to their buildings, though the boom still hung ominously overhead. That meant the musicians would be able at least to show up Friday at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College. There was some anxiety in their rejoicing, as they anticipated the difficulty of performing Mozart's Serenade No. 10 in B flat major, the "Gran Partita," with their counterparts from Queens College.
"We haven't been able to play one note since Monday," said Ms. Josefsdottir, the flutist. To which Mr. Jensen, one of the clarinetists, added, "Now, we're totally out of shape."
This being New York, however, the show went on. Prof. Edward Smaldone, the director of the Queens College music school, reported Friday morning that the trans-Atlantic ensemble had successfully convened, though the college was still without power. In deference to the circumstances, what was to have been a concert became an open rehearsal instead.
"We have all been inspired to persevere," Professor Smaldone said, "and we will finally get to play today, just a few hours before they are due at J.F.K. for their flight home."

 12:19 P.M. | S.I. Hotel Owners Won't Kick Out Guests to Accommodate Runners 
As anger percolates over the the decision to hold the New York City Marathon, at least two hotel owners on Staten Island, where the race starts, said they would not kick out those displaced by Hurricane Sandy to accommodate runners who have reserved a room.
"Our main priority here is to help people in the Staten Island community who have lost their homes to the storm, said Amit Gandhi, the owner of a Holiday Inn Express.
Richard Nicotra, who owns another hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn, told New York 1 on Thursday that he would not ask storm victims to leave. "How do I tell people that have no place to go, that have no home, that have no heat, that you have to leave because I need to make room for somebody that wants to run the marathon? I can't do that," Mr. Nicotra, said.
With many parts of Staten Island decimated by the storm and many residents lacking the basics, many residents and local politicians are furious that marathon organizers are continuing with their plans.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he believed holding the marathon was feasible given the scope of the recovery and was a sign of a return to a semblance of normal life in the city.
But Mr. Gandhi said his first priority had to be the people staying in his hotel whose homes have been destroyed or are uninhabitable.
"We have concerns from our in-house desks who were scheduled to check out due to the marathoners," Mr. Gandhi said. "But they are here because their houses were destroyed, and we're not going to ask them to leave. Any distressed family, we are extending their stays. With marathoners, we do expect a lot of cancellations. If some marathoners come and we don't have availability, we will do our best to find them another hotel, probably somewhere in New Jersey."
At 2:15 pm Friday, Raymond Kozma, a social worker with Integrity Senior Services, arrived in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express on Staten Island. The agency provides services for seniors at Island Shores senior center in the Midland Beach neighborhood of Staten Island. The center's first floor was flooded, and residents were evacuated on Sunday. Kozma came to the hotel to check in on Patricia Quinn, 70, one of the evacuees. Standing in the lobby, Mr. Kozma said to Ms. Quinn, "Oh, you haven't heard? I don't want to alarm you, but we were told that the hotel would be kicking you out to make room for some marathoners."
"Oh, no. I haven't heard," said Ms. Quinn, who looked concerned.
They conferred with Amit Gandhi, owner of the hotel, who also was standing in the lobby. Haid that no, he would not kick out any evacuees. 
"Oh, well that's good," Mr. Kozma said. "Still, I disagree with the mayor. It's still too early to have the marathon when so many people are still affected. He mayor is trying to put the best face on it, but not taking into account the crisis people are in."

 11:28 A.M. | Cleaning Up and Assessing Damage at Ports and Harbors 
The Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest on the East Coast, was ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, and officials there are now in the process of cleaning up after several feet of water sloshed through the huge linked facilities earlier this week.
Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the entire port, which sprawls from Brooklyn through Staten Island and into New Jersey, has been closed since the weekend, with no commercial shipping business coming in. The United States Coast Guard is meanwhile conducting a damage assessment of New York Harbor and its surrounding waterways after reports emerged of gasoline and oil spills in the Arthur Kill near Staten Island and of numerous huge shipping containers blown off vessels into the harbor's channels.
According to a statement issued Friday morning by the Coast Guard, the harbor is open to fuel barge and tugboat traffic, but other so-called deep-draft vessels will be allowed into local waterways only on "a case-by-case basis in coordination with the Captain of the Port." The cruise ship terminals in Manhattan and Bayonne, N.J. are also open but the Brooklyn cruise ship is closed.
Jim Pelliccio, the president of the Port Newark Container Terminal, said that several containers in his outdoor storage yard had been tossed around by the wind during the storm and that workers there were trying to get them back into place. The power is also out, he said. "We got hit pretty hard," Mr. Pelliccio added.
On Tuesday morning, a huge surge from Newark Bay inundated a 120-acre lot at Port Newark where thousands of new cars were awaiting shipment, destroying many of them, according to a report by Northjersey.com. The water swept through the lot, owned by FAPS Inc., ruining hundreds of Fords, Chryslers and Volvos, and then swept through an adjacent lot owned by Toyota.
The storm was so severe that even the Coast Guard had to abandon its New York headquarters in the Battery and relolcate to a temporary facility on Staten Island.
Joseph Curto, the president of the New York Shipping Association, a trade group of regional shippers, said that the port's most serious problem in the days ahead will likely be labor.
"Many workers live in the affected areas," Mr. Curto said. "They lost homes and cars; some have no gas. We don't know how many are going to be able to get to work. That's the big question mark and no one has an answer yet."

 I live on this barrier island on the South Shore of Long Island, and Monday night, at about 8, with the electricity out, candles flickering against the pitch black night and Hurricane Sandy bearing down on us, we raised our glasses and toasted to the 10- foot- high sand dune at the end of our street. 
In beach communities, dunes are held holy, and for the 30 years we've lived here, through numerous hurricanes and Nor'Easters, the dune had held back the sea.
"To the dune," we toasted.
Minutes later, in the pitch black, four feet of ocean water came rushing down our street and two of those feet streamed into our first floor.

"There is no reason to panic; there is no reason for anxiety," Governor Cuomo said of the gasoline shortage. "We understand why there was a shortage, for very definable reasons. We also understand why it's going to be better, and it's going to be better in the near future."
At that, the governor took a moment to make a broader point about patience and realistic expectations in the face of a daunting storm.
"This was a major, major assault by mother nature that we went through, and it's not going to be a one- or two- or three-day situation," Mr. Cuomo said. "A little patience, a little compassion, a little understanding, should make it better for everyone."

 11:24 A.M. | Fuel Ships Start Arriving in New York Harbor 
The gasoline shortage, which has emerged as one of the biggest difficulties faced by New Yorkers trying to resume normal routines, was caused in part by the closing of New York Harbor following the storm, Governor Cuomo said. 
With the harbor reopened, the governor believes that the shortage will begin to ease. The governor has also waived a requirement that fuel tankers register and pay a tax before unloading their goods. 
"I don't like to waive the tax, I don't want to lose the money, but we do want to accelerate the flow of gasoline," Mr. Cuomo said. 
On Thursday, ships began re-entering the harbor, including tankers and vessels carrying gasoline to terminals and distribution centers. "There should be a real change in position, and people should see it quickly," the governor said.

The view from the U.S.S. Wasp posted on Flickr by U.S. Marine Corps Cpl. Michael S. Lockett
The Marines have almost landed.
About 300 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit based out of Camp Lejeune, N.C., are waiting off the New Jersey shore for permission to land in New Jersey and join rescue, relief and cleanup efforts.
The unit, currently aboard the U.S.S. Wasp, an amphibious assault ship, will be brought ashore via helicopters once the command is issued - possibly by noon - that officially authorizes them to join a task force under the command of the New Jersey National Guard.
The Marines include teams trained in installing generators, pumping water and purifying water. They are bringing their own equipment, including a number of generators that are being trucked from North Carolina, said Captain Eric Flanagan, a Marine Corps spokesman.
It is not clear yet where the troops will be dispatched, but more than likely it will be in flood-ravaged areas of South Jersey. "We'll go wherever directed," Captain Flanagan said.
Some Marine Corps reserve units have already been helping in rescue and relief efforts around the region, the corps said.
On Monday night, for instance, New York City police asked a reserve unit in Brooklyn, the Sixth Communications Battalion, to help move rescuers and equipment to a fire in a flooded section of Rockaway Beach. Using two seven-ton trucks, the reservists were able to help police and firefighters rescue 14 people, the Marine Corps said.

 11:21 A.M. | Federal Teams to Help in Damaged Areas 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will be sending 30 teams of workers into damaged areas of the New York region, a collaboration between state and federal authorities, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who discussed the plan on Thursday evening with President Obama. 
The teams will speak to homeowners who are concerned about filing insurance claims for damaged property - "whatever paperwork, whatever bureaucracy, has to be overcome, circumvented, these teams will be in place to do that," Mr. Cuomo said. New York State will also pledge $100 million to a fund to assist residents whose homes were damaged by the storm.

 11:00 A.M. | As Many Remain Without Power, Angry Words From Cuomo 
Huge swaths of Long Island encompassing more than 640,000 households remained without power on Friday, and the authorities said that it would be more than a week before electricity was restored to most customers, and even longer for untold others.
At the worst of the storm, Long Island Power Authority reported power failures for 945,000 out of its 1.1 million customers. Officials there said Friday that they had brought in crews from around the country to help with the recovery process, but that downed trees and washed-out roads made the work extremely challenging. As of Thursday evening, LIPA said it had restored power to roughly 490,000 customers on Long Island.
With frustration building and flooded communities growing more desperate by the day, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo raised serious questions about the steps LIPA and other power authorities took to prepare for Hurricane Sandy. Mr. Cuomo sent a scathing letter to utility companies on Thursday threatening to cancel the state certifications of the private companies and fire the management.
"New Yorkers should not suffer because electric utilities did not reasonably prepare for this eventuality," Mr. Cuomo said.
"With respect to the Long Island Power Authority, I will make every change necessary to ensure it lives up to its public responsibility," he said. "It goes without saying that such failures would warrant the removal of the management responsible for such colossal misjudgments."

 11:05 A.M. | Decision to Proceed With Marathon Divides New Yorkers 
Emotions on the question of whether the New York City Marathon should go ahead on Sunday, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, continued to run high, as runners, fans and New Yorkers voiced their opinion on the polarizing issue.
By Friday morning, more than 500 readers had weighed in with comments on Ken Belson's article about the continued preparations for the event in the wake of the storm. A "Cancel the 2012 NYC Marathon" Facebook group started by Michelle Cleary of Staten Island had over 28,000 "likes" two days before the race was to be run.
"I would love for them to figure out a better way to use volunteers," Cleary said in a phone interview on Thursday. "I think postponing it is an option. Either way, the efforts need to be diverted to help the recovery."

A Reuters video report on the broken crane dangling over West 57th Street.
Carnegie Hall, plunged into suspended animation because of the crane across the street left dangling by Hurricane Sandy, is struggling to accommodate singers, pianists and string players whose dates have been cancelled this weekend. 
Among changes it announced late Thursday: the King's Singers concert scheduled for Friday was moved to Feb. 18; Murray Perahia's piano recital was moved from Friday to Sunday at Avery Fisher Hall; the Belcea Quartet performance on Saturday moves to Tuesday, but only if authorities reopen 57th Street, which was closed because of the crane; a performance by Opera Lafayette of "L'Invitation au Voyage" on Friday in Weill Recital Hall will take place at the Colony Club; Monday's Oratorio Society of New York performance will take place some time in early 2013.
The city has said work to secure the damaged crane that would allow the nearby streets to open could begin this weekend.

 9:18 A.M. | After Hurricane Sandy, Would You Buy on the Waterfront? 
If tropical storm Irene last year was an eye-opener, Hurricane Sandy was a reality check. 
Waterfront property in the New York area is some of the most coveted in the nation, but after back-to-back years of supposedly once-in-a-generation storms, public officials, developers, brokers and homeowners are being forced to re-evaluate.
Although real estate experts say property values are unlikely to suffer in the long term, it is possible that new zoning and planning regulations - and buyers' expectations - could reshape how residential housing along the water is built, marketed and sold.
In a news briefing on Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said elected officials had a responsibility to consider new ways to prevent similar damage to the region's infrastructure in the face of future storms. "For us to sit here today and say this is a once-in-a-generation and it's not going to happen again, I think, would be shortsighted," he said. "I think we need to anticipate more of these extreme-weather-type situations in the future, and we have to take that into consideration in reforming, modifying, our infrastructure."

 9:05 A.M. | Wait Times for Buses Increase 
Between 8 and 8:30 a.m., the wait at the Barclays Center arena tripled - up from 10 minutes to 30 and beyond. For the first time all morning, a line that had been short came to a halt and stretched back along Flatbush Avenue. Then it turned onto Dean Street, and doubled back onto Sixth Avenue.
Still, it was a vast improvement over Thursday, when people waited more than three hours here, and no one was ready to complain just yet. Except, that is, when it came to the walk around the stadium, a detour designed to decongest the bus-loading area that added an unexpected quarter-mile to the morning commute.
"It's horrendous! It's such a long walk around this Barclays Center," said Caroline Young Miller, 60, who works at the Bahamas Consulate General. She was huffing around the stadium with her colleague, Clemmy Eneas-Varence, 41, who took it all in stride. "Good exercise this morning!" she said.

 8:07 A.M. | Power to Return to Parts of Manhattan by Tonight, Con Ed Says 
For the first time in five days, power will return to a small sliver of Lower Manhattan, including Wall Street, by midnight Friday, Consolidated Edison officials said. 
And all of the utility's customers in Manhattan who lost power when Hurricane Sandy barreled into the city should expect to have electricity on Saturday.
Before the end of the day on Friday, power is expected to be restored to the most southeastern tip of Manhattan, said Alfonso Quiroz, a Con Ed spokesman, an area roughly south of Frankfort Street, which parallels the approach to the Brooklyn Bridge. In that area, customers east of Broadway will have electricity, but those west of Broadway will be restored by Saturday, although some customers there already have power, he said.
The area encompasses customers who had been served by the two networks taken out preemptively by the utility during the storm.
Still, not all customers in Manhattan may get power back on Saturday, said Allan Drury, another Con Ed spokesman. Damaged equipment could delay full restoration, he said. 
"Some customers may have had damage to their equipment and cannot accept service," Mr. Drury said.
And he said customers in the other boroughs will have to wait longer for their power to resume.
Manhattan is served by underground lines, which makes the resumption of power easier. About 226,000 customers do not currently have service in Manhattan, from an area roughly south of 40th street on the east side and from about 34th Street on the west side of the island.
A vast majority of customers in the other boroughs will have power again by the weekend of Nov. 10, Mr. Drury said. Those customers depend on overhead lines that are harder to fix.
While the numbers change quickly, customers still without electricity as of Friday morning are as follows:
Queens, 84,000
Staten Island 54,000
Brooklyn: 35,000
Bronx 31,000

 7:34 A.M. | Many Ways to Measure a Line 
The wait to get on the bus at the Barclays Center was just over 10 minutes at 7 a.m. today. But minutes are not the only way to measure a line.
The line was as long as half a medium coffee, or three-quarters of an egg and cheese sandwich, or 10 to 15 pages of the novel on your Kindle, granted that novel was a page-turner.
"I am rereading 'Game of Thrones,'" said Colin Wiggins, 30, who works in student affairs for CUNY in the northwest Bronx. "I chose this book because I knew I wanted something long and interesting for the next days."

 7:27 A.M. | A Cyclist and His Bike Take the Subway 
Clip-clopping up the escalators in his toe-clip cycling shoes in the F Line station, Demetrius Taylor shifted his bike on his right shoulder before heading up the stairs to Lexington Avenue on Friday morning around 6:45. Before Hurricane Sandy, he biked from his home in Elmont at the tip of Nassau County in Long Island to work on 54th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. That bike route takes him 65 minutes to be precise. By subway?
"An hour and a half," said Mr. Taylor, 23, who installs auto glass. "I've never brought the bike on the subway before. It was an experience, crowded."

 7:20 A.M. | Thousands Estimated Already at Barclays Bus Lines 
Police officers at the Barclays Center estimated that thousands of people had arrived and boarded shuttle buses by 6:30 a.m. "Well, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000? I don't know, it's hard to count," said a police officer from the 66th Precinct, as the line of largely black-clad commuters streamed behind him on Flatbush Avenue.
The new system, which involved a lap around the stadium, seemed to be working, decongesting the area immediately in front of the buses.
"This is the first time they've got stuff organized. I see things moving quicker," said Wesley Stevens, 28, who endured a three-and-a-half-hour commute yesterday from his home in Flatbush to the medical office on Madison and 72nd where he works in maintenance. But he was reluctant to declare the commute a success today. "That's the hardest thing, not knowing how long it's going to take."

Juno Rollins, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, took the F train on Friday morning, leaving 45 minutes early to get to his job at the New York City Housing Authority.
"It wasn't bad," Mr. Rollins said. "But it's really crowded." Like others at the station at 63rd and Lexington, Mr. Rollins took the train because he couldn't find gasoline in Queens.
"Where's Madison?" asked a woman emerging from the F train as she stood in a clutch of nannies arriving in Manhattan from Queens. Many of the women, detoured from the E train, were unfamiliar of the way to work and helped one another navigate the routes, before sunrise.

 7:06 A.M. | A Business-Like Mood in a Growing Bus Line 
At 6:15 a.m., the crowds started arriving in earnest at the Barclays Center. They were pressed into the zigzag of barricades by police officers and walked at a very quick pace, some of them even breaking into a run as they tried to move toward the front of what was suddenly becoming a very long line. 
Friends met in line; one man carried a miniature Chihuahua in a pouch hanging from his chest. There were a few smiles, and many a thumbs-up for the police officers. "Much better than yesterday, " one man said before he got onto the bus. Generally, however, the mood was business-like, even, one might say, grumpy.

 6:19 A.M. | With No Gasoline, a Subway Trek to the Airport 
Alexig Diaz of Manhattan and his wife thumped four suitcases down the stairs to the F train at 63rd and Lexington at 6:30 Friday morning. Were they headed to the airport?
"I hope so," said Mr. Diaz, 60. " There's no gasoline and we have to get to J.F.K.," he said. "Visiting relatives in the Caribbean."
The stream of passengers from Queens to Manhattan included others not familiar with the route. There was a nurse running too late to give her name who lives in Fort Lee, N.J. but is living with her sister in Queens until the power is restored. " I've never done this before so I'm not sure where I'm going," she said.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority installed additional agents at the subway stops, said the man in the information booth at the F train at 63rd and Lexington, who narrowed his eyes in mock anger when asked his name. "People are pretty well-behaved given the circumstances," he said, as people filed out of the station. Three New York police officers were dropped off at the station at 6 a.m. for "crowd control," one of them said.

 6:55 A.M. | A 5 A.M. Wake-up and a 6 A.M. Wave at Barclays 
All the commuters seem to have woken up at 5 a.m. to catch buses or the limited subway trains that were running to the Barclays Center. 
"Yep, 5 o'clock," said Kerry Marchesi, 26, who lives in Park Slope but had gone to Bay Ridge to get an express bus to the arena. Yesterday she called a car service, she said. Asked why she decided to brave the lines to the shuttle today, she said: "I work in finance. I've got no choice."
These early risers created the 6 a.m. wave, which created the first large crowd of the day.
"All the way down! Let's go! Let's go!" said a police officer, her arm waving commuters into short lines that deposited them beside the buses. She then repeated the command in Spanish.

 6:11 A.M. | Yesterday, a Carpool; Today, a Quick Subway Trip 
Although he was offered $20 from a driver to be the third passenger in a car bound to cross the Queensboro Bridge on Thursday, David Frazier, a bus driver headed to Manhattan from Jamaica, Queens, took the F train on Friday morning.
"I didn't take it," said Mr. Frazier, 49, with a laugh as he exited the station on Friday at 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue. "But I thanked him and took the free ride." The delay crossing the bridge was so late, Mr. Frazier thought about walking. The Friday morning subway commute was quick for him - he made it to the city by 5:45 a.m. - but getting home last night was difficult.
"There was a line here of people just waiting to get on the train," Mr. Frazier said, gesturing around the F Street station at 63rd Street. "People were frustrated." And the attitude of his bus patrons?
"Not too bad," he said, "people just want to get to work so they try to be patient."
- Stacey Stowe 
 6:39 A.M. | On F Line, 'Today, You're on Your Own' 
For some commuters emerging from the F line at 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue on Friday morning, commuting sounded like solving a geometry problem. Leslie Watson, 43, a supervisor for AM New York, said he took the M train over the F Line but that he'd normally take the E. Car and bus transportation is sketchy, and there are just two local trains running local.
"Yesterday, there were a couple of people from M.T.A. giving out information but otherwise, like today, you're on your own," Mr. Watson said. "Not bad, but not good. My commute was 12 minutes late."
"There's a tree down at 120th and Farmer's that has to be removed or the bus can't get by," said Mr. Watson, who added that the circulation of the morning commuting paper is back after being suspended for four days. "Gas is limited. I have friends going from Queens to the Bronx for gas."

 6:34 A.M. | In Early Hours, Brisk Lines at Barclays Center 
Commuters started arriving in larger numbers between 5 and 5:30 a.m. at the Barclays Center. If they got off at the Atlantic Avenue Barclays Center station they had to make a large loop around the Barclays Center; they filed briskly down Atlantic, crossed behind the hulking stadium and returned to the spot where shuttle buses were picking up passengers on Flatbush. There was virtually no wait. Commuters walked at a brisk pace and looked relieved to be taken directly onto buses, which nevertheless were packed to capacity before they took off.
"If it starts to get too crowded we will start moving them into this zigzag" of barricades, said a police officer from the 78th Precinct. His badge identified him as Davis. "Things are moving," said the officer. "Yesterday things were different."

 10:13 P.M. | On a Walk, Two Lives Lost 
Jessie Streich-Kest walked carefully through the dark and the gathering fury of a hurricane Monday, with a friend, Jacob Vogelman. They had her dog, Max, a big loveable mutt, on the leash, out for a quick walk around the block in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. 
Then the wind gusted harder, roots pulled free of the earth, and a many-ton tree fell on them. It would be the next morning before neighbors found the two young friends beneath the tangle of leaves and branches.
They were dead. They were both 24.
Ms. Streich-Kest was a vivacious newbie special education teacher at the High School for Social Justice in Bushwick, the child of Jon Kest and Fran Streich. 
Mr. Vogelman, a lanky young man with light, curly hair and a soft smile, grew up on the brownstone streets of Park Slope, attending Public School 321 and Leon M. Goldstein High School for the Sciences in Manhattan Beach. He graduated cum laude from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2010 with a degree in theater design. Mr. Vogelman is survived by his mother, Marcia Sikowitz, a housing court judge, and his father, Lawrence Vogelman, an attorney.
Like so many young men and women here, he scuffed to make his way in the arts, laboring as a stagehand at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and then at small theaters in New York. He was pursing a Master of Fine Arts at Brooklyn College, and his friends there talked of a talented young man, overflowing with ideas, ambition.

It was around the time that Hurricane Sandy's winds were starting to barrel north toward the Carolinas that Bill Fletcher set the date, this Friday, to open Fletcher's Brooklyn Barbecue, his new Gowanus restaurant.
He is staying the course and will open tomorrow. "We were lucky," he said. "We had no flooding and our power stayed on. There's lots of excitement here, the paper has come off the windows, and I think people are looking for a good time, to enjoy a plate of smoked meat and a beer."

The Defense Department, working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that the U.S.S. Wasp, a multipurpose amphibious assault ship, would be arriving off the coast of New York City on Thursday and two more ships would arrive on Friday.
The ships are just some of the many assets the military has made available to assist state and local governments in search and rescue missions and recovery efforts.
The military brought in 120 medical professionals and helped them set up in affected areas.
On Thursday, 55 military trucks carrying 1.5 million meals began arriving in New York from Charleston and Martinsburg, W.Va. The last truck was to arrive Thursday evening. There are also 1.3 million meals at vendor facilities, awaiting movement orders, and the military stands ready to increase the number of daily meals at FEMA's request.
The military is also positioned to help bring hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel to the region, the Defense Department said in a statement.
The military also continued to assist in the "unwatering" mission, bringing in 120 high-flow water pumps and 400 qualified workers to help run them.

 7:54 P.M. | Cuomo Speaks of Progress and Warns of Challenges 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said progress was being made on every front to recover from Hurricane Sandy, but he cautioned that there were great challenges ahead.
Mr. Cuomo warned vendors of critical supplies, including gasoline, not to take advantage of the situation.
"Do not try and gouge New Yorkers," he said at a news conference Thursday evening. "And don't try and take advantage of New Yorkers."
The governor said that he believed 99.9 percent of businesses and service providers had been acting responsibly, as nerves grow more and more frayed with each passing hour for people with no power. But he added that the state would not tolerate anyone exploiting the situation.
The most visible sign of progress for many New Yorkers will be the lights coming on at the World Trade Center construction site, where work was to resume Thursday evening.
Given the extent of the flooding at the site, Mr. Cuomo said that it was rather amazing that construction was up and running so soon.
He marveled at "seeing the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel turn into a flume" and "water cascading" into the site at "such a decibel level is was disorientating," to now, just a few days later, the site once again largely returned to normal.
New Yorkers "will see lights at that site again tonight," Mr. Cuomo said.
"New York goes back to work."
There was also incremental progress in restoring the transit system. In addition to the growing services on the train and subway systems, the governor said, one tunnel in the Holland Tunnel would be open for buses Friday morning.
"Leave the car at home," he said. "Take the bus."
The most pressing problem for many New Yorkers remained the power failures.
Mr. Cuomo did not provide new details on when service would be restored, but he said that he believed the utility companies were "working very hard to restore the power."
Still, he said, best efforts are not enough for most people.
It is a binary question, he said: "I have power or I don't have power."
To that end, he reminded the utilities that they rely on the state for licensing and other important matters and if it appeared they were not performing, actions could be taken.
"If the state believed they were not diligent," he said, the companies "could lose money and certification."
As New Yorkers start to seek assistance in rebuilding, the governor said, the state was trying to prevent the process from becoming a bureaucratic nightmare.
He also announced a toll-free number - 1-800-NYSANDY (1-800-697-2639) - that would begin fielding questions from residents Friday morning to help guide them in claiming funds.
Finally, Mr. Cuomo, reflecting on the entire disaster, talked about how water helped make New York City great and how it now had become a weapon that had crippled it.
This "little sliver of land," he said, is so solid that it allowed people to build "15, 20, 30 stories below the surface."
That whole honeycomb of construction is what allows the city to prosper, "until your greatest strength becomes you greatest weakness."
He said he believed that storms like Hurricane Sandy would become more common as the climate changes and that New York needed to prepare.
"I don't accept, 'Well, don't worry about it; it is never going to happen again,'" he said.

 7:24 P.M. | More Subway Service Restored 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced some new additions to its list of returning train service on Thursday night.
Some M train service was restored earlier on Thursday between Jamaica and 34th Street, the authority said. By midnight, the authority expected No. 7 trains to run from Main Street to 74th Street in Queens. And the authority's chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, said at a news briefing Thursday night that once power is restored in Lower Manhattan, service on No. 4 and 5 trains can return between Manhattan and Brooklyn.

 7:09 P.M. | Pumping Water From Subway Tunnels 
At a briefing on Thursday evening, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, described the daunting task of pumping water out of transit tunnels before power can be turned back on to get the entire subway system back in operation. 
The M.T.A. released video of pumping at the flooded South Ferry station on Thursday.

Mr. Cuomo also described the scale of the task ahead to restore all transportation links, including clearing out a mile of water in the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, known officially as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel in memory of a former governor, and about five miles of water in the PATH tubes that connect Manhattan to New Jersey along the Hudson riverbed.

 5:57 P.M. | Fuel Shortage Could Make Taxis Even Harder to Come By 
With a gas shortage besetting commuters across the region, even nondrivers could feel the pain on Friday. David S. Yassky, the city's taxi commissioner, said the shortage "will definitely reduce" the number of cabs on Friday if more fuel does not become available.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that New York Harbor had been reopened, which he expected would help bolster the fuel supply.

 5:37 P.M. | Casinos in Atlantic City to Remain Closed for Now 
Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday that there was no timetable for when the casinos in Atlantic City, which were not significantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy, might be reopened. 
Mr. Christie said a number of logistical problems remained: power had not been restored to all of Atlantic City, and residents were still being advised to boil their water because the storm had imperiled the city's water treatment system. But the governor said once those issues were resolved, he hoped to get the casinos back up and running.
"I certainly don't want to keep them closed a minute longer than I have to," the governor said, "because that costs them in terms of revenue and it costs the state in terms of revenue."
The casinos have been closed since Sunday, when the governor ordered them to shut down.

 4:48 PM | Utility Workers From 12 States Heading to New Jersey 
Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday afternoon that the governors of 12 other states had agreed to send utility workers to New Jersey to help restore power, including 1,500 from Virginia and 700 from Ohio. 
At a news briefing, Mr. Christie said President Obama had offered to provide large transport aircraft to ferry the utility workers' equipment to New Jersey if it would take too long to drive to the state. 
About 1.8 million households in New Jersey remained without power as of midday, Mr. Christie said, down from just over 2 million on Wednesday night.

 5:05 P.M. | Less Severe Storm Could Arrive Next Week 
Given the frayed nerves of many in the region just raked by Hurricane Sandy, and of political operatives around the country, 13 words at the top of an extended forecast discussion issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in College Park, Md., set off some alarm. Those words were the summary near the top of the preliminary forecast, which read:
NOR'EASTER POSSIBLE FOR MID-ATLANTIC/NEW ENGLAND STATES BY ELECTION DAY INTO NEXT THURSDAY
The forecast suggests that a deep cyclone moving down the west coast of Canada could set the conditions for a storm that would bring rain and wind, though not nearly as severe as the one from the past week to the northeastern United States in the early to middle of next week.
As Jason Samenow explains on The Washington Post's weather blog, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, "which snuffed out Sandy eight days before it hit, shows an area of low pressure developing off the Georgia/South Carolina coast the night of the election (November 6), and then moving up the coast into New England by Wednesday night."
Dan Hofmann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the possible storm appears to be "at this point, a week out," looks like it would arrive "more like the middle of the week," than on Election Day.
- Robert Mackey 
 4:58 P.M. | Death Toll in U.S. and Canada Now at 93 
The total death toll from the storm in the United States and Canada has climbed to 93 as of 3:45 p.m.
Here are the state-by-state totals, reported by Reuters.

        
New York State: 46 (38 in New York City)

HEADLINE: Poetry Pairing | 'Though Some Saith That Youth Ruleth Me'

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: In this week's Poetry Pairing, we match "Though Some Saith That Youth Ruleth Me," by King Henry VIII of England, with "Stung by Recession, Young Voters Shed Image as Obama Brigade." 

 BODY:
This week's Poetry Pairing matches "Though Some Saith That Youth Ruleth Me," by King Henry VIII of England, whose rule lasted from 1509 to his death in 1547, with "Stung by Recession, Young Voters Shed Image as Obama Brigade."
After reading the poem and article, tell us what you think - or suggest other Times content that could be matched with the poem instead.
 Poem 
 King Henry VIII wasn't the first - or last - ruler to have penned verse. His daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, also wrote poetry. And American presidents and politicians have, too, including Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president, and Benjamin Franklin, a founding father. 
 Though Some Saith That Youth Ruleth Me 
By King Henry VIII of England
Though some saith that youth ruleth me,
 I trust in age to tarry.
God and my right and my duty,
 From them I shall never vary,
 Though some say that youth ruleth me.
I pray you all that aged be,
 How well did ye your youth carry?
I think some worse, of each degree:
 Therein a wager lay dare I,
 Though some saith that youth ruleth me.
Pastimes of youth sometime among,
 None can say but necessary.
I hurt no man, I do no wrong,
 I love true where I did marry,
 Though some saith that youth ruleth me.
Then soon discuss that hence we must.
 Pray we to God and Saint Mary
That all amend, and here an end,
 Thus saith the king, the eighth Harry,
 Though some saith that youth ruleth me.
 Times Selection Excerpt 
In "Stung by Recession, Young Voters Shed Image as Obama Brigade," Susan Saulny writes about the youngest American registered voters and how they are likely to vote in the coming presidential election:
In 2008, Mr. Obama was the first to recognize the full power of the youth vote as a game changer, and his timing coincided with a political awakening among young Americans after a tumultuous period that included the Sept. 11 attacks, the beginning of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the government failures during Hurricane Katrina.
But since then, the mood of the country has changed. Beyond that, Republicans in several states have recently passed more restrictive election laws, which they say will fight fraud; Democrats say they will make it harder for some of their main constituencies - youths, for instance - to vote.
Mr. Tevlin, the Indiana student, said his exhaustive search for meaningful summer employment was so futile that he took a job cleaning toilets and septic tanks. "I think we're in pretty deep trouble, and the future, as far as jobs, is not looking good at all," he said.
A political science major, Mr. Tevlin has become more cynical over recent years. "I see lies and I hear lies, nothing gets past partisanship, and I don't believe anything," he said. "I think the party system is stupid."
In the last three general elections, young voters have given Democrats a majority of their votes, according to exit polls.
Today, specifically, the youngest potential voters are more likely than their older peers to think it is important to protect individual liberties from government, the Harvard data suggest, and less likely to think it is important to tackle things like climate change, health care or immigration.
After reading the poem and the article, tell us what you think - or suggest other Times content that could be matched with the poem instead.

HEADLINE: Oct. 31: Obama's Electoral College 'Firewall' Holding in Polls

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama continues to hold the lead in the vast majority of polls in Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Iowa, the states that represent his path of least resistance toward winning the Electoral College. This was particularly apparent on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
On Oct. 11, this blog posed the question of whether President Obama's "firewall" in battleground states was all that it was cracked up to be. 
At that point, Mr. Obama still technically held the lead in the FiveThirtyEight forecast in enough states to give him 270 electoral votes. But Colorado, Florida and Virginia had turned red in our map, meaning that our forecast suggested that Mitt Romney had better-than-even odds of winning them. Iowa was just on the verge of doing so. And Mr. Obama's lead was down to just a percentage point or so in Ohio, which would have collapsed his firewall at its foundation. 
Theories that the decline in Mr. Obama's polls that followed the first presidential debate in Denver would somehow skip the swing states were not looking good - as dubious as the idea that tornadoes "skip" houses.
Instead, at that point, Mr. Obama's position in the FiveThirtyEight forecast had declined for seven consecutive days. If he stopped the bleeding there, he might still be the Electoral College favorite, albeit a narrow one. But it wasn't clear where the bottom was.
It turned out, however, that the worst was almost over for him. Mr. Obama had one more terrible day in the polls, on Friday, Oct. 12, when Mr. Romney's chances of winning the Electoral College rose to almost 40 percent in the forecast. But that was when Mr. Romney's momentum stopped. 
Since then, Mr. Obama's standing has rebounded slightly. His position in the national polls has stabilized; although the national polls continue to tell a different story about the race than the state polls do; it can no longer be said that they have Mr. Obama behind. (More about that in a moment.) 
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama continues to hold the lead in the vast majority of polls in Iowa, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin, the states that represent his path of least resistance toward winning the Electoral College. This was particularly apparent on Wednesday, a day when there were a remarkable number of polls, 27, released in the battleground states.
There were 12 polls published on Wednesday among Iowa, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin. Mr. Obama held the lead in 11 of the 12 surveys; the exception was a survey by the University of Iowa, which had Mr. Obama down by about one point there, but also had a very small sample size (about 300 likely voters). On average, Mr. Obama led in the polls of these states by 3.9 percentage points.
None of this ought to have been surprising, exactly, if you have been attentive to the polls rather than the pundits. It was a pretty good day of surveys for Mr. Obama but not a great one: for the most part, the polls were coming in close to FiveThirtyEight forecasts in each state, give or take a modest outlier here and there.
Rather, the polls in these states confirmed what we already knew: that Mr. Obama remains the favorite in the Electoral College. 
Mr. Obama is not a sure thing, by any means. It is a close race. His chances of holding onto his Electoral College lead and converting it into another term are equivalent to the chances of an N.F.L. team winning when it leads by a field goal with three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. There are plenty of things that could go wrong, and sometimes they will.
But it turns out that an N.F.L. team that leads by a field goal with three minutes left to go winds up winning the game 79 percent of the time. Those were Mr. Obama's chances in the FiveThirtyEight forecast as of Wednesday: 79 percent.
Not coincidentally, these are also about Mr. Obama's chances of winning Ohio, according to the forecast. 
Regular readers will have seen the chart below once or twice before. It sorts the competitive states in order of Mr. Obama's current projected margin of victory or defeat in each one, keeping a running tally of the number of electoral votes that Mr. Obama is accumulating.
Ohio remains the tipping-point state in the forecast, the one that puts him over the top to 270 electoral votes. There, Mr. Obama leads by 2.6 percentage points, which should convert to a victory about 80 percent of the time given the historical accuracy of polls at this late stage of the race.
Mr. Romney's chances of winning the Electoral College without Ohio - a prospect we had defended as being plausible before - are looking more tenuous based on the most recent polling.
If Mr. Obama wins Ohio, and all the states above it on the chart, he'd have 281 electoral votes, meaning that he has 11 to spare. That means he could shed New Hampshire from his list, along with either Iowa or Nevada (although not both). 
Of these two states, Nevada appears to be the slightly safer one for Mr. Obama; there, Mr. Obama leads by 3.5 percentage points in the forecast, as opposed to 2.9 percentage points in Iowa. The polling has also been somewhat more consistent in Nevada than in Iowa, another factor that the forecast considers in evaluating the probability of an upset.
One fortunate aspect of these two particular states, from Mr. Obama's view, is that they are not very similar to one another demographically. 
Iowa is quite rural. Nevada occupies a huge geographical territory, but its population is very urban, mostly living in Las Vegas and its suburbs. 
Iowa is overwhelmingly white, and has a lot of moderate and middle-income, but highly educated, voters. Nevada certainly has an independent streak, but winning there usually depends more upon building a 50 percent coalition among diverse groups and then turning it out to vote. Iowa has a pretty good economy, all things considered; Nevada's is still terrible.
Since Mr. Obama only needs to carry one of these states, it helps him that they form a diverse portfolio. If Mr. Obama's turnout operation is strong, then Nevada should be one of the states where he benefits the most. If, instead, Mr. Obama has little "ground game" advantage, but he holds his own among independent and undecided voters, perhaps persuading them that the economy has improved enough to merit his re-election, Iowa may fall for him.
Mr. Romney could also circumvent his need to win Ohio by carrying Wisconsin, but that is looking tough for him. In Ohio, Mr. Romney is behind by two or three percentage points, on average, in the polls. In Wisconsin, Mr. Romney's better polls have him down by two or three points, while his worst ones have him six to eight points instead. There's still enough upside to winning Wisconsin that Mr. Romney should not give up on it, in my view, but his chances are down to 12 percent in the forecast, and most of those cases involve outcomes where he has already won Ohio anyway.
The more debatable cases are Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota. Mr. Romney is the clear underdog in each one. But his campaign has so much money that it probably doesn't hurt Mr. Romney much to spend a little bit of it there to maximize whatever residual chances he might have in case the polls are wrong. (Arguably, it was a poor strategic decision for Mr. Romney to make a half-hearted effort to compete in these states.)
Still, for Mr. Romney to win Michigan, Minnesota, or Pennsylvania, the polls would have to be much further off than they are in Ohio. 
It doesn't help Mr. Romney, either, that all of these states are in the same part of the country as Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin, meaning that they are unlikely to leapfrog them and become the tipping-point state on Tuesday. If, hypothetically, Mr. Romney's polling were a bit better in culturally and geographically disparate states, like Oregon, New Jersey or New Mexico, they might represent better targets.
If Mr. Obama were to lose Ohio (but hold the other states), the tipping-point would then become Colorado. There, Mr. Obama holds a much more tenuous lead, about one percentage point in our forecast, which converts to about a 60 percent chance of winning. But at least it's a lead rather than a deficit, whereas Mr. Romney's non-Ohio paths would require him to win states where he is now three or four percentage points behind. 
Mr. Obama also remains about a 60 percent favorite in Virginia. Another option would be Florida, although it is a resource-intensive state and we give him about a 40 percent chance of winning there.
While state polls dominated the news on Wednesday, there were also a handful of national polls out, even as others have been suspended in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. 
On average, Mr. Obama led by just over one percentage point in these national polls, although it is an odd distribution, with two polls showing him up by four or five points, several showing a tied race, and one (the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll) putting him two points down.
The FiveThirtyEight model calculates a national poll average, using a more sophisticated method than the simple average I've taken in the chart. (The model doesn't "forget" about the Gallup poll, for example, just because it has been suspended for a couple of days.) 
We don't usually print this number, because it would sew confusion: our estimate of the national popular vote, which we do publish, instead represents a combination of national polls and the implied standing of the candidates based on state polls. 
But, for what it's worth, our national poll average shows Mr. Obama up by about half a percentage point right now. This is within the range of other Web sites: Real Clear Politics has an exactly tied race in its national poll average; HuffPost Pollster has Mr. Obama down by three-tenths of a point; Talking Points Memo has Mr. Obama ahead by about one percentage point.
Again: we don't take the average of the national polls to be tantamount to a forecast of the national popular vote, since state polls, if considered carefully, can provide considerable information about the national race as well.
Suppose, however, that Mr. Obama were to tie Mr. Romney in the popular vote on Tuesday. The way that the forecast model works, this would require subtracting some from Mr. Obama in each state in order for the arithmetic to add up.
Even under these conditions, Mr. Obama would still be a favorite in the forecast. In fact, he'd be about a 70 percent favorite to win the Electoral College conditional upon the national popular vote being tied, according to our simulations.
A tie in the national popular vote is a tolerable condition for Mr. Obama, in other words. His position is robust enough in states like Ohio that he has some slack. With a lead of about 2.5 percentage points in the tipping-point states, Mr. Obama could underperform his state polls by a point or two and still win.
Conversely, Mr. Romney has few chances to win unless the state polls are systematically wrong. 
I don't mean for this to sound dismissive; the polling error could quite easily be correlated across the different states, and the national polls are one reason to be suspicious of the state polls.
But we're at the point now where Mr. Obama may be a modest favorite even if the national polls are right. Two weeks ago, when Mr. Obama appeared to trail Mr. Romney by a point or so in the national polls, that would not have been the case.
Is it possible that Mr. Obama has benefited, politically, from his handling of Hurricane Sandy? He has gotten high marks for it so far, according to the tracking poll run by The Washington Post and ABC News.
Our database contains roughly a dozen polls that conducted the bulk of their interviews on Tuesday or Wednesday, after Hurricane Sandy became the dominant news story. Most of these are state polls, and most were conducted in states that were isolated from the major effects of the storm.
Our analysis of the trend lines in the polls suggest that they have been a somewhat above-average group for Mr. Obama, perhaps suggesting a percentage point or so of improvement for him. 
The model is not yet pricing in very much of this into its forecast, as trends like that can occur fairly easily because of statistical noise. But if the storm has a discernible effect in the polls, it seems more likely to help Mr. Obama than to hurt him based on what we've seen so far. 
This is something to monitor as more national polls come back online. I think describing the race as a "toss-up" reflects an uninformed interpretation of the evidence, but there is surely room to debate how much of a favorite Mr. Obama is. However, Mr. Romney is not in a position to tolerate any movement in Mr. Obama's favor given how close we are to the finish line.

HEADLINE: Unemployment and the Swing States

BYLINE: TERESA TRITCH


HIGHLIGHT: State-level data bodes well for President Obama. 

 BODY:
Friday, November 2nd, will bring the last monthly jobs report before the election, with national data through October. The importance of those numbers for the presidential contest is indisputable, but it's also worth looking at the jobless rates in swing states. And state-level data, which the Labor Department released weeks ago, bodes well for President Obama.
The state-specific report found that unemployment fell in 41 states and the District of Columbia in September, including in five of seven toss-up states - Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin. In the two other key undecided states - New Hampshire and Virginia - jobless rates were unchanged.

The jobless rate also ticked down last month in Arizona and North Carolina-two states that lean Republican but are still in play-as well as in Nevada, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico-all of which tilt Democratic. It inched up slightly in light blue Pennsylvania.
The new state data is roughly consistent with national figures from September, which showed overall unemployment at 7.8 percent, down from 8.1 percent in August - and 9 percent a year ago.
The most encouraging news is arguably from Florida, where the labor force is growing and unemployment is down from 10.4 percent a year ago to 8.7 percent recently.
Declining unemployment rates don't necessarily mean job prospects are better across the board. In fourteen states, the jobless rate remains measurably higher than the national rate. And in several states, including Ohio, improvement in the jobless rate is partly due to workers dropping out of the labor force.
While those facts don't erase progress - Ohio's unemployment rate, for example, has dropped from 8.6 percent a year ago to 7 percent recently--they do reflect the depth of joblessness from the Great Recession and the challenges that remain on the long road back to full employment.
Still, according to pollsters and analysts, what matters most electorally is the trend in unemployment, not the level of joblessness. The trend in the swing states favors Mr. Obama.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
 In the final stretch of the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney has used his stump speeches to move from the partisan edges of the Republican nominating contest to the center of American politics. Michael Barbaro writes that Mr. Romney's tonal shift-- and his adoption of President Obama's "change" mantra -- "risks raising the questions about consistency and authenticity that have dogged him, tracking with his muddied stance" on social issues.

        
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney put their presidential rivalry on hold for another day to focus on relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy. Mark Landler and Michael Barbaro write that Mr. Obama toured storm-ravaged parts of New Jersey with Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a Romney ally, offering a glimmer of bipartisanship. The highly visible presence of the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed big government muscle and forced Mr. Romney to defend his small-government vision in Florida, where he turned a campaign stop into a supply drive.

        
In Virginia, the dueling campaigns in a Senate race resumed a fierce contest for votes on the ground. Jonathan Weisman writes that in a race that could be decided by a point or two, the campaigns of former Senator George Allen, a Republican, and former Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, are deploying armies of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls to voters as the election draws near.

        
The sunny idealism once found in abundance among young campaign volunteers in 2008 has given way to a dreary realism among the crop of volunteers for the 2012 campaigns. Jesse McKinley writes about young volunteers for Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney who have been sobered by a bad economy that is stifling their careers. Happening in Washington: Economic reports expected today include third-quarter productivity and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. followed at 10 by data on construction spending for September, weekly mortgage rates and a manufacturing index for October.

HEADLINE: Clinton Assails Romney on Swing Through Ohio

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Bill Clinton took the Romney campaign to task for its ad suggesting Chrysler might move jobs to China as he continued on the trail for President Obama. 

 BODY:
PERRYSBURG, Ohio -- Bill Clinton swept through a campaign visit to Ohio on behalf of President Obama on Thursday, blasting Mitt Romney and his surrogates for implying that Jeep might begin manufacturing vehicles in China at the expense of American jobs and for suggesting that Colin L. Powell endorsed Mr. Obama because both men are black.
Mr. Clinton, 66, started the day with a campaign stop in Wisconsin and made his first Ohio stop here, outside Toledo, his voice as hoarse as it often was 20 years ago when he campaigned for president. Much of his appearance was a reprise of his speech at the Democratic National Convention and other campaign talks that have praised Mr. Obama's economic, health care and student loan policies.
"My voice is a little weak," he told a crowd of about 1,900 students and other supporters at Owens Community College. "But I wasted it in a good cause."
In fact, the pace of his appearances for Mr. Obama was evident a few minutes into his speech when Mr. Clinton said, "I'm honored to be here in Pennsylvania to support President Obama."
"Ohio!" many in the crowd shouted.
"I have a Pennsylvania line in the speech," Mr. Clinton explained. But it was a forgiving crowd. "It's O.K," one woman screamed. "Give 'em hell, Bill," a man shouted a few minutes later.

Mr. Clinton reveled in the opportunity to attack Mr. Romney over the Republican ticket's widely criticized commercial that left the misleading impression that Chrysler -- the corporate parent of Jeep - would build Jeeps in China at the expense of American jobs. The automaker says it is discussing new Jeep production in China for sales within China, but that would not affect jobs in the United States, and that it is adding workers in Toledo. The Romney campaign has stood by the accuracy of the commercial.
"Mr. Romney has come into Ohio time and time again and tied himself in knots," Mr. Clinton said. "So what's their latest scam? You've probably seen it -- they say that Jeep is moving jobs to China." Many in the crowd also shouted "China!" as Mr. Clinton said it, almost drowning his raspy voice.
"The truest thing the Romney campaign ever said was, they have no intention of having their campaign be dictated by fact-checkers," Mr. Clinton added.
Mr. Clinton also took a shot at John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor and one of Mr. Romney's chief surrogates, who last week had suggested that Mr. Powell, the former secretary of state under George W. Bush, may have endorsed Mr. Obama for a second time because they are both of the same race.
"Oh, he endorsed him because they are both black," Mr. Clinton said, using his own paraphrase of Mr. Sununu's comments. (Mr. Sununu had quickly backtracked last week, saying he did not doubt Mr. Powell's endorsement was based on anything other than support for Mr. Obama's policies.)
And Mr. Clinton wasn't finished. He mentioned how the Romney campaign had, in Mr. Clinton's words, stated that "now the Italians are taking your jobs away." (Chrysler is majority-owned by Fiat - the "Italians" - and the Romney commercial's voiceover had stated that Mr. Obama had "sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job." Text shown on the screen had also said, "Plans to return Jeep output to China.")
Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, e-mailed his employees earlier this week to "unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China," adding that "it is inaccurate to suggest anything different."
Mr. Clinton, who says he has Irish ancestry, closed his remarks here by joking, "Pretty soon, they'll come after the Irish - and I'm toast."

HEADLINE: In Defense of the Undecided

BYLINE: LYNN VAVRECK


HIGHLIGHT: They may pay less attention to the news, but voters who take their time choosing between Obama and Romney have some admirable qualities. 

 BODY:
The caricatures flourish. People who can't agree on anything political find common ground on one point: undecided voters are vapid, disengaged and a little bit frightening.
And yet there they are, still part of the electorate. Over the past few weeks, I have been using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project to explore the thoughts and feelings of voters who were undecided last December. The takeaway has been that they are typically less interested in politics; they pay less attention to news in general; and they are more likely to have moderate ideas on contemporary political questions (but 30 percent report that they have no political ideas at all). So far, the caricature pretty much holds.
They are also more likely to be women (63 percent), more likely to have less than a high school education; less likely to hold a graduate degree; and more likely to have family incomes of less than $30,000 a year.
The data, however, also reveal that almost half of the undecided consider themselves Democrats or Republicans. But even this cue is not as strong for them - only 65 percent eventually choose their party's candidate (as opposed to 95 percent of early-deciding partisans).
It is possible that political signals like party mean less to late-deciders because politics is like a foreign country to them. But another possibility is that some of their ideas conflict with the positions their putative party takes.
Here's an example. On the question of whether to raise taxes on families earning more than $200,000 a year, most Democrats say yes - roughly 80 percent of early-deciding and undecided voters favor this policy. But among Republicans, 60 percent of early deciders oppose this policy while only a quarter of undecided voters oppose it. Even at the highest levels of income (more than $100,000 a year), the difference among Republican early and late deciders on this issue is more than 30 points.
Similar differences can be found on whether undocumented immigrants who have been living in the United States should have a legal path to citizenship. Compared to early-deciding Democrats, undecided Democrats are more than 30 points less likely to favor the pathway; undecided Republicans are 20 points less likely to oppose it compared to their co-partisans.
But these out-of-step late-deciding semi-partisans do not always abandon their party at the ballot box. Conflicted, undecided Democrats are more likely (75 percent to 25) to break for Romney over Obama if they oppose raising taxes on the rich, but no more likely to break for Romney if they oppose the pathway to citizenship. The reverse is true for conflicted, undecided Republicans - more likely to choose Obama if they disagree with Republicans on immigration, but no more likely to choose Obama if they disagree with Romney on taxing the rich.
Looked at in this light, the undecided actually exemplify a type of political flexibility we often claim to admire, but often denigrate in practice. A healthy portion of undecided voters seem to understand when they are out of step with their party and this sometimes drives them to the opposing candidate. They may not be as interested in news or politics as you are, but they consider their preferences relative to party positions when making up their minds. Adjust those caricatures.
Let's briefly move away from party to another canonical driver of voter choice in American elections: attitudes about race. Despite the subject's prevalence in 2008, when the economic collapse portended a strong Democratic victory, the discussion of race has been conspicuously absent in 2012 or at least much less of a focus. The problem with this is that the 2012 election is going to be much closer. Attitudes about race could be pivotal in a way they almost surely could not have been in 2008, when we couldn't stop talking about it.
I've modeled votes for Obama or Romney separately for early deciders and initially undecided voters using only party identification, ideology, retrospective evaluations of the nation's economy, and a measure called racial resentment.
Racial resentment is one of a set of regularly used political science measures of attitudes about race. It is born from the concept of symbolic racism, which has its share of critics. Essentially, it is a scale of four survey questions asking people to agree or disagree with questions about whether "generations of slavery" have made it hard for blacks to work their way up the economic ladder - or whether blacks would be as well off as whites if they only "tried harder."
Racial resentment is related to voter choice for every presidential election in modern history. Interestingly, even within the 2008 Democratic primary, these attitudes robustly predicted a voter's choice between Obama and Hillary Clinton. Evidence from 2008 also suggests that racial resentment plays a larger role when Obama is running relative to others who have run for president before.
Here is what the relationship looks like in 2012 plotting across deciles of resentment in the overall sample. After controlling for party, ideology and economic judgments, increasing levels of racial resentment (moving from left to right on the horizontal axis) decrease the likelihood of voting for Obama - not a shock. But here's where it gets interesting. For voters who were able to make up their minds early, moving from the lowest levels of resentment to the highest drops the chance of their voting for Obama by more than 70 points. The comparable drop among initially undecided voters is only slightly more than 10 points.
As we saw with party, attitudes about race among the undecided are related to their choices, but the relationship is weaker than it is for those who decide early. In other words, the racial attitudes of undecided voters do not affect their vote for or against Obama as dramatically as those same attitudes affect otherwise-similar early deciders.
On the one hand, this could be interpreted as more good news - another blow at the caricature. Perhaps undecided voters are truly post-racial. If race mattered to them as much as it does early deciders, they'd have already made up their minds, as the more partisan do. Maybe these voters are the ones who have moved "beyond" race, at least in terms of their candidate selection.
On the other hand, I'm already catching sight of Seth Meyers over at "Saturday Night Live " working on the next skit about undecided voters with the too-good-to-pass-up punch line: "Wait, what do you mean the president's black?"

HEADLINE: Liberty to Lie

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: A significant number of voters who admit that they don't trust Mitt Romney say that they're going to vote for him anyway. What gives? 

 BODY:
This election may go down in history as the moment when truth and lies lost their honor and stigma, respectively.
Mitt Romney has demonstrated an uncanny, unflinching willingness to say anything and everything to win this election. And that person, the unprincipled prince of untruths, is running roughly even with or slightly ahead of the president in the national polls.
What does this say about our country? What does it say about the value of virtue?
The list of Romney's out-and-out lies (and yes, there is no other more polite word for them) is too long to recount here. So let's just take one of the most recent ones: the utterly false claim that General Motors and Chrysler shipped, or planned to ship, American auto jobs to China.
First, let's take on the Chrysler claim.
On Saturday, The Des Moines Register endorsed Mitt Romney because it thought that he would be "the stronger candidate" to forge "compromises in Congress." On Tuesday, the news side of that same publication fact-checked Romney's Chrysler-China claim and found that it was a lie.
According to the Register:
Mitt Romney first told a crowd in Ohio on Thursday that Chrysler was shifting the production of Jeeps to China. Then he aired an ad claiming that President Obama "sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China." (The clear impression in the ad is that American jobs will be lost.) Neither is true.
The paper continued:
Jeep sales have nearly tripled since 2009, according to Chrysler, and the company has added 4,600 jobs to its Jeep plants since then. Another 1,100 jobs will be added at an Ohio plant next year. Sales of Jeep in China have grown in recent years and Chrysler plans to resume vehicle production there, but not at the expense of American jobs.
Now on to GM. The Romney ad claims that "under President Obama, GM cut 15,000 American jobs, but they are planning to double the number of cars built in China, which means 15,000 more jobs for China."
This drew a sharp rebuke from GM: 
We've clearly entered some parallel universe during these last few days. No amount of campaign politics at its cynical worst will diminish our record of creating jobs in the U.S. and repatriating profits back to this country.
Factcheck.org went into more detail to disprove Romney's claim:
The Romney radio ad also claims - correctly - that GM has cut 15,000 U.S. jobs under Obama. It's true that 13,000 U.S. hourly employees and 5,000 salaried workers accepted a buyout offer in 2009 to either retire early or voluntarily leave the company, according to GM's 2009 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Web site continued:
But those numbers don't tell the whole story. GM eliminated old brands and shuttered dealerships when it went through bankruptcy in 2009 - resulting in fewer jobs. The alternative was to go out of business entirely.
And made one further point:
The radio ad goes on to falsely claim that the reduction in GM's U.S. payroll "means 15,000 more jobs for China." That's not true. As we wrote once before, GM is expanding operations in China to meet increased demand there for its vehicles. The increase in its China operations is unrelated to its U.S. operations.
Romney wouldn't acknowledge the truth if it kissed him on the cheek. In fact, Romney seems to have decided that the only things standing between him and the White House are stubborn facts. He continues to roll right over them.
The question is: will this scurrilous tactic have negative consequences?
Unfortunately, there is some evidence that facts and the people who check them don't carry the same weight that they once did.
First, the right's disinformation machine is, explicitly and implicitly, making the argument that facts (science, math, evidence) are fungible and have been co-opted by liberal eggheads. They have declared war on facts in response to what they claim is a liberal war on faith.
This is an utterly false and ridiculous argument, but it works on some people.
According to a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News Swing State poll released Wednesday, President Obama has a 9 percentage point lead over Romney in Ohio among likely voters on the question of who is honest and trustworthy (most people thought that the president was honest while most would not say the same about Romney). But that same poll found that the president only had a 5-point lead in the horse race numbers in Ohio.
The president had a similarly large lead on the honesty question in Florida in Virginia, but in those states the poll found the race to be virtually tied - the president had a small lead that was within the margin of error.
How is it that so many people are willing to support a man who they don't believe is honest or trustworthy?
The poll also found that most voters didn't believe that Romney cared about their problems. On the other hand, at least 60 percent of voters in each state said that they believed that the president cared about their problems.
Who votes for a man who doesn't care about you over a man who does?
I recognize that Obama hatred is a real thing, but disliking the president so much that you would do harm to yourself by voting for someone who you admit you don't trust seems to be taking things to extremes.
All the voters who are aware of Romney's fact-mangling but vote for him anyway must ask themselves this question: are they granting him the liberty to lie?

HEADLINE: Data Shows Twitter Posts That Resonate With Electorate

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: Twitter has introduced an interactive map showing which of the presidential candidates' posts drove the most engagement- measured by the number of times the Tweet was retweeted or "favorited" on Twitter - at the national and state levels. 

 BODY:
In Florida, voters responded most when Mitt Romney posted about education and when President Obama did the same about foreign affairs. In Ohio, Mr. Obama's posted about gay rights, more so than any other topic, held the most traction. For Mr. Romney, it was his posts about the economy.
Twitter introduced aninteractive mapon Thursday showing which of the candidates' Tweets drove the most engagement - measured by the number of times the Tweet was reposted or favorited - on Twitter at the national and state levels.
Nationwide, Mr. Obama's most popular post was, "No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money." His second most popular post was actually a quote from Vice President Biden about women's rights: "VP Biden: I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people, women, that they can't control their bodies." Interestingly, at the state level, that post resonated most with voters in Wyoming, followed by Iowa, South Dakota and West Virginia - states where women's rights are not considered the pivotal issue.
Mr. Romney's most popular post was this remark on Sept. 11th: "On this most somber day, America is united under God in its quest for peace and freedom at home and across the world." Second most popular was a comment about wealth distribution: "I am running for president to get us creating wealth again - not to redistribute it."
In swing states, Twitter's map tells an interesting, and sometimes counter intuitive story. According to the latest polls, Virginia, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Colorado and Florida are still toss-ups.
In the last presidential election, the President won Virginia by seven percentage points. This year, the race is expected to be much closer. There, voters' response was highest when the candidates posted about issues related to retirement.
The same was true for Wisconsin. Democrats carried the state in the last six presidential elections, but the addition of one of their own, Representative Paul D. Ryan, to Mr. Romney's ticket has kept the race tight. There, retirement was also the issue that seemed to have the most traction on Twitter.
In Iowa, where six electoral votes are up for grabs, voters were most engaged when Mr. Obama posted about topics related to energy and the environment and when Romney posted about health care.
Nevada voters responded most to Obama's comments on taxes. Mr. Obama's most popular post in that state was "1,240,000 middle-class families in Nevada could face a tax increase under Mitt Romney." Mr. Romney's posts about education drove the highest level of engagement. "With over 60k jobs lost & the highest unemployment rate in the nation, Nevadans aren't better off under @BarackObama," was Mr. Romney's most popular post.
In Colorado, women's issues have taken center stage after women proved crucial to two Democratic victories in the 2010 races for Senate and governor. But according to Twitter's data, Colorado voters responded in the largest numbers when Mr. Obama posted about taxes. For Mr. Romney, it was his remarks about terrorism.
If, as in the 2004 election, the race comes down to Florida, then the candidates may do well to defy conventional wisdom that retirement is all Florida voters care about. Within Florida, Mr. Romney's posts about retirement did not resonate as well as those about education and foreign affairs. Likewise, Mr. Obama's posts about topics relevant to retirement had less traction than his those about terrorism and foreign affairs.
Despite the perception that Twitter is just a place for East and West coasters to talk to each other, Twitter's map shows a surprising level of engagement in states like Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma. The opposite proved true for New Hampshire and Vermont, where Twitter noted it was not able to collect enough data to draw conclusions.

HEADLINE: Meeker's Address on the State of USA Inc.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: In an update to her USA Inc. report presented at an investor conference last week, Mary Meeker, a former top analyst at Morgan Stanley, argued that the country's fiscal problems had only gotten worse. 

 BODY:
Mary Meeker still thinks that the American economy is a business in need of an overhaul.
Ms. Meeker, a former Morgan Stanley star analyst turned venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, gained attention last year with a report on USA Inc., looking at the government as a corporation whose budget was sorely out of whack. 
And, in an update to the plan presented at an investor conference in San Francisco last week, she argued that the problem had only gotten worse.
 Ms. Meeker says that the country's expenses -- think programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- outstripped revenue by 56 percent. That compares with a difference, or what she calls net margin, of just 7 percent 15 years ago. And tax breaks exceeded $1 trillion last year, which she argues accounted for 83 percent of the deficit in cash flow.
Ms. Meeker adds a few more points to her latest USA Inc. presentation as well. She cites a Pew Research Center poll from December that showed that 49 percent of adults aged 18 years to 29 years viewed socialism favorably. And she points out that the United States tax code contains 859 times more words than the Constitution.
"It's time for a 're-org' of USA Inc.," she writes.

HEADLINE: Hurt by $1.6 Billion Charge, Lloyds Bank Posts a Loss

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Lloyds Banking Group set aside an additional $1.6 billion to compensate clients who were sold insurance inappropriately, as the firm reported a net loss in the third quarter. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Lloyds Banking Group said on Thursday that it had set aside an additional £1 billion ($1.6 billion) to compensate clients who were sold insurance inappropriately.
The announcement brings the bank's total compensation provisions to more than £5 billion, and pushed Lloyds into a net loss for the third quarter. The bank is partly owned by the British government after receiving a multibillion-pound bailout during the financial crisis.
The majority of Britain's largest banks, including HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, have been required to set aside more than a combined £10 billion to compensate clients who were inappropriately sold payment protection insurance, which covered customers if they were laid off or became ill. Many customers did not know they had been sold the insurance when they took out loans or mortgages. Others have found it difficult to make claims on the policies, which often paid out only small amounts.
On Wednesday, Barclays announced it had added £700 million to its previously announced £1.3 billion combined figure to reimburse affected clients.
Barclays, which agreed to a $450 million settlement with British and American authorities in July connected to a rate-rigging scandal, is also facing additional legal scrutiny. On Wednesday, the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recommended a $470 million fine related to past energy trading activities in the bank's American operations. Barclays, which has 30 days to respond to the commission, said it would defend itself against the inquiry.
Lloyds said on Thursday that had a net loss of £361 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, a slight improvement from the £501 million loss in the period a year earlier. Excluding adjustments, Lloyds said its third-quarter pretax profit doubled, to £840 million.
The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its ability to weather financial shocks, also rose slightly, to 11.5 percent.
Shares in the Lloyds Banking Group increased 3.5 percent in morning trading in London on Thursday.

HEADLINE: The Latest Headache at Barclays

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Barclays faces accusations that it manipulated California energy markets. | JPMorgan Chase is going after the boss of the traders known as the London Whale. | The major American exchanges had a largely uneventful day of trading on Wednesday after being shut down for two days because of Hurricane Sandy. 

 BODY:
THE LATEST HEADACHE AT BARCLAYS | The legal battles just won't go away at the British bank Barclays. Just months after reaching a settlement in a case that involved rigging a key benchmark interest rate, the bank now faces accusations that it manipulated California energy markets. Federal regulators are seeking $469.9 million in penalties from the bank, and $18 million from four former traders.
Regulators, relying on e-mail evidence, claim that four traders at Barclays manipulated energy prices to profit on swap contracts. One trader said a particular strategy was "fun," while another said he was "trying to drive price" in his swap bet, according to messages cited by Reuters. Barclays, which has 30 days to officially respond to the regulators, said it disagreed with the claims and that its "trading was legitimate and in compliance with applicable law." The bank disclosed on Wednesday that it also faced an investigation into its capital-raising efforts during the financial crisis.
Another British bank, the Lloyds Banking Group, is also dealing with legal woes. Lloyds said on Thursday that it had set aside an additional $1.6 billion for clients who were sold payment protection insurance inappropriately. That provision helped push the bank to a net loss in the third quarter.
 JPMORGAN TAKES ACTION OVER LOSS | JPMorgan Chase is going after the boss of the trader known as the London Whale. The bank is suing Javier Martin-Artajo, a former executive who supervised Bruno Iksil, the trader who built up the position that resulted in a $6.2 billion loss. While the details of the claims were not disclosed, an internal investigation conducted by JPMorgan found that some traders in Mr. Martin-Artajo's division might have improperly valued their positions. "Some phone recordings suggest that Mr. Martin-Artajo encouraged Mr. Iksil to value troubled positions favorably, according to people with knowledge of the investigation," Jessica Silver-Greenberg writes in The New York Times.
HAUNTED BY MF GLOBAL | A year after MF Global collapsed, federal authorities "have all but cleared" executives of the brokerage firm of criminal wrongdoing, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. "The government has yet to usher in a wider overhaul of futures trading rules, save for certain piecemeal policy changes. And the profit-making exchanges that rely on brokerage firms for business still police the futures industry, presenting potential conflicts of interest." The debacle may be fading from Wall Street's memory, but it has left customers shaken. "The general tenor is fear," said James L. Koutoulas, chief executive of a hedge fund client of MF Global and the leader of a group of customers trying to get their money back. With customers still owed millions of dollars, Mr. Protess writes, some traders are simply sitting on the sidelines.
ON THE AGENDA | Restoration Hardware is expected to price its I.P.O. on Thursday evening and is looking to raise as much as $123.9 million. ExxonMobil reports earnings before the opening bell, while A.I.G. and Starbucks announce results after the market closes. The ADP employment report comes out at 8:30 a.m., and the ISM manufacturing survey for October and construction spending for September are both out at 10 a.m. Get ready for a politically significant unemployment report on Friday. Mary Meeker of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is on CNBC at 7:40 a.m. on Thursday. Robert H. Benmosche, the chief executive of A.I.G., is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m. The Women's Alternative Investment Summit, which features speakers from private equity, venture capital and other industries, is scheduled to start Thursday at the Pierre hotel in New York.
A MOSTLY SMOOTH TRADING DAY | Sometimes no news is good news. The major American exchanges had a largely uneventful day of trading on Wednesday after being shut down for two days because of Hurricane Sandy. "But getting to the relative calm of Wednesday's open took significant work," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. There was one notable hitch. The Knight Capital Group, which had a disastrous trading debacle in August, "suffered a power disruption at its headquarters in Jersey City on Wednesday and told clients to route their orders elsewhere."

HEADLINE: At American Express, Warnings About the 'Fiscal Cliff'

BYLINE: MICHELLE LEDER


HIGHLIGHT: Companies are starting to warn investors about the harsh effects of the coming fiscal cliff of federal spending cuts and tax increases, which would begin to take effect after Dec. 31. 

 BODY:
 2:14 p.m. | Updated 
After the widespread (and highly visible) damage caused by Hurricane Sandy this week, worries about the fiscal cliff may not be at the forefront of most people's minds.
The economic calamity is a lot less visual (though The Wall Street Journal did come up with this clever video), and the destructive force seems somehow in the faraway future.
But companies are already warning investors about the harsh effects of the fiscal cliff. American Express's 10-Q quarterly report, which was filed Wednesday, included a new dire warning about the rapidly approaching year-end deadline.
"The company expects that it will take some time for the U.S. economy to get back onto a steady, upward growth track," the filing said. "Moreover, in the absence of legislative action, there continues to be growing concerns about the potential impact of the 'fiscal cliff' arising from scheduled federal spending cuts and tax increases set for the end of 2012."
The statement goes into more detail than what the firm's chief financial officer, Daniel T. Henry, said during the quarterly earnings call two weeks ago. Then, an analyst for the Telsey Advisory Group asked if there might be a larger impact, specifically in terms of the company's spending on marketing.
"If things were to be better, we know exactly what we'd do. And if things were to be worse, we know exactly what we're going to do. So we will monitor this closely," Mr. Henry said, according to a transcript of the call. Marina Hoffmann Norville, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to comment beyond what was in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
American Express isn't the only large company to mention the fiscal cliff in filings with the S.E.C. But others have been more nuanced or noncommittal on the effects. In itsquarterly earnings release on Thursday, the payroll processing company Automatic Data Processing noted that "there is concern in the U.S. surrounding the fiscal cliff." In its quarterly earnings release on Wednesday, Visa, the giant credit card company, included the "so-called fiscal cliff" in a list of economic factors that might affect the company.
Also on Thursday, Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who just took over as president and chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, issued its own warning in a letter sent to President Obama and Congress.
"We urge Congress and the administration to deal with the fiscal cliff in a two-pronged approach: First, bridge over the fiscal cliff as soon as possible to minimize negative economic consequences. Second, address the federal budget deficit in a comprehensive and bipartisan manner in early 2013 to put the U.S. on a path for sustained growth," Mr. Pawlenty wrote.
But if the Dec. 31 deadline moves closer without any indication of resolution, companies are likely to step up their disclosures in S.E.C. filings.
An earlier version of this post misstated the fiscal quarters that were reported on this week by Automatic Data Processing and Visa. A.D.P.'s report was for its first quarter of 2013 and Visa's report was for its fourth quarter of 2012, in both cases not the third quarter of 2012.

HEADLINE: The Bruce-Bharara Bromance

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: At a concert in Hartford attended by the United States attorney for Manhattan last week, Bruce Springsteen shouted, "This is for Preet Bharara!" before ripping into "Death to My Hometown," a rollicking Celtic-inspired anthem. 

 BODY:
Bruce Springsteen performed in Hartford last week.
Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, had already had a pretty good week as he and his family traveled to Hartford last Thursday for a Bruce Springsteen show.
The day before, he sued Bank of America, seeking $1 billion in a mortgage-related case. And Rajat K. Gupta, the most prominent defendant in his sweeping crackdown on insider trading, received a two-year prison sentence.
But at the concert, things got even better for Mr. Bharara, who has made no secret of his fierce devotion to Bruce.
 Before ripping into "Death to My Hometown," a rollicking Celtic-inspired anthem, Mr. Springsteen shouted, "This is for Preet Bharara!" (Mr. Springsteen name-checks Mr. Bharara a YouTube clip about 22 seconds in.)
The song's lyrics, which are about the effect of the economic crisis, apply to Mr. Bharara's line of work. As much as anyone else, the prosecutor, who was featured on the cover of Time magazine this year with the headline ''This Man Is Busting Wall Street,'' has become the public face of the government's efforts to prosecute white-collar crime.
Sounding angry, Mr. Springsteen sings:
 Send the robber barons straight to hell.
The greedy thieves who came around
 And ate the flesh of everything they found. 
The rest of the stanza, though, hits on a criticism of Mr. Bharara and his Justice Department colleagues:
 Whose crimes have gone unpunished now,
Who walk the streets as free men now.
Critics have faulted the Obama administration for not prosecuting the banking and mortgage-industry executives. Mr. Bharara and others have countered that much of the behavior was unethical and irresponsible, but not necessarily criminal. And they also point out that they have brought thousands of mortgage-fraud cases, including civil actions against some of the country's biggest banks.
So, was Mr. Springsteen's dedication meant as praise or criticism? It is unclear, but presuming that Mr. Springsteen knew that Mr. Bharara was at the show, it is unlikely he would have criticized him. (Mr. Springsteen's has a famously fraught relationship with Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey and a well-known Springsteen fanatic. At concerts, Mr. Springsteen has refused to acknowledge the governor, according to an article in The Atlantic.)
A spokeswoman for Mr. Springsteen declined to comment on whether the singer knew that Mr. Bharara was at the show.
The prosecutor did give a brief interview to a reporter at The Daily News who attended the Hartford concert. He said that when Bruce gave him a shout-out, "All I could think was, my son for the first time thought his dad was really cool."
Mr. Bharara, 44, grew up in Springsteen country. Born in India, Mr. Bharara came to the United States with his parents as an infant. He was raised in Eatontown, N.J., in Monmouth County, just a short drive from Mr. Springsteen's hometown, Freehold, N.J. Earlier this year in an appearance on "The Charlie Rose Show," Mr. Bharara was asked about his passion for Mr. Springsteen.
"If I could cite to Jon Stewart who I think expressed it best what is great about Bruce Springsteen -- I`ll never forget what he said somewhere after coming back from the Springsteen concert he said to his studio audience, 'Do you like joy? If you like joy, you should go see a Springsteen concert,'" Mr. Bharara said. "And I think separate and apart from all those other things you are talking about and the way he talks about America and the way he talks about people and the way he talks about justice, there is a lot of joy."
There has been little joy this week in Monmouth County, among the hardest hit areas by Hurricane Sandy. At a concert in Rochester on Wednesday, Mr. Springsteen expressed deep sadness over the damage wrought by the storm. "We're a band that you can't separate from the Jersey Shore," he said. "A glorified bar band at your service."
On Friday, Mr. Springsteen will headline a telethon to aid victims of the Sandy. As for Mr. Bharara, he had no power at his home in Westchester County and at the United States attorney's office in Lower Manhattan, which has been closed all week. 
In an e-mailed statement, Mr. Bharara extended his sympathy to the storm's victims.
"In the wake of such devastation, it's heartening to see people come together to, as Bruce would say, take care of our own," Mr. Bharara said. "That's what good people always do."

HEADLINE: FERC Takes Aim at Wall Street

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's broad crackdown is aimed at manipulation of energy prices. 

 BODY:
Wall Street finds itself in a bare-knuckle brawl with a government agency.
Yet the fight is not with the Federal Reserve or another banking regulator, but a less-known agency more accustomed to patrolling the nation's energy pipeline than a trading floor.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the government watchdog overseeing the oil, natural gas and electricity business, has lately taken aim at three major banks suspected of manipulating energy prices. After taking action against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, the agency on Wednesday threatened to impose its largest fine ever against Barclays.
The agency - building on a 2005 law, additional resources and a string of personnel moves - is increasingly exercising its new enforcement muscle to pursue not only energy companies but some of the nation's biggest banks. Indeed, the case against Barclays, which could cost the British bank $470 million, stems from a broad crackdown on questionable trading that has prompted 19 actions in the last two years.
"It's the most powerful agency that no one knows about," said Tyson Slocum, the director of the energy program for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.
And it is a regulator that has so far had unusually fierce clashes with Wall Street. While they may push back against regulations and enforcement actions, financial firms typically tread softly in dealing with their regulators, preferring to strike settlement deals that swiftly resolve scandals. In June, for example, Barclays paid $450 million to settle regulators' accusations that it had manipulated interest rates during the financial crisis.
But Barclays and JPMorgan are mounting counterattacks against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, casting the accusations against them as wrongheaded and overreaching. Even Deutsche Bank, which faces a meager $1.5 million fine, has vowed to fight.
"People have to be held accountable, but there also has to be clarity and due process," said Nora Mead Brownell, a former commissioner at the agency who became a founding partner at Espy Energy Solutions, an energy consulting firm.
The banks sense that a larger regulatory battle is at stake. Unlike financial regulators, the energy commission can fine firms $1 million a day for every violation. The string of recent cases, banks fear, could lay the groundwork for years of costly litigation.
The agency's effort is rooted in a 2005 law passed in the aftermath of the Enron fraud. The law created an enforcement unit at the agency and gave it the authority to assess hefty fines.
Under the Obama administration, the enforcement unit expanded its ranks and received a nearly 50 percent budget increase.
The unit, which this year created a specialized group to analyze arcane data and detect manipulation, also hired seasoned criminal investigators. The enforcement team is led by Norman C. Bay, the former United States attorney for New Mexico. One of his top deputies is a former general counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The overhaul is starting to bear fruit. The energy commission in March imposed a $245 million fine on Constellation Energy over charges that the company manipulated markets in New York to benefit its trading portfolio.
As several banks set up energy trading desks over the last decade, aiming to fill the business that Enron vacated, the agency expanded its focus to Wall Street.
The commission disclosed this summer that it was investigating JPMorgan Chase over potential manipulation of markets in California and the Midwest, exploring whether the firm had engaged in abusive bidding for energy prices.
The fight also centers on a technical issue: whether JPMorgan must turn over internal e-mail. The bank initially refused to turn over documents to the California agency that oversees the state's power grid, citing attorney-client privilege.
In September, the federal energy commission ordered the bank to produce evidence that it had not violated market rules, or risk losing its license to sell power at market rates. Last month, JPMorgan apologized and turned over some of the documents, blaming miscommunication for the impasse. The broader inquiry into the bank continues.
"The message from the cases is fairly simple: Traders have to play it straight," said Susan Court, the agency's first enforcement director who is now the principal of SJC Energy Consultants.
JPMorgan has said in a statement: "We believe we have complied in all respects with the law, as well as FERC rules and applicable tariffs, governing this market."
In its most significant case yet, the energy commission this week took action against Barclays. It outlined accusations that Barclays put on trades that were designed to skew the prices for electricity in what the industry calls the "physical" market.
Those prices then lifted the value of separate financial bets Barclays had placed, according to the commission. The agency argued that the gains in the financial bets were greater than the losses on the physical trades, effectively leaving Barclays with an overall profit. Citing complex calculations, the agency argued that the physical trades resulted in a loss of $4 million over the period, against gains of $35 million on the financial contracts.
The commission, emphasizing the nature of the conduct, sprinkled its order with excerpts from colorful and often explicit messages between traders.
In one e-mail, a trader wrote in vulgar terms that he would make trades that would lower one market to weigh down another.
The traders also discussed how one trader asked the others to help her "prop up" certain indexes, which would require taking a "daily loss" in the physical markets.
In testimony before the agency's investigators, bank employees said that traders were forbidden from intentionally forcing losses.
"The golden rule was always, under no circumstances, lose money on a transaction for the intention of making money on another transaction," the Americas head of Barclays' commodities unit, Joseph Gold, said in testimony.
Barclays issued a statement this week challenging the commission's allegations, saying the bank's "trading was legitimate and aboveboard." The bank added that it intended to "vigorously defend this matter."
Barclays plans to challenge the agency's tally of gains and losses, according to people briefed on the matter. Bank officials, who have 30 days to respond to the charges, are also expected to argue that regulators cherry-picked a handful of salacious e-mails from hundreds of thousands of documents.
Despite the onslaught of cases, Mr. Slocum of Public Citizen says the agency has yet to shake its backwater reputation. It still relies on private companies to police the front lines of energy manipulation, he said, and takes years to file cases.
"They're catching a few scraps," he said. But the recent actions have less to do with a reinvigorated agency than "companies engaging in widespread manipulation."
 Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: The List That Big Banks Don't Wish to Be On

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Financial Stability Board, a body that coordinates international bank regulations, has come out with its list of "systemically important" big banks. Of the 28 firms on the list, eight are from the United States. 

 BODY:
The world's too-big-to-fail list is out, and nearly a third of the banks on it are from the United States.
After the 2008 financial crisis, the Financial Stability Board, a body that coordinates international bank regulations, decided it would be a good idea to subject the world's largest banks to tougher rules. The thinking was that, since large-size banks posed a risk to the financial system, they needed to operate with higher loss buffers, or capital, than other lenders. It was also hoped that the tougher regulations would act as an incentive to stop them growing further. 
On Thursday, the board releasedthis year's list of "systemically important" banks. Of the 28 banks on the list, eight are from the United States: Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo.
The list has its own hierarchy, with the banks split into four buckets. In the top bucket are Citigroup and JPMorgan, along with Deutsche Bank and HSBC. The capital surcharge for being this group is bigger than it is for others on the list. For some, the question is whether the amount is big enough.
Once new international bank regulations are fully in place by 2019, nearly all banks will have to hold capital that is at least 7 percent of their assets. But the systemically important banks will have to have even more capital. Citigroup and JPMorgan will have to hold additional capital that is equivalent to 2.5 percent of their risk-adjusted assets, taking them to an overall requirement of 9.5 percent. 
Even though JPMorgan and Citigroup have several years to get to 9.5 percent, they say they are already reasonably close. In the third quarter, Citigroup estimated that it was already at 8.6 percent and JPMorgan said its estimate was 8.4 percent. 
But these are just estimates. The banks have yet to fully comply with rules that may change outcomes in unexpected ways. For instance, in 2013, these banks' Wall Street operations have to adopt substantially stricter regulations that could weigh on capital estimates.
One problem with the stability board's capital requirements is that they use something called risk weighted assets. That means that assets are measured in a way that tries to take into account their differing risk levels. This has the effect of reducing the asset total for the purposes of calculating the capital ratio. In other words, if no risk-weighting were used, the capital ratios would look a lot lower for several banks. 
In addition, the stability board's list may do little to answer the concerns of some analysts who feel the capital surcharges are too small. For instance, on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland issued a paperon bank capital that is based on a conference earlier this year. 
One participant at the conference, Martin Hellwig, from the University of Bonn, called for capital equivalent to 20 percent of assets. Mr. Hellwig argued that much higher capital has "large social benefits" and "low social costs."

HEADLINE: In Nevada, Obama, Ryan and Signs of a New (Democratic-Leaning) Normal

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Increasing racial diversity and a top-notch Democratic Party organization have transformed Nevada from a reliably red state. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it is changing. Here is Nevada, the Silver State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Jon Ralston, a longtime political reporter in Nevada who runs his own political commentary site, RalstonReports.com, and hosts a public affairs program also called "Ralston Reports;" and David Damore, an associate professor of political science at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 
With less than a week until Election Day, Nevada's six electoral votes remain pivotal. After three days of campaigning were canceled so he could oversee the federal response to Hurricane Sandy, President Obama returned to the trail Thursday, including a stop in North Las Vegas in the afternoon. That was about the same time that Representative Paul D. Ryan spoke in Reno, Nev. 
Nevada should be one of the more promising battleground states for the campaign of Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan. The state's economy is in disrepair. Its unemployment rate, 11.8 percent, is the worst in the nation, and personal bankruptcies and foreclosures have ravaged the state.
In addition, although their effect can be overstated, Mormons make up 9 percent of Nevada's population, tied for the third-largest share of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Mormon voters are expected to overwhelmingly support Mr. Romney, a Mormon himself.
Yet, just a single poll all year has found Mr. Romney leading Mr. Obama in Nevada. The race appears close, but polls show Mr. Obama retaining a consistent, if narrow, lead of 3.4 percentage points. And Nevada remains one of the more solid bricks in Mr. Obama's Electoral College "firewall."
How has Mr. Obama's support in Nevada weathered the state's struggling economy? Or, as Mr. Ralston put it, "How in the world is the president not getting crushed here?"
Nevada was once reliably red, favoring the Republican candidate relative to the national popular vote in every presidential election but one - 1960 - from 1948 through 2004. The Silver State's rightward bent began to dissipate in the 1990s and 2000s. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, carried Nevada in 1992 and 1996, although he was helped by the independent candidacy of Ross Perot, Mr. Damore said.
In 2004, Nevada was almost exactly at the national tipping point, only 0.13 percentage points more Republican-leaning than the nation. Then in 2008, Nevada made the switch. Mr. Obama won nationally by seven percentage points, and he carried the state by 12.5 points. For the first time since 1960, Nevada was more Democratic-leaning than the country.
In 2010, Nevada showed signs that 2008 was not an anomaly. Harry Reid, the Senator majority leader who was battling a Republican wave nationally and poor approval ratings locally, upset expectations (and the polls) to defeat the Republican Sharon Angle in Nevada's Senate race.
Nevada's leftward tilt is unlikely to be as strong in 2012 as it was in 2008, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast. But the fact that Mr. Obama is favored at all is evidence of how thoroughly Nevada's political landscape has been remade by the state's fast-growing minority populations.
Nevada led the nation in population growth for the past two decades, more than doubling in size to 2.7 million, from 1.2 million in 1990. Fueling that growth has been Democratic-leaning demographic groups: Hispanics, Asians and African-Americans. While Nevada's non-Hispanic white population grew by 12 percent from 2000 to 2010, African-Americans grew by 58 percent, Asians by 116 percent and Hispanics by 82 percent.
Non-Hispanic whites are still a majority in Nevada, but barely, comprising 54 percent of the state. Hispanics are 27 percent, African-Americans are almost 9 percent, and Asians are about 8 percent.
The state's booming population has also made Nevada more urban, as the growth has been focused primarily in and around Las Vegas and Reno. Nevada is now the third most urban state in terms of population, according to the 2010 census.
Rural Nevada -- which has not seen the population boom that Las Vegas and Reno have -- is still overwhelmingly Republican. But it accounts for only about 15 percent of the state population, Mr. Damore said.
Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, is home to more than 70 percent of Nevadans. It is a majority minority county and a Democratic stronghold. The core of Las Vegas is the most left-leaning and predominantly Hispanic and African-American. The Las Vegas suburbs are more politically competitive, similar to suburban communities in Colorado or Virginia, Mr. Damore said.
Democratic candidates in statewide races can count on carrying Clark County, but they want to win it by a wide margin to cancel out the G.O.P.'s advantage in rural Nevada, Mr. Ralston said. The vote in Washoe County, then, often decides the winner.
 The Bellwether: Washoe County 
Democrats have made substantial gains in Washoe County, home to Reno. "Washoe County was traditionally a strong Republican base," Mr. Damore said, "but over time it has become much more of a swing district."
In the 2000 presidential election, Washoe County was three percentage points more Republican-leaning than Nevada as a whole. In 2004, it was one point more Republican, and in 2008 Mr. Obama carried Washoe County by just over 12 percentage points, matching the statewide vote almost exactly.
To carry Nevada, Mr. Ralston said, Mr. Romney will almost certainly have to carry Washoe County. Mr. Obama needs only to keep it close there, as long as he performs strongly in Clark County.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is an 80 percent favorite in Nevada, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. Mr. Romney could still win the state, but mostly in situations where he had already reached 270 electoral votes.
Nevada's growing diversity has made the state more politically competitive, but it does not tell the whole story. Arizona is almost a third Hispanic, but it is still reliably Republican. In Nevada, the fast-growing minority communities have been harnessed by top-notch turnout operations built by Mr. Reid and the 55,0000-member Culinary Union.
"The Hispanic population began to swell especially in the Culinary Union," Mr. Ralston said, "and they became more and more active as voters, mostly on the Democratic side."
In contrast, the Nevada Republican Party is disorganized, Mr. Ralston said, and the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee have had to build an infrastructure from scratch. They have done a decent job, Mr. Ralston said, "But you can't grow organically in a few months what Reid and company have built in a few election cycles."
Democrats have amassed a voter registration advantage of 130,000, and early voting in Nevada has so far favored the Democrats, according to an analysis by Mr.Ralston.
At the same time, the state is led by a popular Republican, Gov. Brian Sandoval, who may provide a model for Republican success in the state, Mr. Ralston said. 
Mr. Sandoval has claimed the political center, angering the conservative base over taxes and social issues, Mr. Damore said. (Mr. Sandoval has also angered Republicans who feel he has not campaigned enough for Mr. Romney.)
The gains Democrats have made in Nevada appear to be just strong enough to counteract the bad economy and Mr. Romney's advantage among Mormons. Republicans generally and Mr. Romney specifically can still succeed in the Silver State -- as Mr. Sandoval proves -- but it's tougher than it used to be.

HEADLINE: Westin Hotels Lend Gear So Travelers Can Exercise

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
GENERATIONS of bowlers have rented disinfectant-spritzed shoes from bowling alleys, and now the Westin Hotels chain is betting on its guests showing the same willingness when it comes to communal running shoes.
In a partnership with New Balance, Westin is lending guests the running and fitness brand's shoes, shorts and shirts -- along with capri pants and jog bras for women. Borrowing the gear costs $5, and includes a new pair of socks for guests to keep that retail for about $6.
Originating as a pilot program at 10 properties in 2010 (including Boston, Berlin, and Tokyo), the lending program grew to include all 118 properties in North America in March 2012, and is now being introduced across the chain internationally, for a total of about 190 properties. 
One print ad promoting the program shows a man and woman wearing white, and jumping ecstatically on a white trampoline against a white background. The only color: their red New Balance running sneakers.
''You're more likely to run if it's convenient,'' says the ad. ''To help you pack light and stay fit, we now offer New Balance shoes and clothing for you to use during your stay.
The campaign, which is by the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, also includes billboards and in-hotel marketing materials on key cards and on mirrors in guest rooms. A commercial will be shown online, on seat back video screens on Delta airplanes and in about 10,000 elevators in office buildings through the Captivate Network, a Gannett company.
The ads were introduced in travel trade journals like Meetings & Conventions and Successful Meetings in 2011, and on Thursday they began appearing in publications including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. An ad for the program also is in the November issue of Runner's World.
The lending program is part of a broader campaign called ''The Elements of Well Being'' introduced in 2011 by Westin, which is owned by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. That broader effort enumerates restorative features of the hotels, like their trademarked Heavenly bed and menu items developed in a partnership with the SuperFoodsRx brand.
Bob Jacobs, vice president for brand management at Sheraton & Westin North America, said that guests who have tried the program so far have liked not only that they can spontaneously decide to go for a run, but also that they can pack lighter.
''Packing running shoes can lead you to choose a bigger bag, so people have valued the program because of the fact that it allowed them to move from checking their bags to carrying bags on,'' said Mr. Jacobs, referring to airline travelers. ''For a lot of people it's a big deal to pay $25 or more to check a bag, so it becomes a real economic advantage for them.''
Westin also has worked with New Balance, which often has retail stores in the same cities as the hotels, to map three- and five-mile runs from the lobby that gravitate to pedestrian-friendly parks and paths. Many properties have hotel employees who act as what Westin calls run concierges, and lead runs from three to seven days a week.
Hilary Keates, director of global marketing and brand management for New Balance, said that because the partnership with Westin is symbiotic, neither party is writing the other a check.
''It's a great opportunity for us to expose our products to guests around the world,'' Ms. Keates said. ''Westin aligns strongly with the New Balance brand because Westin, like New Balance, has a core brand philosophy that really is rooted in wellness.''
While runners might be squeamish about borrowing used gear from some places, Ms. Keates said a hotel brand like Westin assuages such concerns.
''Westin is an expert on how to get sheets and towels clean, so as a result consumers feel very confident that the products that they're wearing are clean,'' Ms. Keates said.
Shoes are sprayed with a disinfectant between uses, and insoles are replaced at least once a month, Ms. Keates said.
In October, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts announced that members of its President's Club loyalty program were eligible to borrow shoes and clothing from Reebok. The program is being introduced gradually, and it will be available at all of Fairmont's more than 60 properties beginning in January 2013.
To promote the lending program, Westin and New Balance began a weeklong international cause-marketing program on Thursday, with more than 1,000 associates from Westin and New Balance running the mapped five-mile routes near hotels.
The promotion also includes collection drives for Soles4Souls, which provides shoes for impoverished people across the world. (The promotion at the Manhattan Westin location has been postponed because of Hurricane Sandy.)
According to Westin, 5 to 10 percent of guests borrow New Balance gear a day, depending on the property.
Tom Botts, a managing partner at Hudson Crossing, a travel industry advisory firm, lauded the Westin program.
''I think it's great and it definitely fits right in with the brand of Westin, which is all about health and wellness,'' Mr. Botts said. ''As a frequent business traveler who just started running, it's a pain to bring shoes'' because they take up precious space in a carry-on bag, he added.
It behooves hotels to pile on amenities, even when only a minority of guests take advantage of them, he said.
''With product differentiation in the hotel industry it gets played on the fringes at this point,'' Mr. Botts said. ''If they get a couple extra guests a night on this feature, it's a huge home run -- it doesn't take much to move the needle.''

Art
Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events.
Note: Most museums in Upper Manhattan are open, but in Lower Manhattan many galleries remain closed in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. As of press time, these institutions have reopened.
Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collage-like paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 3) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Jan. 6) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (through Jan. 6) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- are familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, Manhattan, (212) 992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Cotter)
Galleries: Other
&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
Public Art
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Roberta Smith)
Last Chance
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tomás Saraceno on the Roof: Cloud City' (closes on Sunday) This climbable 28-foot-high aggregate of 16 interconnected polyhedrons made of reflective steel and clear plexiglass creates a kind of Piranesian, walk-in Cubism that is briefly disorienting, but ultimately decorative. The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park's ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work's forced and busy artifice. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900 -- 2000' (closes on Monday) This big, wonderful show at the Museum of Modern Art examines the intersection of modern design and modern thinking about children. A richly thought-provoking study of a great subject, it is loaded with intriguing things to look at -- some 500 items, including furniture, toys, games, posters, books and much more. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'REGARDING WARHOL: SIXTY ARTISTS, FIFTY YEARS': (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. (A gallery view, above, shows two of those works: Warhol's ''Nan Kempner,'' 1973, left, and a self-portrait from 1986, right
 Alex Katz's ''Lita,'' 1964, is at center.) But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go.

HEADLINE: Car Dealer Sales Failed To Keep Pace in October

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit. Andrew Martin contributed reporting from Montclair, N.J., andMary M. Chapman contributed from Detroit.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The steady recovery of the American auto industry this year seemed immune to a slowdown -- until Hurricane Sandy hit.
Major automakers said Thursday that vehicle sales in October declined in the month's final days, as the storm forced hundreds of dealerships to close and consumers to delay car purchases in New York, New Jersey and other affected states.
Until the storm arrived, the pace of sales in October had been running slightly behind that of the rest of the year. Sales overall rose just 6.9 percent to about 1.09 million vehicles during October, compared with a 14.5 percent gain over the first nine months of the year, according to the research firm Autodata. 
Analysts had been predicting an annual sales rate of about 14.7 million vehicles for October, but now say the rate fell at least 300,000 short of that.
Still, most car companies reported increases for the entire month, an indication that any interruption of the industry's recovery was probably only temporary.
Storm devastation and disruption on the East Coast had an impact on hundreds of dealerships and brought showroom traffic to a halt even in areas spared the most severe damage.
Sitting in his office off an empty sales floor, Frank Lupo bemoaned the dearth of customers at his Acura dealership in Montclair, N.J. ''Horrible,'' Mr. Lupo said in assessing his business on Wednesday. ''No customers today. Not one.''
Most of his calls that day came from people already trying to replace vehicles flooded by the hurricane. But Mr. Lupo is not expecting sales of replacement vehicles to begin any time soon, as insurers sort out claims and customers affected by the storm focus on more immediate needs.
''The last thing a person wants to do is buy a car,'' he said. ''They need to worry about their power, about their family.''
All the big automakers are trying to tally how many sales were lost in the storm, and when those customers will return.
Sales at General Motors, the nation's largest automaker, rose 4.7 percent during October to 195,000 vehicles. A G.M. executive said the company was still calculating the impact of the hurricane on sales, but that its top priority now was assisting dealers shut by the storm.
''There's no question that it had an impact,'' said Kurt McNeil, G.M.'s head of United States sales. ''A large number of vehicles were damaged, dealerships are underwater, there's no power. There are some real horror stories out there.''
Mr. McNeil said that consumers usually returned to the marketplace within a month after a natural disaster. But he said the recovery from the storm could take longer because of the dense population areas affected by the storm.
''Probably half of our dealerships in the state of New Jersey are still without power,'' he said.
G.M.'s two Detroit rivals, the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler, reported mixed results for the month.
Ford said its sales edged up 0.4 percent during the month to 168,000 vehicles, while Chrysler reported a 10 percent increase to 126,000 vehicles.
Both companies reported big gains in the sales of their smallest, most fuel-efficient passenger cars.
Among other automakers, Toyota and Honda continued their rebound from last year's supply disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
Toyota said its sales in October increased 15.8 percent to 155,000 vehicles, and Honda reported an 8.8 percent gain to 106,000. Nissan's sales fell 3.2 percent to 79,000.
The German carmaker Volkswagen kept up its healthy sales pace in October, reporting a 20.4 percent increase in sales of VW and Audi models to 46,000 vehicles. Estimates varied on how many vehicle sales were lost because of the storm, which affected a geographic area that accounts for from 20 to 25 percent of national sales. The car research Web site Edmunds.com estimated a loss of about 30,000 sales in the final days of the month, while Ford said it could be as low as 20,000.
The larger question facing the industry is how long it will take for shuttered dealerships to reopen and for consumers in the affected areas to resume shopping for new models.
''In some areas it's going to take longer than a month,'' said Mr. McNeil of G.M.
Analysts said the relative affluence of the New York metropolitan area should get the industry back on track sooner than it did in the Gulf Coast region after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
''Katrina affected areas where the income level was lower and the damage was almost irreparable in some places,'' said Jesse Toprak, chief market analyst at the auto research site True.Car.com.
The recovery in storm-damaged areas should begin quickly once power is restored and infrastructure is repaired, he said, but ''it's going to be a very slow November for at least two weeks in the impacted areas.''
An untold number of vehicles were damaged by flooding during the storm.
The president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, Mark Schienberg, said the number of flooded cars and trucks could reach into the tens of thousands.
The association represents 425 new-car dealerships in the state, and his offices tried to contact more than 100 stores on Wednesday. Of those, 60 percent did not answer the phone.
''Those we did speak with had flooding or wind damage or other damage to property,'' said Mr. Schienberg, who owns domestic and import dealerships in the state. ''I'm so amazed by the amount of vehicle damage.''
Mr. Toprak said that consumers might not begin replacing damaged vehicles in large numbers until December, particularly if insurance payments are delayed because of the volume of hurricane-related claims.
When they do come back to the market, consumers will most likely continue the buying trends that have made auto sales a rare bright spot in the overall American economy.
Small car sales are surging at both domestic and import manufacturers. Signs also suggest that pickup sales will accelerate along with housing starts. Mr. McNeil of G.M. said he expected a surge of interest in pickups in the final months of the year.
''Housing has been the stumbling block in the national recovery and the auto recovery,'' he said. ''Now it looks like we are at or near an inflection point.''

HEADLINE: The Final Reckoning

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Jan. 20, 2009, was an inspiring day. Barack Obama took the oath of office and argued that America was in a crisis caused by ''our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.''
It was time, he said, to end the false choices between the orthodox left and the orthodox right. He called for ''an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics. ... In the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.'' 
Obama acknowledged that some people questioned the scale of his ambitions, the scope of his grand plans. But, he continued, ''What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.''
In some ways, President Obama has lived up to the promise of that day. In office, he has generally behaved with integrity and in a way befitting a man with his admirable character. Sure, he has sometimes stooped to the cynical maneuver. Contemptuous of his opponents, he has given himself permission to do the nasty and negative thing. But politics is a rough business and nobody comes out unsullied.
In moral terms, he hasn't let us down. If he's re-elected, his administration would probably remain scandal-free. Given the history of second terms, that is no small thing.
Moreover, Obama has been a prudent leader. He's made no rash or disastrous decisions. He's never acted out of some impetuous passion. His policies toward, say, China, Europe and Iran have had a sense of sober balance. If re-elected, he would probably commit no major blunders, which also is no small thing.
But the scope of Obama's vision has contracted over the years. It has contracted politically. Four years ago, Obama won over many conservatives and independents. But he's championed mostly conventional Democratic policies and is now mostly relying on members of his own party.
It has contracted managerially. Four years ago, Obama went to the White House with a Team of Rivals -- big figures with big voices. Now the circle of trust is much smaller and political.
The mood has contracted. The atmosphere of expansive hope has often given way to a mood of aggrieved annoyance. He seems cagier, more hemmed in by the perceived limitations of his office. The man who ran on hope four years ago is now running one of the most negative campaigns in history, aimed at disqualifying his opponent.
Most of all, the vision has contracted. The arguments he made in his inaugural address were profoundly true. We are in the middle of an economic transition, a bit like the 1890s, with widening inequality, a corrupt and broken political system, an unsustainable welfare state, a dangerous level of family breakdown and broken social mobility.
The financial crisis exposed foundational problems and meant that we were going to have to live with a long period of slow growth, as the history of financial crises makes clear.
If Obama had governed in a way truer to his inauguration, he would have used this winter of recuperation to address the country's structural weaknesses. He would have said: Look, we're not going to have booming growth soon, but we will use this period to lay the groundwork for a generation of prosperity -- with plans to reform the tax code, get our long-term entitlement burdens under control, get our political system working, shift government resources from the affluent elderly to struggling young families and future growth.
When people say they wish Obama had embraced the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction plan, they don't mean the specific details of that proposal. They mean the largeness that Obama's inauguration promised and the Simpson-Bowles moment afforded. They mean confronting the hard choices, instead of promising more bounty for everyone with no sacrifice ever.
But the president got sucked in by short-term things -- the allure of managing the business cycle so that the economy would boom by re-election time. Instead of taking the midterm defeat as a sign he should move to the center, or confound the political categories, he seems to have hunkered down and become more political. Washington dysfunction now looks worse than ever.
Sure, House Republicans have been intransigent, but Obama could have isolated them, building a governing center-left majority with an unorthodox agenda. Instead he's comforted the Democratic base and disappointed sympathizers who are not in it.
One final thing. No one is fair to President Obama. People grade him against tougher standards than any other politician. But his innate ability justifies that high standard. These are the standards he properly set for himself. If re-elected, he'd be free from politics. It'd be interesting to see if he returns to his earlier largeness.

HEADLINE: Storm-Imposed Intermission Over, Both Campaigns Rush Back Onto Stage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and MARK LANDLER; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Mark Landler from Las Vegas. Michael Barbaro contributed from Virginia.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The two presidential campaigns roared back to life on Thursday, ending a storm-imposed hiatus with urgent closing arguments and a flurry of cross-country rallies as Mitt Romney raced to overtake President Obama in the election's final 100 hours.
Mr. Obama enters the last stretch with a slight and consistent -- but in some cases, shrinking -- edge over Mr. Romney, his Republican rival, in polling from most of the 10 swing states where the campaigns are waging fierce and costly battles with television ads and armies of supporters. 
The president returned to the trail Thursday amid a series of high-profile events this week that helped bolster his claims of bipartisan appeal. He received endorsements from Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York City. And on Wednesday, the president stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, as the two toured the state's devastated coastal communities.
But Mr. Romney's withering, yearlong critique of the president's economic stewardship has brought him to a virtual tie in national surveys. His campaign hopes that continued attacks combined with a renewed, bipartisan appeal to moderate and independent voters will help him overcome the president's state-by-state organization.
After spending close to $1 billion each, the two candidates are finishing the campaign where polls show they are strongest: with Mr. Obama stressing his pledge to protect the middle class and Mr. Romney promising to fix the nation's economy. Mr. Romney's campaign also signaled its intention to battle Mr. Obama on more fronts, with the campaign announcing on Thursday that he will make a stop in Pennsylvania on Sunday, an indication that Republican strategists believe they might be able to win a state that has been trending Democratic.
Both sides are bracing for Friday morning's release of the October unemployment rate, a final piece of economic evidence that could either bolster Mr. Romney's accusations of fiscal malpractice or provide further ammunition for the president's case that the country's struggling economy is finally headed in the right direction and creating jobs.
After avoiding attacks on Mr. Obama for 72 hours because of the storm, Mr. Romney plunged back into the fray in Roanoke, Va., mocking the president for proposing a cabinet-level post devoted to business development. Mr. Obama discussed the idea in an interview with MSNBC that was shown Monday, just as Mr. Romney was entering cease-fire mode.
''I don't think adding a new chair in his cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street,'' Mr. Romney told an enthusiastic crowd Thursday morning at a family-owned factory. ''We need a president who understands business, and I do.''
The campaign unveiled a new ad echoing those remarks and saying that the president's ''answer to everything'' was simply adding another government bureaucrat. But at his rally, Mr. Romney also played down his own record as a businessman, focusing instead on how he would govern with the support of Democrats and independents should he win on Tuesday.
''We know something about the past, we've seen what his policies have produced,'' Mr. Romney said in Virginia. ''The only way to get this economy going is the kind of bold change I've described, real change from Day 1.''
Mr. Romney's efforts to claim the mantle of change from Mr. Obama -- who rode to victory in 2008 by promising a new kind of politics -- drew sharp criticism from the president as he began the first of three rallies in three states on Thursday. Wearing a black Air Force One bomber jacket at a rally in Wisconsin, the president scoffed at Mr. Romney's offer of a new direction.
''Let me tell you, Wisconsin,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We know what change looks like. And what the governor is offering sure ain't change.''
At a sun-drenched rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Obama appeared at once sobered and galvanized by his tour of the devastation in New Jersey, drawing on the experience to frame his pitch for bipartisan cooperation and a robust government role in society.
''It reminds us that when disaster strikes, we see America at its best,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All the petty differences that consume us in normal times somehow melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans in a storm -- just fellow Americans.''
Even as Mr. Obama returned to the trail, the White House was intent on presenting him as deeply immersed in the storm recovery effort. On Air Force One from Wisconsin to Nevada, the president spoke with Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, and joined a 20-minute conference call led by Mr. Christie.
Until Election Day, the president will be in nearly constant motion, flying to three states a day, as he works furiously to lock down what his campaign insists are narrow but durable leads. Mr. Obama was scheduled to spend all Friday in Ohio, and he is likely to return to the state at least one more time before Tuesday.
In addition, the president's campaign released a television ad Thursday featuring effusive praise from Mr. Powell. The ad, which will run in 10 states, underscores Mr. Obama's closing message by showing Mr. Powell, a Republican, declaring that ''we ought to keep on the track that we are on.''
But the best barometer of how the campaigns felt about their chances on Thursday was the schedules they have set in place.
The president's stop in Wisconsin was aimed at securing a state the campaign did not worry about before Mr. Romney chose a native son, Representative Paul D. Ryan, as his running mate. Mr. Ryan has campaigned extensively there.
The Obama campaign feels more confident about Nevada. Despite having one of the nation's highest unemployment rates and millions of homes in foreclosure, the state has trended Democratic in recent elections.
On the other hand, Mr. Romney's decision to spend all Thursday in Virginia comes a day after he campaigned in Florida. Both are Southern states the Republican campaign had hoped to have locked up by now.
Polls from NBC News, The Wall Street Journal and Marist out Thursday morning showed Mr. Obama holding on to narrow leads in Iowa and locked in tight races with Mr. Romney in Wisconsin and New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: As Recovery Continues, City's Death Toll Reaches 38

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Reporting was contributed by James Barron, Matt Flegenheimer, Michael M. Grynbaum, John Leland, Robert Mackey, Andy Newman, Nate Schweber and Stacey Stowe.

 BODY:
The number of New York City fatalities from Hurricane Sandy jumped to 38 on Thursday, including two young boys who were swept from the arms of their mother on Staten Island and found dead at the swampy end of a street, the police said.
The mother, Glenda Moore, told the police that her sons, Connor, 4, and Brandon, 2, were swept away on Monday shortly after 6 p.m. as the storm arrived. The mother and children had been leaving Staten Island, heading for Brooklyn, as their car was disabled by water, the police said. Ms. Moore, 39, got out of her car with her two sons, near Father Capodanno Boulevard, when a surge of water caused her to lose grip of her children, the police said.
The two children were found at the end of McLaughlin Street, said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the New York Police Department.
''We just brought the parents into a trailer for the awful duty of identifying their little ones,'' Mr. Browne wrote in an e-mail. 
The grim discovery was made as New York City and areas in more than half a dozen states pressed on with efforts to make a full accounting of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Sandy. The extent of the storm's destructive force was reflected in government briefings that addressed a sweeping range of loss that included the human toll, power failures, homes sucked into the ocean, ruined businesses, and broken infrastructure and housing that put millions of people out of work and shelter.
The storm was blamed for more than 80 deaths in the United States, including the 38 in New York City that was announced on Thursday, updating the toll of 24 given on Wednesday. In the region, there were at least 8 in New Jersey and 4 in Connecticut, and numbers are expected to climb as rescue crews uncover the full scale of the damage to buildings and infrastructure. In New York City, the police said 19 victims were from Staten Island, 9 from Queens, 7 from Brooklyn and 3 in Manhattan.
Three days after the storm hit New York, it is becoming clear how most victims died. ''The majority of them drowned,'' said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office.
Previously reported deaths included a woman electrocuted as she walked in Queens and numerous people killed by falling trees. But as rescue crews searched the eastern edge of Staten Island on Thursday, particularly in and around the Midland Beach neighborhood, they discovered numerous drowning victims.
On Thursday, an elderly couple were found dead in their car on Staten Island.
In a briefing on Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that parks and playgrounds would reopen on Saturday, and public schools on Monday. He said the city would distribute meals and water around the city, including at sites in the Rockaways, Coney Island and parts of Staten Island, on Thursday.
''New York is starting to build again,'' he said.
People still coped with the loss of everyday essentials -- elevators, lights, cellphone service, Wi-Fi, refrigeration, hot showers.
But the return of some transportation services was cautiously welcomed, even as commuters and residents still had to negotiate crawling traffic, half-mile lines at suburban gas stations and city buses stuffed beyond capacity.
Subway service resumed on more than half of the city's 23 lines, but several -- the No. 3 and 7 trains and the B, C, E, G and Q trains -- remained dark. Many trains will have large gaps in their routes, including the No. 4 train, which will have no service between 42nd Street in Manhattan and Borough Hall in Brooklyn because of flooding in its tunnel beneath the East River and power problems. Subways and buses will be free for the rest of the week.
Shuttle buses are linking the boroughs from the transportation hub at the Barclays Center and from Hewes Street on the border of Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. Vehicle traffic on city streets was exceptionally heavy as drivers tried to make it into Manhattan before 6 a.m., when the city required at least three people in cars entering Manhattan over the Robert F. Kennedy, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Williamsburg Bridges, but not the George Washington Bridge.
While traffic had cleared up in some areas, much of the region's arterial system remained a parking lot well past the typical morning commute.
Police checkpoints set up in many places to enforce the high-occupancy-vehicle rule were so rigorous that they seemed to have the unintended effect of clogging up traffic flow even more, with lines of cars stretching from the Brooklyn Bridge to Staten Island.
But it could be easier to get a view from 30,000 feet on Thursday as air travel eased. La Guardia Airport, which had been shut down because of flooding, reopened. Some flights resumed on Wednesday at Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International Airports.
Some service was also restored on the AirTrain to Kennedy Airport, which connects the subway and train complex in Jamaica, Queens, to the airport. Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road had limited service to New York's northern and eastern suburbs.
Still, navigating transportation on the streets seemed to require the most diplomacy and luck as commuters adjusted to new rhythms of supply and demand.
The mayor had lifted the three-occupant limit for taxis and livery cars coming into Manhattan around 8:15 a.m. But even before that, some commuters attempted cab sharing, the delicate art of piling into a yellow taxi with strangers, which some cabdrivers declined to accommodate. A popular mode of transportation in Lower Manhattan -- still dark from the loss of power -- appeared to be bicycles.
There was limited ferry service in the East River, and the Staten Island Ferry should start plying the waterways within the next day or so, with a full schedule expected on Saturday.
Attesting to the scale of the recovery, more than 3.75 million people were hit by power failures from the storm, which made landfall on Monday night but was preceded by punishing winds, storm surges and torrential rain.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a Twitter message that as of 9 a.m. Thursday, more than 1.58 million New Yorkers were without electricity, including more than 600,000 in the New York City area and more than 700,000 on Long Island. Consolidated Edison said Thursday that it had restored power to more than 225,000 customers since the storm ended.
There was also more bad news for residents who receive electricity through overhead lines: Con Ed did not expect to restore power to all those customers until the end of next week. The utility has said that power for customers whose lines are underground will be restored sooner, and within the next few days in the case of Lower Manhattan, according to Mr. Bloomberg.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said Tuesday that he expected PATH trains to be unavailable for at least 7 to 10 days.
Work on the seven flooded tunnels beneath the East River caused delays. The Brooklyn-Battery, Queens-Midtown and Holland Tunnels remain closed.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence and Spending Are Rising, Economic Reports Show

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A flurry of reports on Thursday showed that American consumers were growing more confident and spending more, strengthening a still-weak economy just five days before the presidential election.
Consumer confidence surged in October to its highest level in nearly five years. Americans were encouraged by recent declines in the unemployment rate. And they responded by spending more on cars and trucks, at retail businesses and on goods produced in the nation's factories.
Still, businesses remain nervous about where the economy is headed and that could affect hiring. The October jobs report, to be released Friday, is expected to show another month of tepid job growth. Hurricane Sandy could also slow economic growth slightly in the final months of 2012. 
On Thursday the stock market welcomed the signs of improved economic health. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 136.16 points, or 1.04 percent, at 13232.62, and broader indexes also increased.
''U.S. economic data are at least all moving in the right direction,'' Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.
Reports released Thursday showed:
¶ The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 72.2 last month, its highest reading since February 2008. While the index is still below the 90 reading consistent with a healthy economy, it has risen from 40.9 a year ago. That is the biggest one-year increase since 1994, Mr. Kavcic said.
¶ Sales in retail stores open at least one year rose 5 percent in October, according to a tally from 21 retail chains by the International Council of Shopping Centers. That exceeded analysts' predictions. Some of the increase may reflect higher spending for generators, batteries, water and other supplies in preparation for Hurricane Sandy.
¶ Manufacturing expanded for the second straight month, largely because of higher consumer demand. The Institute for Supply Management, a private trade group, said its index of factory activity edged up to 51.7 in October, from 51.5 in September. A reading higher than 50 indicates expansion. Factory activity is growing again after contracting from June through August. The October reading was still slightly below the average for the last year of 52.2.
¶ Weekly unemployment applications fell 9,000 to 363,000 last week, according to the Department of Labor. That suggests hiring is unlikely to pick up much from its current pace of about 150,000 new jobs a month.
¶ A report by the payroll provider ADP showed that businesses added 158,000 jobs in the last month, up from 114,000 in the previous month. ADP updated its method for the October report. It has frequently diverged sharply from the government's figures.
¶ Auto sales also rose in October, even though the storm caused dealers on the East Coast to lose three days of business. Toyota sales rose almost 16 percent, Chrysler's 10 percent and General Motors was up 5 percent. Ford sales increased only slightly, 0.4 percent.
¶ Construction spending rose 0.6 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. A healthy gain in spending on home construction and renovation outpaced declines in commercial and government building.
¶ Manufacturing in China also improved in October, although the two surveys released Thursday show factory activity in the region was still struggling to grow. The reports are rare good news for the world economy, which has weakened because of Europe's debt crisis and slower growth in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil.
The United States economy expanded at a 2 percent annual pace in the July-September quarter, up from 1.3 percent in the second quarter.
Many economists predict slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter, partly because of disruptions from the storm. Still, the economy is not growing fast enough to bring relief to the roughly 12 million jobless Americans soon. With the unemployment rate still high, steady growth of more than 3 percent is generally needed to create enough jobs.

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- After years of bets gone wrong and lost opportunities, three of Japan's consumer electronics giants are showing some signs of faltering.
In the most dire warning, Sharp forecast on Thursday a 450 billion yen ($5.6 billion) full-year loss and warned that it had ''material doubts'' about its ability to survive.
On the same day, Panasonic's shares lost a fifth of their value in Tokyo after the company forecast a 765 billion yen ($9.6 billion) annual net loss from write-downs in its solar-power, battery and mobile handset businesses. 
And Sony, perhaps the best positioned of the companies, posted a net loss of 15.5 billion yen ($194 million) for the quarter on Thursday and warned of falling sales in almost every product it sells.
''We have a lot of great technology which we want to tap to revive and generate profit, but the company does not have that vitality,'' Takashi Okuda, Sharp's chief executive, told reporters after the company posted a net loss of 249 billion yen ($3.1 billion) for the three months to September. The loss was far larger than expected.
In a statement, the company said it had a ''serious negative operating cash flow'' which raised ''serious doubts'' about its ability to continue as a going concern, and said it was taking steps, including pay cuts, voluntary redundancies and asset sales, to generate cash flow.
While Sharp is in the most serious trouble, the three companies' woes are similar at the core.
All three make good quality, even cutting-edge products -- but so do their overseas competitors, usually at lower prices. None of the three have managed to generate the brand pizazz of Apple, or the marketing muscle of Samsung Electronics. In addition, a stubbornly strong yen continues to sap their competitiveness, while Japan's territorial dispute with China has hurt sales there.
The scale of the losses is the result of specific missteps, from huge investments in the wrong technologies to a reluctance to exit loss-making businesses. A manufacturing bubble here in the mid-2000s -- fed partly by an unusually weak currency and Americans flush with cash from rising home prices -- masked continued weaknesses in their business models and spurred the companies to take big bets that backfired.
When the global financial crisis brought that boom to an end in 2008, the three were saddled with excess capacity, bloated work forces and investments that they could hardly hope to recoup. And their refusal to make a big enough departure from the ways of their glory years is now making a comeback difficult.
''Many investors are longing for reforms that will let all of the pus out,'' Yuji Fujimori, technology analyst at Barclays Capital in Tokyo, said in a recent note to clients.
Sharp's stumble, in many ways, has been the most humbling. It was the biggest beneficiary of the manufacturing bubble: from 2000 to 2007, its profits jumped 150 percent. Sharp's high-end Aquos liquid-crystal display televisions -- which it manufactured at state-of-the-art factories in Kameyama, in western Japan -- were a runaway hit in the nascent flat-panel market. The spinoff Aquos cellphone topped Japanese sales rankings. Sharp's solar batteries also sold briskly, helped by a bubble in green technologies.
The company's success during this period seemed to validate Japan's penchant for manufacturing their most important products in-house. In advertisements, Sharp showed off its cutting-edge factories.
But even before the financial crisis, analysts were warning of an impending crash in prices of flat-panel televisions, which were fast becoming commodities that cheap upstarts could emulate. In 2008, the iPhone made its debut in Japan, the end of an era for Japanese-style cellphones. Chinese upstarts were starting to flood global markets with cheap solar panels and batteries. In consumer electronics, outsourced manufacturing became the norm.
Still, Sharp did not change course. It built a new factory in Sakai, Japan, which could make 6 million large LCD panels a year -- more than the size of the global market at the time. Sharp missed the smartphone wave, and its cellphone sales in Japan halved from 2007 to 2012. And in late 2011, the solar bubble burst, driving many solar power companies into bankruptcy and Sharp's solar batteries business into the red. The unit has not turned a profit since.
Now, the Kameyama factories no longer make televisions but panels for Apple's iPhones and iPads.
Panasonic, for its part, also bet heavily on plasma televisions in 2003, pouring some 600 billion yen into a series of factories in Amagasaki, not far from Sharp's own plant. It also bet on solar panels and rechargeable batteries, buying Sanyo in 2009.
But with plasma now a fading technology and solar power struggling, Panasonic is saddled with major losses. Last year, it announced that a factory in Amagasaki was closing, less than two years after it opened.
Kazuhiro Tsuga, who took the helm at Panasonic this year, was blunt in describing his company's predicament. ''We are among the losers in consumer electronics," he told a news conference on Wednesday. He now promises to shift the company away from money-losing televisions and gadgets.
Of the three, Sony now seems the most prescient. Its executives have preached the power of networks and content since the 1990s, building up a vast catalog of music and movies to lure users to their devices. Sony has also moved to slash costs and jobs and sell off some unprofitable businesses, refocusing the company on digital cameras and imaging technology, video games and mobile devices. This quarter, the sale of its chemical products business, which made materials for LCDs and optical discs, helped alleviate losses. Sony is now making a push into the medical field with an investment in the endoscope maker Olympus.
Internal squabbling has quashed its efforts to marry its hardware and software, however, and it refuses to abandon one of its biggest money-losers, its television business, which has bled red ink for eight consecutive years.
''We intend to hunker down and build a profitable business,'' Masaru Kato, Sony's chief financial officer, told a news conference Thursday. ''And where we can, we will chase new markets.''

HEADLINE: An Energy Regulator Vs. Wall St.

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Wall Street finds itself in a bare-knuckle brawl with a government agency.
Yet the fight is not with the Federal Reserve or another banking regulator, but a less-known agency more accustomed to patrolling the nation's energy pipeline than a trading floor.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the government watchdog overseeing the oil, natural gas and electricity business, has lately taken aim at three major banks suspected of manipulating energy prices. After taking action against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, the agency on Wednesday threatened to impose its largest fine ever against Barclays. 
The agency - building on a 2005 law, additional resources and a string of personnel moves - is increasingly exercising its new enforcement muscle to pursue not only energy companies but some of the nation's biggest banks. Indeed, the case against Barclays, which could cost the British bank $470 million, stems from a broad crackdown on questionable trading that has prompted 19 actions in the last two years.
"It's the most powerful agency that no one knows about," said Tyson Slocum, the director of the energy program for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.
And it is a regulator that has so far had unusually fierce clashes with Wall Street. While they may push back against regulations and enforcement actions, financial firms typically tread softly in dealing with their regulators, preferring to strike settlement deals that swiftly resolve scandals. In June, for example, Barclays paid $450 million to settle regulators' accusations that it had manipulated interest rates during the financial crisis.
But Barclays and JPMorgan are mounting counterattacks against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, casting the accusations against them as wrongheaded and overreaching. Even Deutsche Bank, which faces a meager $1.5 million fine, has vowed to fight.
"People have to be held accountable, but there also has to be clarity and due process," said Nora Mead Brownell, a former commissioner at the agency who became a founding partner at Espy Energy Solutions, an energy consulting firm.
The banks sense that a larger regulatory battle is at stake. Unlike financial regulators, the energy commission can fine firms $1 million a day for every violation. The string of recent cases, banks fear, could lay the groundwork for years of costly litigation.
The agency's effort is rooted in a 2005 law passed in the aftermath of the Enron fraud. The law created an enforcement unit at the agency and gave it the authority to assess hefty fines.
Under the Obama administration, the enforcement unit expanded its ranks and received a nearly 50 percent budget increase.
The unit, which this year created a specialized group to analyze arcane data and detect manipulation, also hired seasoned criminal investigators. The enforcement team is led by Norman C. Bay, the former United States attorney for New Mexico. One of his top deputies is a former general counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The overhaul is starting to bear fruit. The energy commission in March imposed a $245 million fine on Constellation Energy over charges that the company manipulated markets in New York to benefit its trading portfolio.
As several banks set up energy trading desks over the last decade, aiming to fill the business that Enron vacated, the agency expanded its focus to Wall Street.
The commission disclosed this summer that it was investigating JPMorgan Chase over potential manipulation of markets in California and the Midwest, exploring whether the firm had engaged in abusive bidding for energy prices.
The fight also centers on a technical issue: whether JPMorgan must turn over internal e-mail. The bank initially refused to turn over documents to the California agency that oversees the state's power grid, citing attorney-client privilege.
In September, the federal energy commission ordered the bank to produce evidence that it had not violated market rules, or risk losing its license to sell power at market rates. Last month, JPMorgan apologized and turned over some of the documents, blaming miscommunication for the impasse. The broader inquiry into the bank continues.
"The message from the cases is fairly simple: Traders have to play it straight," said Susan Court, the agency's first enforcement director who is now the principal of SJC Energy Consultants.
JPMorgan has said in a statement: "We believe we have complied in all respects with the law, as well as FERC rules and applicable tariffs, governing this market."
In its most significant case yet, the energy commission this week took action against Barclays. It outlined accusations that Barclays put on trades that were designed to skew the prices for electricity in what the industry calls the "physical" market.
Those prices then lifted the value of separate financial bets Barclays had placed, according to the commission. The agency argued that the gains in the financial bets were greater than the losses on the physical trades, effectively leaving Barclays with an overall profit. Citing complex calculations, the agency argued that the physical trades resulted in a loss of $4 million over the period, against gains of $35 million on the financial contracts.
The commission, emphasizing the nature of the conduct, sprinkled its order with excerpts from colorful and often explicit messages between traders.
In one e-mail, a trader wrote in vulgar terms that he would make trades that would lower one market to weigh down another.
The traders also discussed how one trader asked the others to help her "prop up" certain indexes, which would require taking a "daily loss" in the physical markets.
In testimony before the agency's investigators, bank employees said that traders were forbidden from intentionally forcing losses.
"The golden rule was always, under no circumstances, lose money on a transaction for the intention of making money on another transaction," the Americas head of Barclays' commodities unit, Joseph Gold, said in testimony.
Barclays issued a statement this week challenging the commission's allegations, saying the bank's "trading was legitimate and aboveboard." The bank added that it intended to "vigorously defend this matter."
Barclays plans to challenge the agency's tally of gains and losses, according to people briefed on the matter. Bank officials, who have 30 days to respond to the charges, are also expected to argue that regulators cherry-picked a handful of salacious e-mails from hundreds of thousands of documents.
Despite the onslaught of cases, Mr. Slocum of Public Citizen says the agency has yet to shake its backwater reputation. It still relies on private companies to police the front lines of energy manipulation, he said, and takes years to file cases.
"They're catching a few scraps," he said. But the recent actions have less to do with a reinvigorated agency than "companies engaging in widespread manipulation."
Peter Eavis contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 'Conceptual Abstraction'

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Hunter College/Times Square Gallery
450 West 41st Street,
Manhattan
Through Nov. 10
Abstract painting is making one of its perennial New York comebacks. And an ambitious survey called ''Conceptual Abstraction'' at the Hunter College/ Times Square Gallery gives a good sense of where it's coming back from. 
The 20 artists in the show all helped shape abstraction's previous revival in the 1980s. They all participated in an important 1991 exhibition, also called ''Conceptual Abstraction,'' at the Sidney Janis Gallery, documenting that florescence. And they all continue to produce characterful work today, as attested by the inclusion, in the Hunter show, of both vintage and recent paintings.
As conceived by the curators -- Pepe Karmel, an associate professor of art history at New York University, and Joachim Pissarro, professor of art at Hunter College and director of the Hunter College Art Galleries -- conceptual abstraction is a roomy term with a simple, basic definition. It is painting that exchanges the hermetic Modernist ideal of pure form for a different ideal, or anti-ideal: the real world, with its bodies and buildings, movies and messes, politics and pop culture.
The slick brush strokes in David Reed's ''#307'' (1991-92) suggest unreeling spools of celluloid film. In Mary Heilmann's ''Violette'' (1991) two painted panels are sensually interlocked. The spiky fleurs du mal in Philip Taaffe's ''Desert Flowers'' grew from the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Richard Kalina's jumpy red, white and blue ''In Absentia'' is a 1992 souvenir of the recession that preceded our Great Recession. Lydia Dona's architectonic ''Biochemical Topographies and the Gaps of Dislocation'' from the same year is about rust eating metal and cities falling down.
By no means does everything here translate into a human drama. A lot of the work is hungrily and critically focused on channeling other art or art styles: Pop in the case of a little 1991 intestinal still life by Thomas Nozkowski; Minimalism in Sherrie Levine's 1988 plywood puzzler, ''Untitled (Lead Knot: 7)'' and Stephen Westfall's 1992 ''Claremont'' with its quaking grid; and pattern and decoration in the design-intensive ''Social Contract'' by Valerie Jaudon, who teaches at Hunter and gave Mr. Karmel and Mr. Pissarro the idea of revisiting the Janis show.
As for newer work, suffice it to say that in every case it emerges logically, if sometimes surprisingly, from what preceded it two decades or more ago. And in some cases it plugs neatly into the present. Bill Komoski's galactic, holographic forms and David Diao's paintings with tables and lists feel in sync with the some of the information-filled, digitally inflected conceptual abstraction that's being done today and that will be lucky to find itself, 20 years on, in a looking-back-looking-forward historical survey like this.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, many galleries in Chelsea and downtown are flooded or without power. Check with galleries before visiting.

HEADLINE: Rescuing Horses as Industry Bides Its Time

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- Deborah Jones has a ticket to the Breeders' Cup, and as a lifelong horse lover, she would cherish a weekend amid the best thoroughbreds in the world and some of the most prominent owners in racing. But she will not make the drive 41 miles north to Santa Anita Park on Friday to watch the horses of sheiks and titans of industry compete for more than $25 million in purses.
Instead, Jones will make and take dozens of phone calls from like-minded thoroughbred advocates on the lookout for former racehorses that have landed at auctions and are en route to slaughterhouses in Canada and Mexico. When they are found, she will call their breeders or former owners in the hope they will send a trailer or some money to help find the horses a safe home.
Some have been horrified to learn of their horses' fate and have helped immediately. But many more, Jones said, have declined to help at all. 
Just two weeks ago, eight horses were discovered in a kill pen in Ohio. One of them had raced 12 days earlier at nearby Thistledown, and another had earned more than $217,000 in his career. Jones mobilized a rescue through her Facebook page.
Within hours, $6,200 was raised, and the horses -- all in poor shape -- were removed, quarantined and under veterinarian care. Over the past four years, Jones and her informal network have raised tens of thousands of dollars to save hundreds of horses.
''It is frustrating to know that these thoroughbreds are bred to make money for people,'' Jones said. ''There are values assigned to their pedigrees, they run for big purses, but then you see how easily they are discarded.''
In the past three years, nearly 86,000 thoroughbreds have been registered as foals, but only about half of them will actually make it to the races, according to Jockey Club statistics.
Slow or injured horses do not stay on an owner's balance sheet for long, and only a handful of horses possess the rare combination of regal bloodlines and proven talent to assure a career after racing. In 2011, for example, 1,861 stallions covered 35,391 mares in North America.
So where do the other former racehorses go?
Hard numbers are elusive, but 138,000 horses were sent to Canada or Mexico in 2010 to be turned into meat for Europe and other parts of the world, according to a Government Accountability Office report.
Advocacy groups say up to 10 percent may be thoroughbreds.
''We know the problem is massive: half the foal crop doesn't make it to the races year after year, and it becomes exponential,'' said Mike Ziegler, executive director of the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, an organization of breeders, owners, sales companies and racetracks recently formed to accredit and raise money for facilities for retired thoroughbreds.
Some owners treat their horses as members of the family and retire them to their farms or find them a home at retraining centers. Other owners treat them as commodities. Their horses are the ones that Jones and dozens of rescue groups come across.
Mindy Lovell has stopped hundreds of horses from reaching a slaughterhouse in Quebec, and she cares for more than 40 of them herself on her farm in Ottawa. They include expensive sons and daughters of stars like the Kentucky Derby winner Silver Charm and the Breeders' Cup Classic winner Skip Away. It costs her $7,000 a month to keep them fed and cared for, money that comes out of her own pocket.
''In all the years I've done this, only one breeder has ever taken back his horse and cared for it the rest of its life,'' Lovell said.''So many involved in the racing industry just sit there silently while we pull them out of the kill pens.''
John Murrell is a longtime horse owner and a friend of Jones's. Like many who save horses, he has a hard time squaring his passion for what he believes is a beautiful sport and the greed that encourages cruelty and abuse off the track.
He provided half the money to rescue Grunwald, a 5-year-old gelding who had won 11 times, and the seven other horses that went from the racetrack to the kill pen in Ohio in October. He knows he cannot save every horse, but he has spent countless hours and thousands of dollars saving scores of them.
''I'm part of the industry, and I know many, many fine people who take care of their horses,'' said Murrell, a Dallas-based oilman. ''But we're breeding too many, and we're dumping them like yesterday's trash when they become economically useless. It has to stop.''
Over the years, there have been substantial donations by individual owners and groups to umbrella organizations and aftercare programs.
In the past three years, for example, the Jockey Club has given $750,000 to Thoroughbred Charities of America and the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation. For the fourth straight year, trainers and owners of Breeders' Cup contenders have pledged a percentage of their earnings to New Vocations Racehorse Adoption Program. So far, more than $150,000 has gone to the organization, which finds homes for horses coming off 40 tracks.
Broader efforts have not fared as well. Since 2009, the Jockey Club has given owners an opportunity to donate $25 to $100 toward thoroughbred retirement when they register their foals. Participation has been poor, and although 86,000 foals have been registered, only a little more than $156,000 has been raised.
Next year, the Jockey Club will add a $25 transaction fee for registering a foal and give the money to the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance.
Auction companies like Keeneland have pledged a percentage of their gross sales receipts, and horseman groups have agreed to set aside a portion of purse money to take care of retired racehorses. Ziegler said the alliance had promises for $4 million for 2013, an admittedly modest start.
''There are a lot of transactions surrounding a horse, and if we take a small percentage of them, it's a lot of money,'' Ziegler said.
Less eager to participate, however, have been the commercial breeders who are responsible for the glut of racehorses. While 13 farms have pledged a portion of their stallion fees to the initiative, hundreds more, including some mainstays of the industry, have chosen a wait-and-see approach.
For Jones, the constant ringing of her phone, the often heartbreaking photos of missing horses that appear on her Facebook page and the 17 hours a day she says she spends identifying racehorses in distress and setting the wheels of rescue in motion are evidence enough that there is no time left to wait and see. Too often, her efforts are too late, and the horses are sent to their death.
As much as she would like to spend a day at the Breeders' Cup, Jones knows her time is better spent standing up for those thoroughbreds that have long been forgotten, she said.
''I'm not antiracing,'' she said. ''I work with, and need to work with, people in the industry. I'm just looking for more responsibility and accountability.''

HEADLINE: America's Gender Divide

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- FOR one prominent Cleveland businessman, a lifelong Democrat, the election had come down to a couple of burning questions: Did he dare tell his wife that he was thinking of voting for Mitt Romney? Would she ever forgive him?
In the end, although tempted, he did not dare and voted early for Obama. His quandary illustrates a fundamental dynamic of the excruciatingly close Ohio vote, which in turn could decide the election. Many men who voted for Obama in 2008 are now leaning toward Romney because they are frustrated by the president's handling of the economy and convinced that he cannot spur a decisive recovery. 
Many women, more focused on social issues, the problems they face in the work force and particularly the right to abortion, just think these men have lost it.
My Ohio survey was unscientific -- conversations over a few days -- but national polling reveals a sharp split along gender lines. The latest poll by The New York Times and CBS News found that Mr. Obama is supported by 52 percent of women and 44 percent of men, while Mr. Romney is preferred by 51 percent of men and 44 percent of women.
The race is poised on a knife-edge: the knives at the American breakfast tables where many husbands and wives are arguing.
If Obama loses, he will have to blame not only his disastrous first debate performance, his futile attempt to define Mitt Romney as a monstrous unfeeling capitalist, and his touch of alienating coolness. He will have to blame his inability to convince the leaders of corporate America that he is not ''anti-business'' and his failure to persuade many Americans, ranging from college graduates to holders of high school diplomas, that his top priority was jobs.
The anti-Obama feeling I encountered among business leaders in both Cleveland and Chicago was of startling vehemence. A Chicago chief executive, scion of Obama's hometown, described how Obama had alienated U.S.A. Inc. The narrative ran all the way from Obama's 2009 comment on 60 Minutes: ''I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street'' to his remark in a campaign speech this year that, ''If you've got a business -- you didn't build that.''
It included his failure to place business leaders in his inner circle, his reluctance to listen to them at White House gatherings and his lack of business experience.
The painstaking if uncertain recovery from the abyss of 2008, the salvaging of the auto industry, the lenience to Wall Street earned not a mention.
Obama is battling this sticky ''anti-business'' label in the land of business. That is an uphill road -- especially in an age of unlimited campaign contributions.
If Romney loses, he will have to blame remaining hostage too long to the right wing of the Republican Party, adopting a social agenda to please the Tea Party, delaying his move to the moderate center for too long, and failing to perceive that the level of economic discontent was such that he could win as a centrist pro-business Republican rather than as a ''pro-life'' ideologue echoing antediluvian male views on the rights, anatomies and inclinations of women.
A Chicago friend told me how you recognize liberal Republicans in Washington these days. ''They're the guys still eating with knives and forks,'' he said. Romney should have moved to that table long ago.
Both candidates have made big mistakes. We will know next week whose was most fatal.
Obama allowed Romney back in the race. After the conventions Romney was toast. After the first debate he became plausible. The Democratic ad blitz to define him as the beast of Bain imploded. Whatever else he was, the G.O.P. candidate was plainly a paid-up member of the human race.
Obama, through his lofty disdain, had suggested he did not care much about keeping his job. How then could he deliver on creating others?
I ran into Thomas Kish, a black ex-Marine working in security, near the West Side Market in downtown Cleveland. He has voted Democratic all his life. Now, worried by ''our downhill trend,'' he is unsure. ''I watched all those commercials that put Romney down and then I saw him in the debates and liked his aggressiveness,'' he said. ''He seemed like he could make some changes. Obama is a good talker, but not much of a backer-upper.''
Kish is a big reason Obama should be worried.
But then there was Pamela Stevenson, aged 49, with a job in marketing, who had already voted for Obama when I met her -- and brought along her two sons, aged 20 and 19, to make sure they voted for Obama, too. ''We are coming out in numbers,'' she told me. ''We know that is what we have to do to get him back in.''
It has come down to women against men, turnout against momentum. How many women, blacks, Latinos, workers will vote for Obama? How many Romney voters are keeping quiet about their choice? There is no romance left. Obama will have to grind this out -- and hope feminine good sense prevails.

HEADLINE: Hit Mexico's Cartels With Legalization

BYLINE: By IOAN GRILLO

 BODY:
WHENEVER I've interviewed Mexican cartel killers, the aspect that I've found most disturbing about them is that they appear to be sane.
Even though they have described to me such unfathomable actions as hacking off the heads of still-living victims, it is something other than mental illness that drives their violence. Their sanity is disconcerting because, if they were simply mad, it would be easier to accept horrific actions like leaving piles of headless corpses in town squares.
Instead, we have to face up to the hard reasons why thousands of young men (and some women) with full mental faculties have become serial killers. These reasons should be taken into account by residents of Colorado, Washington state and Oregon when they vote on referendums to legalize marijuana next Tuesday. 
The painful truth is that the monster of Mexican cartels has been pumped up by decades of Americans buying illegal drugs under the policies of prohibition. No one knows exactly how much money Mexican traffickers make, but reasonable estimates find they pocket $30 billion every year selling cocaine, marijuana, heroin and crystal meth to American users. Since 1980, the cumulative jackpot could be close to $1 trillion. Under the law of the jungle, this money goes to the most violent and sadistic players, so the cartels have spent their dollars on building increasingly ferocious death squads.
There have been a tragic 60,000 killings under President Felipe Calderón that are described as drug-related. But even this description can be misleading. Most cartel assassins do not carry out these brutal acts because they are high on drugs. Their motive is to capture the profits that are so high because in the black market you can buy drugs for a nickel and sell them for a dollar. How many others would love to be in a business with a markup of more than 2,000 percent?
Marijuana is just one of the drugs that the cartels traffic. Chemicals such as crystal meth may be too venomous to ever be legalized. But cannabis is a cash crop that provides huge profits to criminal armies, paying for assassins and guns south of the Rio Grande. The scale of the Mexican marijuana business was illustrated by a mammoth 120-hectare plantation busted last year in Baja California. It had a sophisticated irrigation system, sleeping quarters for 60 workers and could produce 120 metric tons of cannabis per harvest.
Again, nobody knows exactly how much the whole Mexico-U.S. marijuana trade is worth, with estimates ranging from $2 billion to $20 billion annually. But even if you believe the lowest numbers, legal marijuana would take billions of dollars a year away from organized crime. This would inflict more financial damage than soldiers or drug agents have managed in years and substantially weaken cartels.
It is also argued that Mexican gangsters have expanded to a portfolio of crimes that includes kidnapping, extortion, human smuggling and theft from oil pipelines. This is a terrifying truth. But this does not take away from the fact that the marijuana trade provides the crime groups with major resources. That they are committing crimes such as kidnapping, which have a horrific effect on innocent people, makes cutting off their financing all the more urgent.
The cartels will not disappear overnight. U.S. agents and the Mexican police need to continue battling hit squads that wield rocket-propelled grenades and belt-driven machine guns. Killers who hack off heads still have to be locked away. Mexico needs to clean up corruption among the police and build a valid justice system. And young men in the barrios have to be given a better option than signing up as killers.
All these tasks will be easier if the flow of money to the cartels is dramatically slowed down. Do we really want to hand them another trillion dollars over the next three decades?
It is always hard to deal with these global issues in a world where all politics is local. Mexico was not even featured in the presidential debate on foreign policy, despite that fact that the United States has supported Calderón's war on drugs with more than $1.3 billion worth of hardware, including Black Hawk helicopters, and that cartels have attacked and killed U.S. agents.
Of course, residents of Colorado and Washington will have many valid local reasons to make their choices. But on the issue of organized crime, the underlying fact should be clear: Legal marijuana will take away dollars that pay for assassins and redirect them to small businesses and government coffers.
If voters do choose to legalize marijuana it would be a historic decision, but it would also open up a can of worms. The U.S. federal government and even the United Nations would be forced to react to a state's resolution to break from the path. This could be a good thing.
Many Latin American leaders and others have been questioning the current prohibitionist doctrine. Even Calderón, who staked his presidency on fighting cartels and suffered assassination threats, spoke at the United Nations in September demanding an international debate on drug policy. Perhaps the time for this debate has come.

HEADLINE: Fiat's Plan to Go Upscale Is Met With Skepticism

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, was the model of the concerned corporate leader when he vowed this week not to close any underused Italian car factories. But many doubt whether even the man who led Chrysler's revival can defy Europe's worst industry downturn in decades.
Instead of closing factories that are operating at less than half of capacity and throwing thousands of people out of work, Fiat will attempt to do what BMW and Mercedes have done in Germany. It will make Italy a production center for the company's pricier brands, like Alfa Romeo and Maserati, which Fiat will then try to export to the United States and fast-growing markets in Asia.
The ambitious plan has been received skeptically by analysts who doubt whether Alfa Romeo can play in the same league as the German brands -- each of which sells more than four times as many cars in Europe and already have strong positions in America and China. 
''Alfa has too little volume,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany who generally admires Mr. Marchionne.
Even in Italy, where Fiat is the largest private-sector employer, Mr. Marchionne's vow not to close plants won only muted praise. Many in the country complain that he has not kept past promises to invest in new Fiat brand cars.
''Fiat's words are good, fair and realistic,'' Roberto Cota, the president of the Piedmont region, told the news agency Ansa. ''But as president of the region I await facts.''
What is more, any good will generated by Mr. Marchionne's show of commitment to Italian jobs was overshadowed by a decision this week to fire 19 workers at a factory in Naples. That came after a court ordered the company to rehire 19 others who had been dismissed, ruling in favor of their claims of discrimination.
If the firings seemed vindictive to the company's critics, Fiat said in a statement that it had ''no alternative but to employ the necessary mechanisms to reduce the company's existing work force by the same number.''
During a week in which Ford and General Motors reported another quarter of huge losses in Europe, Mr. Marchionne illustrated just how different the crisis on the Continent is playing out compared with the one on the other side of the Atlantic in 2009.
European automakers cannot count on U.S.-style bailouts from strapped governments. And even if countries did try to prop up their national champions, they would probably run afoul of European Union rules.
In Europe, the government role usually consists of trying to prevent car companies from cutting jobs, even in response to huge financial losses. Calls by Mr. Marchionne for a coordinated, industrywide reduction of factory capacity have not led to any action. So the carmakers are left to fight among themselves for higher shares of a shrinking market -- a competition that not all can win.
''The market is going to be a lot tougher than people think,'' Mr. Marchionne said during a conference call with analysts Tuesday. ''This is truly not for the fainthearted.''
Not that the car business is immune to politics in the United States, where Mr. Marchionne has been drawn into the fray. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has been running television commercials contending that President Barack Obama ''sold Chrysler to Italians.''
In fact, many analysts credit Mr. Marchionne -- who grew up partly in Canada and has dual Canadian and Italian citizenship -- with rescuing Chrysler from oblivion. The rescue saved the jobs of more than 55,000 company employees, mostly in the United States and Canada.
''If it wasn't for Marchionne Chrysler wouldn't be around,'' said Paul Nieuwenhuis, a director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales.
Fiat and Chrysler remain legally separate. And Fiat cannot subsidize Italian operations with Chrysler profits, according to the company. On the contrary, Fiat has been supplying Chrysler with components and engineering that allow it to introduce more new products than it might be able to do on its own. The new Dodge Dart borrows heavily from the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, and the company is expected to incorporate more Italian styling and technology into future Chrysler models.
While European sales have not yet dropped as steeply as they did in the United States in 2009, the downturn -- 20 percent since 2007 -- has lasted longer and an uptick is not yet in sight. Mr. Marchionne said that Fiat's European operations would not be profitable again until 2015 or 2016. G.M. this week made a similar forecast for Opel, after reporting a pretax loss in Europe of $478 million.
Except for Ford, which plans to close three factories in Europe after reporting a pretax loss of $468 million in the region during the quarter, automakers have been hesitant to face the public opprobrium that accompanies any shutdown. Opel plans to close a plant in Bochum, Germany, but probably not until 2016.
Mr. Marchionne, who said earlier this week that it made more business sense to keep plants open, promised to roll out an array of new high-end models that would be built in Italy for export. The product offensive is to include seven new Alfa Romeos, six new Maseratis and a new Jeep brand vehicle.
Critics are skeptical about the plans to move upmarket.
''They've been trying that for a while with limited success,'' said Mr. Nieuwenhuis of Cardiff University. Alfa and Fiat have too thin a distribution and service network in Europe even when its products are appealing, he said. ''What let them down was their dealer network,'' Mr. Nieuwenhuis said.
All the European carmakers are trying to escape dependence on lower-priced vehicles with thin or nonexistent profit margins. They look enviously at the German carmakers, which have remained profitable through the downturn. So far no European rivals have been able to seriously challenge the dominance of BMW, Mercedes and Audi.
Renault said Wednesday that it wanted to focus its French factories on higher-priced cars like the Laguna. The company said it would begin talks with labor unions next week on how to operate more profitably. In a statement, the company did not mention plant closings.
Given that Mr. Marchionne has already led one turnaround at Fiat, and gets credit for saving Chrysler, it would probably be a mistake to underestimate his chances. For all its problems, Fiat has performed better in Europe than Ford or Opel.
Fiat said Tuesday that it lost &#x20ac;219 million, or $283 million, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter, compared with a loss of &#x20ac;135 million a year earlier. As bad as that is, it is still substantially better than Ford's and G.M.'s results in the region.
''We have all said nasty things about his strategy but he did better than we expected,'' said Mr. Dudenhöffer of the University of Duisburg-Essen.
Still, some analysts have expressed doubt how long Fiat, which is profitable over all because of sales outside Europe, can continue to absorb losses at home. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimate the company is burning through &#x20ac;15 million a day. On Tuesday the company raised its estimate of what its debt would be at the end of the year, to &#x20ac;6.5 billion. That compared with a previous forecast of no more than &#x20ac;6 billion.
When an analyst questioned Tuesday whether Fiat had enough money to carry out its plans for new models, Mr. Marchionne replied sharply: ''There is enough cash coming out of this damn thing, don't worry about it.''
One reason that Fiat has lost less money than some rivals is that the company has drastically cut investment in new Fiat cars. In an industry that lives on new products, that is a controversial approach.
''The one big risk with Marchionne is that he is saving very radically on product development,'' Mr. Dudenhöffer said. ''He is taking a big risk. We'll see in a few years whether it worked.''
Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Class Divide Jumbled by the Storm

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- For Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize recipient and Harvard economist and philosopher, a formative life experience was the Bengal famine of 1943, which he had observed as a child living in Santiniketan, in West Bengal, a state in the eastern region of India.
What impressed itself most powerfully upon Mr. Sen, and eventually inspired some of his most important work, was the uneven impact of the tragedy. Between two and three million people died during the famine, but the young Mr. Sen noticed that his personal acquaintances were unaffected. 
''I knew of no one in my school or my many friends and relations whose family had experienced the slightest problem during the entire famine,'' he explains in the autobiographical note he wrote for the Nobel Prize. ''It was not a famine that afflicted even the lower middle classes -- only people much further down the economic ladder, such as landless rural laborers.''
The so-called Superstorm Sandy, and its devastating aftermath, has the potential to create a similar epiphany for much of America. Mr. Sen's central observation was of the ''thoroughly class-dependent character'' of famine. The first instinct of many Americans was to note that Sandy's damage had likewise been drawn along economic lines.
One of the most hard-working metaphors -- Google it to see for yourself -- in this disaster is some version of ''A Tale of Two Cities.'' The power grid cleavage of the island of Manhattan into a fully functioning uptown -- above 34th Street -- and dark and cold downtown, south of that dividing line, inspired some to muse that, like the famine of Mr. Sen's boyhood, Sandy hadn't touched the affluent. It had afflicted, instead, the historically rougher neighborhoods.
But, as others quickly noted, unlike famine, this meteorological disaster was no respecter of class divides. Many poor communities were hard hit, but so were some glossy ones -- my Twitter feed reflected the irony of refugees from pricey Soho seeking shelter in less expensive Brooklyn precincts. And one of Sandy's most dramatic manifestations in New York on Monday was when the winds bent back the construction crane on One57, a luxury condominium tower. This skyscraper, which will be the highest residential building in the city, is a true plutocrats' palace -- apartments in the top eleven floors start at $50 million, and a duplex penthouse has sold for $90 million -- which is being expressly marketed at the global super-rich.
The real class divide exposed by Sandy, as my colleague David Rohde has argued, is the way in which money makes natural disasters more bearable. Finding a hotel room and perhaps a taxi to take you there is tough this week in New York, but at least the rich can afford both.
This economic bifurcation is well worth dwelling on, particularly because it so powerfully reflects the broader ways in which, in the economically polarized United States of today, disaster affects the rich and the poor so differently. If you are a member of the hollowed-out middle class, getting sick or losing your job is a blow from which you, and perhaps your children, will never recover. For the plutocrats, bouncing back is much easier: Indeed, crisis really can be opportunity.
If Sandy prompts Americans to dwell on this divide, that will be an important consequence, particularly on the eve of the presidential election. But an equally powerful impact of the storm may lie elsewhere. Sandy, as Rebecca Solnit, author of ''A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster,'' told me, was about ''geography, not economy.''
For a few hours or days, those geographic lines bisected Manhattan into a new community of privilege and deprivation. Privilege meant living north of 34th Street, no matter what your income, race, gender or creed; deprivation meant living south of that line.
Ms. Solnit said that every disaster she had studied created ''a leveling moment -- we are all in it together.'' She argues that this instant of solidarity creates a ''rupture'' that can forever transform individual human lives and, sometimes, entire societies.
In economically polarized America, Sandy has served up a meaningful twist on this theme. Sandy hasn't really leveled Manhattan -- the storm has jumbled it up. For a day or two, your life circumstances were most powerfully shaped not by the size of your bank account, but by your particular street address. That gave some of the denizens of the city's hippest quarters a brief taste of what it is like to suddenly be the losers in life's lottery.
The philosopher John B. Rawls imagined a veil of ignorance to help judge the justice of any particular social order. As Mr. Rawls described it, ''No one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength and the like.''
The veil of ignorance is a good way to figure out whether you really support a particular social construct. Would fans of apartheid have backed it if subject to the veil of ignorance? How about limits on reproductive rights?
The veil of ignorance is also a valuable idea when it comes to thinking about income inequality in America, particularly because so many winners in this country's winner-take-all-economy are so certain they fully deserve their good fortune. Sandy should be a reminder that very often in life neither triumph nor disaster are deserved. Understanding that would profoundly change how America responds to rising economic disparity.

HEADLINE: The Blackmail Caucus

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
If President Obama is re-elected, health care coverage will expand dramatically, taxes on the wealthy will go up and Wall Street will face tougher regulation. If Mitt Romney wins instead, health coverage will shrink substantially, taxes on the wealthy will fall to levels not seen in 80 years and financial regulation will be rolled back.
Given the starkness of this difference, you might have expected to see people from both sides of the political divide urging voters to cast their ballots based on the issues. Lately, however, I've seen a growing number of Romney supporters making a quite different argument. Vote for Mr. Romney, they say, because if he loses, Republicans will destroy the economy. 
O.K., they don't quite put it that way. The argument is phrased in terms of ''partisan gridlock,'' as if both parties were equally extreme. But they aren't. This is, in reality, all about appeasing the hard men of the Republican Party.
If you want an example of what I'm talking about, consider the remarkable -- in a bad way -- editorial in which The Des Moines Register endorsed Mr. Romney. The paper acknowledged that Mr. Obama's signature economic policy, the 2009 stimulus, was the right thing to do. It also acknowledged that Mr. Obama tried hard to reach out across the partisan divide, but was rebuffed.
Yet it endorsed his opponent anyway, offering some half-hearted support for Romneynomics, but mainly asserting that Mr. Romney would be able to work with Democrats in a way that Mr. Obama has not been able to work with Republicans. Why? Well, the paper claims -- as many of those making this argument do -- that, in office, Mr. Romney would be far more centrist than anything he has said in the campaign would indicate. (And the notion that he has been lying all along is supposed to be a point in his favor?) But mostly it just takes it for granted that Democrats would be more reasonable.
Is this a good argument?
The starting point for many ''vote for Romney or else'' statements is the notion that a re-elected President Obama wouldn't be able to accomplish anything in his second term. What this misses is the fact that he has already accomplished a great deal, in the form of health reform and financial reform -- reforms that will go into effect if, and only if, he is re-elected.
But would Mr. Obama be able to negotiate a Grand Bargain on the budget? Probably not -- but so what? America isn't facing any kind of short-run fiscal crisis, except in the fevered imagination of a few Beltway insiders. If you're worried about the long-run imbalance between spending and revenue, well, that's an issue that will have to be resolved eventually, but not right away. Furthermore, I'd argue that any alleged Grand Bargain would be worthless as long as the G.O.P. remained as extreme as it is, because the next Republican president, following the lead of George W. Bush, would just squander the gains on tax cuts and unfunded wars.
So we shouldn't worry about the ability of a re-elected Obama to get things done. On the other hand, it's reasonable to worry that Republicans will do their best to make America ungovernable during a second Obama term. After all, they have been doing that ever since Mr. Obama took office.
During the first two years of Mr. Obama's presidency, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, Republicans offered scorched-earth opposition to anything and everything he proposed. Among other things, they engaged in an unprecedented number of filibusters, turning the Senate -- for the first time -- into a chamber in which nothing can pass without 60 votes.
And, when Republicans took control of the House, they became even more extreme. The 2011 debt ceiling standoff was a first in American history: An opposition party declared itself willing to undermine the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, with incalculable economic effects, unless it got its way. And the looming fight over the ''fiscal cliff'' is more of the same. Once again, the G.O.P. is threatening to inflict large damage on the economy unless Mr. Obama gives it something -- an extension of tax cuts for the wealthy -- that it lacks the votes to pass through normal constitutional processes.
Would a Democratic Senate offer equally extreme opposition to a President Romney? No, it wouldn't. So, yes, there is a case that ''partisan gridlock'' would be less damaging if Mr. Romney won.
But are we ready to become a country in which ''Nice country you got here. Shame if something were to happen to it'' becomes a winning political argument? I hope not. By all means, vote for Mr. Romney if you think he offers the better policies. But arguing for Mr. Romney on the grounds that he could get things done veers dangerously close to accepting protection-racket politics, which have no place in American life.

HEADLINE: Marathon Presses On as Backlash Builds

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Juliet Macur, David Chen and Mary Pilon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Amid intensifying criticism, New York Road Runners continued Thursday to prepare for the New York City Marathon with an abbreviated schedule of events leading to the race.
With the death count from Hurricane Sandy growing, hundreds of thousands still without power, and air, rail and ferry service struggling to resume, some runners and elected officials have called for Sunday's marathon to be canceled or postponed. Police, fire and other essential public services, they said, should be focused on helping those most in need.
Nevertheless, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, aware that the marathon generates hundreds of millions of dollars for the city, repeated Thursday that the race would go on. He did not expect the Police Department to be overly burdened because the race is on a Sunday, when street traffic is limited. Many parts of the city, including Lower Manhattan, are expected to have their power back, freeing other workers. 
''The city is a city where we have to go on,'' Bloomberg said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
Mary Wittenberg, chief executive of New York Road Runners, which puts on the race, defended Bloomberg's decision and said the race would be used as a platform to lift spirits and raise money. Her organization plans to donate $1 million, or $26.20 for every runner who starts the race, to relief efforts in the city. The Rudin Family and ING, two sponsors of the race, will donate a combined $1.6 million to storm relief. Road Runners is working to donate other supplies to relief efforts.
George Hirsch, the chairman of the board of Road Runners, acknowledged that running the marathon could be viewed as trivial and even a drain in light of the devastation in and around New York. But he expected the race to galvanize the city much as it did after the terrorist attacks in September 2001.
''I understand the controversy completely and respect all the views on this, but any decision that was made by the mayor would have been controversial and to call off the race would have been equally as controversial,'' Hirsch said. ''By Sunday afternoon, there won't be any controversy. People will view it as an early step in the city's recovery.''
New York's marathon is the world's largest, but this year the race will be noticeably smaller. Hirsch said he expected about 40,000 runners to begin the race, about 15 percent below what had initially been expected.
Wittenberg said that Road Runners had ''essentially canceled'' nearly everything on its calendar before the marathon, including a youth event Thursday, the opening ceremony in Central Park on Friday and the Dash to the Finish Line 5K on Saturday that would have run through Midtown.
With air and rail service only now starting to resume, many runners have yet to reach the city. Once they do, other accommodations will be needed. For now, the Staten Island Ferry transportation option to the start line is in doubt, and runners who hoped to get to the start line by ferry may need to take a bus instead. Typically, about half of the runners in the marathon take that route to get to the start line at the toll plaza to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on Staten Island.
Runners will have until Saturday, instead of Wednesday, to withdraw from the race. They will be guaranteed a spot in next year's race, but will not have this year's entry fee refunded.
The marathon has escalated into political fodder, with elected officials issuing statements about the appropriateness of staging the race.
The likely Democratic candidates for mayor of New York offered their opinions. William C. Thompson said the race should be canceled because ''our neighbors are hurting and our city needs to make them its priority.'' John Liu, the comptroller, told Reuters that it should go on because ''it's a big economic generator.'' Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, also supported the decision to hold the race, saying, ''The event is a city institution that delivers tremendous economic activity.''
Some runners are torn about taking part. Simon Ressner, a lieutenant at the Fire Department, said that the police and fire departments and ambulance drivers are often needed unexpectedly in a disaster situation like this one. He noted that at least four police officers were at one gas station at Flatbush that he passed Thursday en route to evaluate the safety of some burned homes in Breezy Point, Queens. About 300 people had gathered to fill their gas cans, and the police officers were there to control the crowd.
''There's a concrete example of why you need all the city resources available right now,'' said Ressner, who added that he was 80 percent sure he would run Sunday. ''I've written two e-mails to the Road Runners saying, 'Just postpone it.' That way, you'll still get the money, you'll still have a high-profile event, but it would show that you're being sensitive. But now, we're not going to show the world we're resilient, we're going to show them we're selfish.''
First responders are not the only ones questioning the wisdom of holding the race. People on Staten Island are particularly angry that their borough is being used as a jumping-off point for the race while critical services for those stranded by the storm are not getting through.
Michelle Cleary, a singer-songwriter on Staten Island, started a Facebook group Wednesday calling for the marathon to be canceled. She came up with the idea because she and one of her two sisters did not have power, and her mother, a nurse in a burn unit, was upset by the devastation around them.
''Everyone was talking about whether they should have the marathon or not and I thought I should do something about it,'' she said in a phone interview.
In less than 24 hours, more than 5,000 people had endorsed the site on Facebook.
A separate online petition calling for the race to be postponed had more than 1,100 signatures.
Cleary said that she worried about the potential toll the race could have on volunteers and city workers and would be in favor of postponing the marathon or diverting runners and volunteers to storm relief efforts. ''I respect the Road Runners and I think they're doing the best they can, but I don't think they're being fully realistic,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Market Lifted by Reports On Jobs and Consumers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market moved solidly higher on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index scoring its best day in seven weeks, as bullish reports on consumer confidence and private sector jobs encouraged investors. 
Data from the payrolls processor A.D.P. showed that American companies added 158,000 workers in October, the fastest pace in eight months. In another encouraging sign, consumer confidence jumped in October to its highest level in more than four years, the Conference Board said.
The numbers showed a slightly more positive picture of the American economy a day before Friday's employment report from the Labor Department, the most widely watched United States economic indicator.
''In all, it bodes well for the bull side, and finally gave some investors a catalyst to buy,'' said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates, an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio. ''Tomorrow will be more of a trump card and can take it all away.''
Employers are expected to have added 125,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in October, up from 114,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to have inched up to 7.9 percent after a sharp drop to 7.8 percent in September.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 136.16 points, or 1.04 percent, to close at 13,232.62 The S.& P. 500 shot up 15.43 points, or 1.09 percent, to finish at 1,427.59, its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 13, when the Federal Reserve unveiled its plan for a third round of economic stimulus. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 42.83 points, or 1.44 percent, to 3,020.06.
Pfizer fell 32 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $24.55 after it reported revenue that fell far short of expectations.
Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, which like Pfizer is a Dow component, gained 43 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $91.60. The company reported a quarterly profit that slipped from a year earlier, although it still topped expectations. Exxon's oil and gas output, however, declined more than expected.
In after-hours trading, Starbucks rose $3.54, or 7.6 percent, to $50.16 after it reported a higher quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast. The stock closed regular trading at $46.62.
During the regular session, official and private sector factory surveys in China that showed the world's second-biggest economy regaining some traction added to support for stocks.
The JDA Software Group, a maker of supply-chain management software, soared $6.61, or 17.3 percent, to $44.76. The company agreed to a cash buyout by a privately held rival, RedPrairie, with a value of about $1.9 billion.
In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 13/32, to 99 2/32, while its yield rose to 1.73 percent, from 1.69 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Innovative Immigrants

BYLINE: By THOMAS K. McCRAW. 
Thomas K. McCraw is a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School and the author, most recently, of ''The Founders and Finance: How Hamilton, Gallatin, and Other Immigrants Forged a New Economy.''

 BODY:
Boston
SOME 70 million immigrants have come to America since the first colonists arrived. The role their labor has played in economic development is widely understood. Much less familiar is the extent to which their remarkable innovations have driven American prosperity.
Indeed, while both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have lauded entrepreneurship, innovation and ''job creation,'' neither candidate has made comprehensive immigration reform an issue, despite immigrants' crucial role in those fields. Yet understanding how immigrants have fueled innovation through history is critical to making sure they continue to drive prosperity in the future. 
At the country's beginning, the three most important architects of its financial system were immigrants: Alexander Hamilton, from St. Croix, then part of the Danish West Indies; Robert Morris, born in Liverpool, England; and Albert Gallatin of Geneva. Morris was superintendent of finance during the Revolutionary War, using every resource at his command to support the army in the field. Hamilton, as the first secretary of the Treasury, rescued the country from bankruptcy and designed its basic financial system. Gallatin paid down much of the national debt, engineered the financing of the Louisiana Purchase and remains the longest-serving Treasury secretary ever.
Immigrants' financial innovations continued through the 19th century. In 1808 Alexander Brown, from Ireland, founded the nation's first investment bank, and his immigrant sons set up Brown Brothers. The Lehman brothers, from Germany, began as dry-goods merchants and cotton brokers in Alabama, then moved to New York just before the Civil War and eventually founded a bank. Many other immigrants, including Marcus Goldman of Goldman Sachs, followed similar paths, starting very small, traveling to new cities and establishing banks. Meanwhile, ''Yankee'' firms like Kidder, Peabody and Drexel, Morgan -- whose partners were native-born -- remained less mobile, tied by family and high society to Boston and New York.
Immigrant innovators were pioneers in many other industries after the Civil War. Three examples were Andrew Carnegie (Scotland, steel), Joseph Pulitzer (Hungary, newspapers) and David Sarnoff (Russia, electronics). Each came to America young, poor and full of energy.
Carnegie's mother brought the family to Pittsburgh in 1848, when Andrew was 12. He became a bobbin-boy in a textile mill, a telegram messenger, a telegraph-key operator, a low-level manager at the Pennsylvania Railroad, a division superintendent for the same railroad and a bond salesman for the railroad in Europe.
Recognizing the limitless market for the rails that carried trains, Carnegie jumped to steel. His most important innovation was ''hard driving'' blast furnaces, wearing them out quickly. This violated the accepted practice of ''coddling'' furnaces, but he calculated that his vastly increased output cut the price of steel far more than replacing the furnaces cost his company. In turn, an immense quantity of cheap steel found its way into lucrative new uses: structural steel for skyscrapers, sheet steel for automobiles.
Pulitzer was the home-tutored son of a prosperous Hungarian family that lost its fortune. He came to the United States in 1864 at age 17, recruited by a Massachusetts Civil War regiment. Penniless after the war ended, he went to St. Louis, a center for German immigrants, whose language he spoke fluently.
He worked as a waiter, a railroad clerk, a lawyer and a reporter for a local German newspaper, part of which he eventually purchased. In 1879, he acquired two English-language papers and merged them into The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
In 1883, he moved to New York, where he bought The New York World and began a fierce competition with other New York papers, mainly the Sun and, later, William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. The New York World was pro-labor, pro-immigration and, remarkably, both serious and sensationalist. It achieved a huge circulation.
Sarnoff was just 9 years old when he arrived from Russia in 1901. He earned money selling Yiddish newspapers on the street and singing at a synagogue, and then worked as an office clerk, a messenger and, like Carnegie, a telegraph operator. From there he became part of the fledgling radio firm RCA and rose rapidly within its ranks.
Sarnoff was among the first to see radio's potential as ''point-to-mass'' entertainment, i.e., broadcasting. He devoted a huge percentage of profits to research and development, and won an epic battle with CBS over industry standards for color TV. For decades, RCA and electronics were practically synonymous.
As these men show, one of the key traits of immigrant innovators is geographic mobility, both from the home country and within the United States. Consider the striking roster of 20th-century immigrants who led the development of fields like movies and information technology: the Hollywood studios MGM, Warner Brothers, United Artists, Paramount and Universal; the Silicon Valley companies Intel, eBay, Google, Yahoo and Sun Microsystems.
The economist Joseph Schumpeter -- yet another immigrant, and the most perceptive early analyst of innovation -- considered it to be the fundamental component of entrepreneurship: ''The typical entrepreneur is more self-centered than other types, because he relies less than they do on tradition and connection'' and because his efforts consist ''precisely in breaking up old, and creating new, tradition.'' For that reason, innovators always encounter resistance from people whose economic and social interests are threatened by new products and methods.
Compared with the native-born, who have extended families and lifelong social and commercial relationships, immigrants without such ties -- without businesses to inherit or family property to protect -- are in some ways better prepared to play the innovator's role. A hundred academic monographs could not prove that immigrants are more innovative than native-born Americans, because each spurs the other on. Innovations by the blended population were, and still are, integral to the economic growth of the United States.
But our overly complex immigration law hampers even the most obvious innovators' efforts to become citizens. It endangers our tradition of entrepreneurship, and it must be repaired -- soon.

HEADLINE: Fraud Case Delayed By 2 Months

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
In its prospectus, a penny stock named Caribbean Pacific Marketing proudly described itself as an ''emerging growth company'' when it began to sell shares to the public this summer.
To someone uninitiated to the Orwellian nature of recent legislation, that phrase might have seemed downright deceptive. As the prospectus made clear, it was not a growth company; it was barely even a company at all. It hoped to start a business with the proceeds from the offering.
But that phrase was enshrined in legislation officially called the JOBS Act, which Congress passed and the president signed this year in an unusual display of bipartisanship.
Now, Caribbean Pacific Marketing -- a company without revenue since it was created earlier this year -- appears to have become the first ''emerging growth company'' as defined by the JOBS Act to have prompted charges of securities fraud by the Justice Department and an effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to halt sales of the stock. The government claims a disbarred lawyer from Boca Raton, Fla., is really behind the company. 
Those charges came two months after the S.E.C. allowed the company to begin selling shares under a prospectus that the government now says it knew to be inaccurate.
The Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act defined nearly every business in the United States as an ''emerging growth company.'' No growth was needed to qualify as such a company, only that it must have less than $1 billion in assets, less than $700 million in shares in public hands and less than five years as a public company. Such companies could sell stock to the public with fewer restrictions, and then report less information to their shareholders than was required from normal companies.
The idea was that numerous new companies would get financing, and in that way promote job growth. Critics warned that some provisions might simply make it a lot easier to commit securities fraud. Alternate titles like ''Jumpstart Our Bilking of Suckers Act'' were suggested.
It is far too soon to pronounce on the act's success. The S.E.C. has yet to issue some important rules, so innovations like crowdfunding, whereby it becomes legal to market possible offerings to anyone on the Internet before a registration statement has been filed, have yet to get off the ground. Some of the companies that have gone public under the JOBS Act provisions have done well in subsequent trading.
Caribbean Pacific was formed in January, selling 20 million shares of stock to insiders for $30,000. After expenses for things like a Web site saying it plans to sell ''the finest all-natural sun care and skin care products,'' it had precisely $20 left at the end of June.
The company planned to sell up to one million new shares to the public at 15 cents each, 100 times what the insiders paid. The S.E.C. allowed the offering to begin in August, but it is not clear how many shares have actually been sold. The company said over-the-counter trading would begin as soon as 500,000 shares were sold, something that has not happened. It promised that if the minimum number of shares were not sold within nine months, it would return the money to the buyers.
The strategy may have never actually called for that offering to succeed at all. It appears that some of those insider shares were being sold privately, with the promise that the buyers could earn a quick profit by reselling them as soon as the company went public. Such sales would not be legal.
Last week the Justice Department charged that the disbarred lawyer, William J. Reilly, had been trying to sell shares before the offering became effective. Unfortunately for him, he did sell some shares -- at 5 cents each -- to a buyer who turned out to be working with the F.B.I. In the complaint filed in Federal District Court in Miami, an F.B.I. agent stated the bureau has been conducting, with the S.E.C., ''an ongoing undercover investigation targeting penny stock fraud in Florida.''
The complaint stated that Mr. Reilly claimed to own 9.2 percent of the company's shares, although the prospectus, in its list of people who owned at least 5 percent, did not mention him. The S.E.C. action, announced this week, claimed that Mr. Reilly secretly controlled the company and asked that an administrative law judge halt the public offering.
Mr. Reilly previously settled -- without, of course, admitting or denying he actually violated any laws -- an S.E.C. suit claiming he had done something similar at other penny stock companies, allowing insiders to sell restricted shares when they should not have been permitted to do so. He was ordered to comply with the law in the future and barred from practicing as a lawyer before the S.E.C. Last year, the S.E.C. filed another suit, claiming he was continuing to act as a securities lawyer for another penny stock company based in Boca Raton. In March of this year, a federal judge ordered him to comply with the original injunction. In May, he was disbarred for ''misappropriating'' money held for a different corporate client.
The Justice Department action states that on July 31, ''agents with the F.B.I. and another federal law enforcement agency'' met with Mr. Reilly at a Denny's restaurant in Boca Raton and told him about the investigation. In that interview, it says, Mr. Reilly admitted violating securities laws in selling the Caribbean Pacific stock. The affidavit from the F.B.I. agent also says Caribbean Pacific's ostensible president, Thomas Hagan, admitted that he knew virtually nothing about the company and that he deferred to Mr. Reilly in decisions regarding it, although it does not say when that admission was made.
In late August, Randall Lanham, a California lawyer representing Caribbean Pacific, sent two letters to the S.E.C., asking that it allow the company to begin selling shares on Aug. 29. In the second of those letters, Mr. Lanham said the company understood that allowing the sale would ''not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filing.'' The commission granted the request, and the company was allowed to begin marketing shares under a prospectus that the government knew was inaccurate.
It took another two months for the government to file the actions.
Asked why the S.E.C.'s division of corporation finance allowed the offering to proceed, John Nester, an S.E.C. spokesman, said, ''As is always the case, Enforcement and Corporation Finance staff closely and appropriately coordinated their efforts in this case. As soon as staff had the necessary and required evidence to support the pending action in this case, we filed the case.''
Neither Mr. Lanham nor the federal public defender representing Mr. Reilly in the criminal case returned phone calls seeking comment. Nor did the company return a call left on an answering machine at the number that it gave in the prospectus. A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Miami declined to comment.
The JOBS Act should not be blamed for Caribbean Pacific Marketing. The company cited the law when it identified itself as an emerging growth company, but it began the process to go public in March, before the law was adopted. The law allowed it to qualify for easier rules in going public, but it is not clear those rules made any difference to it. Perhaps the publicity accompanying the charges will help to remind potential investors that the title ''emerging growth company'' means virtually nothing.
The S.E.C. has always said it is, in the words of William O. Douglas, who was the commission chairman before he became a Supreme Court justice, ''the investor's advocate.'' Any investors who bought Caribbean Pacific shares after the offering was approved might question that claim.

HEADLINE: Exxon and Shell Earnings, Hurt by Natural Gas, Are Helped by Refining

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell reported lackluster earnings on Thursday because of declining oil and natural gas production and weak domestic gas prices.
The third-quarter results for the two energy giants would have been worse had it not been for strong performances from their refinery operations. Company executives also noted that the international oil business had been hurt by economic distress in Europe and Japan and weakening growth in China.
Energy analysts were not surprised by the results since natural gas prices in the United States were roughly 30 percent lower than the year before. Oil prices were little changed, but both companies have become increasingly dependent on gas production in recent years. 
Exxon Mobil reported net income of $9.57 billion in the quarter, down from $10.33 billion a year ago, with revenue of $115.71 billion, nearly 8 percent lower than in the third quarter of 2011. For the first nine months, however, earnings were up 10 percent.
Shell reported net earnings, adjusted for charges, of $6.6 billion, down from $7 billion in the third quarter of 2011. The company was forced to write down $354 million in assets during the quarter, mainly gas fields in the United States. Shell had a $7.14 billion profit in the quarter, up 2.3 percent from last year, after including extraordinary items and inventory changes.
''The performance of each company's exploration and production business lagged expectations,'' said Philip H. Weiss, a senior energy analyst at Argus Research Group. ''Natural gas prices, particularly in North America, have been weak, driving the underperformance.''
Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, became the country's biggest gas producer three years ago when it bought XTO Energy for $41 billion. The purchase gave Exxon Mobil experienced personnel in exploring and drilling in shale formations, but gas drilling in the United States has become increasingly unprofitable the last couple of years and few analysts expect gas prices to increase much over the next year.
Both companies in recent months have shifted more American production to oil from gas, with Shell acquiring West Texas oil fields from Chesapeake Energy for nearly $2 billion and Exxon Mobil spending $1.6 billion to acquire acreage in the Bakken shale oil field in North Dakota from Denbury Resources.
Shell began drilling in Alaskan Arctic waters over the summer, though equipment problems and thick ice delayed operations. The company had hoped to complete up to five wells but was only able to begin drilling two wells. Nevertheless, the start of drilling culminated six years of legal and regulatory struggles and appeared to assure more exploration next summer.
Exxon Mobil was hurt by production problems in Kazakhstan and the North Sea, while Shell's oil production was hurt by theft, flooding and political instability in Nigeria.
Exxon Mobil reported a decline of 1.8 percent in oil production for the quarter and a 1.3 percent gas production decline, excluding the impact of divestitures, production-sharing contracts and quotas set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Shell's production of oil and gas was down about 1 percent.
David Rosenthal, Exxon Mobil's vice president for investor relations, said he was not overly concerned by the decline in production. ''We are only slightly below'' previous expectations, he said, adding: ''Most of that production is pretty much back up,'' referring to Kazakhstan and the North Sea.
Exxon's stock price closed at $91.69 on Thursday, a 43-cent increase, while Shell's price jumped $1.51, to $69.99.
A bright spot for both companies was improving results in their refining businesses. Exxon Mobil's downstream earnings, mainly from refining, were nearly $3.2 billion, up $1.6 billion from the third quarter of 2011. But Simon Henry, Shell's chief financial officer, noted in a conference call that improved refining margins were more the result of supply shortages than stronger demand.
''We're seeing evidence of a weak economy all around us in our downstream, marketing and our chemicals business,'' Mr. Henry said, ''so the downstream rally over all could be short-lived.''
Quarterly financial results have been mixed in the oil patch. Total, the French oil giant, reported on Wednesday that its third-quarter profit jumped 20 percent, largely because of improved refinery margins. Conoco Phillips reported that its net income fell 30 percent in the quarter, with revenue declining 10 percent.
But many energy analysts say they believe that global oil demand could revive in the coming months, particularly if the Chinese economy strengthens. A Barclays research note this week predicted that in 2013 Chinese oil demand would increase 340,000 barrels a day, based on an expected rebound in manufacturing and truck sales.

HEADLINE: Storm Leaves Fallen Trees, Flooding and Other Damage Across the City's Parks

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Four days after Hurricane Sandy dealt a fierce blow to New York City's 1,700 parks, beaches, boardwalks and gardens, they remained closed on Thursday.
Outside Central Park, Mallory Locke, a 24-year-old teacher in the Bronx, was out for a run, ''dodging babies and people,'' and she looked wistfully past police barricades into Central Park, where crews were furiously cleaning up felled trees and clearing roads, while other workers were setting up the finish line for the New York City Marathon on Sunday.
''I tried to sneak into Riverside, but I couldn't get in,'' she said. 
She will have to wait a little longer: parks officials said that the majority of parks, playgrounds and recreation centers would reopen by 8 a.m. on Saturday. When they do, visitors will probably be faced with the residue of the storm.
The number of trees downed in the parks is not yet known. The parks department had gotten 8,217 calls about downed street trees by Thursday morning.
Here is what visitors are likely to find at some major parks and recreation areas:
HUDSON RIVER PARK The entire five-mile park was flooded, from the Battery to 59th Street, but the piers and bulkheads held up well, said Madelyn Wils, president of Hudson River Park Trust. There was some damage to the playground at Pier 25, as well as to pavement on Piers 46 and 84. At Pier 40, the first floor of the building suffered water damage and oil spilled from an old boiler, requiring remediation.
CENTRAL PARK At least 250 mature trees toppled in the storm, a number that was expected to rise as inspections continue, according to the Central Park Conservancy. Fences, benches and infrastructure were also bruised throughout the park.
HIGH LINE Despite its elevation, the High Line, which runs along 10th Avenue on the West Side of Manhattan, felt the effects of the hurricane, according to Friends of the High Line. The High Line's underground utility vaults, in Zone A, which was evacuated, were flooded with salt water as the nearby Hudson River surged over its banks. The impact on the park's electrical systems -- needed to power elevators, lights, phones, gates and mechanical systems -- has yet to be determined.
RIVERSIDE PARK Large areas of the park, which stretches along the Hudson River on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, were under four feet of water after the hurricane, according to the Riverside Park Fund. Dozens of trees were destroyed, and hundreds of others damaged. Some paved walkways were washed away, and falling branches damaged park lights, playground equipment and benches.
NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN The public garden in the Bronx is still tallying its losses, officials there said, but so far it appears that 100 mature trees in the forest, including some of the ''ancient and most magnificent'' oaks, were destroyed. Hundreds of pines, spruces and firs in the conifer arboretum were damaged, as were fences, signs and a building. Many parts have reopened, and the garden will cut the admission fee in half over the weekend.
BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN Three areas of the garden will remain cordoned off when it reopens to the public on Friday, officials said. Dozens of trees were affected, many of them near the western perimeter, where a line of 80-year-old little-leaf lindens was felled. A significant Chinese parasol tree was destroyed, and several large pin oaks were damaged or destroyed.
PROSPECT PARK An initial survey revealed that more than 100 trees were knocked down or severely damaged, the Prospect Park Alliance reported. Falling trees and limbs damaged signs, fences, lighting and playground equipment. Dangerous areas will be roped off when the park reopens.
BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK Given its waterfront location, the park was affected by floodwaters, which surged over the piers, damaging play surfaces in the Swing Valley playground at Pier 6 and the playgrounds at Main Street and Pier 1, the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation said. Salt water damaged the lawns, beds and trees, and park workers were desalinizing those areas with fresh water. Electrical and irrigation equipment was also damaged.
CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK AND AMUSEMENTS The boardwalk itself was spared a knockout punch, and none of the major rides, like the Cyclone roller coaster or the Parachute Jump, suffered structural damage, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation. But floodwater four to seven feet high across the community damaged electrical equipment, arcades and the ground floors of business along the boardwalk.
NEW YORK AQUARIUM The 14-acre aquarium complex, next to the Coney Island boardwalk, was severely flooded, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs it. The society is working to restore utilities and operating systems and to restore filtration and other life-support systems for the exhibits and holding tanks. The aquarium is closed indefinitely, and administrators warned that the fish and marine mammals may need to be temporarily evacuated to other aquariums.
ROCKAWAY BEACH About 80 percent of the Boardwalk along the seven-mile stretch of Rockaway Beach in Queens was ripped off the pilings by the storm surge, according to the Queens borough president's office. Officials said that beach erosion was expected, and that the sand replenishment under way in the Rockaways was probably undermined.
FLUSHING MEADOWS-CORONA PARK There was extensive flooding from Meadow Lake and Willow Lake, submerging several soccer fields near the Fountain of the Planets and a parking lot under several feet of water. It was unclear how much permanent damage had occurred, according to the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, a local park-advocacy group.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT FOUR FREEDOMS PARK AND MEMORIAL Though it is surrounded by water, the new park on Roosevelt Island came through the storm unscathed, said Sean Wood, a spokesman for the park. The park's parapets held the East River off, and the newly planted linden trees were undamaged. But riprap was covered with lumber that had apparently floated across the East River from a lumberyard in Queens.

HEADLINE: Amid Storm Recovery, Marathon Expo Opens Doors to Runners

BYLINE: By MARY PILON

 BODY:
Upstairs at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Thursday, exhibitors commanded rows of booths showcasing things like brightly colored compression socks, dry-fit shirts, green cups of Gatorade samples and nutrition bars made with chia seeds -- items that apparently appeal to people who are three days away from running a marathon.
Downstairs, staffers worked to clean up the water-damaged floor, which emitted a faintly stale odor that wafted with the brew of a nearby Starbucks outpost. ''It's safe,'' Alan Steel, president and chief executive of the convention center, said. 
This year's New York City Marathon, for better or worse, will no doubt be remembered as the one that was held days after Hurricane Sandy roared through the region, debilitating transportation systems, knocking out power to millions of homes and killing dozens. Some feel the race should be canceled, out of respect for those still suffering from the damage of the storm. Others say the race must go on, as a symbol of the city's resilience and as an economic stimulant.
The hurricane and the marathon were brought together under the convention center's roof Thursday, on the Far West Side of Manhattan, as the event's exposition opened. The hall smelled like new sneakers. ''Rock You Like a Hurricane,'' a curious selection, blared from speakers.
Exhibitors who usually have days to set up had mere hours, some working late into Wednesday night or arriving early Thursday morning, coffee cups in hand. Runners, carrying their clear gift bags and bibs, roamed around, sampling protein shakes, trying on shoes and watching flat-screen TVs showing footage of various marathon courses.
Jessica Stephens and Kirsty Murfitt arrived from Wellington, New Zealand, last Friday.
''We wanted to do New York because it's the biggest and the best,'' Stephens said. ''We were here, and we can see the storm was very, very serious. At the same time, people spend a lot of money at the local businesses here, and New Yorkers have a can-do attitude.''
Mary Wittenberg, chief executive of New York Road Runners, the marathon organizer, made her way to the entrance and greeted employees and volunteers working at the event.
''This isn't about running,'' she said. ''This is about helping the city.''
She added: ''We're dedicating this race to the lives that were lost and helping the city recover. We want to raise money and awareness.''
Lt. Larry Quinn, of the New York Firefighters Burn Center Foundation, said he left Long Island at 5:30 Thursday morning and arrived at the Javits Convention Center at 9 a.m. After battling traffic into the city, he and other volunteers unpacked cardboard boxes of T-shirts, sweatshirts and baseball hats to sell. The proceeds go to the charity, which supports treatment for burn victims and research.
''We got guys sleeping on cots and working long hours,'' Quinn said. ''A lot of firemen live in Breezy Point, and their homes are gone.''
He paused, holding a T-shirt in his hand. ''But we're a nonprofit,'' he said. ''We need the money that we raise here for the foundation. We support the marathon.''
Many runners wanting to show their support for the event faced significant travel hurdles, as the area's airports slowly restored service. Martin Kraenzlein and his wife, Bettina, arrived Wednesday from Munich and said they were surprised when their rescheduled flight arrived in time for them to make it to the expo Thursday morning.
''It's a very difficult discussion,'' Kraenzlein, who will run his ninth marathon this weekend, said about the debate over whether to stage the race. ''But I understand why it must go on. The marathon is part of the city.''
Marie Wickham, a resident of the Upper East Side who collected her 22nd bib for the New York City Marathon at the expo, said: ''It's always emotional at the end. You can't help that. It's always special, but I think it will be different. This will be a marathon I'll remember.''
By early afternoon, some of the empty vendor booths had filled up, and lines for bibs were nearly empty. A man with a headset, a blender and a plastic baggie of carrots demonstrated how to make tortilla soup to a dozen transfixed onlookers. A shoe company had a treadmill up and running, to give runners the full effect when they tried on shoes.
Much of the crowd arrived bleary-eyed, but grateful, speaking of fellow runners who were still stranded, family members who called off trips or tales of locals who had evacuated because of the storm's destruction.
''We're definitely sympathetic to the New York Road Runners and the decision they had to make,'' Dave Humphreys, with the Dublin Marathon, one of the exhibitors at the expo, said. ''But I really believe you go ahead and run. You have people all over the world who train for months to make it here.''
Among them is Frank LaDonna, a 60-year-old retired school psychologist who said he hoped to hit a time of 3 hours 47 minutes Sunday. In the two years leading up to the race, he said, he has lost 35 pounds. ''Even though I lost that weight, my date of birth didn't change,'' he said.
LaDonna, who drove in for the expo from Fort Lee, N.J., said he was not directly affected by the storm and said he approved of the decision to go forward with the marathon.
''The strange thing is, the weather on Sunday could be great for running,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Month of Gains for Stores, Before a Storm's Toll

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Shoppers continued to spend steadily at retailers in October, from discounters all the way to the high end, suggesting consumer confidence heading into the holiday season.
Results tallied Thursday from the 18 national retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters showed an average increase of 2.7 percent in sales at stores open at least a year. The results largely excluded the effects of the hurricane.
Without the Rite Aid drugstore chain, though, that figure would have been 4.7 percent, above analysts' expectations of a 4.3 percent increase. Rite Aid saw a decline mainly because of a shift toward cheaper generic drugs. 
''You're seeing solid single-digit numbers not just one month but consistently for the past few months,'' said Madison Riley, managing director at the retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon. ''It reflects a steadily improving economy and therefore, steadily improving consumer confidence.''
Still, all retailers' eyes were on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Most retailers' fiscal October ended on Saturday, so while a few stock-up trips made it into the October results, most of those, along with poststorm spending and the impact of store closures, were not included in October results.
Some analysts have said that consumers may direct their money toward home repairs in the storm's wake, rather than toward early holiday shopping. However, home improvement retailers and discounters might benefit from shopping for storm supplies.
Categories as various as department stores, discounters and apparel retailers all posted good results. ''What I find intriguing and encouraging is it's not isolated,'' Mr. Riley said, ''but it's across the industry.''
Stores for those on a budget continued to shine, like Costco, with a 7 percent increase, and the Nordstrom Rack division of Nordstrom, which posted its highest same-store sales increase of the year. The Rack's same-store sales rose 10.5 percent, while Nordstrom over all posted a 9.8 percent increase.
Kohl's, which had been struggling to meet analysts' sales expectations this year, surpassed them on Thursday, with sales increasing 3.3 percent, versus analysts' estimates of a 1.1 percent gain. The company said sales of children's merchandise were stronger than everything else.
Macy's also exceeded analysts' expectations, with a 4.1 percent increase versus the 3.1 percent analysts had projected. The company raised its same-store sales guidance for the second half of this year to about 4 percent, up from 3.7 percent, despite the storm's impact. Macy's noted that about 200 Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores had to close anywhere from a few hours to multiple days as a result of the storm, but added that ''the company is confident that it can make up some or most of the lost sales through the remainder of the quarter.''
Target had a rare miss, with a 2.4 percent increase versus the 3.2 percent analysts had expected. The company did not give a clear reason for the results, saying in a release that they were ''near the low end of our expected range.''
The biggest decline came from the teenage-apparel retailer Wet Seal, which was troubled by management churn and sliding sales. Same-store sales declined 7.6 percent, which was actually less steep than the 10.5 percent drop that analysts had expected.
Same-store sales at Rite Aid dropped 1.1 percent, largely because customers chose cheaper generic prescriptions over name-brand ones. (Walgreens, the other drugstore chain reporting monthly same-store sales, will do so next week.)
Retail analysts were already looking ahead to the storm's effect on November sales. A Citi analyst, Deborah Weinswig, wrote in a research note that discounters could see a slight lift as people restocked supplies after the storm. But department stores that depend on New York City will be hit, she said -- she estimated that Saks derives 22 percent of sales from its Manhattan flagship, and Macy's gets 8 percent of sales from its New York City-area stores. Ms. Weinswig wrote that ''the cost of cleanup and repairs from the hurricane could take money away from holiday purchases, which puts early holiday sales at risk.''
But Mr. Riley, the retail consultant, said the storm had arrived early enough to give people plenty of time to shop for holiday items. ''It's a timing issue, as opposed to 'It's going to affect the holiday season,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Shortages Disrupting Recovery From Hurricane

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE; Reporting on the storm was contributed by Russ Buettner, Annie Correal, Alison Leigh Cowan, Sheri Fink, Joseph Goldstein, J. David Goodman, Denise Grady, Winnie Hu, Randy Leonard, William K. Rashbaum, Ray Rivera, Liz Robbins, Nate Schweber, Kirk Semple, Stacey Stowe, Rebecca White and Vivian Yee.

 BODY:
UNION, N.J. -- Widespread gas shortages stirred fears among residents and disrupted some rescue and emergency services on Thursday as the New York region struggled to return to a semblance of normalcy after being ravaged by Hurricane Sandy.
Tiny increments of progress -- some subway and bus lines were back in service -- were overshadowed by new estimates of the storm's financial cost, struggles to restore power, and by the discovery of more bodies in flooded communities.
The lines of cars waiting for gas at a Sunoco here ran in three directions: a mile-long line up the Garden State Parkway, a half-mile line along Vauxhall Road, and another, including a fleet of mail trucks that needed to refuel before resuming their rounds, snaking through a back entrance. The scene was being replayed across the state as drivers waited in lines that ran hundreds of vehicles deep, requiring state troopers and local police to protect against exploding tempers. 
''I've been pumping gas for 36 hours, I pumped 17,000 gallons,'' said Abhishek Soni, the owner of an Exxon in Montclair, where disputes on the line Wednesday night had become so heated that Mr. Soni called the police and turned off the pumps for 45 minutes to restore calm. ''My nose, my mouth is bleeding from the fumes. The fighting just makes it worse.''
Four days after Hurricane Sandy, the effort to secure enough gas for the region moved to the forefront of recovery work. The problems affected even New York City, where the Taxi Commission warned that the suddenly indispensable fleet of yellow cabs would thin significantly Friday because of the fuel shortage.
City officials said they had reached an agreement with a major supplier Thursday night that would ensure emergency operations -- fire, police, sanitation and work by the parks department to clean up downed trees -- would continue uninterrupted.
Though Thursday marked a return to routine for many who ride the subway to work or celebrated the resumption of power, the scenes of long lines, fistfights at gas stations and siphoning at parking lots highlighted the difficult, uneven slog to recovery.
The losses from the storm will approach $50 billion, according to an early estimate from economists at Moody's Analytics -- about $30 billion in property damage, the rest in lost economic activity like meals and canceled flights. At the same time the death toll in New York City rose to 38, as rescuers continued to discover bodies while combing through coastal wreckage. Among them were the bodies of two boys, 2 and 4, who had been torn from their mother by raging floodwaters on Staten Island on Monday night.
The lack of power continued to bedevil efforts to address the damage. About 43 percent of customers in New Jersey and about 16 percent in New York State remained without electricity, and officials said that they expected power to be restored to all of Manhattan by Saturday. Those issues were only aggravated by the increasingly short supply of gas, particularly given that many suburban residents in New Jersey and elsewhere were heading to the stations to fuel generators, which provided the lone source of power and heat to homes across the region.
According to figures from AAA, of the gas stations it monitors, roughly 60 percent of stations in New Jersey and 70 percent on Long Island were closed.
At stations that were open, nerves frayed. Fights broke out Thursday at the block-long Hess station on 10th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, forcing the Police Department to send three officers to keep the peace, a police official said. By evening, the police had to close two lanes of the broad thoroughfare to accommodate a line of customers stretching eight blocks, to 37th Street.
The ports and refineries that supply much of the region's gas had been shut down in advance of the storm and were damaged by it. That disrupted deliveries to gas stations that had power to pump the fuel. But the bigger problem was that many stations and storage facilities remained without power.
Politicians were scrambling Thursday to increase the supply of fuel -- the Port of New York and New Jersey opened just enough to allow boats carrying gas to move, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey waived restrictions that make it harder for stations to buy gas from out-of-state suppliers. Mr. Christie's office had warned that price gougers would be prosecuted, but drivers were reporting that some stations were charging more than $4 a gallon, even though the state had set gas prices at $3.59 on the highways last week.
Mr. Christie said Thursday afternoon that President Obama had sent 250,000 gallons of gas and 500,000 gallons of diesel fuel to the state through the Department of Defense, and he pledged to send more if needed.
Despite these steps the situation was not expected to get significantly better on Friday. Utility companies said power might not be fully restored until late next week.
In Paterson, N.J., the state's third-largest city, the Police Department was trying to negotiate emergency contracts for gas, and short of that, said it would beginning siphoning it from other city vehicles to keep police cruisers running.
The Essex County executive, Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., said that the fuel shortage had become his No. 1 concern, causing officials to start limiting gas half a tank at a time to police and fire vehicles. ''All 22 of our municipalities are having problems getting fuel,'' he said. ''Everyone's on edge.''
Some drove hours out of their way, across state lines, in search of gas. Others tried their luck at a dozen stations, finding many roped off, or turned to Twitter, trading tips about where lines were long.
That is how Jason Brown, 25, of St. Albans, Queens, learned there might be gas at a BP station two miles away in Valley Stream, Nassau County. He walked there lugging a five-gallon Igloo cooler hoping to fill it with gas for his car -- only to find a line stretching a quarter-mile along Sunrise Highway. When the generator pumping the gas failed, the crowd erupted into fights and police were called in to close the station.
''I'm trying to get gas for my family,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Everywhere you go, it's either a riot or there's no gas.''
The lines themselves only exacerbated the problem; reports in the local media provoked drivers to buy gasoline before stations ran out. Some spent what fuel they had searching for more and could be seen pushing vehicles toward relief.
''I just want to have it, because you don't know how long this is going to last,'' said Richard Bianchi, waiting in the half-mile line at the Sunoco in Union with a tank that was three-quarters full.
''People are panicking,'' said Jimmy Qawasmi, the owner of a Mobil in the Westchester County town of Mamaroneck. ''People must have heard something.''
Bloomfield Avenue, a traffic artery connecting several towns in Essex County, N.J., was unusually congested as drivers stopped to lean out their windows at every station: ''You got gas?'' Mr. Soni's station in Montclair had received a delivery of 8,000 gallons at 4 p.m. Wednesday, but that had run out by 2:30 a.m. Thursday. A tanker truck passed by, prompting a cheer. ''I'm empty!'' the driver called out.
Up the road, a tanker turned into one gas station just down from where a crowd was waiting at another. The people waiting dashed across the street, only to see the tanker turn and go to the station where they had been waiting. The police were refusing to let the station open for three hours, but people were determined to hold out.
As Benito Domena, holding two gas cans, said: ''The wait is just going to be worse elsewhere.''

Previews and Openings
'Annie' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Lilla Crawford plays the ginger-topped moppet bounced between the tyranny of Katie Finneran's boozing orphanage den mother, Miss Hannigan, and the promise of a home and family with the billionaire Daddy Warbucks, played by Anthony Warlow. Almost 30 years after closing its original six-year run, this musical by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan returns to Broadway in a new production staged by James Lapine, a sensitive director who seems well-equipped to scratch out real characters beneath the comic-strip surfaces. Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney) 
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Nov. 19) The young composing team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul took their first significant New York bow early this summer with ''Dogfight'' at Second Stage. They graduate to Broadway with this holiday show, which has a book by Joseph Robinette based on the writings of the radio humorist Jean Shepherd and the 1983 film. Set in 1940s Indiana, this musical tells the story of bespectacled Ralphie, whose one wish for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB gun. John Rando directs the production, which has proved popular in national tour dates; its Broadway cast includes Dan Lauria, John Bolton and Erin Dilly. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, achristmasstorythemusical.com, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Dead Accounts' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Nov. 29) This new comedy from Theresa Rebeck tests the strength of family ties when a man returns to his small-town home with a suspicious amount of cash and few answers to the questions raised. The play's deluxe team includes two Tony magnets in the director Jack O'Brien and his leading man, Norbert Leo Butz, with a tasty supporting cast of Judy Greer, Josh Hamilton and Jayne Houdyshell. But the big news here is Katie Holmes: she returns to Broadway in her first starring role there, not to mention her first significant professional adventure since the tabloid storm of her divorce from Tom Cruise. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Emotional Creature' (in previews; opens on Nov. 12) Having delved into the psychological, physiological, political and personal issues affecting women in works like ''The Vagina Monologues'' and ''The Good Body,'' Eve Ensler turns her probing gaze to female childhood and adolescence in this new theater piece, based on her 2010 book. Directed by Jo Bonney, this empowering collection of monologues, stories and songs features six young actors who consider what it means to be a girl in the world today. Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Figaro' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Before Mozart took his crack at Figaro and his commedia dell'arte antics, Pierre Beaumarchais created a play licentious enough to get banned in Vienna. Charles Morey's new adaptation of that 1778 comedy will be the Pearl Theater's first production in its new permanent home (thanks to a new 20-year lease), the West 42nd Street space that until recently housed the Signature Theater. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 598-9802, pearltheatre.org. (Eric Grode)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (in previews; opens on Nov. 11) The schlubby real estate salesmen in David Mamet's masterful 1984 drama depend on a sucker being born at least every minute. With only seven years having elapsed since the last revival, let's hope new audience members are sprouting up at a comparable rate. Al Pacino, who was so memorable as the agency hotshot in the 1992 film version, graduates to the role of the old lion Shelley Levene. The newest young lion: Bobby Cannavale. Daniel Sullivan, who directed Mr. Pacino in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' takes on that task again. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Golden Child' (in previews; opens on Nov. 13) The Signature Theater kicks off its season of David Henry Hwang plays with the best known of the three works. This look at a polygamous Chinese household was a hit at the Public Theater in 1997 and had a short run on Broadway, earning the play and its lead actress, Julyana Soelistyo, Tony nominations. Ms. Soelistyo returns for this revival and will be joined by someone who made a more recent splash in Mr. Hwang's work, Jennifer Lim (''Chinglish''). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Golden Boy' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Dec. 6) The last time the director Bartlett Sher dipped into the Clifford Odets canon for Lincoln Center Theater, the result was the soul-stirring 2006 revival of ''Awake and Sing!'' With this 75th-anniversary production of the Odets classic about a talented violinist forced to choose between music and a more lucrative career in prize-fighting, Mr. Sher returns to the same stage as that earlier Tony-winning success, and also to the same theater where this play had its 1937 premiere. Alongside Seth Numrich (''War Horse'') in the title role, the large ensemble cast includes Danny Burstein, Bill Camp, Ned Eisenberg, Jonathan Hadary, Tony Shalhoub and Yvonne Strahovski. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Good Mother' (in previews; opens on Nov. 15) The New Group opens its season with the world premiere of this psychological thriller by Francine Volpe about a struggling single parent forced, through a bizarre incident involving her 4-year-old daughter, to confront the questionable actions of her past. Gretchen Mol plays the title character in Scott Elliott's production, with a cast that also features Mark Blum and Darren Goldstein. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Mies Julie' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Nov. 12) St. Ann's Warehouse opens its new season as well as its new location with this Edinburgh Festival Fringe award winner from the University of Cape Town's Baxter Theater Center. Adapted and directed by Yael Farber, the production updates August Strindberg's classic power struggle of class and sex, ''Miss Julie,'' to post-apartheid South Africa, unfolding over a single night in the kitchen of a remote estate, 18 years after the election of Nelson Mandela. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Murder Ballad' (in previews; opens on Nov. 15) Continuing a vital trend among New York's top-tier nonprofit companies, Manhattan Theater Club inaugurates The Studio at Stage II, a banner devoted to new works from emerging artists. First up in the series is this rock musical by Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash about love, compromise and betrayal as illustrated in a romantic triangle gone wrong. Trip Cullman directs a first-rate cast that includes John Ellison Conlee, Rebecca Naomi Jones, Karen Olivo and Will Swenson. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Nov. 28) Originally seen in May at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, this adaptation by Aaron Posner of the best-selling Chaim Potok novel was described by Anita Gates, writing in The New York Times, as ''an economical, almost painfully potent 90-minute one-act play.'' In this transfer of Gordon Edelstein's production, Ari Brand reprises the title role of a gifted young painter in postwar Brooklyn who defies the wishes of his Hasidic Jewish parents to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' (in previews; opens on Nov. 13) The winner of five Tony Awards including best musical, original score and book for its 1985 Broadway premiere, this show by Rupert Holmes presents the unfinished Charles Dickens novel as a Victorian music-hall lark in which the audience gets the final verdict on who killed the title character. Scott Ellis directs this Roundabout Theater Company revival (part of the 200th anniversary Dickens celebration), with a cast headed by Stephanie J. Block, Will Chase, Gregg Edelman, Jim Norton and the indefatigable Chita Rivera. Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Performers' (in previews; opens on Nov. 14) The enthusiastic response for David West Read's 2011 Off Broadway drama, ''The Dream of the Burning Boy,'' directed by Evan Cabnet, promised big things from its creators. Now Mr. Read and Mr. Cabnet make their Broadway debuts in this romantic comedy set in the adult film world. As you'd expect, given the setting, the cast includes plenty of eye candy past (Henry Winkler), present (Cheyenne Jackson, Daniel Breaker) and sort of in between but much closer to present (Alicia Silverstone). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Piano Lesson' (in previews; opens on Nov. 18) Ruben Santiago-Hudson has a strong association with the plays of August Wilson. In addition to appearing in ''Gem of the Ocean'' on Broadway, he won a Tony in 1996 for his role in ''Seven Guitars,'' which he later directed as part of Signature Theater's 2006-7 season dedicated to Wilson's work. Mr. Santiago-Hudson returns to Signature to take on one of the most celebrated entries in that playwright's Century Cycle. Set in 1936 in the wake of the Great Depression, this Pulitzer-winning 1990 drama focuses on siblings at odds over what to do with their family legacy, an antique piano. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson' (in previews; opens on Nov. 15) Aimee Semple McPherson, the pioneering evangelist from the early 20th century, used to pack a 5,300-seat church three times a day, seven days a week. Suddenly that eight-show-a-week schedule doesn't seem so arduous. Sinclair Lewis, Nathanael West and Evelyn Waugh have all paid literary tribute to her, and now it's Kathie Lee Gifford's turn. She wrote the book and lyrics to this new musical, featuring Carolee Carmello in the title role. The score is by David Pomeranz and David Friedman. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, scandalousonbroadway.com. (Grode)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' (in previews; opens on Nov. 12) At least three of those names might look familiar to theater buffs. Yes, Christopher Durang has turned his gimlet-eyed focus to Chekhov, plunking the characters and themes in modern-day rural Pennsylvania. Longtime Durangians (Durangos?) like Sigourney Weaver, David Hyde Pierce and Kristine Nielsen are among the cast members; anyone who saw what the director, Nicholas Martin, and Ms. Nielsen worked up for Mr. Durang's ''Betty's Summer Vacation'' will already be practicing their Russian. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as South West Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1844-1915' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Nov. 13) This epic title requires little explanation, but Jackie Sibblies Drury's meta-theater piece, described as ''harrowing and humorous,'' follows a troupe of American actors as they struggle to dramatize the first genocide of the 20th century, their explorations ultimately revealing truths that hit closer to home. Eric Ting directs an ensemble cast that includes Quincy Tyler Bernstine (''Ruined''). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Rooney)
'The Whale' (in previews; opens on Monday) A reconciliation between a recluse who weighs 600 pounds and his estranged teenage daughter doesn't go quite as planned in Samuel D. Hunter's new play. ''A Bright New Boise'' earned Mr. Hunter an Obie Award for playwriting last year; he and the director Davis McCallum have teamed up, once again, for this comedy with teeth, also set in Idaho. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-1235, playwrightshorizons.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Cyrano de Bergerac' Douglas Hodge (last seen in a dress in ''La Cage aux Folles'') provides an oxygenating blast of freshness in the title role of Edmond Rostand's beloved chestnut, creating a vigorous and original portrait of the swashbuckling, big-beaked poet. True, whenever he's not onstage that old ennui creeps into Jamie Lloyd's production. Fortunately, that's not all that often (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'An Enemy of the People' Boyd Gaines gives a forceful performance as Dr. Stockmann, the champion of truth who takes a principled stand against forces led by his brother, Peter (a sinister Richard Thomas), in Ibsen's meaty but talky drama about corruption in a Norwegian spa town. Doug Hughes's production features fine performances but cannot always overcome the play's sometimes heavy-handed dramaturgy (2:00). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, mtc-nyc.org, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show'') whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20). Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'The Medium' (through Nov. 11) Gian Carlo Menotti's 1946 one-hour opera is a campy melodrama about a mystic named Madame Flora, who feels icy hands around her throat during one of her fraudulent séances, driving her to booze, madness and murder. Jeffery Roberson, better known as his drag alter ego, Varla Jean Merman, would seem the ideal interpreter to breathe life into the title character and her spooked ordeal. But under the clunky direction of Donna Drake, the performers play it more or less straight, something this trifle struggles to withstand. There are amusing touches, but on the whole this Provincetown production is strangled by seriousness (1:00). Marjorie S. Dean Little Theater, 10 West 64th Street, Manhattan. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' In Dave Malloy's improbably wonderful electro-pop opera based on ''War & Peace,'' Tolstoy's introspective, emotional, impetuous characters sing about their love and woes. They feel modern and familiar, and it's a pleasure to be crowded together with them in Ars Nova's theater, which has been made into a kind of nightclub, with a bottle of cold vodka on each table. Rachel Chavkin directed (2:30). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, arsnovanyc.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
Off Off Broadway
'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, Manhattan, stageleftstudio.net. (Daniel M. Gold)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sartah Gitelstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)

Last Chance
'Blood Play' (closes on Saturday) The Debate Society's newest (and as of now sold out) production has several things to recommend it, including a strong ensemble and intriguing characters. But Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen's script slides too easily into melodrama and silly plot devices, never allowing the promise of these characters to play out (1:15). Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, Brooklyn, thebushwickstarr.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'Children of Killers' (closes on Sunday) Katori Hall's disturbing drama focuses on a group of young men whose fathers perpetrated the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Running just an hour, Ms. Hall's impressionistic play, directed by Emily Mendelsohn, draws a rough-hewed but affecting portrait of a society still haunted by the past (1:00). Castillo Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-1234, castillo.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Closer Than Ever' (closes on Sunday) Can it be? Intelligent, tuneful material written by and for men and women whose ingénue years were in the 20th century? Four rock-solid singers give Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire's winning 1989 revue a polished revival (1:30). York Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Grode)
'Modern Terrorism, or They Who Want to Kill Us and How We Learn to Love Them' (closes on Sunday) Jon Kern's comedy about three hapless terrorists plotting to blow up the Empire State Building wins points for a daring concept, but the delivery is mostly of the conventional, sitcom kind. The young cast is terrific, particularly Steven Boyer as the lone nonterrorist (2:05). Second Stage, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'Mojo' (closes on Sunday) This British kid's show, which features lanky puppetry and an amiable live band, is skillful if uninspired family fun (1:20). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, 10th floor, Manhattan, (646) 562-2200, newvictory.org. (Zinoman)

HEADLINE: Need for More Thought In Electing Judges

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
This will hit you on Tuesday, unless you voted early and already had the experience: At the bottom of the statewide ballot are the names of people who want to wear robes and dispense justice, and if you know your way around that roster, you're in the minority.
If you know all of them, you either work in the courthouse or you're a campaign consultant. 
If we're going to elect judges, why do we make it so hard to learn enough about them to vote intelligently? It is hard for them to raise money from anyone who doesn't have business before them. They are supposed to remain impartial even while running as partisans.
In a state with 26 million people, it's difficult to get past the standard of ''That's a pretty good ballot name.''
Some judges -- Justice Don Willett of the Texas Supreme Court is a recent example -- take heed of recent federal court rulings that hack away at restrictions on what they can talk about during campaigns. Broadly speaking, they can talk about issues, as long as they're not getting too close to telling people how they would rule in particular cases.
Justice Willett is on the state's highest civil court, where candidates are more likely to have some financial support for their campaigns. Much of that support comes from people who might appear before the court -- lawyers and potential litigants -- because, as it turns out, it's easier to get people to contribute in their own interest than for plain old civic good.
The evidence for that -- the money the candidates are able to raise -- can be found just one step down the ballot, where voters find the names of potential judges for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. That's the state's other high court -- the one that handles criminal law.
The shorthand, politically, is that there is more money in civil cases, where economic interests are balanced, than in criminal, where the life-or-death cases are decided. And there is more campaign money available for Supreme Court races than for the contests at its criminal twin.
What are voters to do?
They could actively research the races, but that's really the province of participants -- lawyers, consultants, journalists and so on. They could use party cues, which is generally the default, especially in a state with such widespread straight-ticket voting.
Sometimes there is a little more information available. The presiding judge on the Court of Criminal Appeals, Sharon Keller, a Republican, has been in the news a couple of times during her tenure, creating the possibility that voters know something more about her than her party affiliation. Her opponent, Keith Hampton, an Austin Democrat and criminal defense lawyer who has swept the legal bar polls and newspaper endorsements, says the key to the race for him is connecting her name, in voters' minds, to the stories about her.
The first controversy started in 2007 when Judge Keller rejected a last-minute appeal that came in shortly after a 5 p.m. deadline in the case of Michael Wayne Richard. After some convoluted disciplinary hearings, an appointed special master said that what Judge Keller had done was embarrassing but not worthy of official sanction. Judge Keller next made the headlines when The Dallas Morning News reported that she had not listed more than $2 million in real estate holdings in mandatory state ethics disclosures.
Mr. Hampton says voters know some of that history but do not necessarily link her name to it. He has raised about $80,000 for his campaign (Texas Supreme Court races regularly run into the millions of dollars) and is trying to help voters with the dots he wants them to connect. He will get the results of his experiment on Tuesday night.
But this is a rare case in which actual information may leak into a judicial race that might otherwise turn on the colors of the candidates' partisan flags.
Mr. Hampton said he would like to pull together a group of reformers -- some known, some not -- to talk about changing the way Texas chooses its judges. How would that change the courts?
''They would be an older crowd, with longer track records, with board certifications,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''We'd have some diminishment of the judiciary being changed by these political mood swings. They'd be more diverse. And you wouldn't necessarily know what party they were from.''

HEADLINE: Imagining a Romney Presidency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Upside of Opportunism'' (column, Oct. 30):
David Brooks speculates that since the House Republicans would rather let the country go to ruin than allow President Obama any accomplishments, there could be no major achievements in a second term. He then fantasizes that a ''center-right'' President Mitt Romney might achieve a grand compromise of tax increases on the wealthy and modest entitlement reform.
Since virtually every Republican in Congress has pledged not to raise any taxes and a growing number of them have committed to doctrinaire Tea Partydom, this musing is either a pleasant delusion or simply disingenuous. At any rate, the advice is plain: yield to the crazed hostage-takers and maybe then they will play nice. 
Both principle and practicality make that bargain obscene.
ERIC J. B. SHAPIRO Shaker Heights, Ohio, Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
O.K., David Brooks. You are definitely the favorite conservative for all of us who still take pride in being liberal, and I will concede much of your argument that Mitt Romney might be able to accomplish more than President Obama given a split Congress.
However, you don't mention the Supreme Court -- the threat to our Republic from Citizens United with its unlimited money in our electoral process or the threat of reversing Roe v. Wade. And what about the neoconservative influence in Mr. Romney's foreign policy?
You don't convince me. You don't even alleviate my anxiety.
BENETH B. MORROW Las Vegas, Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks's point could have been stated in three words: Reward House intransigence. I know we want to get unstuck, but at what cost?
MAC SCHAFER Raleigh, N.C., Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks concludes his column comparing a second-term President Obama to a first-term President Mitt Romney this way: ''Romney is more of a flexible flip-flopper than Obama.''
I would suggest changing the description to ''proven negotiator.'' As a successful businessman and governor of a deep blue state, Mr. Romney has demonstrated his ability to work with ''opponents.''
CHARLES H. GESSNER Marblehead, Mass., Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks speaks against a second term for President Obama because of likely Republican obstructionism, obstructionism that has already damaged the country's recovery. Then, in a cynical conclusion, he suggests that Mitt Romney would govern from the center because he will not, or cannot, implement the socially and fiscally radical conservative agenda he proposes.
I believe that Mr. Romney, if he thought it would help his re-election, would throw the Supreme Court and a woman's right to choose under the bus. No, thank you; I will take my chances, however slim, that courage will return to the few remaining closet moderate Republicans so that Mr. Obama can govern.
Here's a thought: Why not instead advocate the defeat of radical obstructionist Tea Party representatives?
JOYCE REIDY New York, Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks sketches two unsatisfactory scenarios. In one, President Obama is re-elected but is hamstrung by a Republican-dominated House. In the other, Mitt Romney is elected and spends his term fighting with a Democratic-dominated Senate.
But of course, we the people aren't constrained to pick from Mr. Brooks's menu. If we were to re-elect President Obama and put Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, we could actually, finally get the change we voted for four years ago.
BARRY HASKELL LEVINE Lafayette, Calif., Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks's closing argument for Mitt Romney is that he is a lying opportunist.
I think Mr. Romney's comments when closeted with fellow plutocrats, his inability to get out of the 1950s in his views of women's rights and roles, and his reliance on economic and foreign policy advisers who live in a world of myths reflect the true, hollow core of the man.
If elected, he will govern as he is: of, by and for the narrow slice of America and the world that he understands. Mr. Brooks is dreaming to expect anything else.
ALLAN TAYLOR Hartford, Oct. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
Is David Brooks seriously asking us to trust that Mitt Romney is lying?

HEADLINE: The Storm: Bipartisanship, Climate Change, Gas Lines

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''An Unlikely Political Pair, United by a Disaster'' (front page, Nov. 1):
The admirable bipartisanship of two old foes, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, and President Obama, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy is a timely reminder that the purpose of politics is -- or should be -- the public good, not personal triumphalism. 
Is it naïve to hope that this flicker of bipartisanship will promote more civil politics after the election? Probably yes. But our founding fathers, who were not naïve, believed that it was possible to harness the dynamics of disagreement for the public good. We should cling to that hope.

To the Editor:
Re ''Will Climate Change Get Some Respect Now?,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Nov. 1):
It seems as if we Americans need to get slapped in the face to mount sustained responses to problems. The cold war, the war on drugs, the war on terror -- these we understand. The war on warming? Not so much.
Hurricane Katrina was supposed to change that, but then carbon limits were killed under the political cover of the Great Recession.
The dirty truth is that we Americans stink at solving gradual problems. We suffer from politicians controlled by powerful interests, and more important, a culture in which time is measured by sound bites instead of by generations.
Until we start thinking beyond ourselves, climate change will remain the Rodney Dangerfield of problems.

Re ''Long Gas Lines, Clogged Roads, and Slim Hope for a Better Day'' (front page, Nov. 1):
One of the biggest frustrations in the aftermath of a storm as witnessed in New York and New Jersey is the inability to get gasoline because of a power failure.
A simple solution to this problem would be to require a certain number of gas stations to have backup generators.

HEADLINE: Romney Advance Team Works Every Angle in Pursuit of Visual Perfection

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
LANCASTER, Ohio -- The national anthem was taking too long.
The Romney campaign's advance team had precisely timed its rally at the town square here, charting the exact moment when the event's backdrop, the municipal building, would be bathed in an alabaster glow from the setting sun.
Nearly two dozen lights were set, illuminating banners, flags and the square itself for the rally on Oct. 12. The day before, aides had taken photos of the site every 15 minutes as day dwindled to night, ensuring that Mr. Romney would take the stage -- and cameras would click -- at the proverbial golden hour.
Now all was in jeopardy. 
The singer had thrown in a few extra little-known verses, pushing back the rally's start time by several minutes. John Legittino, the director of production, realized the sun was lower than planned, and began dimming some of the 12,000-watt lights and turning others off.
''Let's add one-half C.T.O. to four of the fixtures,'' he said. (Translation: Add a warm orange filter to the lights, casting the stage in the same hue as the setting sun.) Moments later, Mr. Legittino nodded almost imperceptibly and headed over to the audio station to cue up the right song, ''Born Free'' by Kid Rock.
In an operation that has had some missteps, like the secretly recorded ''47 percent'' comment and a much-criticized foreign trip, Mr. Romney's advance team has emerged as one of the consistently high-performing arms of his campaign, producing Hollywood-caliber events with a fraction of a film director's time and budget. The team's daily task, to push the candidate's message, may be rooted in stagecraft. But its mission is also grandly historical: to create the kind of vivid and iconic images of Mitt Romney that say: Here is the next president of the United States.
And the advance team must do all that largely through the filter of a generally uncooperative news media, which will broadcast its images on Twitter and the Web, as well as on television and in print.
''This is a direct introduction for voters to the governor,'' said Mr. Legittino, running through last-minute changes a few hours before the Lancaster rally. ''We just want to have an event for the governor to come to that's free of distraction, that looks good in photos and on TV, and that accurately delivers our message that better days lie ahead.''
Thirty-six hours spent with the team last month, watching a political rally come together, reveals how thoroughly Mr. Romney's advance team -- like all presidential campaigns -- tries to dictate the candidate's image. To do it well, they must not only attend to details, but also handle the unforeseen hiccups that must be navigated before Mr. Romney utters a single word.
The planning for the Oct. 12 event began in earnest on Oct. 9, in the Boston campaign office of Will Ritter, 29, the director of advance. In a meeting, Mr. Ritter rolled through a list of questions, ticking off potential obstacles.
''The tricky thing is, we've got to work around high school football, right?'' he asked. ''What time does high school football start?''
''7:30,'' came the reply.
''So we've got to get people out by 6:45,'' he said, ''and they can go straight to the game.''
A young aide mentioned a local fair and a combine demolition derby, which would take up parking, and Mr. Ritter jotted down a note. Later, he explained, only half joking, ''There are probably eight problems per event.''
Not much escapes scrutiny. When choosing the campaign theme song, aides considered ''I'm in a Hurry (And I Don't Know Why)'' by Alabama. But they worried that the ''I Don't Know Why'' verse might undercut the campaign's message of strong leadership. They settled instead on ''Born Free.''
Like many aides, Mr. Ritter monitors Mr. Romney's events from a small television in his office, which can display eight channels simultaneously. (The highlight so far: a speech in Abingdon, Va., on Oct. 5, two days after the first presidential debate, carried live by every single network and news cable outlet, except the Weather Channel.) He often watches with the mute button on, testing if the campaign's message is clear to a voter just glancing at the screen.
''We want to make sure our message transcends the 5,000 people who are on a Main Street in Ohio,'' Mr. Legittino explained.
Not all messages are easy to convey. ''We were talking about the debt and deficit, which is an advance challenge because how do you convey 'debt' without using the word 'debt,' which is negative?'' Mr. Ritter said.
Solution: A debt clock -- a large, portable prop that, with an algorithm written by a recent Harvard graduate, displays a real-time ticking reminder of the nation's growing debt.
The clock, Mr. Ritter quickly realized, helped direct crowds to Mr. Romney's promise of economic turnaround. ''When we did town halls, we noticed that it kept the voters' questions focused on the debt,'' he explained.
Mr. Ritter's advance team arrives in town roughly five days before an event, to scout possible locations and vet everyone from the volunteer drivers for the press motorcade to the owner of a diner where Mr. Romney might make an unscheduled stop. Once a site is chosen, the aides start building crowds by notifying local news media that Mr. Romney is coming.
On Thursday, more than a day before the rally began, Mr. Romney's advance team was in full swing. They shut Main Street to traffic at 4 p.m., and worked until 3 a.m., hammering together the stage and turning off the town bell, so it would not ring during Mr. Romney's speech.
Lamp posts were decorated with bales of hay and cornstalks, signs were posted, and young staff members held their hands to their eyes in the shape of a circle, trying to imagine the event through the lens of a camera.
''You're trying to make things feel energetic, warm and local,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''It's about trying to get that great picture in a national newspaper, and having television B-roll that looks great.''
By the time Mr. Romney took the stage Friday evening, just as Mr. Legittino was quickly tweaking lighting, the rally looked like picturesque Americana: Maples in the throes of fall -- half russet, half green. A giant American flag, rustling slightly in the breeze. And the man who might be the next president of the United States, rousing a sea of people that stretched back as far as the eye could see.
Mr. Ritter was ebullient. ''NBC Nightly News'' had featured a live report, complete with 8,500 people cheering as Mr. Romney spoke. ''Doesn't get much better than that,'' he e-mailed from his desk back in Boston, as he prepared for the next event.

HEADLINE: Estimate of Economic Losses Now Up to $50 Billion

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Patrick McGeehan

 BODY:
Economic damages inflicted by Hurricane Sandy could reach $50 billion, according to new estimates that are more than double a previous forecast. Some economists warned on Thursday that the storm could shave a half percentage point off the nation's economic growth in the current quarter.
Losses from the storm could total $30 billion to $50 billion, according to Eqecat, which tracks hurricanes and analyzes the damage they cause. On Monday, before the storm hit the East Coast, the firm estimated $10 billion to $20 billion in total economic damages. 
The flooding of New York's subways and roadway tunnels and the extensive loss of business as a result of utility failures across the region were behind the sharp increase in the estimate, the firm said.
''The geographic scope of the storm was unprecedented, and the impacts on individuals and on commerce are far larger,'' said Tom Larsen, Eqecat's senior vice president and product architect. ''Lost power is going to contribute to higher insurance losses.''
Eqecat predicted that New York would bear 34 percent of the total economic losses, with New Jersey suffering 30 percent, Pennsylvania 20 percent and other states 16 percent. That includes all estimated losses, whether covered by insurance or not. The estimates and the share that will be covered by insurers are far from certain at this point, as government officials, property owners and insurance adjusters struggle to assess the destruction.
While the stock market, banks and other financial institutions regained some of their stride on Thursday, other sectors like retailing, transportation and leisure and hospitality face a much longer and more difficult recovery. With fuel in short supply in many areas and utilities warning that power may not be back for a week or more in some areas, businesses found themselves preparing for the equivalent of a long siege.
FedEx, for example, was trying to rent fuel tankers for its trucks in New York and New Jersey as commercial gas stations ran dry.
''We're reaching out to everyone who has a gasoline tanker that we can move to these areas,'' said Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the company. While FedEx had stocks of oil in advance of the storm for generators, it was not prepared for the gas shortages that caused long lines at stations on Wednesday and Thursday.
''There has not been an impact yet, but this is something we can see as an issue and we're concerned,'' she said.
As logistical problems mounted, and damage estimates surged, economists raised their estimates of the storm's impact.
''I think the effect will be quite big,'' said Julia Lynn Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas. ''In the fourth quarter, we're probably looking at an impact of half a percentage point.''
She said some of those losses would be made up in the first quarter of 2013, as insurance reimbursements were distributed and homeowners and businesses rebuilt.
Hurricane Sandy will rank high among disasters in terms of economic impact but will not be at the top of the list, said Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. He estimated that the losses would be less than half of those suffered because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and from Hurricane Katrina.
Moody's Analytics also put the impact in the $50 billion range, with about $12 billion in losses falling in the New York City metropolitan area.
About $20 billion of that total is from lost economic activity like meals not served in restaurants, canceled plane flights and bets not placed in casinos, Mr. Zandi estimated. The rest, about $30 billion, will be from property destruction, including damage to homes, cars and businesses, Mr. Zandi said.
Eqecat said it believed that various forms of insurance would cover $10 billion to $20 billion of the total cost. Other losses will be borne by individuals and businesses, or covered by federal government programs like the National Flood Insurance Program. Much of the federal spending will be used to repair damaged public infrastructure, rather than for private property.
Eqecat said that if insured costs remained at the lower end of its predicted range, at $10 billion, then about 60 percent of the losses would be covered by homeowners' and, to a lesser extent, auto insurers. The remainder would be covered by commercial and industrial insurance.
The firm's officials said that if total insured losses rose to the higher end of its predicted range, it would be because of costs like business-interruption losses -- and in that case, commercial insurers pay more.
They said this possibility would depend to a great extent on how long power failures continued. They said there were no solid data yet on the number of transformers and power lines that had been knocked out. They added that in some cases, power might not be restored until well into December.
Moody's issued a report on Thursday stating that the large nationwide insurers had ''diversified exposures and strong capital bases to withstand'' payouts related to the storm. It added, however, that the costs could disrupt the capital bases of smaller regional insurers.
State Farm, the largest writer of home and auto insurance in the region, reported having received nearly 25,000 homeowners' claims and 4,000 auto claims as of Wednesday. Those numbers are probably a fraction of the eventual totals. Some of the losses will not be recouped. Lost Halloween sales will be especially painful for some retailers, according to a separate analysis by Moody's.
''As shoppers in the affected regions focus on the storm, other discretionary spending will fall and not be recouped,'' Moody's said.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Reports Larger-Than-Expected Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The American International Group earned a larger-than-expected profit in the third quarter, in part because of big gains on its investment holdings.
Questions about the sustainability of those profits, along with uncertainty about the timing and structure of the Treasury Department's plan to sell its remaining 16 percent stake in the insurance giant, contributed to a drop in A.I.G. shares in after-hours trading, analysts said. 
''One of the biggest questions that people ask is the timing of the next offering of the U.S. government, and whether A.I.G. will participate in that offering,'' said Paul Newsome, an analyst who covers the firm for Sandler O'Neill & Partners.
The company received $182.5 billion in bailout money from American taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis and has been working to repay the government for the last few years.
The remaining stake pertains to A.I.G. shares the Treasury Department owns in exchange for capital it infused. Last quarter, the Treasury Department sold $26.5 billion worth of those shares, including about $8 billion purchased by A.I.G.
The government still holds 234.2 million common shares. The timing of future sales, and whether A.I.G. will repurchase stock, are unclear.
The company reported net income of $1.9 billion, or $1.13 a share, for the period, compared with a loss of $4 billion, or $2.10 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts had expected it to earn 86 cents a share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters.
Because competitors like the Travelers Companies reported even stronger third-quarter results, investors' expectations for A.I.G. may have been higher than what analysts' figures suggest, Mr. Newsome said.
Stock in A.I.G., which is based in New York, rose 27 cents, or 0.77 percent, to $35.20 a share during the regular trading session. The shares fell as much as 2 percent in postmarket trading after the company reported its results.

HEADLINE: The Man Who Wields a Lead-Weighted Beanbag for Obama

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Almost exactly four years ago, when President Obama was on the cusp of winning the White House, he spoke emotionally about David Axelrod, the strategist who guided him from the Illinois State Senate to the pinnacle of national politics. He praised Mr. Axelrod for his ''basic take'' on ''how politics should be able to draw on our best and not our worst.''
The other day, toward the bitter end of one of the most negatively fought presidential campaigns in modern memory, Mr. Axelrod was asked over breakfast here how that whole thing had turned out.
''I mean, look, what's the old expression? 'Politics isn't beanbag,' '' Mr. Axelrod said, digging into a greasy egg dish he knew he shouldn't have ordered but, well, it's nearly the end and sometimes stress must be fed. Noting that both campaigns have their share of political warriors, he added, ''There are no ingénues in this battle.'' 
For more than a decade, Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Obama have formed one of the most famous partnerships in presidential politics, like those of Karl Rove and George W. Bush, Michael K. Deaver and Ronald Reagan, and James A. Farley and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Where Mr. Axelrod honed and protected the idealism that defined Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, he has been an important force driving the combativeness of Mr. Obama's campaign of 2012, embodying how their hope to change the system has given way to a more traditional reliance on partisan muscle in this, their final campaign together.
It is through Mr. Axelrod that the story of Mr. Obama's perhaps inevitable evolution can best be tracked. Those who know Mr. Axelrod say that he, like Mr. Obama, is a man of ideals but also a street fighter who wants to win -- and has proved himself willing to take off the gloves in these closing weeks of the campaign to protect his friend's legacy before Mr. Axelrod heads off to start an academic institute dedicated to his craft at the University of Chicago.
On any given day his mustachioed face can be seen on national television calling Mr. Romney the ''most secretive'' candidate since Richard M. Nixon, an ''outsourcer in chief'' and, more recently, ''a parrot.''
Making fun this week of Mr. Romney's bid to make last-minute inroads in the perceived Obama strongholds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota, he promised on the MSNBC program ''Morning Joe'' to ''shave off my mustache of 40 years if we lose any of those three states.''
A joke but also a statement of how personally Mr. Axelrod takes Mr. Obama's re-election, the failure of which would bring a crushing end to what had been the pride of Mr. Axelrod's career, shepherding to the White House the nation's first African-American president.
Friends said that he took Mr. Obama's widely panned showing in the first presidential debate this year harder than he let on, ''carrying the weight of it,'' as one colleague put it in an interview this week, and redoubled his efforts to ensure Mr. Obama brought more focus the second time.
Yet Mr. Axelrod also gets credit for playing a critical role in bringing Mr. Obama as far as he did until then, overcoming so much drag from the slowly recovering economy.
He and his colleagues did that in large part through a long-running and hard-hitting campaign to cast Mr. Romney as a job-killing plutocrat while promoting Mr. Obama as the true champion of the middle class.
''David enjoys it all the time, playing hardball politics,'' said William Daley, the former White House chief of staff who helped recruit Mr. Axelrod some 25 years ago to run his brother Richard's first successful mayoral race. Speaking of the president, Mr. Daley added, ''When he's got to do it, he can do it, and enjoy it.''
Mr. Axelrod bristles at such descriptions. And when asked if his approach has helped open the campaign to charges that it has abandoned its promises of high-minded politics, Mr. Axelrod can show flashes of indignation, arguing that Mr. Obama's opponents have played a role since the primaries, if not since the start of his presidency.
''You know, their whole predicate was negative; the whole predicate was 'fire the president,' '' Mr. Axelrod said. ''He's the president of the United States, he's been around the block. But was he going to sit there and take that? No. And neither were we.''
Mr. Axelrod has been called the keeper of Mr. Obama's narrative since at least before his last presidential campaign formally began.
But this year his job has been more about protecting the president's legacy, slashing at Mr. Romney and presenting a case for Mr. Obama's re-election based on arguments that Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager, described as ''wholly grounded in fighting for the middle class.''
She and other aides pointed to nonattack ads that Mr. Axelrod has put his time into this year. One, called ''Go,'' ran heavily earlier this year and was about the work Mr. Obama did to return the economy from the depths of the recession, as well as his decision to sign off on the killing of Osama bin Laden.
And Mr. Axelrod's colleagues described him as often setting the limits on how far to go against Mr. Romney without diminishing the president's own standing.
''He stops us from doing a bunch of things that are typical back and forth campaign stuff that isn't in the president's voice,'' said Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager.
In interviews, Mr. Axelrod's colleagues said he would often weigh in to give an argument more heft -- for instance, embracing the use of the term ''Romnesia'' to describe Mr. Romney's changes in position, but making sure it included a larger argument that his overall policies were more conservative than he was letting on, said his fellow campaign strategist Larry Grisolano. (That did not keep Mr. Romney's campaign from charging that Mr. Obama's campaign was resorting to petty attacks in lieu of a second-term agenda to run on.)
But at other times, Mr. Axelrod said, the president pulled him back. ''He's killed ads,'' Mr. Axelrod said, without elaborating.
As breakfast came toward an end, Mr. Axelrod was asked how the president felt about what was seen as one of his campaign's toughest ads, in which Mr. Romney is shown singing ''America the Beautiful'' off key as the screen flashed information about his offshore investments.
''Well, it aired,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Romney Travels to Russia, but on Strictly Friendly Terms

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Matt Romney, a son of the Republican presidential nominee, traveled to Moscow this week seeking Russian investors for his California-based real estate firm just days before his father is to wrap up a campaign in which he has vowed to take a tougher stance with the Kremlin.
Mr. Romney, the second-oldest son of Mitt Romney, met with Russians whom he hoped to convince to invest in his company, Excel Trust, which owns shopping centers across the United States, the firm said. Although the company's focus has been solely domestic, it said it has begun exploring international opportunities to raise funds. 
Mr. Romney's trip a week before the presidential election underscored the complex relationship between his family's business and the political campaign. Mitt Romney has criticized President Obama for being too soft on Russia, calling it ''our No. 1 geopolitical foe'' and promising to confront President Vladimir V. Putin's government with ''more backbone'' if elected on Tuesday.
Mr. Romney has criticized Mr. Putin's crackdown on domestic dissent and opposition to stronger international measures against Syria and Iran. He has assailed Mr. Obama for not doing more to defend human rights in Russia and for signing a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Moscow.
As Congress considers normalizing trade relations with Moscow, Mr. Romney has insisted that it also penalize Russian officials who commit human rights violations, a linkage the Obama administration has resisted.
The Romney campaign said it had no comment.
The Russian Embassy in Washington said it was unaware of the trip. ''We haven't got any information about Mr. Romney and his visit to Moscow,'' said Yevgeny Khorishko, an embassy spokesman. ''He didn't inform us about his visit.''
But while in Moscow, Mr. Romney told a Russian known to be able to deliver messages to Mr. Putin that despite the campaign rhetoric, his father wants good relations if he becomes president, according to a person informed about the conversation.
Matt Romney traveled to Moscow with Gary B. Sabin, the chairman and chief executive of Excel Trust, which is based in San Diego. Greg Davis, the firm's vice president of capital markets and communications, said the trip was unrelated to the campaign.
''It is a harmless trip,'' Mr. Davis said. ''It was a trip that has been planned for some time. Any travel they've done on behalf of Excel is strictly on the private side. It would have nothing to do with anything governmental.''
Excel is a real estate investment trust that focuses on shopping centers largely in states from California to Florida and up to Pennsylvania. By distributing 90 percent or more of its taxable income in the form of a dividend, it helps investors avoid double taxation under the law, Mr. Davis said.
The firm reported $820 million in assets to the Securities Exchange Commission as of June 30. It focuses on ''grocery-anchored neighborhood centers'' and ''free-standing retail properties,'' among others, according to its Web site. Among its holdings are the Shops at Foxwood in Ocala, Fla., the Plaza at Rockwall in Rockwall, Tex., and the Promenade in Scottsdale, Ariz.
While all of its real estate holdings are in the United States, Mr. Davis said Excel was interested in raising money from sovereign wealth funds in Europe and Russia that were looking for safe havens in uncertain economic times.
''There are a number of opportunities worldwide -- people looking at where can we put our money,'' he said. ''Any trips right now are very exploratory to see is there a market, are they serious about investing in Excel.''
Matt Romney graduated from Brigham Young University and Harvard Business School and started at Excel Realty Holdings in 2003, according to a biography. Since 2009, he has served as senior vice president of capital markets for Excel Trust. He has appeared on the campaign trail at times for his father.
His father has made Russia a centerpiece of his indictment of Mr. Obama, whose ''reset'' policy stabilized relations with Moscow after a rocky stretch only to see ties sour again with the return of Mr. Putin to the presidency.
In recent months, Russia has blocked stronger efforts to stop the killing in Syria, jailed opponents of Mr. Putin at home, kicked out the United States Agency for International Development and threatened to end a longstanding Russian-American nuclear cooperation program.
Mr. Romney seized on a comment Mr. Obama made during a discussion of missile defense with Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russia's president, that ''after my election I have more flexibility.'' Mr. Romney countered that Russia ''is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe,'' although he distinguished it from a nuclear-armed Iran, which he termed ''the greatest threat that the world faces.''
The comment has caused alarm in Moscow, where some analysts have said relations would freeze if Mr. Romney was elected. Mr. Obama has attacked Mr. Romney as a throwback to the cold war.
''The 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,'' he said at their last debate.
Mr. Romney countered, ''I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin. And I'm certainly not going to say to him, 'I'll give you more flexibility after the election.' ''

HEADLINE: A Better Poll Question: Who Will Win?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
In the tight 2004 campaign, the polls that asked Americans which candidate they supported -- all the way up to the exit polls -- told a confusing story about whether President George W. Bush or Senator John Kerry would win.
But another kind of polling question, which received far less attention, produced a clearer result: Regardless of whom they supported, which candidate did people expect to win? Americans consistently, and correctly, said that they thought Mr. Bush would. 
A version of that question has produced similarly telling results throughout much of modern polling history, according to a new academic study. Over the last 60 years, poll questions that asked people which candidate they expected to win have been a better guide to the outcome of the presidential race than questions asking people whom they planned to vote for, the study found.
Most recently, Mitt Romney won the Republican nomination despite at various points trailing other candidates -- Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, Rick Perry -- in polls of Republican voters' preferences. Even when Mr. Romney was behind, Republicans typically told pollsters that they expected him to win the nomination.
Asking about expectations, said Justin Wolfers, one of the study's authors, ''is fundamentally about treating poll respondents with respect.''
The question allows people to consider not only their views but also those of their relatives, friends and colleagues, he said. Some voters may also give more-honest answers about their own plans, rather than naming a candidate who briefly intrigues them, as happened in the Republican primaries this year. And an expectations question allows people to take into account speeches, debates and news media reports.
''More information produces better results,'' said Mr. Wolfers, a professor of economics at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, who wrote the paper with David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research, a division of the software company.
The paper -- which the authors have presented at academic gatherings and will soon submit to journals -- is generating discussion among public opinion experts. With response rates to polls having fallen sharply in recent years, thanks to mobile phones, caller identification and a rise in phone solicitation, expectations questions have the potential of effectively increasing a survey's sample.
The authors estimate that a typical voter has as much information as about 10 randomly selected voters polled about their own intentions.
Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup, said he was intrigued enough by the paper to have talked with the authors about how to include expectations questions in more polls. ''It's treating every respondent like a mini-anthropologist,'' he said.
Perhaps the biggest limitation of the study is that polling companies have asked expectations questions much less often than other kinds of questions, Mr. Newport added. ''Like all intriguing hypotheses, we just need more data,'' he said.
The study also offers another window on the current presidential contest and the endless debate over what the polls mean. In the last three weeks, polls -- including by ABC/Washington Post, Gallup, Politico/George Washington University and Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS -- have consistently found that more Americans expect President Obama to win than expect Mr. Romney to win.
The margins have varied between 13 and 24 percentage points for Mr. Obama among samples of likely voters, registered voters and all adults. The gap is similar to one from a Gallup poll in mid-October 2004, when 56 percent of respondents expected Mr. Bush to win, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Kerry.
The finding does not mean that Mr. Obama is sure to win. If anything, it highlights one uncertainty about the paper's conclusion: Does it mostly reflect people's knowledge of others' voting intentions, or does it mostly reflect publicly available information?
Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia University, said he thought that the notion of asking people about their social networks was a smart one. But in this case, he said he believed that the finding largely reflected public information, which he considered less interesting.
Mr. Wolfers disagreed, saying he thought that voters' predictions were based mostly on friends, yard signs and other private information, given that responses to the expectations questions varied so much.
Either way, expectations questions have the potential to be useful well beyond politics. If people turn out to be accurate forecasters as a group -- be it because of their own knowledge or because of a wisdom-of-crowds synthesis of public information -- they could help pollsters gain insight into the economy and consumer preferences.
Only 15 years ago, the response rate to a typical poll was about 40 percent. Today, it is only about 10 percent, said Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Research Center.
Mr. Rothschild said he believed that polling methods would need ''to change dramatically'' as ''people make it harder and harder to contact someone randomly.'' The beauty of an expectations poll, he and Mr. Wolfers said, is that it has the effect of turbocharging a poll's sample.
In presidential races since 1952, the expectations question has pointed to the winner in 81 percent of states, based on data from the American National Election Studies. The question about voting intentions pointed to the winner in 69 percent.
A larger data set, including other American elections and overseas elections, produced a similar result.
The study's authors emphasized that expectations questions could produce useful results even with unrepresentative samples. On average, about 70 percent of people predict that their preferred candidate will win; if a poll only of Democrats found that 60 percent expected their candidate to win, that would suggest the Republican was the favorite.
Although expectations questions have not received much attention lately, Mr. Rothschild has discovered that they have a long history. In 1936, at the dawn of the modern polling era, The New York Times asked at least four political experts in each state to predict the outcome in their state.
Two well-known polling organizations at the time differed, with Literary Digest forecasting a victory by Alf Landon and the forerunner of the Gallup Poll predicting re-election for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Times's method suggested a Roosevelt landslide, and the article, written by Arthur Krock, appeared on Page 1 of the newspaper on Nov. 1, 1936.
''We hope,'' Mr. Rothschild said, ''that our paper can shift the focus of polling back to this amazingly powerful forecast mechanism.''

HEADLINE: Tax Report Withdrawn At Request Of G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Research Service has withdrawn an economic report that found no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth, a central tenet of conservative economic theory, after Senate Republicans raised concerns about the paper's findings and wording.
The decision, made in late September against the advice of the agency's economic team leadership, drew almost no notice at the time. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, cited the study a week and a half after it was withdrawn in a speech on tax policy at the National Press Club.
But it could actually draw new attention to the report, which questions the premise that lowering the top marginal tax rate stimulates economic growth and job creation.
''This has hues of a banana republic,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''They didn't like a report, and instead of rebutting it, they had them take it down.'' 
Republicans did not say whether they had asked the research service, a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress, to take the report out of circulation, but they were clear that they protested its tone and findings.
Don Stewart, a spokesman for the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Mr. McConnell and other senators ''raised concerns about the methodology and other flaws.'' Mr. Stewart added that people outside of Congress had also criticized the study and that officials at the research service ''decided, on their own, to pull the study pending further review.''
Senate Republican aides said they had protested both the tone of the report and its findings. Aides to Mr. McConnell presented a bill of particulars to the research service that included objections to the use of the term ''Bush tax cuts'' and the report's reference to ''tax cuts for the rich,'' which Republicans contended was politically freighted.
They also protested on economic grounds, saying that the author, Thomas L. Hungerford, was looking for a macroeconomic response to tax cuts within the first year of the policy change without sufficiently taking into account the time lag of economic policies. Further, they complained that his analysis had not taken into account other policies affecting growth, such as the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.
''There were a lot of problems with the report from a real, legitimate economic analysis perspective,'' said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee's Republicans. ''We relayed them to C.R.S. It was a good discussion. We have a good, constructive relationship with them. Then it was pulled.''
The pressure applied to the research service comes amid a broader Republican effort to raise questions about research and statistics that were once trusted as nonpartisan and apolitical.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release unemployment figures for October, a month after some conservatives denounced its last report as politically tinged to abet President Obama's re-election. When the bureau suggested its October report might be delayed by Hurricane Sandy, some conservatives immediately suggested politics were at play.
Republicans have also tried to discredit the private Tax Policy Center ever since the research organization declared that Mitt Romney's proposal to cut tax rates by 20 percent while protecting the middle class and not increasing the deficit was mathematically impossible. For years, conservatives have pressed the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to factor in robust economic growth when it is asked to calculate the cost of tax cuts to the federal budget.
Congressional aides and outside economists said they were not aware of previous efforts to discredit a study from the research service.
''When their math doesn't add up, Republicans claim that their vague version of economic growth will somehow magically make up the difference. And when that is refuted, they're left with nothing more to lean on than charges of bias against nonpartisan experts,'' said Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Jared Bernstein, a former economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., conceded that ''tax cuts for the rich'' was ''not exactly academic prose,'' but he said the analysis did examine policy time lags and controlled for several outside factors, including monetary policy.
''This sounds to me like a complete political hit job and another example of people who don't like the results and try to use backdoor ways to suppress them,'' he said. ''I've never seen anything like this, and frankly, it makes me worried.''
Janine D'Addario, a spokeswoman for the Congressional Research Service, would not comment on internal deliberations over the decision. She confirmed that the report was no longer in official circulation.
A person with knowledge of the deliberations, who requested anonymity, said the Sept. 28 decision to withdraw the report was made against the advice of the research service's economics division, and that Mr. Hungerford stood by its findings.
The report received wide notice from media outlets and liberal and conservative policy analysts when it was released on Sept. 14. It examined the historical fluctuations of the top income tax rates and the rates on capital gains since World War II, and concluded that those fluctuations did not appear to affect the nation's economic growth.
''The reduction in the top tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment and productivity growth. The top tax rates appear to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie,'' the report said. ''However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution.''
The Congressional Research Service does such reports at the request of lawmakers, and the research is considered private. Although the reports are posted on the service's Web site, they are available only to members and staff. Their public release is subject to lawmakers' discretion.
But the Hungerford study was bound to be widely circulated. It emerged in the final months of a presidential campaign in which tax policy has been a central focus. Mr. Romney, the Republican nominee, maintains that any increase in the top tax rates on income and capital gains would slow economic growth and crush the job market's recovery.
President Obama has promised to allow cuts on the top two income tax rates to expire in January, lifting the rates from 33 and 35 percent, their level during most of George W. Bush's presidency, to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, where they were during most of the Clinton administration. Mr. Obama maintains the increases would not hurt the economy and are the fairest way to reduce the deficit.
Mr. Hungerford, a specialist in public finance who earned his economics doctorate from the University of Michigan, has contributed at least $5,000 this election cycle to a combination of Mr. Obama's campaign, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

HEADLINE: Jobless, and Hopeless, in America

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and CATHERINE RAMPELL; Annie Lowrey reported from Washington and Catherine Rampell from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the economy-focused presidential campaign, the two candidates and their teams have scarcely mentioned what economists describe as not just one of the labor market's most pressing problems, but the entire country's: long-term unemployment.
Nearly five million Americans out of work for more than six months are left to wonder what kind of help might be coming, as the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund and a bipartisan swath of policy experts implore Washington to act -- both to alleviate human misery and to ensure the strength of the economy.
The pain of the long-term unemployed has persisted even as the overall jobs picture has brightened a bit and the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.8 percent. The new government report for October was due to be released on Friday morning.
''The problem is incredibly urgent,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and an adviser to Mitt Romney's campaign. ''Spain had a financial crisis in the late 1970s and has never seen its unemployment rate drop back to where it was before that crisis. The unemployed become discouraged, and ultimately the employment to population ratio might take a permanent hit.'' 
On the agenda for the next Congress and the next president is ensuring that the unusually long spells of unemployment now afflicting jobless workers remain a temporary setback of the recession.
Economists warned that long-term unemployment could be transformed in the next few years into structural unemployment, meaning that the problem is not just too few jobs and too many job seekers, but a large group of workers who no longer match employers' needs or are no longer considered employable.
''Skills become obsolete, contacts atrophy, information atrophies, and they get stigmatized,'' said Harry Holzer of Georgetown University.
That has been the experience of millions of workers like Beatrice Hogg, 55, of Sacramento, a college-educated white-collar worker who has slid from the middle class into poverty.
Her last job -- doing administrative work and advising students at a community college -- ended in June 2009. Her unemployment benefits ended more than a year ago. She was evicted from her apartment in December and has been staying at friends' homes and occasionally at train stations. Despite her efforts, she has been turned down for job after job after job, and is surviving on food stamps.
''I don't enjoy being out of work,'' Ms. Hogg said in an interview. ''I don't enjoy having to ask friends to give me rides or get things for me. I want to take care of myself. I've been on my own since I was 18 years old. It's hard for me. It's demoralizing. It's hard to ask people for things when you've been independent the rest of your life.''
Stronger economic growth may help to whittle the ranks of the long-term unemployed over time, experts said.
''There must have been a lot of workers badly scarred by long bouts of unemployment in the Great Depression,'' said Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution. ''Even in 1939 we had unemployment somewhere around 14 percent, as we'd measure it today. A lot of people who were jobless had been jobless for a long, long time. But in the space of a couple of years those disadvantages looked like nothing given that employers had voracious appetites for workers.''
But many economists contended that policies to help the long-term unemployed are needed as well, to ensure that they have the skills necessary to compete for the jobs that the economy is adding -- turning construction workers into oil-and-gas extractors and administrative assistants into home health care providers, for example.
In Washington, many politicians support measures for the long-term unemployed; few demand them.
Both Democrats and Republicans have proposed or supported revamping job-training programs, giving states more flexibility in using funds for the unemployed and providing credits to companies that hire workers who have been out of a job for more than six months, for instance.
The campaigns have offered their preferred policies as well. The White House put out a range of proposals to aid the long-term jobless as part of its stalled American Jobs Act legislation, a few of which made it into a bill extending a payroll tax cut this year. Mr. Romney has proposed, among other measures, creating ''personal re-employment accounts'' to give funds to unemployed workers for community college or vocational training.
But experts worried about a lack of urgency. Gridlock in Washington, the focus on cutting rather than spending, even the simple fact that discussing the topic can be depressing might leave the issue by the wayside.
''It's not just the heat of the campaign'' leaving the topic neglected, said Christine L. Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. ''There's a certain kind of fatigue when talking about long-term unemployment, and as a result there hasn't been the level of attention and discussion that's warranted.''
For new policies, ''there is no political will, none whatsoever,'' said Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas.
He noted that during the recession and the recovery, relatively few workers have cycled through unemployment.
''There are fewer of us experiencing unemployment, but those who are out are out a lot longer,'' Mr. Hamermesh said. ''They then become increasingly isolated, which decreases the will to do anything, because they are a less important group.''
Statistics suggested that the long-term unemployment problem had begun to recede. The number of workers who reported actively seeking a job for more than six months fell to 4.8 million from 6.2 million in the past year, according to government data. The proportion of jobless workers who counted as long-term unemployed fell to 40 percent from its peak of 45.5 percent in March 2011.
But it remains a bleak situation. About 800,000 workers want a job but have simply given up looking, and so are no longer even counted as unemployed. About 1.7 million people have joined the disability rolls since the recession began at the end of 2007, an increase of 24 percent, as workers use the disability program as a backdoor safety net when their unemployment insurance runs out. After searching for a new position for a year, a worker trying to regain employment finds that his chance to do so in the coming month falls below 10 percent.
As seen in the debates and on the campaign trail, the problem has largely fallen off politicians' list of priorities.
When asked directly how to alleviate long-term unemployment in the second debate, Mr. Romney addressed joblessness in general before quickly switching topics to the Detroit auto bailout. Mr. Obama never addressed the question at all.

HEADLINE: Rove Vs. Bloomberg? It Seems That Way In Maine Senate Race

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BANGOR, Me. -- The Maine Senate race has become so convoluted that at times it has seemed as if Karl Rove and Michael R. Bloomberg were running against each other.
Mr. Rove, the mastermind of Republican ''super PAC'' money, and Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York, have injected considerable cash into this race (on opposing sides) and, as a result, have become proxies for their political allies. But that is not the only oddity here.
With an independent candidate as the perceived front-runner, a conservative Republican group actually paid for a series of television advertisements supporting the Democrat in the race, this after she was abandoned by her national party. And the Republican nominee has been cold-shouldered by Olympia J. Snowe, the popular Republican senator whose retirement led to the race to replace her.
Republicans were distraught when Ms. Snowe announced in February that she would not seek re-election. They had counted on her scoring an easy victory and helping the party take control of the Senate. Then Angus King, a popular former governor, entered the race as an independent, and he shot to the top of the polls. 
Mr. King has refused to say which party he will side with if he wins, although many analysts expect him to vote with the Democrats, given his support for President Obama. So Republicans concluded that they at least had to try to knock off Mr. King if they wanted any chance of taking the Senate. Outside interests, notably Mr. Rove's Crossroads GPS and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, joined the National Republican Senatorial Committee in pumping millions of dollars into television ads against Mr. King.
At the same time, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has kept its distance from its nominee, Cynthia Dill, a state senator, because they figured Mr. King had a better chance of winning than she did, and he would side with them anyway.
Now, after a tumultuous summer and fall in which party lines were scrambled and more than $6 million in outside money gushed into the state, Mr. King is still maintaining a double-digit lead in the polls.
This has discouraged some supporters of Charles Summers, the Republican nominee and Maine's secretary of state. Both the national Republican and Democratic Senate campaign committees have stopped buying TV ads in the state.
But Mr. Rove has not. Crossroads has just tossed another $335,000 into the pot for a new ad blasting Mr. King, saying he used his influence to help wind power companies like his own (a charge that the King campaign denies).
The last-minute infusion brings Crossroads' total spending in the race to nearly $1 million, and it has given some fresh hope to the Summers team.
''The fact that Crossroads has locked in for the final week with a new ad should reinforce the fact that this race continues to be seen as a winnable race for Charlie,'' Lance Dutson, Mr. Summers's campaign manager, wrote in an e-mail.
In the down-to-the-wire presidential contest, Mitt Romney has shown sudden interest in Maine; the state has been leaning toward Mr. Obama in the polls, but it awards its Electoral College votes based on results in the state's two Congressional Districts, and even one such vote could matter. Mr. Dutson said that television ad buys by the Romney camp ''means a significant amount of resources will be spent to help get Charlie elected.''
One of Mr. King's chief benefactors has been Mr. Bloomberg, who sent a $500,000 infusion as part of a $1.75 million donation from a group called Americans Elect. The group stepped in after the avalanche of negative ads started to hurt Mr. King. The mayor also started his own super PAC with plans to funnel up to $15 million more to various candidates, including Mr. King.
As the recipient of so much outside money himself, Mr. Summers has not complained too loudly about Mr. Bloomberg's involvement, except to cast Mr. King as a hypocrite. Mr. Summers has also sought to poke holes in Mr. King's notion that he can accomplish anything as an independent.
''We don't need an independent in the Senate,'' Mr. Summers said at a candidate's debate. ''We don't need an umpire. Umpires don't win ballgames.''
Mr. King's support eroded somewhat under an assault of ads that charged him with being a big spender and leaving the state with a deficit when he left office in 2003. But he never fell behind in the polls. One recently gave him an advantage of 26 percentage points; Real Clear Politics has him up over Mr. Summers by an average of 15 points.
One of Mr. Summers's problems is that he managed to alienate the moderate Ms. Snowe, his onetime political patron, who could have been a powerful ally. Before she decided not to seek re-election, he refused to endorse her when she was facing a Tea Party-backed challenger in a Republican primary; that cooled her interest in helping him as he sought to replace her.
Mark Brewer, a political scientist at the University of Maine, said that Mr. King had improved as a candidate, addressing concerns that he needed to be more specific in responding to criticisms about his tenure as governor and about what he wanted to accomplish in Washington.
But much of the campaign has revolved around the outside money, and Mr. King has sought to turn that to his advantage -- even though he, too, has been a recipient. ''I feel, actually, like a walking economic development project,'' he joked here recently.
Maine, he said, has an opportunity to ''make a statement to the negative-ad gurus and the political people that these ads don't work.''
He said in an interview that using Mr. Rove's name had helped him with his own fund-raising because Mr. Rove was so well known and underscored that his race had national implications.
Whatever the outcome, it seems fair to say that traditional political parties in Maine, already somewhat off kilter with its Tea Party-backed governor, will be left in shambles after this campaign, particularly the Democratic Party. By cutting Ms. Dill loose, the national party gave local Democrats the cover to side with Mr. King. And just this week the conservative Safe Nation PAC spent nearly $25,000 on a pro-Dill mailing against Mr. King.
''The scariest thing for Democrats is that this will be their second nominee for a major race who will come in with under 20 percent of the vote in two years,'' said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''They have a lot to worry about.''

HEADLINE: Really? Natural Disasters Can Influence Birthrates

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: Hurricanes and other catastrophes may influence marriage, birth and divorce rates, but studies are mixed on how. 

 BODY:
 THE FACTS 
A sociologist once remarked that a blackout can produce a boom in birthrates. When the lights go out, he said, people are left to interact with each other.
All levity aside, there are some researchers who believe that large-scale disasters can influence birthrates. Psychologists say it comes down to attachment theory on attachment: that catastrophes, in short, have a way of driving people together and influencing major life decisions.
In a study published in The Journal of Family Psychology in 2002, researchers examined data on marriage, birth and divorce rates across South Carolina from 1975 to 1997. They found, as predicted, that in 1990, the year after Hurricane Hugo struck, marriages and births spiked in the 24 counties declared disaster areas. But so, too, did divorce rates, a finding the researchers hadn't expected.
The findings suggested, they wrote, that the life-threatening hurricane had motivated many people to take "significant action in their close relationships that altered their life course."
In another study, published in the journal Demography in 2005, a team of psychologists found that birthrates climbed in Oklahoma after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
But some studies have found evidence of a reverse phenomenon. One, published in The Journal of Population Economics in 2010, used data on hurricanes and storm advisories to look at births in 47 counties along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts from 1995 to 2001. It found that "high-severity advisories" had a significant "negative fertility effect." And a study of decades of data in Italy and Japan found similar decreases in fertility after earthquakes.
Disasters, the author argued, perhaps make people less willing to make the long-term investments required to raise a family, and disruptions in family life and loss of homes and jobs may also contribute to declines in birthrates.
 THE BOTTOM LINE 
There is evidence that large-scale catastrophes may influence birth and marriage rates, but in which direction is not clear.

HEADLINE: Bad Blood in the Bald Hills

BYLINE: MICHAEL SCHROEDER


HIGHLIGHT: As the Civil War raged in the East, settler-Indian violence tore apart northern California. 

 BODY:
Though his memoirs make no mention of the event, Col. Francis J. Lippitt may very well have let out a sigh of relief on the September day in 1862 when the steamer Panama finally docked at Bucksport, Calif. It was not the vessel itself he would have been keen to receive, but rather the cargo it was picking up: 800 surrendered American Indians, ready to ship north to Smith's River Reservation near the Oregon border. Perhaps now the guerrilla war that had stalked the counties of remote Northern California for the previous months would finally abate. Perhaps now Colonel Lippitt could finally partake in the titanic struggle to save the Union being waged far to the east.
Lippitt's relief was short-lived. As he was making preparations to re-enlist his volunteer
Second California Infantry as the 13th Rhode Island (he and several officers being native sons of the Ocean State), the relocated Indians began a gradual trickle southward. By year's end, the reservation had emptied. Attacks on isolated farmsteads and travelers picked up. Violence against settlers would linger in the dense forests of the Klamath-Mad River region for another two years.
Empires fray at the edges. The Romans, in their numerous wars with Persians to the east and Germanic tribes to the north, most likely understood this. The British redcoats and bluejackets in Canada, on the Indian Subcontinent and across Africa were locked in a near perpetual conflict just beginning to gather momentum by the mid-19th century. Not yet a century old, the United States, too, was discovering that its westward drive of Manifest Destiny came at the price of blood shed by both settler and Indian alike, even as the country itself fell into civil war. 
The 1846 Mexican-American War, where so many officers who would later don blue or gray fought together in arms, opened up vast expanses of the continent to farming, ranching, mining and trade. To the current inhabitants - tribes ranging from small, sedentary and peaceful peoples, to sprawling, aggressive, mini-empires - much of the land had either been already claimed or was open to all for mutually sustainable use. But to waves of American settlers, it was a bonanza to be won with their own sweat and toil.
It's an old story, played out countless times through the history of the Americas. Colonist versus native; white versus "other." In the American narrative these conflicts would gain prominence in the decades following the Civil War. But just as the Navy battled along distant shores to keep trade lines open and American prestige intact, the Army found itself called to action in the early 1860s, quelling brutal frontier wars far from the epic contest that threatened its very existence.
The rugged woods and valleys of Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties are a world away from the bustle of San Francisco. Rich in timber, gold, grazing land and riverine fishing stocks, the land's very remoteness was one reason limiting full economic development by the early 1860s; the other factor was the growing hostility of the various Indian tribes inhabiting the area. 
Low-scale, sporadic conflict, including frequent killing by Indian tribes of the settlers' cattle, quickly became a way of life in the hills of Northern California. Many of the settlers in these northern counties tied their livelihoods to the cattle they raised, both for consumption and sale, and the loss of a season's worth of cattle could mean total financial ruin and subsequent hardship. 
But for many of the American Indian tribes, settlers' cattle were fair game when hunted on land whose ownership they disputed. In fact, the very presence of the cattle disrupted much of the natural wildlife and permanently altered hunting patterns. At times settlers' cattle were the only available form of subsistence. For other bands, it was more a matter of outright rustling and brigandry, targeting the comparative wealth of the ranches. But the Americans made no distinction between the two ways their cattle were taken; both affected their livelihoods and thus demanded the swiftest punitive raid on the nearest tribal rancheria.
For obvious reasons, the concentration of American forces was elsewhere by 1861. Not only were most regular Army troops called to action in the East, but many newly raised state volunteer regiments served in the central and southern parts of the state - guards against "copperheads" and outright "secessionists" estimated to compose up to a third of the vitally important state's population.
To the settlers of Humboldt and Klamath, many of whom were Union-friendly, the lack of martial assistance from the state capital at Sacramento or Washington was an insult to their loyalty. Lengthy stretches of near-contemporary history written by prominent local (Republican) settler-politician Anthony Jennings Bledsoe are dedicated to sarcastically deriding several federal officers for their "philanthropy" - including a demand for evidence of murder or imminent danger before attacking native tribes. After a barrage of petitions for help, state officials did beef up the military presence in some places, but it remained spotty coverage at best.
In the breach, many settlers took their defense upon themselves. The local volunteers who had lost the most were often the fiercest fighters, in contrast to the more measured Federal troops who drew the scorn of ranchers: "The regular troops here were just a nuisance and never accomplished any good; they protected the Indians and not the settlers."
The fighting itself was a far cry from the set-piece battles, dug-in lines and fortifications east of the Mississippi. One notorious massacre of American Indians in February 1860 at Indian Island drew condemnation from even pro-settler sources, but was illustrative of the bad blood on both sides. As one account reported, "The Indians, stupefied and sleepy, can make no resistance. More than half of the two hundred are women and little children. The axes and knives gleam and flash, are uplifted, and descend." Revenge was inevitable: "The deed had stirred to its very depths the thirst for revenge in the bosom of the Indian."
The worst and most sustained part of the fighting took place in a part of Humboldt County called the Bald Hills. Beginning in 1858, the so-called Wintoon War (named for a local tribe, now known as the Whilkut tribe) began when settlers killed two Indians in a domestic dispute, after which Indians began to ambush travelers on trails or isolated farms. After the lingering death of a well-liked local man in a trailside ambush, the settlers formed an armed posse and attached a rancheria, or Indian settlement, on the Upper Mad River. They too, were ambushed and retreated with several dead.
In response, volunteers under Capt. I.G. Messec set out on a midwinter campaign against theIndians, beginning with the bloodless capture of multiple unarmed camps on the Mad River; Messec's troops then routed small bands of Indians in the mountains between Redwood and Hoopa Valley. 
Tracking one hostile Wintoon band to the redwoods near the coast, Messec led a squad of 14 men in an assault on their rancheria. Messec's party found itself face to face with more than 150 Wintoon. Yet the settler-soldiers were still game, quickly shooting and killing 15 Indians. Eventually, with two severely wounded, Messec ordered his men to beat a retreat. For seven hours they were trailed by a judicious Wintoon scout who took sniper shots at the volunteers, hitting one man in the left arm.
Such was the ragged nature of fighting in the Bald Hills. The Wintoon phase eventually drew to a close as the volunteer troops' skirmishes were aided by the ultimate artillery: Mother Nature. A torrential rainfall and subsequent deluge in January 1859 soaked the Mad River country until the Wintoon were starved from their forest hide-outs. With each new rancheria found in the spring, the volunteers encountered little resistance from the famished Indians. Hundreds of prisoners were shipped to Mendocino. The state disbanded the volunteer companies, figuring the majority of hostile tribesmen were now displaced.
Yet by the time Colonel Lippitt was once more attempting Indian removal, many Wintoon had already deserted the Mendocino reservation, stirring up other tribes likewise agitated by massacres like the one at Indian Island. Anti-settler violence returned: in one reported incident the female cook at a ranch was killed and burned, with neighboring homes ransacked, hit-and-run attacks being common against the rural farmsteads. "Property was constantly destroyed, and there was no safety for settlers outside the populous districts."
By 1863 the local tribes effectively controlled huge sections of Klamath, Trinity and Humboldt Counties, leaving settler communities cut off from one another. Along the Trinity River, one account wrote, "Every house in one of the most thickly-settled districts on the river, for a distance of twenty miles along the stream, was sacked and burned."
The State Legislature finally authorized a new volunteer battalion, drawn from local men who could now count on state arms, pay and supplies to properly equip them, courtesy of a special county-level tax. These hard men knew the land and the enemy far better than the federal or state troops from outside the northern counties, who had ineffectively maintained garrisons across Northern California for the past several years. The resulting campaign, beginning in the fall of 1863, is known as the Two Years' War.
In December 1863 a company of volunteers laid siege to an Indian fort made of logs and guarding spring water at Bald Mountain. After taking heavy sniping, they retreated, but were replaced by two other companies, which fired away at the fort with a howitzer. By the time the three volunteer companies regrouped the following morning, the fort's inhabitants had slipped away.

HEADLINE: Decision to Run Marathon Divides a City

BYLINE: MARY PILON


HIGHLIGHT: A roundup of reaction to the decision to run the New York City Marathon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. 

 BODY:
Emotions on the question of whether the New York City Marathon should go on Sunday in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy continued to run high, as runners, fans and New Yorkers voiced their opinion on the polarizing issue.
By Friday morning, some 500 commenters had weighed in on Ken Belson's article about the continued preparations for the event in the wake of the storm. A "Cancel the 2012 NYC Marathon" Facebook group started by Michelle Cleary of Staten Island had over 25,000 "likes" two days before the race was to be run.
As a Staten Islander who was w/o power & has family who lost SO much, I am appalled the #NYCM is happening. But I do NOT fault the runners
- Michele Gonzalez (@nycrunningmama)2 Nov 12
"I would love for them to figure out a better way to use volunteers," Cleary said in a phone interview on Thursday. "I think postponing it is an option. Either way, the efforts need to be diverted to help the recovery."
Organizers with New York Road Runners and many runners who stopped by the Expo at the Javits Center said that they supported the race and that it had the potential to unify a city that has been in recovery mode since the storm devastated the region. Many of the runners, who have spent months training for the event, said the race could be a powerful unifying moment.
The cover of The New York Post on Friday morning blasted the race with the headline "Abuse of Power," and an editorial in the paper called for the event to be canceled. In her online Leading Off column in The New York Times on Thursday, Lynn Zinser wrote that she opposed the decision to keep the marathon on: "For some reason, the uplifting value of the New York City Marathon, however, is so off the charts in Bloomberg World that nothing trumps diverting countless police and sanitation resources to marathon duty, even when parts of the metropolitan area lie in ruins and the city is mired in transportation hell."
Hosting the marathon "feels like an unnecessarily stressful move beset by very legitimate questions," Jason Gay of The Wall Street Journal wrote. "Is this race really in the best interest of a damaged city? This is not a playoff game at Yankee Stadium - it's a sprawling, cross-city undertaking."
The thing about the marathon outrage is this: New Yorkers love the race. They get why it matters. They just don't get why it matters Sunday.
- Jason Gay (@jasonWSJ)2 Nov 12
In response to the storm, New York Road Runners announced Thursday that it had created the 2012 ING New York City Marathon Race to Recover Fund and would donate $26.20 for each of the more than 40,000 runners organizers expect to participate in the race, a sum that could be over $1 million. The mayor and other officials have said that the race will not divert resources from the recovery efforts.
Only time will tell if that's enough to temper the anger of commenters on NYTimes.com. Readers there voiced their anger about runners displacing those without power or water who have flocked to hotels, the drain on police resources and the morality of the move. Others, however, raised concerns about the implications of canceling the race on the local economy.
"I see both sides," one commenter wrote. "But many of those who are angry are forgetting that this event is not just about the runners but about the collective support and alliance demonstrated by the spectators as well."
Jeff, a commenter in New York said: "It just felt right under the circumstances in 2001 - a show of hopefulness, resilience, defiance of those who would destroy us - and it just feels wrong this year - frivolous in the face of tragedy."
"To cancel is a loser for everyone," Chris Bergertron said in a comment. "And even those most affected by storm fallout recognize, if they have any stake in the city's future beyond seeking attention for current inconveniences, the marathon brings in money and hope."

HEADLINE: This Sunday: Man-Made Devastation vs. Natural

BYLINE: HUGO LINDGREN


HIGHLIGHT: The photos in Sunday's magazine of the stretch between New York and Washington that got whacked by Hurricane Sandy don't reveal anything about the hardship and heroics of the last week. But they do tell a powerful story about how the American economy has evolved over the last 50 years. 

 BODY:
Sometimes in journalism your work is overtaken by unpredictable events, and this has been one of those times at the magazine. The cover photo essay in this week's issue is about an area of the United States, the stretch between New York and Washington, that got whacked by Hurricane Sandy. But because we put this package together and sent it to our printer in the week before the storm, you won't see any evidence of Sandy in the pictures. Some readers may find that distracting initially, but these pictures deserve a long, close look. Although they don't reveal anything about the hardship and heroics of the last week, they do tell a powerful story about how the American economy has evolved over the last 50 years.
The photo essay was organized around the Amtrak route that links New York and D.C. If you've been on that train any time in recent years, you know it's regularly jammed with well-dressed professionals, many of whom are engaged in the lucrative, growing trades that link government and business. Meanwhile, the scenery outside the windows is filled with strange juxtapositions - natural beauty and suburban tranquility, pockets of fresh economic activity and an awful lot of dramatic post-industrial carnage. Massive abandoned factories. Blocks upon blocks of boarded-up homes. Heaps of smashed concrete and wrecked cars.
No hurricane, no natural force against which human efforts are futile, did this damage. This is the work of our economy.
Into this landscape, we sent Pieter Hugo, a South African photographer skilled at finding humanity even in the bleakest circumstances. He took the pictures for Barry Bearak's 2011 magazine story about a videotaped murder in the Diepsloot settlement in Johannesburg, as well as producing an unforgettable series of images from 2010 about a waste dump for computer equipment in Ghana.
This mid-Atlantic corridor used to be one of the most productive manufacturing areas in the world, and many vital goods and services are still generated there. There just happen to be many fewer jobs for workers who lack specialized skills. Hugo's brief was simple - connect with the people caught up in an economy that has changed faster than they can change themselves. This has been a kind of devastating storm, one that's lasted 40 years.
The fact that we are running Hugo's pictures on the eve of the election is no accident. They dramatize the cruel mismatch between a growing number of working-class people and the jobs that our economy creates, a political problem that has festered for decades, through Republican and Democratic administrations in Washington, though neither presidential candidate has seen the advantage in making an issue of it. As Adam Davidson writes in his essay accompanying Hugo's picture, when it comes to speaking to Americans about real threats to their way of life, Pakistan is a safer subject to talk about.

HEADLINE: Comparing Recessions and Recoveries

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at how the job losses and subsequent gains of the last five years compare with job numbers during and after previous downturns. 

 BODY:
The Labor Department delivered some decent news today, reporting that the nation's employers added 171,000 jobs in October, plus 84,000 more jobs in August and September than initially estimated. The unemployment ticked up a bit to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent, but that's because more people decided to join the labor force and so were newly counted as unemployed. 
Job gains were widespread across the private sector, led by professional and business services, health care and retail.
But employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level.
The chart above shows economywide job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones; the black line represents the current cycle. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has had a net decline of about 3 percent in its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not even account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession.
Getting the economy to 5 percent unemployment within two years -- a return to the rate that prevailed when the recession began -- would require job growth of closer to 280,000 per month.
There are now 12.3 million workers looking for work who cannot find it. The tally of those who are "underemployed" -- that is, adding in those workers who are part time but want to be employed full time, and workers who want to work but are not looking -- is an even larger 23 million. 
As bad as all these figures are, it's worth remembering that job markets in the decade following a financial crisis are always terrible. In fact, layoffs were far worse and lasted much longer in the aftermath of the financial crises that struck, for example, Finland and Sweden in 1991 and Spain in 1977, not to mention the United States during the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: Assessing the Impact of Health Care Reform on New Businesses In Massachusetts

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: You might think that the increased availability of health insurance would make it easier for entrepreneurs to quit jobs and start businesses -- but it's not easy to prove. 

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, when The Agenda discussed Jon Stewart's musings on creating a safety net for entrepreneurial risk-taking, we touched briefly on how health insurance reform might spur people to go out on a limb and open a new business. "What about the risk of, you're afraid to leave your job and be an entrepreneur because that's where your health insurance is?" Mr. Stewart asked his "Daily Show" guest, Austan Goolsbee, the former Obama administration economist.
That led to this question from an Agenda reader, Joyce Carpenter, who wrote that she lives near Boston: "Is there any data from Massachusetts to show that Romney-care a k a Obama-care would help mitigate the risk and encourage entrepreneurship?" Excellent question, Ms. Carpenter, and one we'll explore here. (Spoiler alert: the answer will be disappointingly murky.)
To begin to answer the question, you have to know first whether the health insurance legislation signed by Governor Mitt Romney in 2006 has in fact lowered the cost of individual insurance in Massachusetts enough to make it attractive to prospective entrepreneurs. That is according to Yasuyuki Motoyama, senior scholar at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which focuses on issues related to entrepreneurship. For this, Mr. Motoyama referred us to a study of the Massachusetts health insurance market by economists John Graves of Vanderbilt University and Jonathan Gruber of MIT. (As an adviser to then-Governor Romney, Mr. Gruber helped devise the Massachusetts health reform law.)
The study looked at the average premiums for non-group health insurance plans in each state from 2006, when Massachusetts began to implement the new law, through 2009. (The premium costs were compiled by the Association for Health Insurance Plans, a trade association.) In those years, the average cost of individual coverage grew by 14 percent across the country, but in Massachusetts, premiums fell by more than 21 percent. For family plans, the difference was even more stark: across the United States, premiums rose by around 13 percent; in Massachusetts, they fell by nearly 40 percent. "The estimates show enormous reductions in Massachusetts over this period relative to the national average," the study's authors wrote.
"There's no way - there's no way - that that health care law doesn't free people up to start their own companies," said Robert Nakosteen, a professor at the Isenberg School of Management of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. "It's absolutely certain, to a 100-percent degree of probability, that the health care law in Massachusetts has created an environment where individuals can quit their jobs to take the risk to start new companies."
There is also, however, no way to verify this with a look at data. According to figures from the Census Bureau, entrepreneurs in Massachusetts and across the country created more new companies in each year from 2002 to 2006, but the rate of growth in new Massachusetts companies lagged far behind the rate for the entire United States -- and even behind the rate of growth in neighboring New Hampshire and Rhode Island. From 2006 to 2010, the last year for which figures are available, the number of companies under a year old recorded by the Census Bureau fell across the United States and in Massachusetts at roughly the same rate. In New Hampshire and Rhode Island, the rate of start-ups fell even faster.
Professor Michael Ash, chairman of the economics department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst sees a silver lining for the state in these figures. From 2002 to 2010, he said, "Massachusetts went from pretty weak performance to bad performance, but the U.S. and the rest of New England went from better-than-Massachusetts performance to worse-than-Massachusetts performance. Massachusetts bombed less than the other places."
On the other hand, this company-creation data can be read to suggest no linkage between the theoretical opportunity provided by portable and affordable health insurance and entrepreneurial activity. Connecticut performed roughly as Massachusetts did over the same periods -- but without a 2006 health care law. And when the numbers for new companies are expressed as a percentage of the total population, the per capita rate of new entrepreneurs in Massachusetts has lagged behind the whole of the United States since 2004.
"Whatever impact the Massachusetts health care act may have had on business start-ups has been washed away in the flood of the financial crisis and resulting recession," said Mr. Nakosteen in a follow-up email. "In recent years I think we are mostly seeing cyclical effects rather than anything that can be tied to a state policy."
This is why it is impossible - or perhaps irresponsible - to attempt to tease out any connections, or the absence of a connection, between any of these facts and the health care law, according to Mr. Nakosteen and every other economist we spoke with. There are just too many other variables at play, not least of which is the greatest economic calamity since the Depression. "This kind of impact research is really difficult to conduct, because you should have a clear intervention like the health care law, and you have to assume that no other factors are intervening," Mr. Motoyama said. "And in reality, that kind of hypothetical situation does not exist."
Mr. Gruber pointed out that many more small firms in Massachusetts now offer health insurance than did before the reform. "Beyond that," he said, "it's just theory."
But two authorities on entrepreneurship at Babson College, outside Boston, were skeptical of a link between the health law and start-ups. Donna Kelley said that studies of American entrepreneurs have found that "health insurance is one factor when it comes to entrepreneurship, but there are many factors, and this is a smaller factor."
"The health care affordability act is a small step in the right direction but not a complete solution," said Dennis Ceru, a professor who teaches entrepreneurship but also works with business owners as a consultant and as the head of a networking organization called The CEO's Group. "It seems like it has helped a little bit but not a great deal. There are still all of the taxes, and small- to medium-sized businesses still have difficulty obtaining bank loans or other funding."

HEADLINE: Misunderestimating Spain

BYLINE: JONATHAN BLITZER


HIGHLIGHT: To suggest, as Mitt Romney does, that Spain's current woes are due to government profligacy is to take the wrong lesson from its experience and risk making its problems worse. 

 BODY:
MADRID - Never before has Spain been so central to an American presidential election, Spanish newspapers have been marveling. The country's prominence in the U.S. campaign, the result of its protracted recession and soaring unemployment, is painfully unprecedented: Mitt Romney first mentioned Spain in the opening presidential debate, then last week it was President Barack Obama. 
Romney has held up the country as an example of how high taxes and excessive government spending can precipitate financial ruin. Obama, for his part, has suggested that the Spanish government and the European Union acted too slowly after the country's massive real-estate bubble burst. These divergent appraisals track the two candidates' contrasting political platforms: Obama thinks government should facilitate economic recovery; Romney wants to limit its reach through unstinting budget cuts.
Romney's view of the country is alarmingly confused, and yet it reflects a wider misunderstanding about what happened in Spain and what needs to be done to fix the situation.
Spain's economic plight was never the result of excessive government spending. In 2007 Spain had among the lowest percentages of outstanding debt to GDP in the euro zone [pdf]. Between 1999 and 2007 the Spanish government was a lone exemplar in the European Union for keeping its annual borrowing to 3 percent of economic output, as required by the 1997 Stability and Growth Pact. (This is an agreement, incidentally, that Germany, the chief proponent of austerity on the Continent today, had pushed for but broke repeatedly during the same period.)
Still, as Spain's economy has contracted, international credit-rating agencies and foreign investors have saddled it with exceedingly high borrowing costs. There is a specific reason for this. All along the problem was the private, not the public, sector. With the creation of the euro and the easing of interest rates, a torrent of capital from northern Europe flooded into Spain during the boom years of the early 2000s. Companies and mortgage buyers, riding the tide, took out sizeable loans that then proved virtually impossible to pay back.
Of course, years of plenty also brought excess and unscrupulousness in the public and private sectors. Much-needed reforms in the labor market - to counteract inflated wages and chronically high unemployment - were delayed because of political shortsightedness and self-congratulation over the "Spanish miracle," not just in Spain but also in Europe and abroad.
That giddiness is central to this story: private enterprise was celebrated during periods of runaway expansion, and when growth finally petered out the blame was laid at the feet of the public sector. Yet to suggest, as Romney does, that Spain's current woes are due to government profligacy is to take exactly the wrong lesson from its experience and risk making its problems worse.
The more the government slashes spending to lower Spain's crisis-swollen deficit, the deeper the spiral of recession. If Spain is an example of anything, it is an example of the need to combat unemployment and provide relief to the hardest-hit.
One obstacle, however, is that the European Union has militated against the kind of intervention that would most help. Much like Florida several years ago, Spain experienced a massive housing bubble that went on to burst. But if Florida managed to limp through the aftermath thanks to U.S. federal aid, Spain is getting no such support from the Union.
Spain's relevance to American political rhetoric these days stems partly from a growing worry in the United States that recession-addled Europe will set back the U.S. economic recovery. A greater danger, though, is that the misbegotten orthodoxy on austerity, which by now should be seen as a failure, might still pass as a credible policy on either side of the Atlantic.

HEADLINE: R.B.S. Expects Fine Over Libor Investigation

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Friday that it would probably face financial penalties connected to the rate-rigging investigation, as the British bank reported a net loss in the third quarter of the year. 

 BODY:
 8:53 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON -- Royal Bank of Scotland said on Friday that it would probably face financial penalties connected to a broad investigation into rate-rigging, as the bank reported a net loss in the third quarter of the year.
The bank, which is 81 percent owned by the British government after receiving a bailout during the recent financial crisis, is the latest British firm to disclose legal troubles this week.
On Wednesday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the United States recommended a $470 million fine against Barclays related to past energy trading activity in the firm's North American operations. The bank said it would defend itself against the allegations. Barclays and a local rival, the Lloyds Banking Group, also disclosed that they had set aside additional money to compensate clients who had been inappropriately sold insurance.
 Royal Bank of Scotland's legal woes relate to a broad industry investigation into potential rate-rigging. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department and other authorities around the world are looking into whether big banks tried to influence benchmark rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle charges that it tried to manipulate Libor to improve profits and make its financial position look stronger. 
Royal Bank of Scotland, which is based in Edinburgh, said on Friday that it expected to enter into negotiations with authorities about a potential settlement in the near future. The firm's chief executive, Stephen Hester, declined to say when those talks might begin or how big the potential fine could be. Mr. Hester said the that bank was likely to make an announcement over the matter before reporting its next earnings on Feb. 28.
"We have to dance to the tune of the relevant regulators," Mr. Hester said in a conference call with journalists.
Royal Bank of Scotland faces a broader set of troubles. 
On Friday, the bank said it posted a net loss of £1.4 billion, or $2.3 billion, in the three months through Sept. 30 after setting aside more money to compensate customers who were inappropriately sold insurance and taking a charge on its own debt. The bank reported a £1.2 billion net profit in the same period last year after it benefited from a financial gain on its own debt. 
Without the adjustments, its pretax profit in the third quarter rose to just over £1 billion, compared with £2 million in the same period last year.
Analysts said Royal Bank of Scotland had made great strides to reduce its exposure to risky assets and pare back its balance sheet since the financial crisis began. Yet continued weakness in its underlying performance, coupled with expected future losses in the fourth quarter related to one-off charges like a potential Libor fine, remains a concern.
"The management has made good progress," said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec Securities in London. "But for me, the bank's earnings outlook hasn't improved."
Royal Bank of Scotland shares fell 1 percent in morning trading in London. Stock in the bank has risen almost 22 percent so far this year.
The British bank said it had made a new provision of £400 million to reimburse clients who were sold payment protection insurance, which covered customers if they were laid off or became ill. Many customers did not know they had been sold the insurance when they took out loans or mortgages. Others have found it difficult to make claims on the policies, which often paid out only small amounts.
In total, the bank said it had now set aside a combined £1.7 billion to compensate customers. Britain's banks, including Barclays and HSBC, have made total provisions worth almost £11 billion to reimburse clients, and analysts say that figure may rise to £15 billion.
"All of the banks have been guilty of underestimating the response rate," to payment protection insurance, Bruce Van Saun, chief financial officer of R.B.S., told reporters on Friday.
In an effort to repay the British government's bailout, the bank has been trying to sell assets and raise additional cash. Last month, the firm earned £787 million through the initial public offering of its insurance unit Direct Line. The bank failed to sell a number of its branches in Britain for around £1.7 billion, however, after Banco Santander of Spain backed out of the deal.
Despite the tough economic conditions across Europe, the bank said pretax profit in its investment banking unit reached £295 million in the third quarter, compared with a £348 million net loss during the same period last year. The bank has been scaling bank its risky trading activities through actions like closing or selling its cash equities unit and spinning off of its advisory business. 
The number of employees in the investment banking division fell 5 percent, to 11,900, in the three months through Sept. 30. Earlier this year, the bank said it planned to layoff around 3,500 people in the unit.
The bank's retail and commercial banking unit continued to suffer from weak consumer confidence related to the European debt crisis. Pretax profit in the division fell 7 percent, to £1.1 billion, in the third quarter.
An earlier version of the story incorrectly state that Barclays settled over the rate-rigging investigation in July. It settled the matter in June.

HEADLINE: Q.&A. on Forecasting Based on Voter Expectations

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with Justin Wolfers, co-author of a recent study concluding that who voters think will win is a more reliable predictor of the outcome than asking them how they plan to vote. 

 BODY:
A new academic study concludes that poll questions about expectations - which ask people whom they think will win - have historically been better guides to the outcome of presidential elections than traditional questions about people's preferences. From my article about the study, by David Rothschild and Justin Wolfers, and the reaction to it:
Most recently, Mitt Romney won the Republican nomination despite at various points trailing other candidates - Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, Rick Perry - in polls of Republican voters' preferences. Even when Mr. Romney was behind, Republicans typically told pollsters that they expected him to win the nomination .
In presidential races since 1952, the expectations question has pointed to the winner in 81 percent of states, based on data from the American National Election Studies. The question about voting intentions pointed to the winner in 69 percent.
Below is a lightly edited interview with Mr. Wolfers, conducted by e-mail, focusing on the implications of the study for current presidential polls.
 Q. 
 In the article, I discussed only briefly the expectations polls about the 2012 race, and some of the Twitter feedback was eager for more. By my count, there have been five recent major polls asking people whom they expect to win - by ABC/Washington Post, Gallup, Politico/George Washington University, New York Times/CBS News, and the University of Connecticut. There is also sixth from Rand asking people the percentage chances they place on each candidate winning. How consistent are the polls? 
 A. 
There's a striking consistency in how people are responding to these polls. The most recent data are from the Gallup poll conducted Oct. 27-28, and they found 54 percent of adults expect Obama to win, versus 34 percent for Romney. Around the same time (Oct. 25-28), there was a comparable New York Times/CBS poll in which 51 percent of likely voters expect Obama to win, versus 34 percent for Romney.
But these results aren't just stable across pollsters, they've also been quite stable over the past few weeks, even as the race appeared to tighten for a while. Politico and George Washington University ran a poll of likely voters on Oct. 22-25, finding 54 percent expect Obama to win, versus 36 percent for Romney. The University of Connecticut/Hartford Courant poll of likely voters got a somewhat higher share not venturing an answer, with 47 percent expecting Obama to win versus 33 percent for Romney. Finally, the ABC/Washington Post poll of registered voters run Oct. 10-13 found 56 percent expect Obama to win, compared to 35 percent for Romney.
I'm rather surprised by the similarities here - across time, across pollsters, across how they word the question, and across different survey populations (likely voters, registered voters, or adults) - but I suspect that is part of the nature of the question. You just don't see the noise here that you see in the barrage of polls of voter intentions, which are extremely sensitive to all of these factors.
I always throw out the folks who don't have an opinion, and count the proportions as a share of only those who have an opinion. By this measure, the proportion who expect Obama to win is: 61 percent (Gallup), 60 percent (The New York Times), 60 percent (Politico), 59 percent (Hartford Courant), 62 percent (ABC). The corresponding proportions who expect Romney to win are: 39 percent, 40 percent, 40 percent, 41 percent and 38 percent. Taking an average across all these polls: 60.3 percent expect Obama to win. Or if you prefer that I focus only on the freshest two polls, 60.7 percent expect him to win.
 Q. 
 The results do seem have tightened somewhat since the first debate, which Romney was widely seen to have won, right? Do the patterns - or lack of patterns - in the numbers help solve the issue of what most people are thinking of when they answer the expectation question: Private information (their friends' voting plans, yard signs in their neighborhood, etc.) or public information (media coverage, speeches, etc.)? 
 A. 
The results of the polls of voter intentions seem to have tightened a bit since the first debate. There's an interesting school of thought in political science that basically says: voters are pretty predictable. But they don't think too hard about how they're going to vote until right before the election. So what happens is that public opinion through time just converges to where it "should" be. And viewed through this lens, the first debate was just an opportunity for people who really should always have been in Romney's camp to figure out that they're in Romney's camp.
So why did the expectations polls move less sharply than intentions polls? One possibility is that your expectations are explicitly forward-looking, and perhaps people saw the race tightening as they saw that some of the support for Obama was a bit soft. Let me put this another way: There are two problems with how we usually ask folks how they plan to vote. First, the question captures the state of public opinion today, while the expectations question effectively asks you where you think public opinion is going. And second, polls typically demand a yes or no answer, when the reality may be that we know that our support is pretty weak, and it may change, or we aren't even sure whether we'll turn up to the polls. The virtue of asking about expectations is that you can think about each of your friends, and think not just about who they're supporting today, but also whether they may change their minds in the future.
I worry that it sounds a bit like I haven't answered your question, but that's because I don't have a super-sharp answer. If I had to summarize, it would be: expectations questions allow you to think about how the dynamics of the race may change, and so they are less sensitive to that change when it happens.
 Q. 
 Based on your research and the current polls, what does the expectations question suggest is the most likely outcome on Tuesday? 
 A. 
If a majority expects Obama to win, then right there, it says that I'm forecasting an Obama victory.
But by how much? Here's where it gets tricky. The fact that 60 percent of people think that Obama is going to win doesn't mean that he's going to win 60 percent of the votes. And it doesn't mean that he's a 60 percent chance to win. Rather, it simply says that given the information they have, 60 percent of people believe that Obama is going to win. Can we use this to say anything about his likely winning margin?
Yes. I'll spare you the details of the calculation, but it says that if 60.3 percent of people expect Obama to beat Romney, then we can forecast that he'll win about 52.5 percent of the two-party vote. That would be a solid win, though not as impressive as his seven-point win in 2008.
The proportion who expect Obama to win right now looks awfully similar to the proportion who expected George W. Bush to win in a Gallup Poll at a similar point in 2004. Ultimately Bush won 51.2 percent of the two-party vote.
Right now, Nate Silver is predicting that Obama will win 50.5 percent of the popular vote, and Romney 48.6 percent. As a share of the two-party vote, this says he's forecasting Obama to win 51 percent of the vote. Now Silver's approach aggregates responses from hundreds of thousands of survey respondents, while I have far fewer, so his estimate still deserves a lot of respect. I don't want to overstate the confidence with which I'm stating my forecast. So let me put it this way: My approach says that it's likely that Obama will outperform the forecasts of poll-based analysts like Silver.
 We'll find out soon enough. Thanks.

HEADLINE: Berkshire to Buy Oriental Trading Company

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: With the holidays approaching, Warren E. Buffett has found a way to stock up on all the elf hats and reindeer paper plates anyone could ever need: by buying an 80-year-old retailer overflowing with them. 

 BODY:
 8:10 p.m. | Updated 
With the holidays approaching, Warren E. Buffett has found a way to stock up on elf hats and reindeer paper plates: by buying an 80-year-old retailer overflowing with them.
On Friday, Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, agreed to buy the Oriental Trading Company, acquiring a catalog-based arts-and-crafts company whose wares include Santa doorknob kits and a color-your-own Christmas photo holder. Berkshire paid about $500 million, according to people briefed on the matter.
"Oriental Trading is a leader in its industry, has a strong management team and delivers exceptional customer value and service," Mr. Buffett said in a statement. "We are delighted to have them join the Berkshire Hathaway family and continue their quest to make the world more fun."
The deal signals the end to a series of ownership changes for Oriental Trading, which has been passed among private equity firms and retooled under bankruptcy protection. Its current owners include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which took a big stake in it during the Chapter 11 process.
Oriental Trading was founded in 1932 by Harry Watanabe, a Japanese immigrant in Omaha who found a profitable niche in selling Kewpie dolls and other trinkets through local stores and carnivals.
His son, Terry, expanded the business enormously by bolstering a catalog business that drew in direct sales to churches and schools. Terry Watanabe sold Oriental Trading to Brentwood Associates in 2000. Six years later, Brentwood sold it to the Carlyle Group for $1 billion. K.K.R. had also looked at buying the company through its private equity unit, but was outbid.
Soon afterward, however, Oriental Trading struggled with both rising mailing costs and the recession, as well as the enormous amount of debt that was placed on the company. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, prompting K.K.R.'s special situations team to consider expanding upon a small investment in the retailer's debt. The division specializes in investing in distressed companies, usually by buying debt or providing rescue financing. It currently oversees about $2 billion.
Early in 2011, the unit bought up what eventually became one-third of Oriental Trading's first-lien debt, putting K.K.R. in line to take control by converting its holdings into equity. Using knowledge gleaned by the leveraged buyout side years earlier, the team decided that the retailer appeared headed for a recovery and would make an attractive investment.
"In our view the business was stabilizing and starting to turn positive," Jamie Weinstein, a co-head of the special situations group, said in an interview. "That was a different view from a lot of distressed investors at the time."
In recent months, K.K.R. and the company's other owners, Par IV Capital Management and the Crescent Capital Group, decided to look for a potential exit, according to people briefed on the process. Oriental Trading hired Lazard as an adviser to reach out to potential buyers, including Berkshire.
Given Mr. Buffett's aversion to bidding in auctions, bankers showed Berkshire a number for a potential deal, one of these people said. He accepted.
The deal has been a good one for K.K.R., which should earn twice its initial investment, according to the people briefed on the process.
Jeremiah Lane, another member of the K.K.R. team, said in a statement: "Over the past two years the company has transitioned to steady growth, both top and bottom line, and there is no question the company has a bright future as part of the Berkshire Hathaway enterprise."

HEADLINE: Republican Angst Over European Election Monitors

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have been monitoring U.S. elections for a decade. This year, however, conservatives have expressed concern about the presence of watchdogs from the old Continent. 

 BODY:
LONDON - American voters have been alerted to be on the lookout for sinister strangers lurking near polling places next Tuesday. They may be part of a crack team sent from Europe to snoop on the election.
The authorities in Texas and Iowa have warned that the foreigners could be arrested on sight if they approach a polling place, and a senior Georgia official has said that anyone who sees something improper going on should report it immediately.
The prospect of outsiders - from Europe of all places - attempting to interfere in the democratic process sounds like the stuff of conservative American nightmares.
It turns out, however, that European observers have been present at U.S. national elections for a decade, since President George W. Bush first invited them in.
This year's visitors are members of an election monitoring team from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 56-nation grouping of which the United States is a member.
The international team, led by a Dutch diplomat, has been on the ground since early October. The organization's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, based in Warsaw, monitors elections worldwide to ensure they are fair. As in previous election years, it has received an official invitation from the United States.
Most U.S. officials have taken a relaxed attitude to the Europeans' presence. A pair of observers looked in on Kansas last month but was not expected back. 
"I looked at it as some Europeans that were curious at how we succeed in doing what we do, by holding free and open elections," Bruce Newby, the Wyandotte county election commissioner, said.
Some officials have been less understanding. 
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, wrote to Daan Everts, head of the 57-member observer mission, to warn him that "the O.S.C.E.'s representatives are not authorized by Texas law to enter a polling place. It may be a criminal offense for O.S.C.E.'s representatives to maintain a presence within 100 feet of a polling place's entrance."
Conservatives are concerned that the Europeans have been in touch with civil rights groups, which have told the monitors of a coordinated political effort to disenfranchise millions of Americans through a campaign of voter suppression in what is expected to be a very close election.
Greta Van Susteren of the right-leaning Fox News complained: "The election is none of their business. We ought to be able to police our own election."
That may have reflected a natural resistance to seeing the United States being put under the spotlight by an organization that includes the likes of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.
The controversy over the O.S.C.E. presence might nevertheless have been heightened this year by a tone of Europe-bashing in the campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger.
In his latest swipe at the old Continent, Mr. Romney was quoted as telling a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, this week:
If you're an entrepreneur and you're thinking of starting up a business, you need to ask yourself: Is America on the same road as Greece? Are we on the path to an economic crisis like that we're seeing in Europe, in Italy and Spain?
It cannot have helped the Republican mood that opinion polls consistently show Europeans would overwhelmingly choose President Obama if they had the vote. (My colleague Mark McDonald wrote on Rendezvous last week that the feeling is global.)
Bruce Walker, a commentator for The American Thinker, gave a conservative view of the Continent in a column on Friday. "Our next president will have a very important task: dealing with the looming disaster which is Europe," he wrote.
Portraying a region afflicted by debt, separatism and Muslim immigration, he warned: "The potential disaster of a complete meltdown of Europe will affect our nation in ways that ought to alarm all Americans."

HEADLINE: Bad Barbecue? Blame Obama

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Did the government kill Bill's BBQ? Or was it just the free market? 

 BODY:
The government, it's been said, can't create jobs; but it can destroy family-owned barbecue joints.
Scouring swing states for misery, the Romney campaign came across the tale of Bill's Barbecue, an 82-year-old Richmond, VA chain that closed in September-because of President Obama. Or so a new ad claims: "Bill's Barbecue couldn't take four years under President Obama. Can we afford four more?"
At a campaign stop in West Allis, Wisconsin this morning, Mitt Romney provided more specifics: "I met Rhoda Elliott. She has been running her family restaurants for years, a business that has been in her family for 83 years. At its high point, she employed 200 people. She just closed it down. And she told me that regulations and taxes, 'Obamacare' and the effects of the Obama economy put her out of business."

So that's one explanation for why Bill's went out of business: Government regulation. (The death panelists don't like pulled pork.) It's not the only one. Some Richmond locals have suggested that, in truth, Bill's was just another victim of the free market-i.e., its competitors offered a better product.
An editor of Richmond Magazine, Brandon Fox, tweeted yesterday "And all over Richmond can be heard the wail, 'But Bill's Barbecue went out of business because it was crap!'" Less brusquely, Mark Holmberg, reporting for a local CBS affiliate, said "The service wasn't real friendly or brisk, the prices a little big for small sandwiches. The places on the Boulevard didn't feel clean-they felt old, tired. I had a hard time figuring out when the Myers Street store was open. There were health code violations, although not too extreme." 
He added, "It's a tough, risky business, which is why restaurants close every day. While Bill's was struggling, Alamo BBQ opened in Church Hill three years ago. It's been thriving in what was once a rather tough business location."
If Mr. Obama gets the blame for Bill's, perhaps he deserves credit for Alamo BBQ? No, Mr. Romney would surely respond, only a Marxist would suggest, as the president once did, that if you've got a business, you didn't build it alone.
Mr. Romney's take on Bill's seems perfectly representative of his general outlook. If a business succeeds, the government can't share the credit. If it fails, it's the government's fault.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Romney Is Being Dishonest About Auto Bailout

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama, returning to full-throttle campaign mode after a week upended by the East Coast storm, accused Mitt Romney on Friday of dishonesty in saying that the auto bailout had resulted in jobs moving to China. 

 BODY:
HILLIARD, Ohio - President Obama, returning to full-throated campaign mode after a week upended by Hurricane Sandy, accused Mitt Romney on Friday of dishonesty in claiming that his administration's auto bailout had resulted in jobs moving to China.
Speaking to 2,800 people in a cavernous barn here, Mr. Obama took aim at Mr. Romney for an advertisement his campaign aired in Ohio, which said that Chrysler, under new Italian owners, moved Jeep production to China after being bailed out by the Obama administration in 2009.
"That's not true," Mr. Obama said as the crowd chanted "liar." "Everybody knows it's not true. The car companies themselves have told Governor Romney to knock it off."
The ad, the president said, amounted to a cynical ploy to compensate for the fact that Mr. Romney opposed the bailout. "This isn't a game; these are people's jobs, these are people's lives," he said.
Saying that the commercial had rattled some employees at the Jeep plant in Toledo, Mr. Obama said, "You don't scare hard-working Americans just to scare up some votes."
Mr. Obama's counterattack kicked off a day of barnstorming in a state where he is fighting to cling to a narrow, but stubborn, lead in the polls against a strong offensive by Mr. Romney, who plans a last-minute bus tour in the state over the weekend.
In the final days of the campaign, the escalating confrontation over the auto bailout has dominated headlines and news coverage in Ohio and Michigan.
Mr. Romney's campaign countered the president's criticism by insisting that its ad was accurate.
"The facts are clear: despite his false and misleading attacks, President Obama took the auto companies into bankruptcy," said a campaign spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg. "His mismanagement of the process has exposed taxpayers to a $25 billion loss. And these companies are expanding production overseas."
Ms. Henneberg said the United States had lost 586,000 manufacturing jobs during Mr. Obama's presidency.
The president was buoyed by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday. "This morning we learned that companies hired more workers in October than at any time in the last eight months," Mr. Obama said, while acknowledging, as he always does, that more work remains.
Mr. Obama was also still riding the crest of endorsements by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City, the former secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, and a trip to New Jersey, where the Republican governor, Chris Christie, heaped praise on his response to the storm.
But the show of bipartisan harmony in New Jersey on Wednesday seemed a world away from this chilly Midwestern fairground, where even the minister who offered the religious invocation, Dr. Marilyn Miller, jabbed Mr. Romney for his remarks about the 47 percent.
Warming up the crowd, former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio characterized a canned-goods drive that Mr. Romney held in Dayton for storm victims as a cynical photo opportunity.
"Let me say something about Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan: they don't even know how to fake compassion," said Mr. Strickland, who has emerged as one of Mr. Obama's most pugilistic surrogates.
Urging the audience to vote, Mr. Strickland said Ohio was "the firewall for President Obama." So much attention has been lavished here in the waning days of this election that it sometimes seems like the candidates have been wooing Ohio one voter at a time.
This was the first rally on a day that will take Mr. Obama to Ohio's nooks and crannies. From Hilliard, a farming town of 28,435 northwest of Columbus, he will travel by motorcade, helicopter, and Air Force One to Springfield and Lima for speeches at two high schools.
The Obama campaign has projected steadfast confidence that it will hold on to Ohio, citing polls that show Mr. Obama ahead by a nearly two-to-one margin among the 23 percent of registered voters who have already cast ballots.
If those numbers are accurate, the campaign said, Mr. Romney would have to run up a margin of 54 percent on Election Day just to tie with Mr. Obama. The Romney campaign insists that Democrats are performing below their early-voting levels in 2008, while Republicans are outperforming.

HEADLINE: Romney's Closing Argument: 'Look to the Record'

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO and ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In what his aides called Mitt Romney's closing argument to electorate after 18 months of bruising politics, he asked that Americans "look to the record, the accomplishments and failures, and the judgment." 

 BODY:
WEST ALLIS, Wis.-At the start of a frenetic final weekend of campaigning, Mitt Romney put on a suit and tie, flipped on a teleprompter and did something on Friday that he had avoided for much of the past two years: he made an explicit case for his own lengthy résumé.
He bragged about running the Olympic Games. He waxed about his time as governor of Massachusetts. He brought up Bain Capital(albeit not by name), the wildly lucrative and occasionally controversial private equity firm he founded.
"I started a business from scratch and helped make it successful; that's not easy," Mr. Romney said as a crowd of 4,000 inside a warehouse here applauded his C.E.O.-ness.
As he embarked on a wearying three-day, six-state campaign swing, Mr. Romney urged voters in the battleground state of Wisconsin to judge him on his accomplishments in the private sector and his record in government, arguing that he offered deeper experience and a greater commitment to bipartisanship than President Obama.
"President Obama promised change, but he could not deliver it," Mr. Romney said. "I promise change, and I have a record of achieving it."
After weeks of rallies at high school fields and factory floors, Mr. Romney's speech here had a formality and sweep that are frequently missing from his day-to-day campaigning.
He dropped many of the warm, personal stories that have become a staple of his stump speech: one about his sister, Lynn, that celebrates single mothers and another about the Boy Scouts that exemplifies Americans' patriotic spirit.
In their place, he named specific pieces of legislation that he would introduce in office, including what he called the Retraining Reform Act, a bill to consolidate dozens of federal job training programs that he considers redundant and inefficient.
With its heavy emphasis on biography and readiness, his speech was a departure from a style of campaigning that has relied heavily on stinging attacks on Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney seems to have farmed out his most withering attacks to his campaign advertising team, which is under fire for a commercial that makes the misleading claim that Mr. Obama is seeking to export American auto jobs to China.
After surging in polls after the first presidential debate and turning the race into a virtual tie, Mr. Romney is grappling with a shifting political landscape. The economy is experiencing a recovery, however halting, and his opponent is enjoying a very public bipartisan embrace, most recently from a prominent Romney supporter, Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City, a high-profile independent.
Mr. Romney's message on Friday seemed intended to play offense on both of those fronts. He dismissed a federal jobs report, released Friday, that showed stronger-than-expected job growth, calling it stagnation. "Unemployment is higher today than when Barack Obama took office," he said in West Allis, just outside of Milwaukee.
Mr. Romney delivered a pointed rebuttal to the bipartisan images of his rival that millions of Americans have watched over the past few days on cable news.
Recalling Mr. Obama's promise in 2008 to transcend party politics, Mr. Romney insisted that the president had plunged the Capitol into an era of partisan politics, exemplified by his pursuit of a national health care overhaul.
"If the president were to be re-elected, he will not be able to work with Congress. I don't care what he says right now," Mr. Romney said. "We have four years of record to look at. And of course, he's burned a lot of bridges there. He ignores Congress, he attacks Congress, he demonizes Congress."
He offered himself up as a candidate with a proven record of reaching across the aisle, as governor of a largely Democratic state. He vowed to meet with Democrat lawmakers and their leaders in Congress personally if he is elected on Tuesday.
"I won't waste any time complaining about my predecessor," he said. "I won't spend my effort trying to pass partisan legislation unrelated to economic growth. From Day 1, I will go to work to help Americans get back to work."
But for a candidate who has studiously sidestepped specific references to his time in business, it was his emphasis on his corporate record that stood out.
He even mentioned his time as the temporary head of Bain Consulting, when the firm was plunged into financial turmoil. "I took the reins of another business that was in trouble and helped turn it around," he said. "That's real change."
Mr. Obama carried Wisconsin handily in 2008, and Mr. Romney has rarely campaigned here. But his standing in the state has been lifted by his selection of a Wisconsinite, Representative Paul D. Ryan, as his running mate, and polls now show the race to be neck and neck in the state. On Saturday, Mr. Romney will barnstorm across New Hampshire,Iowa and Colorado, all considered vital to his victory as he tries to cobble together 270 electoral votes on Tuesday.
But on Friday, Mr. Romney made sure to play to the local crowd. "It's good to be in the home state of the next vice president of the United States," he said to roaring cheers.
"Next to Ann Romney," he said, after a pause, "Paul Ryan is the best choice I ever made."

HEADLINE: Lessons from Sandy: Building with Resilience in Mind

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A look at ways to cut disaster losses before disasters occur. 

 BODY:
 | Many updates at bottom | 
Following up on my postexamining whether we're stuck with "blah, blah, blah, bang" disaster planning, here's a discussion of ways to plan and build with the worst in mind.
First, I hope you'll read "Hurricane Sandy's Real Lesson will we learn it?" -- a post by William H. Hooke, a senior policy fellow at the American Meteorological Society who's made the transition to online communication with more facility than some people half his age. (His Twitter feed is at @AMSpolicy; I found the post via Judith Curry.)
Here's an excerpt: 
The need for emergency response will never go away. But we shouldn't resign ourselves to the idea that emergencies will necessarily continue to grow in scope, number and impact, just because our society is growing in numbers, in property exposure, and in economic activity. We can grow our society's resilience to such events. We can reduce the geographical extent and the population adversely affected by future events. 
We actually have a shining example, one we can build on:
Commercial aviation. I've blogged on this before. Over the past fifty years, property loss to natural hazards has been growing exponentially. Experts (e.g., Roger Pielke, Jr. and his collaborators) have shown this to be the result of growing population and property exposure in hazardous areas. [See, for example, this link, or posts sprinkled among the entries in his blog, and the references therein.]
But it's also the result of a failure to learn from experience; an insistence on "rebuilding as before." By contrast, commercial air travel as measured by takeoffs and landings has quadrupled over the same half-century, but the number of flight-related accidents has remained constant over that period or even declined. That's because of a remarkable public-private partnership on the part of the airlines and the FAA, and because of the catalytic role played by a small but vital independent federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB mantra is not "the wing fell off this airplane, but we're going to rebuild it as before", but rather "What called this accident? We have to make sure it never happens again." 
We need an analog to the NTSB for natural hazards. Each catastrophe should trigger a national conversation, not just at the federal but also state and local levels along the lines of "what can our community here learn from what happened (over there)?" And that conversation should lead to a set of mutually-supportive private- and public-sector actions to build resilience at the community level and reduce future risk.
So that's one step we can take. Here's a second one.
Today we routinely file environmental impact statements detailing the implications for the environment of this or that undertaking (a new strip mine, an agricultural start-up, another airport, a landfill you can supply any one of thousands of examples). We should similarly file statements indicating the impact of real estate development; the construction of buildings, dams, and levees; and other major projects - on the increased vulnerability to hazards they will impose on others. In this politically polarized climate, this will seem to many like another unwanted federal "taking," but why should my freedom extend to building a levee to protect my property that will increase the risk to your property downstream on that same river? Shouldn't I have to consult you? The requirement for Environmental Impact Statements prompted numerous complaints at the time, but today, we've internalized the process. It's an accepted part of doing business. And it's the right thing to do. That's the similar intent of the No-Adverse-Impact policy advice of the Association of State Floodplain Managers.
A third step? Let's get the public- and private-sectors to the table to talk strategically about how they can continue to work together to reduce disaster losses in this country. Many companies these days have business continuity plans. They know what they have to do to keep their doors open in the face of disasters. And they take those actions as best they can. But the companies can't execute those plans if as result of the disaster their employees lose homes and either can't make it to work or are preoccupied with domestic problems. And those open stores won't do any business if their customers' communities have been disrupted. Companies need a forum for partnering with local-, state-, and national government to reduce community vulnerability. [Time was, we had such a forum, under the name of Project Impact, a FEMA program dating back to the Clinton years, which was ended in the first year of the Bush Administration. We should bring back this program, or something like it.]
Insurance companies might provide a useful starting point. It's likely that Sandy's impact along all that built-up shoreline will once again highlight opportunities for improving the National Flood Insurance Program. The insurance companies, DoC and DHS, and the publics they all serve have skin in the game. Such discussions are needed at the federal, state and local levels. The Department of Commerce could provide a natural venue to start such a dialogue. [The rest is here.]
Some of these themes were explored earlier this year when Pace University hosted a Summit on Resilience, with a particular focus on the roles of the public and private sectors in recovery from disasters like Hurricane Sandy. A set of papers is forthcoming, including a short reflection from me (see below), but you can view video of some interesting discussions and talks online, including lectures by the first Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, and Margareta Wahlström, the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction.
My short piece on the themes of the meeting was titled "Living Resiliently on a Crowding, Turbulent Planet." Here's a snippet that is particularly relevant:
Human communities will always be in harm's way even as we improve our technological and societal capacity for withstanding threats -- either natural or of our own making. This is partly because history and geography have placed many of our centers of habitation and commerce in zones of implicit hazard. Just two examples are severe and recurring seismic activity in Istanbul and the inevitability of a calamitous storm surge in New York City. The superimposition of allure, utility and danger led geographer Peirce Lewis to call New Orleans an "impossible but inevitable city" ....
A core theme at the meeting was that a boosted capacity to withstand and recover from disasters will not come by establishing some set menu of protocols and responsibilities. Ivan Seidenberg, who as chairman of the board of Verizon Communications Inc. deals continually with managing resilient responses to emergencies, went so far as to challenge, playfully, Albert Einstein's menu for saving the world. While Einstein said that, if given an hour, he would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and the final minute designing a solution, Seidenberg noted that in a fast-changing world, the rules and stakes - the very nature of the question - are in constant flux. That kind of situation requires a commitment to constant reevaluation, to learning and adjusting, to knowing resilience building is not accomplished from the top down, and is not a task, but a trait.
I've posted the final draft on Slideshare.
Jonathan Rose, a friend who is a developer with a focus on equitable, sustainable urban design, sent a relevant note yesterday focused on the tangle of issues facing New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It's worth posting here because it speaks to broader, and timely, opportunities to invest now with urban resilience in mind:
The MTA Blue Ribbon Commission on Sustainability and Climate Change, which I chaired, issued a report in 2009 recommending a wide range of actions that the MTA take to prepare itself for the future. Among them, it recommended, "The MTA should develop a climate-adaptation decision matrix to identify options for protecting transit infrastructure from storm surge, extreme heat, and other manifestations of climate change."
But the sharp recession prevented the MTA from being able to make the capital investments the that system sorely needed. The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the region's transportation system revealed how essential the MTA's system is for our economy, and how vulnerable it is to climate change. Sandy underscored our need to invest in the planning and reconstruction of our subways, trains, tunnels and bridges to make them more resilient- but to do so will take money, lots of it. And our cities and states don't have it.
Since the 1980's, the national economic debate has focussed on two levers of change- the cost of government expenditures, and revenues to pay for them. But the debate entirely misses a third, critical lever, investment. We need to look at critical infrastructure such our regional mass transit systems not as a cost, but as an investment in our economic future. And like any investment, it will provide a return, not only by supporting a more vibrant economy, but also by broadening the access of lower income families to the region's prosperity.
As we focus on balancing the federal government's operating budget, we should also develop a capital budget to fund the upgrading of critical regional systems to meet the challenges of climate change and population growth. With interest rates on the Federal 30-year bonds now below 3 percent, this is an ideal time to borrow for these investments in our nations future.
 11:07 a.m. | Update 
Robert R.M. Verchick, the author of "Facing Catastrophe: Environmental Action for a Post-Katrina World," and Gauthier-St. Martin Chair in Environmental Law at Loyola University in New Orleans, has an excellent post following up on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's statement on the presidential election, Hurricane Sandy and climate change. Here's an excerpt:
Is this the beginning of a tipping point? History shows that extreme events have the potential to focus people's attention and energy in ways previously thought impossible. In the eighteenth century, the Lisbon Earthquake forced a dramatic rethinking across of Europe of the government's role in hazard management. Portugal's prime minister launched one of the first scientific inquiries into earthquake mechanics. The government imposed stricter zoning laws and Europe's first seismic building codes.
Northeast governors whose states are receiving federal assistance after Hurricane Sandy have Herbert Hoover to thank. After the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927, Hoover, then the Secretary of Commerce, helped establish the national role for disaster recovery in the United States. Less than a decade later, the federal government boosted hazard protection across the nation by taking charge of all flood control projects on allfederal waterways. [ Read the rest .]
 11:39 a.m. | Update 
Via Twitter, I found and read a fascinating analysis by Stéphane Hallegatte, an economist and lead climate change specialist at the World Bank, pointing to the rational aspects of why we end up building in harm's way. As he explains:
My analysis is based on a simple model where investments are assumed to be more productive in flood-prone areas, because there are close to coast and rivers, lowering transportation costs, or because of urbanisation, which leads to concentration and development in river flood plains. Economic agents are then assumed to decide rationally on (i) how much to invest in flood protection; (ii) how much to invest in flood-prone (protected) areas; and (iii) how much to invest in safe areas. The main mechanism of the model is really simple: with economic growth, we have more resources to dedicate to disaster protection; but with better protections, disaster probability is reduced, creating an incentive to increase investment in more-productive risky areas. So when a protection fails or is overtopped by an exceptional events, consequences are larger.
As a result, the model predicts that disaster frequency decreases with economic growth, but that consequences are larger when a disaster occurs. The share of capital and population installed in flood-prone area can be increasing with growth, making disaster consequences (when a disaster occurs) grow more rapidly than wealth. With economic development, therefore, we are moving toward a world of fewer but bigger disasters, even relative to the size of the economy.
The post builds on a 2011 World Bank study.
11:48 a.m. | Update 
Again via Twitter, I learned about a 2011 White House report, "Federal Actions for a Climate Resilient Nation," from Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center. (More evidence that 140 characters can matter.) The report is more evidence that President Obama gets both sides of the climate challenge.
2:55 p.m. | Update 
I discussed storm surge, disaster planning and more with Columbia University climate scientist Radley Horton on the NPR program Science Friday [audio is online here]. I mentioned how recent TV coverage of comments by dislocated coastal residents reminded me of the "We'll rebuild!" reaction of people I interviewed when . Horton, who was involved in crafting the 2010 report, "Climate Change Adaptation in New York City: Building a Risk Management Response," offered many thoughts, including one I had to convey on Twitter:

I just found this very useful tropical cyclone mapping tool created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:
Plug in a location, date or other information to see hurricane activity back through time. (Hurricane Sandy is not in the data base yet, but there's plenty on the storm here.)
3:31 p.m. | Update 
An interesting piece on climate change, storm surge and New York City's adaptation options by Matthew Herper at Forbes.com led me to this prescient 2009 video report by my friend Robert Lee Hotz of The Wall Street Journal (here's the related print column):
11:46 p.m. | Update 
Alan Feuer has a nice feature in The Times exploring whether a softer perimeter and strategic retreats can allow New York City to persist in a turbulent century with rising seas (a reality we're stuck with even if CO2 emissions abate).
Nov. 3, 11:53 p.m. | Update 
My friend and sometime fishing partner Carl Safina, the marine scientist, conservationist and writer (who lives on Long Island), wrote a hard-edged piece for the CNN Web site calling out coastal communities and the nation for complacency in the face of climate change and rising seas. Here's an excerpt with a particularly tough opening line:
[U]npreparedness requires, one might say, quite a lot of preparation. We build in places prone to flooding. We do that largely because subsidies encourage it. Federal flood insurance is a way the entire country subsidizes building and rebuilding in places destined for repeated hits.
We rely on overhead lines to bring electricity, lines vulnerable to falling trees. And when they fall, we put them right back. Underground lines are more expensive. But if you have to keep repairing the overhead lines...
We've created coastal bowling-pin communities; we set 'em up and the weather takes 'em down. I live in one. I'm guilty. In my defense, I'll claim entrapment, because I have federal flood insurance. You made me do it. So I just want to take this opportunity to thank you. But I'd like to also tell you, it's OK with me if you withdraw your generosity. In fact it would be better if you did. You help make us lazy. And by us, I mean millions of people living along the coast, whistling in the dark. And you help our politicians look away from the oncoming truth.
 Nov. 4, 12:17 a.m. | Update 
This tweet pulls together two articles on how flood protections can backfire -- one on this coastal storm, the other on redevelopment in areas around St. Louis inundated by the great Mississippi flood of 1993:

 Nov.4, 7:39 a.m. | Update
David Biello, who saw the storm surge flow just short of his Brooklyn home, has an excellent feature in Scientific American on the science behind the flooding from Hurricane Sandy, and on the reality that this was far from a worst case -- and that of course more such flooding will be ever more likely as seas rise. Michael Lemonick of Climate Central, who's been writing wisely on the greenhouse effect and climate change since 1987, has a sobering piece at Climate Central on the gulf between climate discourse around Hurricane Sandy and a meaningful response on greenhouse-gas emissions.
Nov. 12, 9:41 a.m. | Update 
In a guest post on Dot Earth, three students at the New York Harbor School focus on living infrastructure -- oyster reefs -- as one way to blunt storm surges.
Finally, the Room for Debate blog solicited varied views on whether storm surge barriers are a feasible investment for New York City (it's a much more challenging question than it was for London's Thames River storm barriers). Have a look.

HEADLINE: Hyundai and Kia Acknowledge Overstating the Gas Mileage of Vehicles

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The South Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia built their brands around the idea that their cars got better gas mileage than competitors, promoting that fact in ads that often took swipes at less efficient rivals.
But on Friday, the companies admitted that they had overstated the fuel economy of 900,000 vehicles sold in the United States over the last two years -- about one-third of the vehicles they sold during that period.
Hyundai and Kia, which are both owned by the Hyundai Motor Group, said they would begin a broad effort to reimburse consumers and restate mileage estimates for the affected models. 
The admission followed an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency into consumer complaints that their cars were underperforming the official mileage estimates on the window stickers of new Hyundai and Kia vehicles. While few drivers achieve the stickered mileage levels under real-world conditions, the government requires automakers to conduct standardized tests to calculate the figures so that buyers can more easily compare the fuel efficiency of various models.
Hyundai and Kia apologized to customers for what they called ''procedural errors'' in testing that resulted in incorrect mileage stickers on some of their most popular models, like the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Rio.
It is a costly setback for the companies, which are among the fastest-growing carmakers in the United States and self-proclaimed leaders in the highly competitive area of fuel economy.
''Given the importance of fuel efficiency to all of us, we're extremely sorry about these errors,'' said John Krafcik, the chief executive of Hyundai's American operations.
The E.P.A. did not announce any sanctions or fines against either carmaker, and said both companies agreed to voluntarily lower fuel estimates on a majority of their new cars and S.U.V.'s.
''Consumers rely on the window sticker to help make informed choices about the cars they buy,'' said Gina McCarthy, an agency official. ''E.P.A.'s investigation will help protect consumers and ensure a level playing field among automakers.''
Hyundai and Kia now face a protracted struggle to restore their reputations.
''In an industry where reputation is so important, this will undoubtedly give both carmakers ugly black eyes,'' said John O'Dell, an analyst at the auto research firm Edmunds.com.
To compensate customers who bought cars with the inaccurate stickers, the companies will offer debit cards to reimburse them for the difference between the stated gas mileage and the actual amount of gas used in their vehicles.
The companies said their dealers would check vehicle odometers to see how much more customers spent on gas than they would have if the window stickers had been accurate. That amount, in addition to a 15 percent ''inconvenience'' bonus, will then be refunded.
The company estimated that the average debit card will be for about $88, based on a typical car driven 15,000 miles this year that had an overstated fuel economy of 1 mile per gallon. Current owners will be able to refresh the card as long as they own the vehicle.
Mr. Krafcik declined to estimate the total cost of the program, which could run into the tens of millions of dollars. ''We're going to spend what it takes to make it right,'' he said.
The companies will also replace mileage stickers on large numbers of unsold cars, and run newspaper ads explaining the mistakes and reaffirming their commitment to delivering good fuel economy.
The E.P.A. said it discovered the mileage discrepancies during a continuing fuel-economy audit program that covers vehicles made by various manufacturers.
The agency said it was aware of consumer complaints about Hyundai mileage estimates when its audit found a difference in the stated and actual fuel economy mileage of an Elantra sedan. The E.P.A. then expanded its testing to other Kia and Hyundai models.
The agency said its investigation was continuing.
''Although it took more than a year, the E.P.A. did catch the discrepancies,'' Mr. O'Dell said.
The companies said the misstated mileage figures were a result of internal errors in testing the vehicles for E.P.A. certification.
The government has standard testing procedures it requires all automakers to use to produce mileage estimates, which can then be displayed on cars for sale in dealer showrooms.
The tests measure aerodynamic drag on vehicles, how much energy is used to overcome road resistance and the amount of fuel used to drive the engine and wheels.
In the case of Hyundai and Kia, errors in testing caused inaccurate mileage estimates that were one to six miles per gallon higher than the vehicles were capable of. The companies gave no explanation for the wide band of errors.
The corrective actions agreed to by the carmakers will have an immediate effect on their marketing efforts.
The fleet average of all Hyundai and Kia models combined will be reduced by 3 percent, to 26 miles per gallon from 27. Also, Hyundai will retract widely publicized claims that four of its models get 40 miles per gallon on the highway.
Mr. O'Dell of Edmunds said that falling out of the 40 m.p.g. category could hurt sales, particularly when competitors are also advertising that figure as a new benchmark for fuel economy.
The E.P.A. said that it had twice before required manufacturers to relabel a vehicle's fuel economy since 2000, but that this was the first instance where multiple models from the same carmaker had overstated mileage estimates.

HEADLINE: Berkshire to Buy Retailer Of Arts and Crafts Wares

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
8:10 p.m. | Updated
With the holidays approaching, Warren E. Buffett has found a way to stock up on elf hats and reindeer paper plates: by buying an 80-year-old retailer overflowing with them.
On Friday, Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, agreed to buy the Oriental Trading Company, acquiring a catalog-based arts-and-crafts company whose wares include Santa doorknob kits and a color-your-own Christmas photo holder. Berkshire paid about $500 million, according to people briefed on the matter. 
"Oriental Trading is a leader in its industry, has a strong management team and delivers exceptional customer value and service," Mr. Buffett said in a statement. "We are delighted to have them join the Berkshire Hathaway family and continue their quest to make the world more fun."
The deal signals the end to a series of ownership changes for Oriental Trading, which has been passed among private equity firms and retooled under bankruptcy protection. Its current owners include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which took a big stake in it during the Chapter 11 process.
Oriental Trading was founded in 1932 by Harry Watanabe, a Japanese immigrant in Omaha who found a profitable niche in selling Kewpie dolls and other trinkets through local stores and carnivals.
His son, Terry, expanded the business enormously by bolstering a catalog business that drew in direct sales to churches and schools. Terry Watanabe sold Oriental Trading to Brentwood Associates in 2000. Six years later, Brentwood sold it to the Carlyle Group for $1 billion. K.K.R. had also looked at buying the company through its private equity unit, but was outbid.
Soon afterward, however, Oriental Trading struggled with both rising mailing costs and the recession, as well as the enormous amount of debt that was placed on the company. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, prompting K.K.R.'s special situations team to consider expanding upon a small investment in the retailer's debt. The division specializes in investing in distressed companies, usually by buying debt or providing rescue financing. It currently oversees about $2 billion.
Early in 2011, the unit bought up what eventually became one-third of Oriental Trading's first-lien debt, putting K.K.R. in line to take control by converting its holdings into equity. Using knowledge gleaned by the leveraged buyout side years earlier, the team decided that the retailer appeared headed for a recovery and would make an attractive investment.
"In our view the business was stabilizing and starting to turn positive," Jamie Weinstein, a co-head of the special situations group, said in an interview. "That was a different view from a lot of distressed investors at the time."
In recent months, K.K.R. and the company's other owners, Par IV Capital Management and the Crescent Capital Group, decided to look for a potential exit, according to people briefed on the process. Oriental Trading hired Lazard as an adviser to reach out to potential buyers, including Berkshire.
Given Mr. Buffett's aversion to bidding in auctions, bankers showed Berkshire a number for a potential deal, one of these people said. He accepted.
The deal has been a good one for K.K.R., which should earn twice its initial investment, according to the people briefed on the process.
Jeremiah Lane, another member of the K.K.R. team, said in a statement: "Over the past two years the company has transitioned to steady growth, both top and bottom line, and there is no question the company has a bright future as part of the Berkshire Hathaway enterprise."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Is Romney Unraveling?

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Time is running out for Mitt Romney.
According to the latest polls, the most likely outcome of Tuesday's election is that Romney will lose. If he does, it will likely be a bitter pill to swallow. He would have come so close only to have fate and circumstances step in at the final hour and give President Obama a boost.
How is Romney losing it? Let us count the ways: 
1) The economy continues to improve. The argument for electing Romney hinges on a sour economy and his experience as a businessman with the expertise to turn it around. But, on measure after measure, the economy seems to be getting better.
A Commerce Department report released last month found that housing starts jumped 15 percent in September -- the largest surge in four years.
The unemployment rate dropped below 8 percent in September and the October jobs report released on Friday was stronger than expected.
Furthermore, according to a Gallup report also released Friday:
''The U.S. Payroll to Population employment rate (P2P), as measured by Gallup, was 45.7 percent for the month of October, up from 45.1 percent in September, and reflecting the highest percentage of Americans with good jobs since Gallup began daily tracking of U.S. employment in 2010.''
Romney needed gloom and doom on the economy, but Obama got some rays of sunlight.
2) Romney's momentum is maxing out. There was a moment after the first debate when it appeared as if he might have a legitimate shot at winning. He surged in the polls. His forlorn followers found their faith. There was hope for their candidate. Momentum begot momentum. But it peaked a couple of weeks ago, and evidence amassed that the momentum has evaporated.
Even so, the Romney campaign seemed to believe it could stick with the momentum meme even after that momentum had stalled because it had been effective at rallying the troops.
As The Times's Nate Silver wrote Friday about arguments touting Romney's chances in the election:
''A third argument is that Mr. Romney has the momentum in the polls: whether or not he would win an election today, the argument goes, he is on a favorable trajectory that will allow him to win on Tuesday. This may be the worst of the arguments, in my view. It is contradicted by the evidence, simply put.''
Silver averaged the national polls of likely voters in his database and found that ''there is not much evidence of 'momentum' toward Mr. Romney. Instead, the case that the polls have moved slightly toward Mr. Obama is stronger.''
That's right, it is the Obama campaign that has the rightful claim to having momentum.
3) Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane devastated the Northeast, which also happens to be the media center of the country. This diverted people's attention from the rancor of the campaign trail, and they saw Obama being presidential in his response to the storm.
They also saw bipartisanship. Obama was embraced by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was the Republican National Convention keynote speaker. He won an endorsement from Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, an independent.
For his part, Romney transformed an Ohio rally into a ''storm relief event.''
4) Truth and lies. Evidence continues to emerge that Romney is one of the most dishonest, duplicitous candidates to ever seek the presidency.
He criticized Obama for telling then-President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia that he would have ''more flexibility'' to deal with sensitive issues between the two countries after he won re-election. Romney said this was particularly troubling given that Russia ''is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.''
However, according to a report on Friday in The New York Times, Romney's son Matt recently traveled to Russia and delivered a message to President Vladimir Putin:
''Mr. Romney told a Russian known to be able to deliver messages to Mr. Putin that despite the campaign rhetoric, his father wants good relations if he becomes president, according to a person informed about the conversation.''
It sounds as though he was signaling that Mitt would do exactly what he had castigated Obama for: operate with ''more flexibility'' after the election.
This is the kind of hypocrisy that just makes you shake your head in disbelief.
According to a Gallup poll released on Wednesday, Americans expect Obama to be re-elected by 54 percent to 34 percent. Among those believing that Obama will win were most independents and almost a fifth of Republicans.
I cast my lot with those folks unless there is a seismic shift in the next few days.

HEADLINE: Campaigns Have Strategy For Couples Who Disagree

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
FAIRFAX, Va. -- When Pat Rosend received a ''Vote'' flier from Democrats, she stuck it on her refrigerator door.
Her husband, Dave, who has always voted Republican, drew an ''X'' over the Democratic congressman depicted on the flier with President Obama.
Yet Mr. Rosend says he remains ''on the fence'' about whether he will vote for Mitt Romney -- and cancel out his wife's strong support for Mr. Obama.
The Rosends illustrate a little-scrutinized variable of the campaign's results: the influence that spouses can have on each other's voting decisions. 
In a skintight presidential race, pillow talk and kitchen-table discussions could make a difference to each party's bid to close its gender gap in battlegrounds like Colorado, Ohio and Virginia. In this week's New York Times/CBS News poll -- a dead heat among likely voters with 48 percent for Mr. Obama and 47 percent for Mr. Romney -- the Republican challenger had support from 51 percent of men but just 44 percent of women, while the Democratic incumbent held the backing of 52 percent of women but just 44 percent of men.
As those still undecided make up their minds this final weekend, ''conversations people have with their spouses will be at least as important as all the TV ads people are seeing,'' said Geoff Garin, a pollster for Democrats.
Those who have studied political dynamics within households say that roughly three-fourths of married couples vote the same way. Because people seek spouses with similar values, they typically have similar political views to begin with. But couples who disagree, said Paul Allen Beck, a political scientist at Ohio State University, usually make at least a cursory attempt to resolve their differences. It is a factor both parties take into account in their data-driven process of identifying and mobilizing potential supporters.
Obama campaign organizers consider the political orientation of a spouse among the characteristics most predictive of where an undecided voter will end up. Michael Meyers of TargetPoint Consulting, a firm that helps Mr. Romney with voter turnout, said the political views of a Republican's spouse help determine whether and how a household gets courted, both for purposes of locking down its support and for ensuring that its members actually vote.
The firm's database might show that the spouse of a gun-rights supporter holds a different view on that issue, for example. If so, Mr. Meyers said, the household might receive anti-tax rather than ''Second Amendment'' literature in support of the Republican ticket.
At A.F.L.-C.I.O. offices in Washington this week, organizers of a phone bank direct callers to discuss the impact of issues on entire families in hopes of leveraging the persuasive power of spouses. Amber Sparks, a volunteer making calls to back the Democratic ticket, heard from a steelworker in Virginia that ''his wife was for Obama, but he wasn't so sure,'' Ms. Sparks recalled. ''I said he should listen to his wife.''
A few chairs away, another caller, Lisa Aaron, reached a female Obama backer who noted that her husband leaned the other way because he opposed government-financed contraceptive coverage. ''I said, 'You just really have to work on him,' '' Ms. Aaron recounted. ''She said, 'I'll do that, but he's a hard nut to crack.' ''
Laura Stoker, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, studied the political preferences of 150 couples over a series of elections. Her conclusion: ''Wives are more inclined to move toward their husbands than husbands are to move toward their wives.''
That would seem to augur well for Mr. Romney, given his disproportionate support among men. But Mr. Meyers of TargetPoint, echoing Professor Stoker's research, noted that the most influential partner is the one who knows and cares most about the election.
That could help Mr. Romney in blue-collar households, where ''men do more of the talking,'' Mr. Garin said. But after months in which Democrats hammered Mr. Romney on issues like abortion and contraception, Mr. Garin concluded from focus groups that Mr. Obama might benefit from the dynamic within more affluent suburban households.
In Virginia, this week's New York Times/CBS News/Quinnipiac University poll showed, Mr. Obama has driven up his support among white college-educated women to 58 percent from 46 percent on Election Day 2008. His support among white college-educated men remained fairly steady at 39 percent in the recent poll, compared with 41 percent in 2008, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky. ''The strength of support for Obama among college-educated women at the very least sparks conversation in those households, and gives college-educated men another thing to think about,'' Mr. Garin said.
That has already happened inside the Rosends' town house in this sprawling Northern Virginia suburb. Ms. Rosend, 48, a landscape architect, said she feels ''passionately'' about the election because she approves of Mr. Obama's health care bill and his efforts to revive the economy, and because she sees Mr. Romney as ''stuck in a different era'' on issues of special concern to women.
Mr. Rosend, also 48, an information technology manager, is a National Rifle Association member. Despite his wife's misgivings, he has taught their sons how to handle firearms. Her Mazda sports an Obama bumper sticker; his Mazda does not.
''I'm not a big fan of the president,'' Mr. Rosend said. But even though he backed Senator John McCain four years ago, and has never supported a Democrat for the White House, he said he is considering it this time.
He said he fears that Mr. Obama would seek ''full-bore'' tax increases in a second term, but also that Mr. Romney might eliminate his mortgage interest deduction as part of an overhaul of the tax code. Like his wife, Mr. Rosend said he has concluded that Mr. Romney is ''out of touch'' with average Americans on economic issues.
''I don't think either of them has great plans,'' he said. ''It's who will do the least damage.''
Usually, Ms. Rosend said, ''We don't talk about politics that much because it can be painful.'' But the couple watched this year's party conventions and Obama-Romney debates together. Ms. Rosend has been trying to persuade her husband by pointing out parts of the president's record he might like, from provisions in Mr. Obama's health plan to his caution about committing troops to new conflicts in the Middle East.
On Tuesday, she may take their 13-year-old son, David, to their polling place at a nearby Catholic church to give him a taste of the Democratic process. (Professor Stoker found that, whatever the dynamic between spouses, children are more likely to take political cues from their mothers.)
Mr. Rosend said he will vote, too -- his first ballot for a Democratic presidential contender, if his wife gets her way. If he decides otherwise, she said with a hopeful chuckle, perhaps he will neglect to get around to it.

HEADLINE: A Face More Careworn, a Crowd Less Joyful

BYLINE: By DAMON WINTER. 
Damon Winter is a photographer for The New York Times. In 2009, he won the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography.

 BODY:
If you just squinted your eyes a little, and looked at only the first row of supporters at an Obama campaign rally, it might not seem all that different from four years ago. That raw electricity still radiates around him. Supporters still sink their fingers into his back, middle-aged men still, on occasion, tear up in his presence, and crowds still stand out in the rain to hear him speak.
But in general, the events are smaller and the crowds less diverse. And if you look beyond the front row, more faces look not frozen in ecstasy but suspended in a quiet, sometimes penetrating scrutiny. 
The 2008 campaign offered voters a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make history, to be part of the nation's grand collective memory. This year that offer is not on the table.
In this campaign, President Obama wears the dual uniforms of candidate and incumbent, and with them, the weight of the institution and four difficult years of service. He is no longer the abstract embodiment of intertwined notions of Hope and Change. He is the president, with a record to defend. He can no longer ask for a leap of faith, only for four more years. He can only push, as his campaign posters simply state, forward.
Unlike the soaring language of the last campaign, utilitarian calls to ''just vote,'' squabbles over saving Big Bird and cures for ''Romnesia'' are more likely to be heard. It is a more down-to-earth affair. Only four years separate the two campaigns, but aside from the man at the middle of them both, covering the campaign this year feels much different.
In photographs from 2008, the Obama campaign was a visible work in progress, constantly evolving through a long, bitter primary season.
The settings were as diverse as the crowds that inhabited them. At a rally in Carrollton, Tex., Mr. Obama roamed freely on the stage, unshackled to the teleprompter, microphone in hand, lighted from one side by the warm glow of tungsten filaments set against a cool fluorescent green ceiling. His stroll around the stage brought him within inches of my lens.
In Miami, storm clouds gathered in the steamy evening sky as he gestured in silent silhouette. In the October homestretch, his events had the scale of sold-out rock concerts. You could feel this swell of energy and emotion as Election Day drew near.
This time around, many of his rallies have a small-town scale but lack the grass-roots feel of '08. They have a uniform, prepackaged gloss, typical of most presidential events. At a rally at a baseball field in Virginia the president came out swinging, literally, with an imaginary bat. But the crowd was squeezed into a corner of the stadium to give the illusion of density. Four years ago, he would have been speaking in the center of that stadium, with supporters lining the field and filling the stands.
In 2008, I observed him interacting with people more. He was not just a solitary figure, standing at a microphone or shuttling from place to place. Now, there is a constant challenge to find candid, storytelling images. Every day on the trail is scheduled and scripted down to the minute, and covering it often feels like a carefully choreographed dance.
In between rallies, there are a few ''off the record'' stops to local businesses and restaurants or official presidential duties, but most days are filled with this intricate series of repeating movements. Sometimes it feels as if we are just going through the motions, and I often wonder whether he feels the same way.
Photographers catch only a fleeting glimpse of the president beneath layers of armored stage decorations, lecterns, microphones, teleprompters, staff members and Secret Service agents. In photographs, Mr. Obama can often seem engulfed by the scale of the office and its necessary trappings.
Night after night, we watch him descend the ramp from Air Force One, salute his greeters, take a right turn and walk away to Marine One, the helicopter that carries him into the night sky and back to his home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. A lone Marine tips his hat and bows into the rotor wash from the departing helicopters. It is mesmerizing, standing under the wing of Air Force One, watching the routine unfold, even though it is exactly the same every time.
Campaigning can sometimes seem like a lonely undertaking for a man who is almost always surrounded by people. At the Iowa State Fair in August, Mr. Obama made a stop for a beer and pork chops and found himself alone with a plate of food in front of a crowd of reporters, photographers and fairgoers, but without utensils so he could actually eat his food. He got little sympathy from his busy observers.
Backstage at an October event in Cleveland, after shaking dozens of hands he stood alone in front of the campaign's instant presidential backdrop, waiting for instructions on his next obligation and a dose of hand sanitizer.
At an August stop in Colorado City, Mr. Obama sat on the edge of a wrestling mat and put his shoes on after meeting with some Olympic hopefuls. It was such a brief and rare humanizing moment, a reminder that the president of the United States still sits on the ground when he has to and still puts his shoes on, one foot at a time, just like the rest of us. We were quickly ushered away.
In 2012, Mr. Obama looks a little leaner and his hair is a little grayer. At an event in Miami, speaking in front of an oversize American flag, he eventually draped his arm over the lectern, shifted the weight of his body and for a fleeting moment allowed his weariness to seep onto the podium and in through my lens. In New Hampshire, in a sweltering high school gymnasium, he closed his eyes, lost for a fraction of a second in solitary respite, as he used a handkerchief to dab the sweat off his forehead in the middle of his stump speech.
While I was traveling through Alabama and South Carolina in 2008, several black supporters of Mr. Obama told me they could not bring themselves to vote for him. I didn't understand. Many of these voters, who had experienced the civil rights movement firsthand, explained that they could not live with the possibility of having the assassination of America's first black president on their conscience.
It was a shocking and fascinating testament to that unique moment in time and a reminder of how different things are now. These days, voters' concerns are a little more familiar: taxes, health care and of course, the economy. Out on the trail this year, I am reminded that you can only elect the first black president once.

HEADLINE: For Some After the Storm, No Work Means No Pay

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Chantal Sainvilus, a home health aide in Brooklyn who makes $10 an hour, does not get paid if she does not show up. So it is no wonder that she joined the thousands of people taking extreme measures to get to work this week, even, in her case, hiking over the Williamsburg Bridge.
While salaried employees worked if they could, often from home after Hurricane Sandy, many of the poorest New Yorkers faced the prospect of losing days, even a crucial week, of pay on top of the economic ground they have lost since the recession. 
Low-wage workers, more likely to be paid hourly and work at the whim of their employers, have fared worse in the recovery than those at the top of the income scale -- in New York City the bottom 20 percent lost $463 in annual income from 2010 to 2011, in contrast to a gain of almost $2,000 for the top quintile. And there are an increasing number of part-time and hourly workers, the type that safety net programs like unemployment are not designed to serve. Since 2009, when the recovery began, 86 percent of the jobs added nationally have been hourly. Over all, about 60 percent of the nation's jobs are hourly.
Even as the sluggish economy has accentuated this divide, Hurricane Sandy has acted as a further wedge, threatening to take a far greater toll on the have-littles who live from paycheck to paycheck.
''There's a lot of people in our society that are living in a very precarious situation in terms of low wages or very insecure work,'' said Arne L. Kalleberg, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of ''Good Jobs, Bad Jobs.'' ''That's why it's important to have a safety net that's based on the idea of people working insecure jobs like this.''
On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that New York City and four suburban counties were eligible for disaster unemployment relief, which covers a broader spectrum of workers than regular unemployment benefits, including the self-employed like taxi drivers and street vendors as well as those who were unable to get to work.
New Jersey has also declared people in 10 counties eligible for disaster unemployment assistance. In Connecticut, residents of four counties and the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation are eligible.
A New York Department of Labor spokesman emphasized that workers who lost wages should call to apply because the program is flexible and many eligibility issues would be determined on a case-by-case basis.
But the program might not help people whose commute simply lasted longer or cost more, like Ibezim Oki, a cabdriver who spent $50 on a cab to get from his Brooklyn home to Manhattan on Friday, rather than risk long bus delays, and ''now I don't know how long I'm going to have to wait for gas.''
The commute alone represented a hardship for workers whose jobs require a physical presence, while neighborhood coffee shops in the boroughs and suburbs overflowed with those who needed nothing more than a laptop and Wi-Fi to stay connected to work.
Ms. Sainvilus estimated that on Thursday, she had traveled eight hours to work for five, making her effective pay less than $4 an hour.
Others could not work because their place of business was closed. At a food distribution center in Chelsea, Mike Samuel, 55, a delivery man for a florist, was feeling the pain of five days of lost income. ''We don't work, we don't get no tips, we don't get no pay,'' he said.
Muta Prather said the chemical company where he works in Newark was flooded, causing him to miss three days of work. He worked part of the day on Thursday helping to clean up, but worried about how he would pay for damage to his own roof.
''It hurts, you know,'' said Mr. Prather, who is 49 and lives in West Orange, N.J. ''I looked up at my roof, and it's going to cost me like seven grand. I don't make that kind of money.''
But at a playground in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, Damien Carney stood with his baby daughter strapped to his chest and his toddler on a nearby swing, enjoying a surprise week off. For Mr. Carney, a salaried portfolio manager for a wine distributor that was closed because it had no power, the storm was amounting to something like a paid vacation with time for cooking and rearranging the living room. ''They basically said, 'Don't worry about it,' '' Mr. Carney said of his employers.
Federal labor laws include more protections for salaried workers than hourly workers when a disaster hits. Employers must continue to pay salaries if the worksite is closed for less than a week, even though they are allowed to require employees to use vacation or paid leave for the duration of the closure. Hourly workers, on the other hand, do not have to be paid if the worksite closes. If the workplace is open but salaried workers cannot get there, their pay may be reduced.
Of course, policies vary from workplace to workplace, and some hourly workers were luckier than others. Cassandra Williams, 54, waiting for the bus from Brooklyn to Manhattan with her 6-year-old granddaughter, said the family for whom she keeps house would pay her full wages despite her missing three days of work. Tinash Makots, a 24-year-old salesman at the Nike store in Midtown Manhattan, said he would be paid for the days missed as well.
One nanny in the bus line said she would be paid her regular wages, while another said she would not be compensated for hours missed.
A financial district worker who would identify himself only as William S. said he did not strictly need to go into Manhattan to do his job, but felt that he should make an appearance after one of his staff members showed up every day at 6 a.m. and another paid $40 a day to get to a distant office in Queens.
But Anthony Howell, a 42-year-old hair stylist in Chelsea, said he hadn't worked all week because his salon, like his high-rise apartment, has no electricity.
''That's the brutal part,'' he said. ''The hair industry is like that. You don't do the work, you don't get the money.''

HEADLINE: Not Ready for a 'Solar Sandy'

BYLINE: By YOUSAF BUTT

 BODY:
HORRENDOUS and damaging as it was, Hurricane Sandy would be considered only an opening act compared with a powerful ''once-in-a-century'' solar storm.
These storms of charged particles and magnetic fields are unleashed periodically by the Sun and -- if headed toward Earth -- can cause havoc with satellites and the electricity grid.
Unlike with Sandy, we are woefully underprepared both to detect such impending storms and to respond to them. Although they can come at any time, their likelihood waxes and wanes in 11-year cycles -- with the next period of maximum activity being next year. 
A powerful solar (or ''geomagnetic'') storm has the potential to simultaneously damage multiple transformers in the electricity grid and perhaps even bring down large sections of it, affecting upwards of a hundred million people in the United States for many months, if not years.
These huge transformers are expensive and difficult to replace, and not many are stockpiled in the United States for an emergency. In the worst case, the impact would be devastating: An outage could cost a few trillion dollars, with full recovery taking years. Not only would parts of the grid be compromised, but telephone networks, undersea cables, satellites and railroads also would be affected.
A 2008 National Academy of Sciences study warned that ''because of the interconnectedness of critical infrastructures in modern society,'' the ''collateral effects of a longer-term outage'' would likely include ''disruption of the transportation, communication, banking and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration.''
Similarly, a recent Lloyd's of London report cautioned that ''a loss of power could lead to a cascade of operational failures that could leave society and the global economy severely disabled.''
And we've had plenty of warning: In 1989 Canada's Hydro-Québec grid collapsed within 90 seconds because of a geomagnetic storm and the entire province was without electricity for many hours. (Luckily, Hydro-Québec depends on hydroelectric generation, which permits a straightforward and rapid restoration of power).
And that storm was not nearly as strong as some historical ones: A May 1921 solar storm may have been 10 times as powerful. The public was far less dependent on electricity then and the system was far less interconnected at that time, so the damage was minimal. Even so, telegraph lines did blow their fuses.
A similar storm now would be far more dangerous. The grid is much larger, more interconnected and running closer to its design tolerance, making the entire system highly vulnerable.
A primary method of defending the grid is through early warning from NASA satellites that observe the Sun and detect solar storms that may be headed in our direction. Such warnings can alert utilities to take measures to protect equipment. Usually a couple of days of warning is available, though about a third of all major storms still arrive unheralded, and almost one-quarter of the warnings turn out to be false alarms.
NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, which monitors energetic particles in the solar wind from a vantage point between the Earth and Sun, was launched in August 1997 and is, according to the National Academy of Sciences study, ''well beyond its planned operational life'' with no plans on the books to replace it.
The 14-year-old satellite, as well as another even older one -- the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) -- ''can fail anytime, no one knows,'' according to Michael Hesse, director of the modeling center at Goddard Space Flight Center.
Both ACE and SOHO should be replaced and perhaps even be augmented by satellites orbiting closer to the Sun in order to increase the lead time of the warnings of any solar storms that are heading toward Earth.
Relatively cheap hardening of the grid should also be done. For example, after the 1989 outage Hydro-Québec adjusted control relays and installed capacitors to protect their systems. Similar low-cost solutions should be applied to the U.S. grid before a crisis situation. Although the Western section of the U.S. grid has some of these protections, most of the Eastern grid lines do not.
In contrast to the trillions of dollars that a once-in-a-century geomagnetic storm could cost, hardening the grid and launching the necessary early- warning satellites would be relatively cheap insurance: The price would range from a few billion dollars to perhaps a few tens of billions.
So far, however, as an expert scientific panel tasked by the Homeland Security Department recently concluded [pdf], the federal response to this potential crisis has been ''poorly organized'' and ''no one is in charge.'' We ought to get our act together before a ''Solar Sandy'' catches us off-guard.

HEADLINE: Euro Zone Manufacturing Declines

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- A European economic report Friday confirmed a continuing slowdown in the euro zone's factories, even as Washington reported data indicating a moderate improvement in the American economy. 
Euro zone manufacturing declined for a 15th consecutive month in October, according to a survey of purchasing managers by Markit Economics, a research firm.
The final Markit purchasing managers' index fell to 45.4 in October from 46.1 in September. A number below 50 signals contraction.
''A broad-based decline in production was seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors,'' Rob Dobson, a Markit economist, wrote in a note, ''as manufacturers faced a restrictive combination of weak demand from domestic markets and declining intra- and extra-euro area trade flows. Cost caution also prevailed, leading to cutbacks in employment, purchasing and the disinvestment of inventories.''
Data from individual countries were also sobering, he noted, as Ireland was the only euro zone country not to report a contraction.
''This is further evidence that the ongoing weakness of the periphery is being combined with hollowing out of the previously strong core of France and Germany,'' Mr. Dobson said.
The figures for Britain, not a member of the euro zone, were scarcely better, with the manufacturing index falling to 47.5 in October from 48.1 in September.
Attention in the euro zone is now beginning to focus on a meeting of euro zone finance ministers Nov. 12 in Brussels, where officials are expected to move toward decisions on what to do about the thorny situations in Greece and Spain.
The U.S. economy, meanwhile, appears to be continuing its slow recovery. In the last assessment of the job market before the presidential election, the Labor Department announced Friday that employers added 171,000 positions in October, and more jobs than initially estimated in both August and September.
The unemployment rate ticked up slightly in October, to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent in September, as more people joined the labor force and so officially became counted as unemployed.
The report reinforced expectations that the U.S. economy, for all its problems, would continue to outpace Europe's. A report this month from Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, is expected to show the euro zone's economy back in recession, with gross domestic product contracting for a second consecutive quarter in the three months through September.
The euro slipped 0.7 percent from the New York close Thursday, to $1.2847.

HEADLINE: Lifelong Scholar of the Japanese Becomes One of Them

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO
WITH his small frame hunched by 90 years of life, and a self-deprecating manner that can make him seem emotionally sensitive to the point of fragility, Donald Keene would have appeared an unlikely figure to become a source of inspiration for a wounded nation.
Yet that is exactly how the New York native and retired professor of literature from Columbia University is now seen here in his adopted homeland of Japan. Last year, as many foreign residents and even Japanese left the country for fear of radiation from the Fukushima nuclear accident that followed a deadly earthquake and tsunami, Dr. Keene purposefully went the opposite direction. He announced that he would apply for Japanese citizenship to show his support.
The gesture won Dr. Keene, already a prominent figure in Japanese literary and intellectual circles, a status approaching that of folk hero, making him the subject of endless celebratory newspaper articles, television documentaries and even displays in museums.
It has been a surprising culmination of an already notable career that saw this quiet man with a bashful smile rise from a junior naval officer who interrogated Japanese prisoners during World War II to a founder of Japanese studies in the United States. That career has made him a rare foreigner, awarded by the emperor one of Japan's highest honors for his contributions to Japanese literature and befriended by Japan's most celebrated novelists. 
Dr. Keene has spent a lifetime shuttling between Japan and the United States. Taking Japanese citizenship seems a gesture that has finally bestowed upon him the one thing that eludes many Westerners who make their home and even lifelong friendships here: acceptance.
''When I first did it, I thought I'd get a flood of angry letters that 'you are not of the Yamato race!' but instead, they welcomed me,'' said Dr. Keene, using an old name for Japan. ''I think the Japanese can detect, without too much trouble, my love of Japan.''
That affection seemed especially welcome to a nation that even before last year's triple disaster had seemed to lose confidence as it fell into a long social and economic malaise.
During an interview at a hotel coffee shop, Japanese passers-by did double takes of smiling recognition -- testimony to how the elderly scholar has won far more fame in Japan than in the United States. A product of an older world before the Internet or television, Dr. Keene is known as a gracious conversationalist who charms listeners with stories from a lifetime devoted to Japan, which he first visited during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.
BUT what is perhaps most remarkable about Dr. Keene is that Japan, a racially homogeneous nation that can be politely standoffish to non-Japanese, has embraced him with such warmth. When he legally became a Japanese citizen this year, major newspapers ran photographs of him holding up a handwritten poster of his name, Kinu Donarudo, in Chinese characters. To commemorate the event, a candy company in rural Niigata announced plans to build a museum that will include an exact replica of Dr. Keene's personal library and study from his home in New York.
He says he has been inundated by invitations to give public lectures, which are so popular that drawings are often held to see who can attend.
''I have not met a Japanese since then who has not thanked me. Except the Ministry of Justice,'' he added with his typically understated humor, referring to the government office in charge of immigration.
With the patient air of someone who has tussled with Japanese bureaucracy before, he listed what he called the absurd requirements imposed upon him to take Japanese citizenship, including documentation to prove his completion of elementary school in New York City. Still, in a nation that welcomes few immigrants, Dr. Keene's application was quickly approved. To become Japanese, Dr. Keene, who is unmarried, had to relinquish his American citizenship.
His affection for Japan began in 1940 with a chance encounter at a bookstore near Times Square, where Dr. Keene, then an 18-year-old university student at Columbia, found a translation of the Tale of Genji, a 1,000-year-old novel from Japan. In the stories of court romances and intrigue, he found a refuge from the horrors of the world war then already unfolding in Europe and Asia.
Dr. Keene later described it as his first encounter with Japan's delicate sense of beauty, and its acceptance that life is fleeting and sad -- a sentiment that would captivate him for the rest of his life.
When the United States entered the war, he enlisted in the Navy, where he received Japanese-language training to become an interpreter and intelligence officer. He said he managed to build a rapport with the Japanese he interrogated, including one he said wrote him a letter after the war in which he referred to himself as Dr. Keene's first P.O.W.
LIKE several of his classmates, Dr. Keene used his language skills after the war to become a pioneer of academic studies of Japan in the United States. Among Americans, he is perhaps best known for translating and compiling a two-volume anthology in the early 1950s that has been used to introduce generations of university students to Japanese literature. When he started his career, he said Japanese literature was virtually unknown to Americans.
''I think I brought Japanese literature into the Western world in a special way, by making it part of the literary canon at universities,'' said Dr. Keene, who has written about 25 books on Japanese literature and history.
In Japan, he said his career benefited from good timing as the nation entered a golden age of fiction writing after the war. He befriended some of Japan's best known modern fiction writers, including Yukio Mishima and Kenzaburo Oe. Even Junichiro Tanizaki, an elderly novelist known for his cranky dislike of visitors, was fond of Dr. Keene, inviting him to his home. Dr. Keene says that was because he took Japanese culture seriously.
''I was a freak who spoke Japanese and could talk about literature,'' he joked.
Japanese writers say that Dr. Keene's appeal was more than that. They said he appeared at a time when Japan was starting to rediscover the value of its traditions after devastating defeat. Dr. Keene taught them that Japanese literature had a universal appeal, they said.
''He gave us Japanese confidence in the significance of our literature,'' said Takashi Tsujii, a novelist.
Mr. Tsujii said that Dr. Keene was accepted by Japanese scholars because he has what Mr. Tsujii described as a warm, intuitive style of thinking that differs from what he called the coldly analytical approach of many Western academics. He said that this has made Dr. Keene seem even more Japanese than some of the Japanese novelists whom he has studied, like Mr. Mishima, an ultranationalist influenced by European intellectual fads.
''Keene-san is already a Japanese in his feelings,'' Mr. Tsujii said.
Now, at the end of his career, Dr. Keene is again helping Japanese regain their confidence, this time by becoming one of them. Dr. Keene, who retired only last year from Columbia, says he plans to spend his final years in Japan as a gesture of gratitude toward the nation that finally made him one of its own.
''You cannot stop being an American after 89 years,'' Dr. Keene said, referring to the age at which he got Japanese citizenship. ''But I have become a Japanese in many ways. Not pretentiously, but naturally.''

HEADLINE: Marathon Presses On Amid Backlash

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; David W. Chen and Mary Pilon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Two days before nearly 50,000 runners are scheduled to gather in Staten Island for the start of the New York City Marathon, opposition to the race continued to swell Friday and the Police Department, stretched thin from handling relief efforts, has called for department retirees to help with storm work and the marathon on Sunday.
Debate over whether to hold the race began soon after Hurricane Sandy hit the region Monday night. Critics have said that it is in poor taste to hold a race through the five boroughs while people are trying to cope with the storm's aftermath and that city services should focus on storm relief, not the marathon. Proponents of the marathon believe the race will provide a needed morale boost, as well as an economic one.
Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, was the latest in an increasingly long line of public officials to call for the marathon to be postponed or canceled. In a statement Friday, Stringer said that ''New York has experienced a tragedy of historic proportions'' and residents in many hard-hit areas of the city ''are struggling to keep body and soul together, deprived of basic essentials as temperatures drop.'' 
Stringer said the race should be postponed ''to focus all of the city's resources on the crucial task of helping our neighbors recover from this disaster.''
The likely Democratic candidates for mayor of New York have offered their opinions.
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and an ally of the mayor's, added her voice to a chorus of politicians calling for the race to be postponed or canceled. ''The decision to move forward with the marathon is not a decision I would have made,'' she said in a statement. ''That said, I think we need to look forward and continue to focus on the task at hand -- helping those without electricity, food and water and rebuilding our city.''
William C. Thompson said the race should be canceled because ''our neighbors are hurting and our city needs to make them its priority.'' John Liu, the comptroller, told Reuters that it should go on because ''it's a big economic generator.'' Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, who earlier in the week supported the decision to hold the race, reversed his view on Friday. ''The pain and suffering still unfolding in our neighborhoods is too deep for words,'' de Blasio said after touring Staten Island on Friday. He added, ''It's convinced me the needs are simply too great to divert any resources from the recovery.''
The comments by elected officials were echoed by thousands of people on social media. While some support Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's notion that the marathon can help get the city back on its feet, many others are disgusted that precious public resources will be used for a sporting event while millions of New Yorkers are without power, heat and food. Several online petitions and message boards have sprung up with thousands of signatures calling for the marathon to be postponed or canceled.
''This will forever tarnish the marathon as a brand and an event,'' said Stephen Robert Morse, a 27-year-old from Brooklyn who started stopthemarathon.tumblr.com. ''There are still thousands of people downtown and businesses that still lack necessities and it's insulting to have tourists prioritized over the people of this city.''
The New York State Nurses Association has also asked the mayor to postpone the race.
Bloomberg, aware that the marathon generates hundreds of millions of dollars for the city, has repeatedly said the race will go on. He did not expect the Police Department to be overly burdened because the race is on a Sunday, when street traffic is limited. Many parts of the city, including Lower Manhattan, are expected to have their power back, freeing other workers.
Responding to questions about whether police officers would be taken off relief efforts to work the marathon, the mayor said: ''There will be no diversion of resources. New York has to show we are here and we can recover.'' He added: ''You can grieve, you can cry and you can laugh all at the same time.''
The Police Department, meanwhile, has reached out to department retirees to help with storm work and the marathon. ''We would begin deployments starting with the NYC Marathon and other assignments to assist the Department thereafter,'' the department's personnel bureau wrote in an e-mail to retirees.
Roy Richter, president of the New York Police Department Captains Endowment Association, said that in a normal year, maintaining order at the marathon ''is a tremendous tax on the resources on the Police Department.'' The police presence at this year's race will be smaller than in the past ''because of the severe strain on the department right now,'' said Richter, who was living in a shelter in Rockaway because his home in Breezy Point, Queens, was destroyed.
While he was confident that the police officers at the race would do a good job, those officers would not be able to work in the ''tremendous number of diverse communities that have been devastated,'' he said.
In a typical year, about 1,000 full-time police officers and 500 auxiliary officers are stationed along the 26.2-mile course, which touches all five boroughs. (New York Road Runners, which puts on the race, also hires private security for the race.) But many officers are now working 12-hour shifts maintaining order in hard-hit neighborhoods, at gas stations and elsewhere. Some officers themselves may be without power at home, compounding the strain.
''They would be lucky to get the 500 auxiliary cops this time, especially if they don't have their uniforms because their homes were washed-out,'' said one retired police officer who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. Many retired officers might not have kept their uniforms even before the storm, he added. ''It's not like there are nasty crowds at the marathon, but with crowd control, you get the usual frustration.''
Working traffic detail at the race is only one role the Police Department fills. Teams of officers must also supervise the installation of barriers along the course as well as posting signs telling residents to remove their cars. In the hours before the race, illegally parked cars are towed.
Mary Wittenberg, chief executive of New York Road Runners, defended Bloomberg's decision to hold the race, saying it would be used as a platform to lift spirits and raise money. Her organization plans to donate $1 million, or $26.20 for every runner who starts the race, to relief efforts in the city. The Rudin Family and ING, two sponsors of the race, will donate a combined $1.6 million to storm relief. Road Runners is working to donate other supplies to relief efforts.
George Hirsch, the chairman of the board of Road Runners, acknowledged that running the marathon could be viewed as trivial and even a drain in light of the devastation in and around New York. But he expected the race to galvanize the city much as it did after the terrorist attacks in September 2001.
''I understand the controversy completely and respect all the views on this, but any decision that was made by the mayor would have been controversial and to call off the race would have been equally controversial,'' Hirsch said. ''By Sunday afternoon, there won't be any controversy. People will view it as an early step in the city's recovery.''
New York's marathon is the world's largest, but this year the race will be noticeably smaller. Hirsch said he expected about 40,000 runners to begin the race, about 15 percent below what had initially been expected.
Wittenberg said Road Runners had ''essentially canceled'' nearly everything on its calendar before the marathon, including a youth event Thursday, the opening ceremony in Central Park on Friday and the Dash to the Finish Line 5K on Saturday, which would have been run through Midtown.
Some runners are torn about taking part. Simon Ressner, a lieutenant in the Fire Department, said that police officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians are often needed unexpectedly in a disaster situation like this one. He noted that at least four police officers were at a gas station that he passed Thursday on the way to evaluate the safety of the burned homes in Breezy Point. About 300 people had gathered to fill their gas cans, and the police officers were there to control the crowd.
''There's a concrete example of why you need all the city resources available right now,'' said Ressner, who added that he was 80 percent sure he would run Sunday. ''I've written two e-mails to the Road Runners saying, 'Just postpone it.' That way, you'll still get the money, you'll still have a high-profile event, but it would show that you're being sensitive. But now, we're not going to show the world we're resilient, we're going to show them we're selfish.''
First responders are not the only ones questioning the wisdom of holding the race. People on Staten Island are particularly angry that their borough is being used as a jumping-off point for the race while critical services for those stranded by the storm are not getting through.

HEADLINE: Rising Estimates of Costs Of Storm Weigh on Wall St.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Shaken by Hurricane Sandy and unmoved by a solid October jobs report, stocks fell sharply Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 139 points as details about the storm's costs began to emerge.
Verizon Communications, whose Lower Manhattan operations are still without power, said the storm would have a significant effect on its fourth-quarter earnings. Verizon said it could not yet estimate the cost of the storm, which downed cell towers across the region. Shares of Verizon fell 62 cents, to $44.52.
''The information coming out from the economic impact of Sandy is a negative,'' said Rob Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass. ''I think the markets are trying to digest that and understand that, so there is a little bit of uncertainty.'' 
Insurers, the group that will feel the storm's effects most acutely, plunged as analysts warned that the storm will eat into their income. Raymond James analysts lowered their estimates for Allstate, while Barclays analysts cut theirs for Hartford Financial Services.
The chairman of Hartford, Liam McGee, told investors in a conference call that the storm's costs were just beginning to come into focus. ''It's much too early for us to provide data with any level of certainty,'' he said.
Shares of Hartford fell 66 cents, or 3 percent, to $21.26. Allstate dropped 49 cents, or 1.25 percent, to $38.56. The American International Group plunged $2.52, or 7.16 percent, to $32.68. Genworth Financial dropped 16 cents, or 2.57 percent, to $6.06.
After a day of steady selling, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 139.46 points, or 1.05 percent, at 13,093.16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 13.39 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,414.20. The Nasdaq composite index lost 37.93 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,982.13.
The day started with a burst of hope: In the last big piece of economic news before the presidential election on Tuesday, the Labor Department said employers added 171,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent. More jobs were added in the previous two months than was first reported, the government said.
European stocks rose on the news and American stocks opened higher. The Dow gained as much as 57 points in the first half-hour of trading. After that, the indexes commenced a steady slide.
All 10 categories in the S.& P. 500 were lower by the end of the day. Consumer discretionary stocks had the narrowest loss.
The Internet travel sites Priceline.com and TripAdvisor were among the S.& P. 500's top gainers. The companies surprised investors with better-than-expected third-quarter earnings after the market closed on Thursday. TripAdvisor rose $5.71, or 19.42 percent, to $35.12. Priceline added $48.64, or 8.3 percent, to $634.74.
Starbucks rounded out the S.& P. 500's top three gainers, adding $4.22, or 9.05 percent, to $50.84. The company said late Thursday that global revenue at cafes open at least a year rose 6 percent during its fiscal fourth quarter, which runs from July through September.
Shares of Restoration Hardware, the home-decor retailer, shot up $7.10, or 30 percent, to $31.10, in their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Interest rates were barely changed. The Treasury's 10-year note was up 4/32, to 99 6/32, and the yield fell to 1.72 percent from 1.73 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Being Elected Is No Shield Against Money Woes

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Right or wrong, many voters think their elected representatives are above it all financially.
With their salaries of $174,000 (or more for those in leadership roles), senators and members of Congress are paid more than most of us. These days, many of them need enough money in the first place to jump-start their campaigns.
But there have to be some lawmakers who have suffered as much as many of their constituents in the last four years, have changed the way they legislate because of it and learned some lessons worth sharing, right?
Representative Robert Turner, a Republican from New York City, lost his house in a fire after the storm this week. So for him the wound is still raw. 
Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who may have the lowest net worth of the 100 senators, sold his home in a short sale. I hoped to speak to him about it, but his media representative, Brian Phillips, said in an e-mail that my column idea ''has to be the silliest thing I've ever heard.''
Then there is Representative Joe Walsh, a freshman Republican who represents the suburbs northwest of Chicago. He proudly claims the mantle of America's poorest congressman, telling Chicago magazine that he's ''No. 1 in poverty.'' In the last few years, he's had to answer for his tax liens, a foreclosure and an accusation that he owed more than $117,000 in past-due child support.
What do we see of ourselves in him? And what does his opponent's efforts to brand him a deadbeat tell us about what we ought to be willing to tolerate in our elected officials?
There isn't much in the historical record on these questions, but one example from 20 years ago is instructive. That was when the public learned that many members of Congress were helping themselves to free overdrafts from banklike government accounts.
Voters who had no such privileges at their own local banks weren't pleased. Within one election cycle, according to Gary C. Jacobson, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, and Michael A. Dimock, then a graduate student at the university, who later published an academic paper about the scandal, the worst abusers were about three times as likely not to be in Congress anymore as incumbents who steered clear of the issue. This was equally true of Republicans and Democrats, though Democrats were the more egregious of the two parties in this instance.
It wasn't until after Mr. Walsh won his Republican primary in 2010 that some of his biggest financial troubles emerged. He triumphed with the help of strong Tea Party backing. And given his call for fiscal restraint, it was only natural that local reporters would look at his personal finances.
Sure enough, right after the primary, The Daily Herald discovered that Mr. Walsh had recently lost a condominium to foreclosure. ''This experience helped me gain a better appreciation for the very real economic anxieties felt by Eighth District families, many of whom are just a paycheck or two away from facing similar difficulties,'' Mr. Walsh told the paper via e-mail.
Voters fed up with the goings-on in Washington seemed to empathize with this and revelations of tax liens he dealt with more than a decade ago, or at least they were willing to hold their noses and look past it. He beat the Democratic opponent in his race by just a couple of hundred votes.
But the revelations didn't end there. Last year, The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Representative Walsh's former wife had filed court papers seeking more than $117,000 in what she claimed was past-due child support. She also said that he failed to make his payments at the same time that he was personally lending money to his campaign, putting politics over paternity, in effect. Representative Walsh countered that there was a verbal agreement between him and his former wife that allowed him to skip the monthly payments because he wasn't earning much money at the time.
Earlier this year, the two resolved the dispute and issued a joint statement saying that ''we now agree that Joe is not and was not a 'deadbeat dad' and does not owe child support.''
At the time of the initial revelation, Representative Walsh's lawyer, R. Steven Polachek, told The Sun-Times that he'd ''had no more problems with child support than any other average guy.''
About 40 percent of the 500,000 or so child support cases that the Illinois Department of Health Care and Family Services handles involve late payments at any given moment. The half-million cases tend to involve households with lower income, according to a spokesman, where there may be more frequent income disruptions.
Whether the questions about Representative Walsh's child support make him Everyman or not, however, it's the original suggestion that he prioritized his campaign over his children that may give voters the most pause.
His most ardent supporters continue to defend him. ''It stinks that he couldn't help, but I think it all got blown up more than it should have,'' said Laurie Jenner, the coordinator for the McHenry County Tea Party, which helped elect him in 2010. ''It's not like those kids were starving. I think that if there had been a bigger issue there, then maybe he would have gotten a second job or done something else.''
But his opponent in the coming election, Tammy Duckworth, invoked the ''deadbeat dad'' phrase in a campaign ad. The use of that phrase so enraged Representative Walsh's eldest son, Joe Walsh Jr., that he held a news conference and filmed his own ad. In it, he said that his father was ''terrific'' and that he and his siblings ''never wanted for anything.''
I would have liked to ask Representative Walsh about all of this, but his spokesman, Justin Roth, responded to my invitation by asking whether he should have the congressman call me or whether he should ask Ms. Duckworth to do so, ''since it seems you are just writing their narrative.''
In fact, Ms. Duckworth wouldn't talk to me either. Perhaps she's embarrassed about feeling the need to fling dirty words like ''deadbeat'' around. After all, the term implies intent, and we tend to think of most deadbeats as lowlifes.
But to Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S.D., who emphasizes the psychological side of money in his practice, Representative Walsh's personal finance pattern looks more like a symptom of a chronic behavior problem than the act of a deliberately reckless man.
Mr. Kahler, a libertarian who tends to vote for Republicans, says he is not repulsed by Representative Walsh and his actions, nor does he feel pity, since that would imply condescension. Instead, he feels sadness. ''I think people like that are in a lot of emotional pain,'' he said.
We can only know so much about a person's inner life before deciding whether to vote for them. And it may well be that a sizable regular paycheck has helped mend the finances of Representative Walsh, who changed jobs frequently before his election to Congress and has few assets, according to his most recent financial disclosure forms.
Voters must take in what they know about any candidate's personal finances and then address a deeply personal question that is anything but rhetorical. ''The question,'' said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, ''is if you can do the public's business if you can't even manage your own.''

HEADLINE: Citing Logistics, N.H.L. Cancels Winter Classic

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The N.H.L. on Friday canceled the Winter Classic, the outdoor game that is its signature regular-season event, two months before it was scheduled to be played, on Jan. 1.
It was the latest and the most significant cancellation of the nearly seven-week lockout, which has wiped out the league schedule for October and November.
The game, between the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs, was to be played at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, with an expected world-record crowd of up to 115,000. The league said the game between the teams would instead be played at Ann Arbor on Jan. 1, 2014. 
''The logistical demands for staging events of this magnitude made today's decision unavoidable,'' said Bill Daly, the N.H.L. deputy commissioner. ''We simply are out of time.''The Winter Classic, televised on NBC since the first game on 2008, has been perhaps the N.H.L.'s biggest success story as it recovered from the lockout that eliminated the 2004-5 season and the fan apathy that preceded that lockout. The Winter Classic produced millions of dollars in revenue for the N.H.L., drew four of its five biggest regular-season TV audiences since the 1970s and generated invaluable publicity for a league trying to reclaim its place among the big four of North American team sports.
Also canceled was a slate of related outdoor games at Comerica Park in Detroit, called the Hockeytown Winter Festival, starting Dec. 27. The event included the Great Lakes Invitational, with four N.C.A.A. games featuring Michigan, Michigan State, Western Michigan and Michigan Tech; an Ontario Hockey League doubleheader; an American Hockey League game between the top farm clubs of the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs; and two Dec. 31 games between Wings and Leafs alumni. Some of the games will be moved indoors.
The league's announcement Friday cited the construction of rinks at Michigan Stadium and Comerica Park for the early cancellation, as well as travel and hotel commitments for games involving teams from various leagues.
''The combined events were preparing to welcome nearly 400,000 guests to Detroit and Ann Arbor over the holiday period,'' the statement said.
The Great Lakes tournament will be moved indoors to Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on Dec. 29 and 30, and the O.H.L. and A.H.L. games will be reassigned as regular home games for the teams involved. But the alumni games were canceled until next season. HBO's ''24/7,'' the reality series about the participating teams that precedes the Classic, also will not happen this season.
Brian Cooper, the president of the Toronto sports management company S&E Sponsorship Group, said the cancellation of the Classic would cost league sponsors between $3 million to $3.5 million, and set the economic impact on Detroit and Ann Arbor at tens of millions of dollars.
Daly said in an e-mail that rescheduling the game at Michigan Stadium was ''not something we are considering doing,'' even though the stadium will not be used through the winter. Under the N.H.L.'s $3 million contract with the University of Michigan for renting the stadium, the league will forfeit only $100,000 by canceling the Winter Classic before Saturday.
The league estimated that it had lost about $800 million in revenue as a result of the lockout, with 26.5 percent of the regular-season schedule gone. Only the Winter Classic was affected by Friday's announcement; the rest of the schedule from Dec. 1 remains.
Daly told The Canadian Press he expected the league and the N.H.L. Players' Association to resume negotiations in the near future, and that he was discussing details of where and when to meet with the union's special counsel, Steve Fehr. The last bargaining session between the sides was Oct. 18.
Red Wings forward Danny Cleary told the Michigan Web site MLive.com that he was ''almost in disbelief'' at the cancellation of the Winter Classic. Red Wings defenseman Ian White said, ''I think we've already had some damage that won't be able to be undone to our sport.''
The loss of the Winter Classic is ''momentum interruptus'' for the N.H.L., Cooper said.
''In the U.S. they were doing so well,'' he said, about the N.H.L.'s growth over the last few years. He also cited the loss of momentum from last season's Stanley Cup triumph by Los Angeles, a major media market newly excited about hockey after ignoring it for decades. ''Any marketing expert will say that when you have a great product that has a great reputation, and then it's out of sight and has a negative taint to it, it's tough coming back.''
The window for the Winter Classic's status as an economic boon for the N.H.L. may be closing. The event will soon be competing with the new college football playoff system, which will have semifinals played on Dec. 31 or Jan. 1 in the 2014 season.
''For the last few years, Jan. 1 was a date in the holiday calendar that the N.H.L. controlled,'' Cooper said. ''With the Winter Classic, they were getting beyond the average core fan. They were getting to the casual fan.''

HEADLINE: Royal Bank of Scotland Braces for Libor Penalties

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
8:53 a.m. | Updated
LONDON -- Royal Bank of Scotland said on Friday that it would probably face financial penalties connected to a broad investigation into rate-rigging, as the bank reported a net loss in the third quarter of the year.
The bank, which is 81 percent owned by the British government after receiving a bailout during the recent financial crisis, is the latest British firm to disclose legal troubles this week. 
On Wednesday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the United States recommended a $470 million fine against Barclays related to past energy trading activity in the firm's North American operations. The bank said it would defend itself against the allegations. Barclays and a local rival, the Lloyds Banking Group, also disclosed that they had set aside additional money to compensate clients who had been inappropriately sold insurance.
Royal Bank of Scotland's legal woes relate to a broad industry investigation into potential rate-rigging.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department and other authorities around the world are looking into whether big banks tried to influence benchmark rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle charges that it tried to manipulate Libor to improve profits and make its financial position look stronger.
Royal Bank of Scotland, which is based in Edinburgh, said on Friday that it expected to enter into negotiations with authorities about a potential settlement in the near future. The firm's chief executive, Stephen Hester, declined to say when those talks might begin or how big the potential fine could be. Mr. Hester said the that bank was likely to make an announcement over the matter before reporting its next earnings on Feb. 28.
"We have to dance to the tune of the relevant regulators," Mr. Hester said in a conference call with journalists.
Royal Bank of Scotland faces a broader set of troubles.
On Friday, the bank said it posted a net loss of £1.4 billion, or $2.3 billion, in the three months through Sept. 30 after setting aside more money to compensate customers who were inappropriately sold insurance and taking a charge on its own debt. The bank reported a £1.2 billion net profit in the same period last year after it benefited from a financial gain on its own debt.
Without the adjustments, its pretax profit in the third quarter rose to just over £1 billion, compared with £2 million in the same period last year.
Analysts said Royal Bank of Scotland had made great strides to reduce its exposure to risky assets and pare back its balance sheet since the financial crisis began. Yet continued weakness in its underlying performance, coupled with expected future losses in the fourth quarter related to one-off charges like a potential Libor fine, remains a concern.
"The management has made good progress," said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec Securities in London. "But for me, the bank's earnings outlook hasn't improved."
Royal Bank of Scotland shares fell 1 percent in morning trading in London. Stock in the bank has risen almost 22 percent so far this year.
The British bank said it had made a new provision of £400 million to reimburse clients who were sold payment protection insurance, which covered customers if they were laid off or became ill. Many customers did not know they had been sold the insurance when they took out loans or mortgages. Others have found it difficult to make claims on the policies, which often paid out only small amounts.
In total, the bank said it had now set aside a combined £1.7 billion to compensate customers. Britain's banks, including Barclays and HSBC, have made total provisions worth almost £11 billion to reimburse clients, and analysts say that figure may rise to £15 billion.
"All of the banks have been guilty of underestimating the response rate," to payment protection insurance, Bruce Van Saun, chief financial officer of R.B.S., told reporters on Friday.
In an effort to repay the British government's bailout, the bank has been trying to sell assets and raise additional cash. Last month, the firm earned £787 million through the initial public offering of its insurance unit Direct Line. The bank failed to sell a number of its branches in Britain for around £1.7 billion, however, after Banco Santander of Spain backed out of the deal.
Despite the tough economic conditions across Europe, the bank said pretax profit in its investment banking unit reached £295 million in the third quarter, compared with a £348 million net loss during the same period last year. The bank has been scaling bank its risky trading activities through actions like closing or selling its cash equities unit and spinning off of its advisory business.
The number of employees in the investment banking division fell 5 percent, to 11,900, in the three months through Sept. 30. Earlier this year, the bank said it planned to layoff around 3,500 people in the unit.
The bank's retail and commercial banking unit continued to suffer from weak consumer confidence related to the European debt crisis. Pretax profit in the division fell 7 percent, to £1.1 billion, in the third quarter.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What Romney Has Said Offers Clues If He Wins

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- What would a President Romney have done?
For nearly four years, Mr. Romney has attacked President Obama's responses to the worst economic crisis since the Depression, the decisions that have defined the Obama presidency -- on the stimulus package, auto industry rescue, home-foreclosure measures and financial regulation.
Mr. Romney has been less clear about what action he would have taken instead. What follows are snapshots of his reactions then and now, which provide a sense of how he might have responded if he had been in the Oval Office and how he might approach economic policy should he be elected president on Tuesday.
STIMULUS Mr. Romney was an early advocate of some government action and criticized President George W. Bush for not seeking a stimulus measure before departing. But mostly he slammed Mr. Obama, within days of the inauguration, for the $831 billion package of spending and tax cuts that a Democratic-led Congress soon passed. He called it bloated with spending that would take too long to help the economy. (The total grew to $1.4 trillion as some provisions were renewed.) 
By the end of 2009 Mr. Romney declared the stimulus a costly failure, though nonpartisan studies found that it had helped create or support millions of jobs. He cited a weak recovery, slower than even the Obama administration's projections, and a stubbornly high unemployment rate.
But Mr. Romney's own prescriptions were mixed. In February 2009, as the stimulus bill was being enacted, he suggested $450 billion in tax cuts for middle-income Americans and federal money for unspecified ''urgent priorities.'' He called tax cuts ''twice as effective'' as spending for spurring the economy, a contention that many economists dispute.
That December, Mr. Romney called for Washington to pull back, though unemployment had hit 10 percent. ''Shrinking government and reducing government jobs is healthier for the economy, but this option was never seriously considered,'' he wrote.
His position mirrored that taken by many conservatives at the time in the United States and in Europe, which became something of a laboratory for the idea that Keynesian policy had been proven ineffective and that slashing spending and reducing deficits would lower interest rates, promote investment, shrink the government's interference in the marketplace and put the economy on a sounder footing for the long run.
Britain and other nations that adopted austerity policies encountered deeper economic troubles. In the United States, few nonpartisan economists support government austerity in a downturn. Mr. Romney, suggesting some belief in the central tenet of Keynesian economics -- that government spending can temporarily make up for a lack of demand in the private sector -- has subsequently said that he would enact budget cuts he supported with an eye toward whether the timing would have a negative impact on a still-weak recovery.
AUTO BAILOUT In late 2008 President Bush approved $25 billion in aid for General Motors and Chrysler. Ford, in better shape, declined aid but backed it for the others since liquidating two of the Big Three automakers would bankrupt many suppliers, imperiling Ford.
That help proved insufficient. Mr. Obama, advised by a task force he formed after taking office, forced G.M. and Chrysler through a government-managed bankruptcy, lending them $60 billion more so they could keep operating while restructuring. This amount, unlike the first, had to be repaid.
The decision was politically risky, given the growing populist backlash at the time to bailouts like those already given to banks. Mr. Romney opposed the actions by both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush to provide direct government aid to Detroit, and in November 2008, he wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times calling for the companies to be given new management and restructured through the bankruptcy process, with the prospect of government loan guarantees only afterward. He has defended that stance even as the bailout helped the companies return to profitability and add jobs.
Mr. Obama's plan also required a bankruptcy that forced new union contracts, new managers and investments in fuel-saving technologies. The difference was that Mr. Romney ruled out any bridge loan from taxpayers. He said the government should only guarantee private loans, and only when the companies emerged from bankruptcy. ''Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check,'' he wrote in the Op-Ed article.
But there was little if any private financing available to the automakers at the time. Romney ads this week in Ohio say the revived automakers are sending jobs to China, a charge the automakers have denounced as false. One ad ends, ''Mitt Romney has a plan to help the auto industry.'' It offers no details, but the Romney campaign has suggested that he would have built more safeguards into any bailout package against moving production from the United States to other countries and that his promised crackdown on China's trade and currency practices would have discouraged Chrysler from deciding to build Jeeps for the Chinese market in China rather than in the United States.
HOUSING The hangover of depressed home values and foreclosures since the housing bubble burst has been perhaps the biggest drag on the recovery, analysts say. Yet remedies are financially and politically complex, as Mr. Obama found. Polls show most Americans oppose bailouts for neighbors who got mortgages they could not afford or owe more than their homes are worth. Incentives for lenders to modify troubled mortgages have helped far fewer people than Mr. Obama predicted.
Until recently Mr. Romney offered a free-market alternative: do nothing. Last November in Nevada, the state with the highest foreclosure and jobless rates, he told The Las Vegas Review Journal: ''Don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom.''
Mr. Romney did express interest in then ''helping people refinance homes.'' And more recently he has seemed to suggest that the government policy could have some role in helping spur a recovery. Last week in Reno, he said, without elaboration, ''When I'm elected, we're going to finally get this housing market going.''
FINANCIAL REGULATION Mr. Romney has long proposed to ''repeal and replace'' the 2010 Dodd-Frank law tightening regulation of financial institutions. He has emphasized ''repeal'' and not defined a replacement. But Mr. Romney, who expressed general support for the role of regulation in the first presidential debate, has offered hints.
''There's some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world,'' he said. ''You need transparency, you need leverage limits.''
Past comments and language in his manifesto, ''Believe in America,'' suggest that Mr. Romney supports several objectives of Dodd-Frank: Authorizing the government to wind down failing institutions, to avoid a Lehman Brothers-like crash that threatens the system; requiring transparency for complex financial instruments like derivatives, and requiring institutions to keep a larger buffer of capital.
He has suggested support for some version of the new consumer-protection bureau, which Congressional Republicans opposed. While calling it ''perhaps the most powerful and unaccountable bureaucracy in the history of our nation'' in a statement in January, he also proposed ''to fix the flaws in this new bureaucracy.''
Mr. Romney often attacks Dodd-Frank for supposedly designating five banks as ''too big to fail,'' freeing them to take risks, confident of a bailout. ''We need to get rid of that provision,'' he said in the debate.
But if his position makes clear his opposition to the ''too big to fail'' concept, it ignores one thing: such a provision does not exist in the law.

HEADLINE: First Federal Money Is Dealt Out to States In Hurricane Aftermath

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The first trickle of federal funds has started to go out after Hurricane Sandy -- $29 million to rebuild highways, $30 million to hire temporary workers to help with the cleanup. But lawmakers are just beginning to tally what is certain to be a multibillion-dollar bill for the federal government at a time of fiscal restraint.
At least initially, New York, New Jersey and other states most affected by the storm will be spared the traditional fights in Washington over disaster assistance, thanks to a little-noticed provision in last year's budget agreement that arose from the debt-ceiling fight and resulted in Congress setting aside roughly $12 billion for disaster relief. 
The Federal Emergency Management Office has $7.5 billion to spend this fiscal year, and an additional $5 billion could be made available with no spending offsets required in other government programs.
While that will help in the short term, the East Coast states hit by the giant storm will almost certainly request billions in additional federal dollars, which would require appropriations by Congress and could set off partisan -- or geographic -- wrangling and stir longstanding concerns about fraud and waste.
New York state officials have already started to apply pressure on the federal government to cover a greater share of the rebuilding cost than is provided under the law, seeking 100 percent reimbursement for major infrastructure projects compared with the 75 percent automatically provided in major disasters. State officials have also talked of an ambitious new sea wall system, with a possible price tag of at least $10 billion, that could protect New York from a future superstorm.
''Our counties are responding to the continued impacts of multibuilding fires, tunnel closures, power losses to hospitals and other critical infrastructure, destroyed homes and sheltered populations -- all in the midst of historic flooding that has complicated emergency response operations exponentially,'' Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wrote to President Obama on Wednesday.
Lawmakers from New York and elsewhere, perhaps wary of any requests for new federal spending that could become political fodder, so far are playing down the need for additional money. But when pressed, they acknowledge that they could soon follow.
''I think there is a very good chance we are going to need more than that,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in an interview Thursday of FEMA's disaster-relief reserves. ''But the immediate needs are being taken care of without people looking over their shoulders.''
President Obama has pledged to speed federal aid to the hard-hit states, winning praise from state and local officials of both parties. But so far, the flow of money has been relatively modest in a disaster that economists estimate could leave up to $30 billion to $50 billion in damage, costs borne by individuals, businesses, insurers and the federal government.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved the distribution of more than $40 million in temporary housing aid and other assistance to 98,000 victims of the storm as of 3 p.m. Friday.
The government ultimately paid out more than $7 billion in so-called individual and household assistance in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, an indication of how the bill from Hurricane Sandy could skyrocket.
The Department of Labor, meanwhile, has already kicked in another $30 million to hire temporary workers to help with the cleanup, New York and New Jersey officials have announced. And the Department of Transportation has given what it calls ''quick release emergency funds'' totaling $29 million so far to five states, to help them start to rebuild roads, bridges, tunnels and other transportation infrastructure damaged in the storm.
But it is clear this is just the start of the federal costs.
After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the federal government eventually allocated at least $120 billion, including $14 billion to rebuild 350 miles of levees and flood walls around greater New Orleans.
Lawmakers and federal officials say they are determined to guard against fraud, which has marred past recovery efforts. Mispayments and fraud were estimated to cost at least $600 million in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
''Just as disasters bring out the best in most people, they bring out the worst in some,'' said Representative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania. ''We need to make sure disaster recovery funds go to the people who truly need them. Those who are found to commit fraud and abuse should be punished severely because they are taking money from those who truly need it.''
Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican, said during a debate in his re-election campaign on Tuesday that while he favored assistance to the battered states, they needed to come up with a plan on how to spend it. After Hurricane Katrina, he said, ''they spent it on Gucci bags and massage parlors and everything you can think of in addition to what was necessary.''
Officials at FEMA said this week that they were committed to trying to block abuses, citing computer systems that will compare home addresses given by victims with public databases to make sure that applicants are not filing false claims, while also using computer programs to attempt to ensure victims do not register twice for aid.
But it remains unclear if FEMA can meet the challenge. A report issued last year by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general noted that the agency had far too few employees dedicated to investigating fraud -- assigning just 6 people nationwide to the effort, compared with 21 in 2007.
''FEMA begs people to call and apply even if they are not sure they are eligible,'' the Inspector General's report said, quoting agency employees, about the push to sign up people for disaster aid.
FEMA's 2012 disaster-relief allocation will certainly be enough to cover the initial response, FEMA director W. Craig Fugate said this week. But the widespread flooding in areas where many residents do not have flood insurance will probably mean requests to the federal government to provide more federal financing to the government-backed flood insurance program, which already is facing a deficit.
FEMA is only authorized to provide each homeowner a maximum of about $30,000 in assistance, far short of the damage many of those without flood insurance have suffered.
''This is going to require a very substantial recovery effort,'' Mr. Fugate said on Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Adds 171,000 Jobs, More Than Estimated

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The American job market is looking a little stronger than had been feared just a few months ago, according to the government's final labor snapshot before the presidential election.
Whoever wins the election on Tuesday might even inherit an accelerating economy in 2013, if (and that is a big if) Congress is able to smooth over that pesky fiscal cliff in the few weeks after the election.
The nation's employers added 171,000 positions on net in October, the Labor Department reported on Friday, and more jobs than initially estimated in August and September. Hiring was broad-based, with just nearly every industry except state government adding jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 7.9 percent in October, from 7.8 percent in September, but for a good reason: more workers joined the labor force and so officially counted as unemployed.
None of this makes for a game-changer in the presidential race, analysts said. But it appeared to provide some relief for President Obama, whose campaign could have been sideswiped by bad news from the volatile monthly jobs report. With the latest numbers, the economy finally shows a net gain of jobs during his presidency. His record had previously been weighed down by huge layoffs in his first year in office after the financial crisis. 
The report also allayed widespread suspicion that September's plunge in the unemployment rate -- to below 8 percent for the first time since the month he took office -- might have been a one-month statistical fluke.
''Generally, the report shows that things are better than we'd expected and certainly better than we'd thought a few months ago,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist for Capital Economics. ''But we're still not making enough progress to bring that unemployment rate down significantly and rapidly.''
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement that the jobs report was evidence of the need to change the nation's economic policies.
''Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill,'' he said. He also noted that October's unemployment rate of 7.9 percent was higher than the 7.8 percent when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October of Mr. Obama's first year in office, and has been skidding downward very, very slowly since then.
Economists were hopeful that once the election was over and Congress addressed the major fiscal tightening scheduled for the end of this year, job and output growth could speed up further.
''If we can do this kind of job growth with all the uncertainty out there, imagine if we were to clear up those tax issues and hold back the majority of tax increases that are pending at the end of the year,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''We could do much better in 2013, maybe as well as we appeared to be doing earlier this year.''
The jobs snapshot for October was based on surveys conducted too early in the month to capture work disruptions across the East Coast caused by Hurricane Sandy. Economists expect that businesses and employment will resume their normal activity by the next jobs survey, in mid-November, and that some industries will even show an increase in hiring because of the storm.
''We had a lot of lost hours worked and production stuff still delayed, but much of that will be offset by hiring of emergency workers, government workers and construction, to do all that emergency fixing,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.
In October, the biggest job gains were in professional and business services, health care and retail trade, the Labor Department said. Government payrolls dipped slightly. State and local governments have been shedding jobs in most months over the last three years.
One of the low points of the report was in hourly wages, which remained flat in October after showing barely any growth in the previous several months.
''Perhaps the decline in real wages is a factor here in being able to employ more people,'' Mr. Ryding said. ''It's something to keep in mind when we think about creating jobs and whether we're maybe creating the wrong sort of jobs.''
A report from the National Employment Law Project, a liberal research and advocacy organization that focuses on labor issues, found that while the majority of jobs lost in the downturn were middle-income jobs, the majority of the jobs created since then had been lower-wage ones.
Stock markets opened higher after the jobs report on Friday, but fell for the day, apparently weighed down later by a number of concerns from the possible lingering effects of the storm to the uncertainty about the outcome of the election.
The United States has now posted job gains for 25 consecutive months, but the increases have been barely large enough to absorb the increase in the working population. About 12 million unemployed people remain waiting for work, with about two out of five of those people out of a job for more than six months.
That is in addition to more than eight million people who are working part time but really want full-time jobs.
''I'm not just competing against all the other people who are out of work,'' said Griff Coxey, 57, of Cascade, Wis., who was laid off in May from his controller job at a small business. ''I'm also competing against all those people who are actually working but are underemployed.''
Like two million other idle workers, Mr. Coxey is scheduled to lose his unemployment benefits the last week of the year, when the federal extensions expire. He said he still had some savings to fall back on, but many workers do not.
Labor advocates and many economists have been urging Congress to renew the benefits as part of their discussions of the ''fiscal cliff'' during their postelection session. So far, though, the issue has received little attention, and analysts worry that ending extended benefits could disrupt whatever forward momentum the economy has.
''Federal unemployment benefits are one of the most effective stimuli we have,'' said Christine L. Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project.
''The recovery is still fragile,'' she said, ''and to pull that amount of income and expenditure out of the economy -- particularly at a time when people thinking about the holiday season -- will have a significant impact on not just those individuals and their families, but the economy as a whole.''
Friday's jobs report was unlikely to affect policy from the Federal Reserve, which has pledged open-ended stimulus until the job market improves ''substantially.''
''The Fed desires both a substantial and sustainable improvement in labor market conditions and is likely to read recent payroll growth as a positive step in the right direction, but just one step in a longer journey,'' said Michael Gapen, director of United States research and global asset allocation at Barclays Capital.

HEADLINE: Personal Cost for 2 Senate Bids: $100 Million

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Elizabeth Maker, Jo Craven McGinty and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Linda E. McMahon's campaign for the United States Senate has been good for Bert Volpacchio, who received $494 for a meet-and-greet with about 40 local officials last May at his restaurant, the Hot Tamale, in Seymour, Conn.
It has been great for regular suppliers like Best Buy, Staples and BJ's Wholesale Club; for restaurants that have provided meals for volunteers like No Anchovies in Cromwell and the Sushi Palace in North Haven; for specialty businesses like Bayview Balloons of Milford, which got $830 just before the Republican primary; and for political operatives large and small.
Ms. McMahon may or may not get to influence job creation as a senator. But she has already made an impact on the Connecticut economy by dishing out close to $100 million for two Senate races over the past three years, far more than anyone has ever spent of their own money to win any federal seat. She has long since blown by the $72 million Ross Perot spent of his own money on presidential bids in 1992 and 1996. 
The result is akin to a medium-size business with roughly 200 employees, a network of 13 offices and a broad constellation of consultants, marketing experts and advertising firms that include a who's who of Republican handlers and has had a virtual monopoly in the race on the expensive New York City television market that reaches southern Connecticut. The biggest recipient thus far has been Scott Howell & Company, a Texas media consulting company, which received $24.7 million, mostly for advertising in her unsuccessful 2010 race against Richard Blumenthal, according to her campaign finance disclosure reports. She has spent at least $11 million on printing and postage.
Ms. McMahon's millions at the very least have taken her from an obscure businesswoman overshadowed by her husband in her own wrestling company into a ubiquitous political brand in Connecticut. But with recent polls seeming to show her Democratic opponent, Representative Christopher S. Murphy, with a small lead, whether her spending can produce a Senate seat in a strongly Democratic state remains unclear.
''It's bad enough to have 'super PACs' go around and spend whatever they want, but if you can just buy a Senate seat, I think that's outrageous,'' said Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former governor and senator who in 1982 became the last Republican elected to the Senate from Connecticut. He has endorsed Mr. Murphy.
But Ms. McMahon says that spending her own money leaves her -- unlike Mr. Murphy -- in no one's debt. ''In the Senate I will owe you, not the special interests who corrupt so many career politicians from Hartford to Washington,'' she says in one of her campaign ads.
Ms. McMahon's campaign manager, Corry Bliss, said her spending was not an issue for voters. ''The most important issue in this race is who has a plan to create jobs,'' he said. ''That's what people care about.''
Ms. McMahon spent almost $50 million, nearly all of it her own, in her 2010 race. She has already lent her current campaign $42.6 million, finance reports show. Candidates may raise money to pay back such loans, but it is quite likely that most of her loans will not be repaid.
She had outspent Mr. Murphy by more than four to one at the end of September, but her campaign notes that spending by unions and other outside groups supporting him narrowed that gap. (Outside groups, including the national parties, had spent about $8.5 million in support of Mr. Murphy and less than $1 million for Ms. McMahon through Thursday, according to campaign finance records.)
Her receipts vary from a $10.17 charge at the Dunkin' Donuts in West Hartford to huge advertising buys and media costs like a $1,260,806.25 payment on Sept. 28 to Mentzer Media Services, just one of several payments to Mentzer, which buys advertising and has been the biggest recipient of money in this race.
Some payments seem calculated to court constituencies, like those for ads or event sites to the Stamford Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the African-American Alliance of Hartford, the Caribbean World Chamber of Commerce in Fairfield, the West Indian Foundation in Bloomfield or the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in New Haven.
She has paid more than $900,000 in payroll taxes for campaign workers. She has spent more than $600,000 on paraphernalia like signs, balloons, T-shirts and bumper stickers.
But the biggest categories of expenditures, as with most campaigns, have been for consultants, pollsters, digital marketing experts and other political professionals.
The centerpiece of Ms. McMahon's campaign is her jobs plan; she says it would produce a positive impact on the federal budget of nearly $1.7 trillion over nine years. The numbers come from John Dunham & Associates of New York City, which bills itself as ''The Winning Side of Economics'' and got at least three payments totaling $56,258. Mr. Dunham is a former tobacco industry economist who works mostly for trade groups like the Beer Institute and the National Chicken Council. (In response, an ad that features President Obama praising Mr. Murphy's ''real record of job creation'' will start running on Saturday, The Associated Press reported.)
Her money has allowed her to employ an unusually broad range of political consultants, research and advertising firms, and to afford the most expensive television buys, including spots during the Olympics, the World Series and prime network news shows.
She has hired experienced A-list Republican operatives like Scott Howell, who cites his work with Lee Atwater and Karl Rove on his Web site, and McCarthy Hennings Media, which is best known for the Willie Horton ad going after Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race and which also works for Restore Our Future, the PAC backing Mitt Romney. And the campaign's senior consultant is Christopher J. LaCivita; he was media adviser to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, whose ads questioning John Kerry's military service played a critical role in the 2004 presidential election.
A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Mr. Murphy with a six-point lead, with particular gains among women and older voters. It found that 75 percent of likely voters said they had seen her ads very often and that 13 percent had seen them somewhat often. Most accepted her spending, but 38 percent of voters said they were very or somewhat concerned about it.
Laura Randall, of Fairfield, said that she had planned to vote for Ms. McMahon but that the campaign's barrage of advertising had turned her off, ''I swear, if I hear, 'I'm Linda McMahon and I approve this message' one more time...' '' she said with a grimace.
On Route 7 in New Milford, Doug Yeomans has posted a big, hand-painted sign on his property reading: ''TELL LINDA McMILLION$ YOUR VOTE IS NOT 4 SALE.''
''This is a true David and Goliath story,'' he said. ''I have never felt pressed to do something of this magnitude on my front lawn. But these are extraordinary times.''
Ray Dalton, who works nearby as an electrician, disagreed. ''When I saw that sign go up a couple days ago, I had to laugh,'' he said. ''So Linda McMahon has spent a pile of money on her campaign. So what? Who cares? That's what politicians do.''
He added: ''She has a burning desire to make things better. Why else would she want to spend that kind of money?''
Ms. McMahon lent her campaign another $3.3 million last week. One thing she has done differently this time is to finance a sophisticated turnout operation, including paid staff in minority neighborhoods that Republicans usually cede to Democrats. It could be especially important given the disruption caused by Hurricane Sandy, but otherwise the storm could blunt the impact of the advertising.
On NBC on Tuesday night, the news anchor Brian Williams said: ''In this part of the country, those who do have TV are seeing attack ads from a woman named Linda McMahon, who's running for Senate up in Connecticut -- airing like nothing had changed. Juxtaposed against the damage, it's just a very strange time.''
Mr. Bliss, the McMahon campaign manger, said Mr. Murphy and groups supporting him had also kept up some negative ads.
Asked how Ms. McMahon would feel if she spent close to $100 million of her own money and lost two elections, Mr. Bliss said, ''She is very proud of the race she's run, and has every intention of winning this race.''

HEADLINE: The Ultimate Zombie Idea

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And our corrupted discourse. 

 BODY:
Zombie ideas -- a phrase I originally saw in the context of myths about Canadian health care -- are policy ideas that keep being killed by evidence, but nonetheless shamble relentlessly forward, essentially because they suit a political agenda.
The controversy over the withdrawal by the Congressional Research Service of a report showing no connection between tax cuts for the rich and economic growth is a reminder that in U.S. politics, at least, the tax cuts/growth notion is the ultimate zombie idea.
I mean, when the CRS report first came out I didn't write about it because it was basically old news (which is not to criticize the report, which did a fine job of putting the evidence together). Nobody has ever been able to find clear evidence of a link between high-end tax cuts and growth. The raw fact, after all, is that the US economy did better in the first half of the post World War II era, with high top marginal rates, than it did in the second half: growth was both somewhat slower and much more unequal in the years after Reagan's 1981 cut than before.
And the tax-cut faithful have delivered one forecasting debacle after another. I'm old enough to remember not just the predictions that the Bush tax cuts would unleash a huge economic boom, but the claims that Clinton's 1993 tax hike would cause a deep depression. 
Yet the tax-cut dogma remains politically intact, and it is at the core of Romney's alleged plan for recovery.
There is, of course, no mystery here: just ask who benefits from the dogma that ever-lower taxes on the wealthy are just what we need, and you understand why there is always plenty of money for both economists and politicians who promote the dogma.
But it's kind of sad to realize that our public discourse is so obviously, nakedly corrupt.

HEADLINE: The Political Speechwriter's Life

BYLINE: ROBERT LEHRMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We don't get to use our names, but we do get to fight for our beliefs. 

 BODY:
Kurt Vonnegut once wrote that "only nut cases want to be president." But he helped me become a White House speechwriter. In 1965, Vonnegut was my adviser at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where I was studying fiction. One day, he said he could get me an assistantship, but I'd have to teach speech.
"I know nothing about speech," I said.
He said something like: "Learn. It's 1,800 bucks."
In class, Kurt had annoyed some students by boiling all fiction down to a diagram: "Get someone in trouble. Get them out!" he would say. "Man-in-the-hole!"
Right, Kurt. But I was in a hole. $1,800 would help.
Next fall, as the Vietnam War was heating up, I stayed one chapter ahead of my students. When I decided that politics mattered to me just as much as writing novels, I'd learned enough to become a speechwriter. But wait! Isn't speechwriting the sewage-filled, dumbed-down tributary of writing, designed to deceive and make inarticulate politicians seem smart?
No, because those charges fall far below even a half-truth. Political speechwriters trade the pleasure of writing under our own names for the power to help achieve policies we're passionate about and, of course, help elect people who favor them. Democratic and Republican speechwriters may differ on the content of the speeches, but we agree on the value of the writing. This is why at midnight, in any political office, you find writers adding detail to a paragraph, compressing a sentence and trying to create the runs of antithesis that bring crowds to their feet.
When I write speeches, I'm influenced by novels. I use story to move listeners. I also plant something in the opening and bring it back at the end, the way Anton Chekhov advised ("If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall..."), and I search for illuminating details, as Joseph Conrad urged ("My task is to make you hear, to make you feel, and, above all, to make you see"). But this hectic, collaborative life is nothing like the novelist's, especially when it comes to the nerve-jangling pressure to meet impossible deadlines.
Once, back in the '90s, when I wrote for Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic House majority whip, he said he wanted to do a one-minute speech. Something about the economy, he said. It was 11:50. "When do you speak?" I asked. "12:02."
I wrote a 150-word speech, called my mother to tell her if she turned on C-Span she'd see me on the House floor, ran up three flights and handed it to Mr. Bonior just as he was walking to the well.
It's tough to do great work when your first draft is often your last. It also can be difficult to make someone sound like Moses addressing the Israelites when you announce a three-point plan for reducing the deficit. And it's an art to write for a general American audience, which averages a seventh-grade reading level. It genuinely distresses some academics that politicians today speak many school grades below George Washington's Farewell Address. But a few years back researchers gave us a sense of what that seventh-grade level means. They tested adult, English-speaking hospital patients on some common directions about health, like the idiomatic sentence "Do not take this medicine on an empty stomach." Did patients understand it? More than 40 percent didn't.
To speechwriters that means, don't write sentences even that complex. You can't hand your boss a speech saying, "It's got all your ideas. But 40 percent of your audience won't know what you're talking about." Luckily, English is a rich language. Without losing nuance you can say a lot with simple words - use, not utilize; now, not currently - and simple sentences.
Speechwriters must help maintain what Aristotle called ethos, or character. Voters cast ballots not just for candidates they agree with, but for those they like. Are they compassionate? Humble? Optimistic?
To convey likability, politicians can't just point to problems. They need to propose solutions. Monroe's Motivated Sequence, the five-step structure most popular in political speech, has problem solving at its core. The most meaningful part of writing in politics is the attempt to make terrible problems real to listeners. But once we do that it's hard to convince people of our sometimes puny solutions.
Even if we do all of that well, we won't please everyone. If a president announces that the United States will invade Iraq or that he favors same-sex marriage, you can't expect those on the other side to appreciate your graceful turn of phrase.
In 1989 I wrote Senator Lloyd Bentsen's Democratic response to President George Bush's address to Congress. It's impossible for someone sitting alone in a room facing a single camera to match the glitzy presence of a president in a packed House chamber. The next morning I complained to my wife: 39 million people had watched Mr. Bush, but as soon as Mr. Bentsen started, 11 million turned off the television. Well, she said, gently, 28 million listeners were about 300 times as many people as had read all my novels.
Much of what lures speechwriters is the prospect of reaching so many people about ideas we think so important - as Peggy Noonan did for Mr. Bush in 1989 ("thousand points of light") ; Bob Shrum did for Edward M. Kennedy in 1980 ("the dream shall never die"); and Matt Scully did for Sarah Palin in 2008 ("If character is the measure in this election ...").
I have passed no bill, stopped no war, created no policy that would bring health insurance to a single person. But if we expect to see such results solely from our work, that dooms many to disappointment. There's plenty to celebrate about being part of the team.
As a speechwriter in the House, Senate and White House, I wrote about 25,000 words a month - as much as three books each year. I cherish the four novels I wrote. But I am also proud that when Al Gore spoke at Nelson Mandela's inauguration, he read my words. I've written a eulogy for Rosa Parks, speeches against a war I hated and for presidential candidates I loved. I've written about ways to educate children in the United States and to save the lives of children in Africa. At a Rose Garden event where Mr. Gore introduced President Bill Clinton, a photographer snapped a picture of Gore whispering to my son, "He wrote the president's speech, too."
So it would have been nice to tell Kurt how much more than 1,800 bucks I got out of his idea. He probably would have thought I put way too much faith in politics, though he would have been too nice to say it. If he picked up one of my speeches, would he have heard echoes of Conrad and Chekhov? Not likely.
But when he read through my problem-solution section he might have said what I now know is true of stories, speeches, speechwriting and, come to think of it, much of life. "Man-in-the-hole!!"
 Robert Lehrman, who was the chief speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore, is the author of four novels and "The Political Speechwriter's Companion" and teaches speechwriting at American University.

HEADLINE: Nov. 2: For Romney to Win, State Polls Must Be Statistically Biased

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: There were 22 polls of swing states published on Friday. President Obama led in 19 of them, two showed a tie and just one, a Mason-Dixon poll of Florida, showed Mitt Romney ahead. 

 BODY:
President Obama is now better than a 4-in-5 favorite to win the Electoral College, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast. His chances of winning it increased to 83.7 percent on Friday, his highest figure since the Denver debate and improved from 80.8 percent on Thursday.
Friday's polling should make it easy to discern why Mr. Obama has the Electoral College advantage. There were 22 polls of swing states published Friday. Of these, Mr. Obama led in 19 polls, and two showed a tie. Mitt Romney led in just one of the surveys, a Mason-Dixon poll of Florida. 
Although the fact that Mr. Obama held the lead in so many polls is partly coincidental - there weren't any polls of North Carolina on Friday, for instance, which is Mr. Romney's strongest battleground state - they nevertheless represent powerful evidence against the idea that the race is a "tossup." A tossup race isn't likely to produce 19 leads for one candidate and one for the other - any more than a fair coin is likely to come up heads 19 times and tails just once in 20 tosses. (The probability of a fair coin doing so is about 1 chance in 50,000.)
Instead, Mr. Romney will have to hope that the coin isn't fair, and instead has been weighted to Mr. Obama's advantage. In other words, he'll have to hope that the polls have been biased in Mr. Obama's favor. (I recognize that 'bias' is a loaded term in political contexts. I'll explain what I mean by it in a moment.)
There are essentially three reasons that a poll might provide an inaccurate forecast of an upcoming election.
The first is statistical sampling error: statistical error that comes from interviewing only a random sample of the population, rather than everyone. This is the type of error that is represented by the margin of error reported alongside a poll and it is reasonably easy to measure.
If you have just one poll of a state, the statistical sampling error will be fairly high. For instance, a poll of 800 voters has a margin of error in estimating one candidate's vote share of about plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. In a two-candidate race, however, the margin of error in estimating the difference between the candidates (as in: "Obama leads Romney by five points") is roughly twice that, plus or minus seven percentage points, since a vote for one candidate is necessarily a vote against the other one. 
The margin of error is much reduced, however, when you aggregate different polls together, since that creates a much larger sample size. In Ohio, for example, there have been 17,615 interviews of likely voters in polls conducted there within the past 10 days. That yields a margin of error, in measuring the difference between the candidates, of about 1.5 percentage point - smaller than Mr. Obama's current lead in the polling average there. 
In other words, Mr. Obama's current lead in Ohio almost certainly does not reflect random sampling error alone. The same is true in states like Iowa, Nevada, Wisconsin and others that would suffice for him to win 270 electoral votes. (Mr. Obama's more tenuous leads in Colorado and Virginia, and Mr. Romney's thin lead in Florida, potentially could be a product of sampling error.)
So why, then, do we have Mr. Obama as "only" an 83.7 percent favorite to win the Electoral College, and not close to 100 percent?
This is because of the other potential sources of error in polling. One is that a poll is a snapshot in time - even if you're sampling the voters accurately, their opinions could change again before Election Day. 
This is a huge concern if, for instance, you're conducting a poll in June of an election year. Michael Dukakis led the polls for much of the spring in 1988; John Kerry did so for some of the summer in 2004; even John McCain, in 2008, had a few moments when he may have been ahead in the polling average.
But it's now the weekend before the election. The vast majority of voters are locked into their choices. In some states, in fact, a fair number of them have already voted. (Perhaps about 20 percent of the vote nationwide has been cast, and the tally may be as high as two-thirds of the vote in some states like Nevada.)
Nor are there any more guaranteed opportunities for news or campaign events to intervene to alter the dynamics of the campaign, at least not at the national level. The debates have been held; the conventions occurred long ago; the vice-presidential nominees have been picked. The last major economic news of the campaign came on Friday, with the release of the October jobs numbers. A negative print on the payrolls report, or a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, could have altered the campaign, but instead the jobs report was a pretty good one. (I don't expect the jobs report to produce much of a boost for Mr. Obama, but there's little in the report that would aid Mr. Romney.) The recovery from Hurricane Sandy is still a developing story, but not one that seems to be playing to Mr. Romney's benefit. 
There is the remote possibility of a true "black swan" event, like a national-security crisis or a major scandal unfolding at the last minute, but the chance for news events to affect the campaign is now greatly diminished. And most of the polls that we've seen over the past several days are the last ones that polling firms will be releasing into the field.
That leaves only the final source of polling error, which is the potential that the polls might simply have been wrong all along because of statistical bias.
Polling is a difficult enterprise nowadays. Some estimate that only about 10 percent of voters respond even to the best surveys, and the polls that take shortcuts pay for it with lower-still response rates, perhaps no better than 2 to 5 percent. The pollsters are making a leap of faith that the 10 percent of voters they can get on the phone and get to agree to participate are representative of the entire population. The polling was largely quite accurate in 2004, 2008 and 2010, but there is no guarantee that this streak will continue. Most of the "house effects" that you see introduced in the polls - the tendency of certain polling firms to show results that are consistently more favorable for either the Democrat or the Republican - reflect the different assumptions that pollsters make about how to get a truly representative sample and how to separate out the people who will really vote from ones who say they will, but won't.
But many of the pollsters are likely to make similar assumptions about how to measure the voter universe accurately. This introduces the possibility that most of the pollsters could err on one or another side - whether in Mr. Obama's direction, or Mr. Romney's. In a statistical sense, we would call this bias: that the polls are not taking an accurate sample of the voter population. If there is such a bias, furthermore, it is likely to be correlated across different states, especially if they are demographically similar. If either of the candidates beats his polls in Wisconsin, he is also likely to do so in Minnesota.
The FiveThirtyEight forecast accounts for this possibility. Its estimates of the uncertainty in the race are based on how accurate the polls have been under real-world conditions since 1968, and not the idealized assumption that random sampling error alone accounts for entire reason for doubt. 
To be exceptionally clear: I do not mean to imply that the polls are biased in Mr. Obama's favor. But there is the chance that they could be biased in either direction. If they are biased in Mr. Obama's favor, then Mr. Romney could still win; the race is close enough. If they are biased in Mr. Romney's favor, then Mr. Obama will win by a wider-than-expected margin, but since Mr. Obama is the favorite anyway, this will not change who sleeps in the White House on Jan. 20.
My argument, rather, is this: we've about reached the point where if Mr. Romney wins, it can only be because the polls have been biased against him. Almost all of the chance that Mr. Romney has in the FiveThirtyEight forecast, about 16 percent to win the Electoral College, reflects this possibility. 
Yes, of course: most of the arguments that the polls are necessarily biased against Mr. Romney reflect little more than wishful thinking. 
Nevertheless, these arguments are potentially more intellectually coherent than the ones that propose that the leader in the race is "too close to call." It isn't. If the state polls are right, then Mr. Obama will win the Electoral College. If you can't acknowledge that after a day when Mr. Obama leads 19 out of 20 swing-state polls, then you should abandon the pretense that your goal is to inform rather than entertain the public.
But the state polls may not be right. They could be biased. Based on the historical reliability of polls, we put the chance that they will be biased enough to elect Mr. Romney at 16 percent.

 BODY:
 NEWS Chancellor Angela Merkel held talks Friday on developing a nationwide strategy on renewable energy with the governors of Germany's 16 states, at a time when energy prices are rising and the opposition is critical of her government's efforts. On the federal side, there is no single leader for the project to increase reliance on renewable energy to at least 35 percent by 2020; the Social Democratic Party has pounced on the weakness in the Merkel government's signature project ahead of national elections next year. Melissa Eddy reports from Berlin.
Last year, as many foreigners left Japan for fear of radiation from the Fukushima nuclear accident, Donald Keene, a New York-born scholar of Japanese literature, went the other way: He announced that he would apply for Japanese citizenship to show his support. The gesture made Dr. Keene, 90, a folk hero, and seems to have finally brought him the one thing that eludes many Westerners who make their home in Japan: acceptance. Martin Fackler reports from Tokyo.
A European economic report Friday confirmed a continuing slowdown in the euro zone's factories, even as Washington reported data indicating a moderate improvement in the American economy. David Jolly reports from Paris.
 ARTS Marie-Agnès Gillot is the first in-house female dancer to be given the chance to choreograph for the Paris Opera Ballet. Her new piece, "Sous Apparence," which opened Wednesday, shares a program with a major work by Merce Cunningham, enough to make far more seasoned choreographers quake. Roslyn Sulcas reports from Paris.
As China's soaring economy brings about a transformation of the market for Chinese art, a porcelain show at Eskenazi, the leader in Chinese art from the late second millennium B.C. to the 15th century, uncharacteristically deals with a more recent period. Souren Melikian reports from London.
 SPORTS The four leading men in tennis have divided up the best of the 2012 loot, but one big prize remains: The Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, which begin Monday in London, which are behind only the four Grand Slam tournaments when it comes to clout. Christopher Clarey reports.
 In late September, Lewis Hamilton surprised the world of Formula One when he announced that he would leave McLaren for Mercedes, severing a special relationship with a team he has described as his family. Although the 24 Formula One drivers who are preparing to race in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday seek job security like any other company employee, it is likely that none envision staying with the same team throughout their career. Few drivers with long careers have done so. Brad Spurgeon reports.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and a look at the president's weekly address, plus the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy is threatening to create Election Day chaos in some places, but the expected disruptions are considered unlikely to change the outcome of the presidential election, Michael Cooper reports. The biggest impact is likely to be on state and local races.

        
Campaigns are now using a strategy that targets a little-scrutinized variable of election results: the influence that spouses can have on each other's voting decisions, John Harwood writes. In a skin-tight presidential race, pillow talk and kitchen-table discussions could make a difference to each party's bid to close its gender gap in battleground states.

        
The commander in chief who was comforting the nation a few days ago has been replaced by a political warrior, accusing Mitt Romney at every stop of dishonesty for claiming that the president's auto industry bailout resulted in jobs moving to China, Mark Landler reports.

        
Mr. Romney gave a speech in Wisconsin on Friday that was a departure from his usual stinging attacks on President Obama, choosing instead to name specific pieces of legislation that he would introduce in office and making an explicit case for his own lengthy résumé, Michael Barbaro and Ashley Parker report.

        
Presidential campaigns overshadow Congressional contests, often leaving Senate and House candidates largely to their own devices, Jonathan Weisman writes. Since neither presidential candidate is focusing on the down-ballot races, the winning Congressional candidates may not feel the need to repay the man who wins the White House with the sort of loyalty and gratitude that can smooth a legislative agenda once the new terms begin.

        
Jackie Calmes has cataloged a snapshot of Mr. Romney's reactions to the economic crisis to provide a sense of how he might have responded had he been president and how he might approach policy should he be elected.

        
A last-minute burst of below-the-radar cash has begun flooding the national elections in the last days of the race, advertising in contests that could determine control of the Senate and exploiting a loophole that keeps their donors anonymous until long after the votes are counted, Nicholas Confessore and Derek Willis report.

        
 The Federal Emergency Management Office has distributed $40 million in Hurricane Sandy relief aid since Friday afternoon, but lawmakers are expecting a multibillion-dollar bill for the federal government at a time of fiscal restraint, Eric Lipton and Jennifer Steinhauer report.
 Weekly Address 

        
President Obama used his weekly address to offer words of comfort to those affected by the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, and to ask that the nation pray for the storm's victims. "And as president, I promise them this: your country will be there for you for as long as it takes to recover and rebuild," he said. "Our number-one concern has been making sure that affected states and communities have everything they need to respond to and recover from this storm." He vowed not to let "red tape and bureaucracy" get in the way of the recovery and thanked a number of citizens for their heroism when the storm was darkest. "We're Americans. When times are tough, we're tougher. We put others first. We go that extra mile," he said. "We recover, we rebuild, we come back stronger - and together we will do that once more."
 Happenings in Washington

        
Supporters of financing for public broadcasting will hold a Million Puppet March on the National Mall on Saturday.

        
Madame Tussauds Wax Museum will let children cast their own ballots while learning about the election process Saturday morning.

        
Ralph Nader will moderate the Alternative Parties Debate with candidates from the Libertarian, Green, Constitution and Justice Parties on Sunday night.

HEADLINE: America's Leftward Tilt?

BYLINE: DREW WESTEN


HIGHLIGHT: There is only one pole in American politics today, and its magnetic field is so powerful that it has drawn both parties in the same direction - rightward. 

 BODY:
The presidential election is now a close contest, but barring an Electoral College tie, someone is going to win, someone is going to lose, and both sides will have to make sense of it all.
The obvious story line of this election, whoever wins, is that Americans want pragmatic solutions to the relentless distress they have experienced for over a decade, whether that means a more active or a more passive government. They are looking for anyone who can provide a coherent vision of how to fix an economy that is not working for people who work for a living. But rather than a victory for pragmatism, we may well see both the winners and losers take away a very different lesson: that this election was a mandate for another shift to the right.
If Mitt Romney loses, conservatives will no doubt conclude that he just wasn't conservative enough, that they should have picked someone more appealing to their base. If President Obama loses or squeaks out a victory just four years after President George W. Bush destroyed the economy (which should have discredited conservative economics once and for all), many Democrats are likely to conclude that he tried to move too left too fast when he pushed for a stimulus and health care reform for which Americans were simply not ready, rather than that he simply sold both programs poorly (something he now acknowledges).
Similarly, whichever candidate wins, the first order of business will be deciding which programs to cut - unless a deal to prevent us from going over the fiscal cliff is reached during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election. Most voters intuitively understand that jobs and deficits are linked - too much of an emphasis on deficits leads to too few jobs - because working people with money in their wallets drive demand, whereas wealthier people with money in their wallets drive Jaguars (and send the rest of their income to their hedge fund managers). Even in the heart of red America, people understand that high unemployment and income disparities of the magnitude we are now witnessing are bad for economic growth.
But you have to speak in a way that brings out their inner Keynes, as I discovered when testing the following message in the Deep South: "The only way to cut the deficit is to put Americans back to work." That message beat the toughest austerity message by over 30 points.
The reality is that our government hasn't become this dysfunctional because the parties are so "polarized." It's because there is only one pole in American politics today, and its magnetic field is so powerful that it has drawn both parties in the same direction - rightward. And it is in that same direction that the magnetic field of contemporary American politics is likely to pull the stories the two parties tell after the election - and the policies the winner pursues.
The data, however, suggest just the opposite - that both candidates have benefited in the general election every time they have taken a left turn. President Obama was in deep political trouble 15 months ago when he cut the closest thing he could to a "grand bargain" with House Speaker John A. Boehner to slash the federal budget by trillions, and he did nothing for his popularity nine months earlier when he extended the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy. Not until he began talking like a populist did he begin picking up steam in the polls. Indeed, one of the most powerful messages the Democrats chose not to use in the 2010 midterm elections - which would have supported a policy that was extremely popular then and remains as popular now - was a simple message on taxes I tested nationally, which won in every region and with every demographic, including Tea Partyers: "In tough times like these, millionaires ought to be giving to charity, not getting it." Once that position (and other populist appeals) became central to Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, the election looked like it would be a rout.
BUT then in the first debate, Mr. Romney moved to the center, taking back his promise of tax cuts for the rich and proposing instead to let people choose which tax deductions they wanted to take (for their home mortgages, for example) but limiting the amount that can be deducted. Perhaps understandably, the president didn't know what to do with a Republican challenger who was outflanking him half the time on his left, and suddenly the race was competitive again. For both men, a pragmatic left-hand turn helped them steer their way toward a middle class desperate for hope.
This should have come as no surprise. A majority of Americans still holds Bush accountable for the Great Recession, and with good reason. We are still breathing the fumes of his toxic brew of deregulation, massive transfers of wealth to the rich and a doubling of the national debt. His policies, and those of a Republican Congress that had its way with the economy for six years, were in fact the culmination of a right-wing ideological revolution led by Ronald Reagan, which changed the way Americans view their government. Mr. Reagan's shadow continues to loom large, because Democrats have yet to make the case for a compelling alternative and have too often accepted the premises of the right.
There are, of course, differences in how both sides view the role of government. But too often the consensus among the parties is that the solution to what ails us is deficit cutting and attacks on, or failure to support, the unions that gave us the weekend, 20th-century benefits and the eight-hour day. Both candidates have implicitly or explicitly blamed "public employees" with their "bloated pensions" and waste-filled jobs for our economic woes (with Mr. Obama sending a signal by freezing the pay of federal workers, as if tightening their belts would somehow loosen the noose around the Treasury).
The term "public employees" itself evokes faceless bureaucrats, rather than images of firefighters and police officers, E.P.A. scientists monitoring our air and water to protect our children's health, or the people who get up at the crack of dawn to pick up our trash. Both candidates have been as relentless in their attacks on teachers' unions as Mr. Reagan was with the air traffic controllers whom he summarily fired for going on strike. Both parties have seen the austerity so many Americans are feeling at the kitchen table and concluded that the answer to austerity is more austerity - with "grand bargains" and "sequestrations" that promise to undo the effects of a stimulus that virtually all economists agree kept us from falling deeper toward a depression in early 2009. Austerity has been a failure almost everywhere governments have tried it, with Spain, where one in four working people is no longer working, being the most recent example. Both parties preach the gospel of free trade, which polls poorly because ordinary Americans can see with their own eyes how we have freely traded the good American wages and benefits away.
SO what underlies this powerful pull to the right? Many factors, but two stand out. The first is campaign money. When Americans saw the scope of the savings and loan scandal in the 1980s, which today seems like just a bad day on the unregulated derivatives market, Ronald Reagan's attorney general, Edwin Meese III, put nearly a thousand bankers behind bars. In contrast, Mr. Obama's attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., can't seem to smell the stench of a fraud that cost millions of people their jobs or homes.
The second is an ideological vacuum. For years, even Republicans accepted the premises of the New Deal, which drew them leftward just as today's political winds blow everything in their path rightward. President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Interstate highway system. President Richard M. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither believed in the radical dismantling of programs that protected ordinary Americans, and both believed that a crucial role of government is to provide the infrastructure that makes economic prosperity possible.
Then came the conservative movement that ushered in Reagan, whose ideology has dominated our political discourse ever since, even after its proven failure. If Nixon and Bill Clinton were the last gasps of Roosevelt's breath, then Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama and perhaps Mr. Romney may well be the last gasps of Reagan's. If the centrifugal pull of the 2012 election is likely to be to the right, is there any potential counterweight?
Perhaps one: both presidential candidates want a legacy. The most important legacy Mr. Obama could have would be to spend his second term using executive orders, judicial appointments and the bully pulpit to return democracy to everyday Americans by demanding clean elections, uncorrupted by money. If Mr. Obama wins a close election on the strength of the country's changing demographics, he may feel a special responsibility to tackle the seemingly intractable problems that a second-term president can more easily address.
If Mr. Romney wins and wants a second term, he would be wise to wed an economic narrative about innovation with a narrative that will save his party from extinction by making comprehensive immigration reform a central item on his agenda. If Mr. Romney succeeds in reviving a moderate Republicanism that recognizes that an increasingly interconnected world will require an increasingly diverse work force, he could potentially drag his party into the 21st century.
In other words, if the candidate who wins takes a left turn like the one that won him the presidency, the Reagan era would finally be over. We can only hope.

HEADLINE: This Little Rothko Went to Market

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years ago, just three weeks after Black Monday -- the worst one-day plunge in stock market history -- Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art topped $100 million for the first time, a 45 percent increase from six months before. During times of financial uncertainty collectors with cash have parted with untold millions of dollars, putting their liquid assets into Picassos and Giacomettis, Rothkos and Warhols.
When the big fall auction season in New York starts on Wednesday, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips de Pury & Company are hoping that the flight from cash into art will continue given the financial uncertainty in the United States and especially in Europe. The catalogs are bursting with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of paintings, drawings and sculptures, many of which are being sold by collectors hoping to take advantage of the growth in the global art market. 
American collectors in particular are among this fall's biggest sellers. Unsure of what the political future holds, they have decided to sell art now, fearing that capital gains taxes on fine art could rise from their current 28 percent, already higher than the 15 percent federal rate on the gains from selling stocks and bonds.
''That concern is what accounts for more discretionary selling this fall,'' said Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. ''Collectors are looking closely at their assets and evaluating their collections.''
Although the October auctions in London timed to coincide with the Frieze Art Fair there were bumpy, Marc Porter, chairman of Christie's in the Americas, pointed out that while the stock market has seen a 3 percent drop since September, the art market -- both at auction and in private sales -- has ''remained robust'' with a marked increase in new buyers.
Sellers during the next two weeks include many of the art world's savviest collectors, among them the hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen; the newsprint magnate Peter M. Brant; the casino owner Stephen A. Wynn; and the television impresario Douglas S. Cramer.
And while there is no artwork expected to come anywhere close to the $120 million that a version of Edvard Munch's famed image of ''The Scream'' brought at Sotheby's six months ago, there are numerous paintings estimated to sell for over $35 million, including one of Monet's signature canvases of the lily pond at his home in Giverny, France; a brilliant red-and-blue work by Mark Rothko from 1954; and a 1932 Picasso portrait of his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter, which he painted in a single day.
''It's an icon market,'' said Brett Gorvy, chairman of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department. ''Collectors only want to buy the best.''
That could leave things a bit top-heavy, forcing auction house experts to drum up excitement for their second-tier offerings, which dealers say are beginning to show signs of softening.
Besides several American billionaires, it is the new rich from places like the Middle East, Russia, Brazil and Azerbaijan who have been fueling the market. (A small group of Chinese collectors who have been big players in years past may pull back this time, experts say, because of the weakening economy there.)
The tastes of these new collectors are hard to gauge, but they tend to gravitate toward obvious images by blue chip artists. ''We knew putting these sales together that we had to have a number of icons,'' Mr. Gorvy said. ''If a collector is in a buying mode and doesn't get one thing you have to have something else that is just as good or they just move on.''
These are some of the big-ticket items that the auction houses are betting on over the next two weeks.

HEADLINE: Every 4 Years, the Pen Is Even Sharper

BYLINE: By KARIN LIPSON

 BODY:
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.
EDITORIAL cartoonists, who wield their pens like darts, probably never lack for targets. But if Hofstra University's exhibition ''Political Slant: Editorial Cartoons'' is any indication, nothing beats a presidential election year for good material.
The foibles of Republicans and Democrats, excesses of the presidential campaign, failings of Congress, fallout of the recession -- just for starters -- are all grist for commentary in ''Political Slant,'' which features the work of five contemporary cartoonists, including three Pulitzer Prize winners. The free exhibition runs through Dec. 21 at the David Filderman Gallery, in the university's Joan and Donald E. Axinn Library. 
Not coincidentally, Hofstra was the site of the second presidential debate, on Oct. 16. (It also hosted the final debate in 2008.) When the planning for ''Political Slant'' began three years ago, ''we knew Hofstra was going to put in a bid for another debate,'' said Beth E. Levinthal, executive director of the Hofstra University Museum. ''And we knew it was the political season,'' Ms. Levinthal said, making the show timely in any event.
Karen T. Albert, the Hofstra Museum's associate director of exhibitions and collections, then rounded up the cartoonists: Walt Handelsman of Newsday, the Long Island-based daily; Jimmy Margulies of The Record, in New Jersey; Mike Keefe, formerly of The Denver Post; Steve Kelley, who until earlier this year was with The Times-Picayune, in New Orleans; and Signe Wilkinson of the Philadelphia Daily News.
The Pulitzer winners are Mr. Keefe, Ms. Wilkinson and Mr. Handelsman, who has won twice, in 1997 (while at The Times-Picayune), and in 2007. Ms. Wilkinson is the only woman among the approximately 55 full-time staff editorial cartoonists in the United States, according to John Cole, the president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists.
Pieces by the 19th-century cartoonist Thomas Nast, who was the first to use the donkey and the elephant to represent the Democratic and Republican Parties, are also on view.
The show is organized into five topics: the economy, presidential elections, education, human rights and war. ''These editorial cartoonists often work on the same themes, but they have different takes on it,'' Ms. Albert said.
Not surprisingly, the economy comes up repeatedly. In Mr. Handelsman's ''Economic Indicators,'' for example, two bemused figures try to decipher a painting composed of arrows pointing in multiple directions.
The colorful cartoon, based on similar arrow-motif paintings he created in high school, ''was a fun and artsy way to illustrate the difficulty people have in knowing which way the economy is going,'' Mr. Handelsman said.
''It's very challenging,'' he continued, ''when economists say 'new housing prices are up,' and then others say 'housing values are down' or you get a conflicting report.''
Another take on the economy is Mike Keefe's 2011 ''Upward Mobility,'' featuring four escalators: Two, labeled ''jobs'' and ''savings,'' are headed in a downward direction; a third, labeled ''debt,'' is going up. The fourth, labeled ''American Upward Mobility,'' isn't going anywhere -- its entrance is barred by an ''Out of Order'' sign.
Caricature, the exaggeration of physical features, is a time-honored tradition of political cartooning. ''It's useful, because it's a way to take these people in public life, and show they're human, too,'' said Mr. Margulies, who emphasizes President Obama's prominent ears and elongated chin in his ''Buffett Rule,'' a selection in the show. (The president's ears, as well as Mitt Romney's granite jaw, are often in evidence in ''Political Slant.'')
But the essence of caricaturing political figures ''is to make a point, not to say they're funny-looking -- that lets them off the hook,'' Mr. Margulies said. In the show, he also weighs in on unemployment, student debt and American involvement overseas -- all of them campaign issues.
''This time every four years, with the presidential campaign, it's sort of like being an accountant in the days leading up to April 15 -- it's my busy season,'' Mr. Margulies said.
Steve Kelley's ''Halftime in the Campaign,'' which borrows football terminology to suggest public debate-fatigue, is one of several cartoons displayed not only as a final version, but also in preliminary sketch form. ''We wanted to make people understand that they still draw,'' Ms. Albert said of the cartoonists. (A touch-screen kiosk in the gallery provides additional information on the five artists and the history of political cartoons.)
Several cartoons criticize standardized student testing as a measure of school accomplishment. Among them, ''School Test-Taking Basics'' by Ms. Wilkinson zeros in on dishonest results: on the left of her cartoon, a student's hand writes a test answer; on the right, a school administrator's hand erases one.
The cartoon, Ms. Wilkinson said, ''was particularly pegged to a cheating scandal in Philadelphia,'' though test-tampering also occurred elsewhere.
Political cartoons do not really change people's minds, Ms. Wilkinson said, ''but they're important to grease the wheels of public discourse, and to give people a different way to imagine an issue.''
''Political Slant: Editorial Cartoons,'' through Dec. 21 at the David Filderman Gallery, Axinn Library, Hofstra University. ''Music: The Voice of the People,'' a related program of politically oriented music, will be held Nov. 17 at 8 p.m. at the Rochelle and Irwin A. Lowenfeld Conference and Exhibition Hall, also in the library. Concert admission is $10 ($7 for those 65 and over). Information for both: hofstra.edu/museum; (516) 463-5672.

HEADLINE: A Life Beyond Baseball

BYLINE: By JACK B. DUNN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY family owned the Baltimore Orioles when it was a minor-league team. My great-grandfather recruited Babe Ruth. Babe's parents had sent him, an unruly son, to an industrial school that served as an orphanage. After seeing him pitch when he was 19, my great-grandfather became his guardian and signed him to the team.
Four days after I was born, my father, then the owner, whisked me off to spring training. When I was growing up, and the Orioles were a major-league team, Brooks Robinson would come to my birthday parties. I got batting lessons from another legendary Oriole, Frank Robinson, and met luminaries like Ralph Houk of the Yankees. It was a fun-filled childhood. 
My dad sold the team in 1954 but stayed on in a number of roles. I attended Princeton, as he did, and I graduated in 1973 with a degree in religion. I'd always been fascinated by the subject, but I talked to a few educators I respected, like Redmond Finney, headmaster of the Gilman School, and Milton Eisenhower, a president of Johns Hopkins University, about whether to choose a more practical major. They said your undergraduate major teaches you how to learn, and that's most important. That solidified my choice.
The summer after my sophomore year, I served as assistant general manager of the Miami Orioles farm team and ran it for a month when the man who had the job had to leave for his own training in different work. He mentored me for a couple of months first.
After graduating, I worked three years in the brokerage business. The day I registered as a broker, in 1973, the Dow closed over 1,000, but it would soon drop several hundred points. I had always planned on getting an advanced degree to build on my finance and investment banking interest, but I chose law school to have more options.
I graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1979 and worked for Weinberg & Green of Baltimore for three years. Legg Mason, the financial services firm, was one of our clients. In 1982, I left to become a managing director at Legg Mason and stayed for 10 years.
In 1992, Legg Mason invested in what was then the Forensic Technologies International Corporation. I joined the board, which asked me to find a chief financial officer. I applied for the job and was selected. In 1993, I also bought an interest in the Orioles -- and am still a part-owner. In 1995, I was made president and C.E.O. of Forensic Technologies International, and the next year we changed our name to FTI Consulting and went public.
We now have 3,800 employees and offices in 24 countries. We assist with litigation support, economic analysis, technology, strategic communications and corporate restructurings. Recently, the trustee handling the Bernard L. Madoff fraud hired us to help with the planning effort to recover victims' money.
I've learned that the tone set at the top permeates an organization. You can talk about the importance of internal communication, but what most sends a message is the people you pick to lead.
Great C.E.O.'s can be charismatic, and geniuses. But they are lucky if they have those traits. If you pick great leaders and are honest with employees, it can mean the difference between winning and losing. Some leaders' biggest strength is that they show their humanity. Other leaders' strength is that they don't. It's a matter of personal style.
When he's not studying, my 20-year-old son, Jack, is a disc jockey. Like me, he loves music, as I did at his age. We've both played professionally at parties and dances. Also like me, he's had a negative cash flow because of it. We've both gotten $200 for a job, then spent $400 on musical equipment.

HEADLINE: Governor in High Gear Over a Tax Initiative

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Ian Lovett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Jerry Brown jumped up from his desk on the 16th floor of the Ronald Reagan State Office Building the other morning, riled over evidence that his ballot initiative to raise taxes and head off billions in education spending cuts might be headed for a potentially catastrophic defeat.
''This is a measure paid for by relatively few that affects millions of people in this state,'' Mr. Brown said, jabbing the air with a pen. ''It is hugely important to this state: The idea of what it is should carry it to victory. Just that.''
Perhaps. But with two days until Election Day, Mr. Brown's proposition is struggling, raising the prospect of as much as $6 billion in new cuts to California's already battered public education system. It also is emerging as a serious challenge to Mr. Brown, who has affixed his personal prestige to its passage. The outcome holds the potential to hobble a governor whose hoped-for legacy had been wresting California from a fiscal crisis. 
Three recent polls have shown Proposition 30, as it is known, declining in support since earlier this year. Now, barely 50 percent of likely voters said they planned to vote for it; historically, tax initiatives tend to fail if they fall below 50 percent this close to an election.
So it is that Mr. Brown, after lying relatively low, has sprung to action. He could be found last weekend talking up the initiative before ordering a burrito at the Grand Central Market. It was part of a flurry of journeys to make urgent appeals to voters who at this point might be inured to what have become numbing warnings of economic Armageddon from their state leaders.
''There is no more money,'' Mr. Brown said plaintively. ''The money is needed for schools. I don't want people to wake up the day after the election and say, 'Why didn't you tell me?' I am telling you.''
At 74, Mr. Brown is a politician who tends to plays by his own rules. For one thing, he has enlisted his dog, Sutter, a Pembroke Welsh corgi, as a campaign surrogate, sending his pet to 30 Democratic field offices to drum up support.
But perhaps more consequentially, the governor himself did not begin aggressively campaigning for this initiative until 10 days ago, as polls began registering a decline in support and as the breadth of the financial opposition -- including $11 million from an unidentified donor in Arizona -- became clear.
Part of this, aides said, is that Mr. Brown, who famously does not delegate authority, has been consumed with work in Sacramento, overseeing the reading, vetoing and approving of more than 700 bills that crossed his desk after the Legislature adjourned.
''I don't need to go over what the governor does,'' Mr. Brown said. ''You know all that. It's a full-time job.''
Beyond that, he said, he thought it was pointless to go out too soon, when people might not be listening and when there is only so much to say.
''There's only a certain amount you can do,'' Mr. Brown said. ''You can only push so much through the pipe to the eyeballs. I am pushing the maximum through the pipe that I can.''
Still, initiatives that raise taxes are tough to pass here -- even one like this, intended to place nearly all the burden on a relatively small group. (It raises $6 billion with a one-quarter of a cent sales tax increase and an income tax surcharge on those earning more than $250,000 a year.)
''I think it's great that in the closing weeks, the governor is playing such a strong role,'' said John A. Pérez, the Assembly speaker. He said Mr. Brown was a powerful advocate, adding, ''In my opinion, it would have been great if he had started on Day 1.''
A defeat would result in cuts in spending on public schools, on top of a series of school cuts that has, by almost every measure, resulted in a marked decline in public education here. In this case, Mr. Brown said, the cuts would probably mean a reduction by three weeks of the school year.
A defeat would constrain Mr. Brown from going forward, putting more pressure on him to find things to cut -- or ways to get around reductions. ''It's hard to see where he goes if 30 doesn't pass,'' said Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California.
Mr. Brown disputed the notion that it would hurt him. He noted that he vigorously opposed Proposition 13, which slashed property taxes, in 1978 when he was first governor, and survived that. The day after Proposition 13 passed, Mr. Brown did an about-face and announced he would cheerfully carry it out.
''This would be a huge blow to California and the public sector,'' he said of this latest proposition's potential failure. ''As to how or what it does to me as a political leader, I think that's hard to say. I battled very hard to defeat Prop. 13, and I went on to win by 21 points.
''If you're only interested in what happens to this one person, Jerry Brown -- that's such a narrow question,'' he said.
The difficulties are by no means of Mr. Brown's making, as he has faced an onslaught of spending and competition from a rival tax measure pushed by Molly Munger, a wealthy lawyer, in a state with a resistance to tax increases. ''At the end of the day it is what we've seen the last eight times a tax increase was in put in front of California voters: Voters will reject it,'' said Jon Coupal, the head of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, an opponent.
The best hope for Mr. Brown's initiative is that the prospect of re-electing President Obama draws a big turnout. Polls suggest that Mr. Obama's supporters are disproportionately in favor of the initiative.
''It is very close,'' said Mark Baldassare, president of the Public Policy Institute of California, which has been polling on the measure. ''The numbers that support it are lower than we are seeing when we asked about it a month ago. Passing a state tax increase in California is very, very tough to do.''
The proposition drew the support of 48 percent of likely voters in a survey conducted Oct. 17 to 30 by the Field Poll of California and released Thursday; another 38 percent said they opposed it.
Justine Kennedy, 32, an epidemiologist with a 13-month-old daughter, said she was leaning against it, even if she thought schools needed money.
''My initial reaction is no on 30,'' she said. ''Is that money really going towards the schools? I just feel like, in the past, money is misused and tends to be abused, especially in the school system.''

HEADLINE: With Time as Tight as Race, Obama and Romney Zero In

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
MILWAUKEE -- President Obama and Mitt Romney entered their final weekend of campaigning on Saturday facing a stubborn landscape of competitive states that right to the end are producing equal shares of hope and fear amid conflicting signals about the outcome.
The president, fighting to avoid being turned out of office four years after a rousing and historic victory, sought to shore up his standing in Midwestern states that had backed him enthusiastically last time. He assumed a defensive posture in Iowa and here in Wisconsin, two states where his advisers had openly scoffed at his rival's chances only a few months ago.
Mr. Romney, in the closing days of his second quest for the White House, worked to harness the enthusiasm running through the Republican Party to overcome the challenges he confronts in building an Electoral College majority. He fought to secure critical states like Florida and Virginia without allowing others to slip away. 
But after hundreds of millions of dollars in television commercials, months of campaigning and three widely viewed debates, the race was locked in the same dynamic that has defined it from the start: Mr. Obama, burdened by four years of economic struggle and partisan animosity but still an inspiration to his party, holding the slightest of edges in Ohio and other swing states, and Mr. Romney, bearer of the hopes of conservatives and voters convinced the nation is on the wrong path, fighting to overtake him.
The last defining question was whether Mr. Romney's support had hit a ceiling -- blunted by Mr. Obama's opportunity to show leadership in the deadly aftermath of Hurricane Sandy -- or whether he was on the verge of unseating a president in a dramatic finale.
Supporters, donors and advisers to Mr. Romney, in battleground states and at the campaign headquarters in Boston, said in conversations over the last two days that they had hoped to be closing the campaign in a stronger position, with clear leads in at least some contested states. Now, several of them said, their optimism comes from the uncertainty in the closing hours of a contest, rather than any affirmative command of the race.
Mr. Obama raced through four states on Saturday as he tried to build enthusiasm among Democrats, appearing after a performance here by the singer Katy Perry to urgently tell a crowd of thousands, ''We have come too far to turn back now; we have come too far to let our hearts grow weary.''
Mr. Romney sought to tap into disappointment and discontent among voters as he rallied supporters, telling thousands of them in Engelwood, Colo., that ''throughout his campaign, President Obama has tried to convince you the last four years have been a success.''
The outlook expressed by both campaigns belied the tight nature of the contest in at least seven states. In their respective headquarters, advisers made convincing cases for why their candidate had the clearer path to 270 electoral votes, but when pressed they admitted to sleepless nights about a result that was expected to come down to only a sliver of the electorate.
The pursuit of Ohio's 18 electoral votes drew the most attention, with the candidates scheduling multiple stops there before Tuesday, but the rest of the landscape was also highly volatile. Mr. Obama had the edge in Nevada and Mr. Romney in North Carolina, strategists agreed, while Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin were far closer.
Here in Wisconsin, Mr. Romney rallied voters on Friday as his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, a native son, fought to rewrite the historical trends of a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
The president, who carried Wisconsin by 14 percentage points in 2008, arrived here in Milwaukee on Saturday afternoon. His campaign advisers thought the contest here was narrow enough to send him back to the state on Monday for a rally with an even bigger music star, Bruce Springsteen.
''It's always tantalizingly close for Republicans, and I assume that's where we are at with this one,'' said James E. Doyle, a former Democratic governor of Wisconsin, who was among the early supporters of Mr. Obama.
The defeat this year of an attempt to recall Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, left behind an energized contingent of voters that Mr. Romney and his team will try to return to the polls. State laws that allow same-day registration in Wisconsin and in Iowa were seen by advisers to the Obama campaign as an advantage in their efforts to turn out younger voters.
Neil Newhouse, the pollster for the Romney campaign, compared the moment in the race to a football game: ''It's a tie game, and there's a loose ball.'' Joel Benenson, the pollster for the Obama campaign, argued instead that Mr. Obama held the edge and that Mr. Romney was running out of time to overcome him.
Strategists on both sides agreed that Hurricane Sandy had at the very least interrupted Mr. Romney's late-stage prosecution of Mr. Obama in a way that may have stunted the sense of upward movement that had been surrounding his campaign.
The duel between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney also held implications for the fight for the Senate, where Democrats are increasingly hopeful of retaining control, as well as for races in the House, where Republicans are confident of keeping a majority.
The close nature of the presidential race was underscored by the travel schedules, which left the candidates crossing paths, including stops on Saturday afternoon only a few miles apart in Dubuque, Iowa, across the Mississippi River from Wisconsin. In 2008, Mr. Obama carried Iowa and Wisconsin by wide margins, but he has struggled to lock down his support this year, creating an opening for Republicans.
''He's trying to do everything he can to rekindle what he had four years ago, but it's not there,'' said Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican. ''Initially, there were a lot of people who were against Obama and weren't that wild about Romney, but over the last few months that has changed, and now there is really genuine enthusiasm for Romney.''
The president had a five-point advantage in Iowa, according to a Des Moines Register poll released Saturday evening, which found Mr. Obama with 47 percent compared to 42 percent for Mr. Romney. The poll, conducted Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The candidates, as they near the end of their contest, are intimately familiar with the metrics and minutiae of the state-by-state races. In Iowa, for example, Democrats were pointing to 17,000 voter registrations in the past month, which narrowed the Republican advantage to about 1,400 voters, down from about 11,000 a month ago.
The campaign played out on Saturday entirely on the terrain that Mr. Obama won four years ago, when he expanded the battleground to Virginia and North Carolina for the first time in a generation. Republicans portrayed Mr. Romney's late push into Pennsylvania, where he was set to have a campaign rally on Sunday, as a sign of strength.
''You have to look at what they're doing now,'' said Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, a Republican. ''They're engaging here. They're spending money here. The race is close, and that's when you try to push it over the line.''
Yet Democrats portrayed the move as an act of desperation, arguing that the state has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since the elder George Bush in 1988.
''This is what I would describe as a Hail Mary,'' said former Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat. ''They have found out that it's not likely they'll carry Ohio, and the only way to do the electoral math is to carry Pennsylvania or a Michigan or even a Minnesota.''
An aide to Mr. Romney said the campaign had decided to compete in Pennsylvania only after taking steps to finance advertising campaigns and get-out-the-vote operations fully in other states. The indication was that advisers viewed the state as worth a try, given the deadlocked national poll numbers, but not at the expense of anything else.
In interviews, aides to Mr. Obama said he remained competitive in Florida, a state that both sides had viewed as more favorable to Mr. Romney, who would face a hard road to victory without its 29 electoral votes.
Mr. Romney's campaign officials said they were confident that he would win Florida. But they were not taking chances and scheduled a visit by Mr. Romney to the state on Monday. Each side had a poll to bolster its supporters. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll showed Mr. Obama with a two-point edge. A Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 survey showed Mr. Romney with a six-point advantage.
They said they were less certain about Virginia, agreeing with Mr. Obama's strategists that a jump in polling in the state for Mr. Romney after the first presidential debate had subsided, though they still predicted a victory there. Mr. Obama increased his advertising in both states, even though ads had reached saturation levels, a sign of the uncertainty alive in the race.
Mr. Romney was scheduled to make two stops in Virginia on Monday, including one in the northern suburbs, a region that was pivotal to Mr. Obama's becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate in four decades to win the state. It is part of the Romney campaign's strategy of winning over voters who supported Mr. Obama in 2008.
Mr. Newhouse, the pollster for the Romney campaign, said the campaign had wooed enough Obama supporters nationally to make a decisive difference.
The effort has been punctuated by Mr. Romney's recent emphasis on bipartisanship and moderate policy positions after a primary season in which he called himself ''severely conservative.'' It has also included a run of advertisements telling those swept up in the promise of Mr. Obama's last campaign that he had tried but failed, and that it was time to move on.
''I think we did what we needed to do,'' Mr. Newhouse said, ''but we're going to find out Tuesday.''

HEADLINE: A Capitalist's Dilemma, Whoever Wins on Tuesday

BYLINE: By CLAYTON M. CHRISTENSEN. 
Clayton M. Christensen is a business professor at Harvard and a co-author of ''How Will You Measure Your Life?''

 BODY:
WHATEVER happens on Election Day, Americans will keep asking the same question: When will this economy get better?
In many ways, the answer won't depend on who wins on Tuesday. Anyone who says otherwise is overstating the power of the American president. But if the president doesn't have the power to fix things, who does?
It's not the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been injecting more and more capital into the economy because -- at least in theory -- capital fuels capitalism. And yet cash hoards in the billions are sitting unused on the pristine balance sheets of Fortune 500 corporations. Billions in capital is also sitting inert and uninvested at private equity funds.
Capitalists seem almost uninterested in capitalism, even as entrepreneurs eager to start companies find that they can't get financing. Businesses and investors sound like the Ancient Mariner, who complained of ''Water, water everywhere -- nor any drop to drink.'' 
It's a paradox, and at its nexus is what I'll call the Doctrine of New Finance, which is taught with increasingly religious zeal by economists, and at times even by business professors like me who have failed to challenge it. This doctrine embraces measures of profitability that guide capitalists away from investments that can create real economic growth.
Executives and investors might finance three types of innovations with their capital. I'll call the first type ''empowering'' innovations. These transform complicated and costly products available to a few into simpler, cheaper products available to the many.
The Ford Model T was an empowering innovation, as was the Sony transistor radio. So were the personal computers of I.B.M. and Compaq and online trading at Schwab. A more recent example is cloud computing. It transformed information technology that was previously accessible only to big companies into something that even small companies could afford.
Empowering innovations create jobs, because they require more and more people who can build, distribute, sell and service these products. Empowering investments also use capital -- to expand capacity and to finance receivables and inventory.
The second type are ''sustaining'' innovations. These replace old products with new models. For example, the Toyota Prius hybrid is a marvelous product. But it's not as if every time Toyota sells a Prius, the same customer also buys a Camry. There is a zero-sum aspect to sustaining innovations: They replace yesterday's products with today's products and create few jobs. They keep our economy vibrant -- and, in dollars, they account for the most innovation. But they have a neutral effect on economic activity and on capital.
The third type are ''efficiency'' innovations. These reduce the cost of making and distributing existing products and services. Examples are minimills in steel and Geico in online insurance underwriting. Taken together in an industry, such innovations almost always reduce the net number of jobs, because they streamline processes. But they also preserve many of the remaining jobs -- because without them entire companies and industries would disappear in competition against companies abroad that have innovated more efficiently.
Efficiency innovations also emancipate capital. Without them, much of an economy's capital is held captive on balance sheets, with no way to redeploy it as fuel for new, empowering innovations. For example, Toyota's just-in-time production system is an efficiency innovation, letting manufacturers operate with much less capital invested in inventory.
INDUSTRIES typically transition through these three types of innovations. By illustration, the early mainframe computers were so expensive and complicated that only big companies could own and use them. But personal computers were simple and affordable, empowering many more people.
Companies like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard had to hire hundreds of thousands of people to make and sell PC's. These companies then designed and made better computers -- sustaining innovations -- that inspired us to keep buying newer and better products. Finally, companies like Dell made the industry much more efficient. This reduced net employment within the industry, but freed capital that had been used in the supply chain.
Ideally, the three innovations operate in a recurring circle. Empowering innovations are essential for growth because they create new consumption. As long as empowering innovations create more jobs than efficiency innovations eliminate, and as long as the capital that efficiency innovations liberate is invested back into empowering innovations, we keep recessions at bay. The dials on these three innovations are sensitive. But when they are set correctly, the economy is a magnificent machine.
For significant periods in the last 150 years, America's economy has operated this way. In the seven recoveries from recession between 1948 and 1981, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, the economy returned to its prerecession employment peak in about six months, like clockwork -- as if a spray of economic WD-40 had reset the balance on the three types of innovation, prompting a recovery.
In the last three recoveries, however, America's economic engine has emitted sounds we'd never heard before. The 1990 recovery took 15 months, not the typical six, to reach the prerecession peaks of economic performance. After the 2001 recession, it took 39 months to get out of the valley. And now our machine has been grinding for 60 months, trying to hit its prerecession levels -- and it's not clear whether, when or how we're going to get there. The economic machine is out of balance and losing its horsepower. But why?
The answer is that efficiency innovations are liberating capital, and in the United States this capital is being reinvested into still more efficiency innovations. In contrast, America is generating many fewer empowering innovations than in the past. We need to reset the balance between empowering and efficiency innovations.
The Doctrine of New Finance helped create this situation. The Republican intellectual George F. Gilder taught us that we should husband resources that are scarce and costly, but can waste resources that are abundant and cheap. When the doctrine emerged in stages between the 1930s and the '50s, capital was relatively scarce in our economy. So we taught our students how to magnify every dollar put into a company, to get the most revenue and profit per dollar of capital deployed. To measure the efficiency of doing this, we redefined profit not as dollars, yen or renminbi, but as ratios like RONA (return on net assets), ROCE (return on capital employed) and I.R.R. (internal rate of return).
Before these new measures, executives and investors used crude concepts like ''tons of cash'' to describe profitability. The new measures are fractions and give executives more options: They can innovate to add to the numerator of the RONA ratio, but they can also drive down the denominator by driving assets off the balance sheet -- through outsourcing. Both routes drive up RONA and ROCE.
Similarly, I.R.R. gives investors more options. It goes up when the time horizon is short. So instead of investing in empowering innovations that pay off in five to eight years, investors can find higher internal rates of return by investing exclusively in quick wins in sustaining and efficiency innovations.
In a way, this mirrors the microeconomic paradox explored in my book ''The Innovator's Dilemma,'' which shows how successful companies can fail by making the ''right'' decisions in the wrong situations. America today is in a macroeconomic paradox that we might call the capitalist's dilemma. Executives, investors and analysts are doing what is right, from their perspective and according to what they've been taught. Those doctrines were appropriate to the circumstances when first articulated -- when capital was scarce.
But we've never taught our apprentices that when capital is abundant and certain new skills are scarce, the same rules are the wrong rules. Continuing to measure the efficiency of capital prevents investment in empowering innovations that would create the new growth we need because it would drive down their RONA, ROCE and I.R.R.
It's as if our leaders in Washington, all highly credentialed, are standing on a beach holding their fire hoses full open, pouring more capital into an ocean of capital. We are trying to solve the wrong problem.
Our approach to higher education is exacerbating our problems. Efficiency innovations often add workers with yesterday's skills to the ranks of the unemployed. Empowering innovations, in turn, often change the nature of jobs -- creating jobs that can't be filled.
Today, the educational skills necessary to start companies that focus on empowering innovations are scarce. Yet our leaders are wasting education by shoveling out billions in Pell Grants and subsidized loans to students who graduate with skills and majors that employers cannot use.
Is there a solution? It's complicated, but I offer three ideas to seed a productive discussion:
CHANGE THE METRICS We can use capital with abandon now, because it's abundant and cheap. But we can no longer waste education, subsidizing it in fields that offer few jobs. Optimizing return on capital will generate less growth than optimizing return on education.
CHANGE CAPITAL-GAINS TAX RATES Today, tax rates on personal income are progressive -- they climb as we make more money. In contrast, there are only two tax rates on investment income. Income from investments that we hold for less than a year is taxed like personal income. But if we hold an investment for one day longer than 365, it is generally taxed at no more than 15 percent.
We should instead make capital gains regressive over time, based upon how long the capital is invested in a company. Taxes on short-term investments should continue to be taxed at personal income rates. But the rate should be reduced the longer the investment is held -- so that, for example, tax rates on investments held for five years might be zero -- and rates on investments held for eight years might be negative.
Federal tax receipts from capital gains comprise only a tiny percentage of all United States tax revenue. So the near-term impact on the budget will be minimal. But over the longer term, this policy change should have a positive impact on the federal deficit, from taxes paid by companies and their employees that make empowering innovations.
CHANGE THE POLITICS The major political parties are both wrong when it comes to taxing and distributing to the middle class the capital of the wealthiest 1 percent. It's true that some of the richest Americans have been making money with money -- investing in efficiency innovations rather than investing to create jobs. They are doing what their professors taught them to do, but times have changed.
If the I.R.S. taxes their wealth away and distributes it to everyone else, it still won't help the economy. Without empowering products and services in our economy, most of this redistribution will be spent buying sustaining innovations -- replacing consumption with consumption. We must give the wealthiest an incentive to invest for the long term. This can create growth.
Granted, mine is a simple model, and we face complicated problems. But I hope it helps us and our leaders understand that policies that were once right are now wrong, and that counterintuitive measures might actually work to turn our economy around.

HEADLINE: Clever, How They Earn That Laugh

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN and MEGAN ANGELO

 BODY:
STAND-UP comics tell jokes about race, sex, abortion, rape and pedophilia. But ask some of those same outspoken performers to reveal publicly how they make their living, and they suddenly become discreet. Money may be the last taboo.
It's a critical subject, however, since the economics of comedy has a huge impact on the art form itself, something to think about as the New York Comedy Festival gets under way on Wednesday. If you want to know why so many comedians spend valuable time on television development deals or dedicate months to the road, you will find clues in their tax returns. Louis C. K. reinvented the business model of stand-up, successfully self-releasing a stage show online, but he's a rare case. Few comics today have that kind of fan base. 
Most comics, when starting out, make so little working in New York that they are, in a sense, paying to perform. Some move up to well-known theaters and showcases, but they still might not draw much more than graduate students. Television offers a big payday, but it's not the fortune that some imagine. Comedy Central routinely offers $15,000 for a half-hour special that can take a year or more to develop. Even as well-known comics get modest fees, relative unknowns can do very well -- in the right field. Buzz Sutherland may not be a household name, but he pulled down $350,000 last year, with his largest source of income coming from the lucrative college circuit.
Earning a livable salary through comedy is not easy, but these working comics reveal the diversity of ways to make money. (Some salaries are approximate.) Of course money is not the only form of reward. Comedians perform because they love what they do. Or the prestige of a respected gig. Or simply to get better. As with any freelance job, their work requires resourcefulness, determination and creativity. Being funny is essential, but a few accounting skills don't hurt.
The Road Warrior
Costaki Economopoulos
An 18-year veteran who makes most of his money on the road, Mr. Economopoulos, 42, said regular appearances on ''The Bob and Tom Show,'' a radio program syndicated to about 150 stations, changed his career. ''Five years ago I would go into a club and be unknown,'' he said. ''After being on 'Bob and Tom' I make twice that when I self-produce a show. I can sometimes make five times.'' Still, he's careful to schedule gigs by geography, even if one paying a few thousand dollars is followed by one paying just a few hundred, to save on travel expenses.
ANNUAL SALARY $92,000
TYPICAL SOURCES OF INCOME
$467 -- Sales from comedy records like ''Mission Economopoulos'' online through cdbaby.com.
$2,191 -- Self-produced set in Fort Dodge, Iowa. From that amount he paid the opening comic $200.
$2,710 -- One night at Go Bananas, a club in Cincinnati.
$2,850 -- Fees from Sound Exchange, an organization that collects royalties from satellite radio, Internet radio and other platforms that stream recordings.
$3,217 -- Self-produced comedy show at the Canyon Crest Dining and Event Center in Twin Falls, Idaho.
LOSS LEADER
$5 -- Residuals from appearance on the NBC show ''Last Comic Standing.''
The Upright Citizens Brigade Solo
Livia Scott
Ms. Scott has a show at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Chelsea and has been in the business for a decade, but she made just under $3,200 from comedy last year. And that's before about $2,100 in expenses for promotion, props, costumes and more. ''I spend money on my shows at U.C.B. because it's valuable to me to be on that stage,'' said Ms. Scott, who lives in Sunnyside, Queens. ''It's an investment, and I'm honored to be in shows there. My parents are appalled, but you know what? It's fair. I'm an artist. I made that decision.''
ANNUAL SALARY $35,500
TYPICAL SOURCES OF INCOME
$33,000 -- Part-time receptionist at a law firm.
$2,500 -- Several bit parts in the DVD release ''National Lampoon's Dirty Movie.'' She also receives $35 residuals a few times yearly. The arrangement was similar for her appearance as a kooky nurse with Andrew McCarthy in ''National Lampoon's Snatched.''
LOSS LEADERS
$0 -- ''Livia's Castle of Enchantment,'' her monthly solo show at Upright Citizens Brigade.
$0 -- Stand-up set at Karma Lounge in the East Village.
The Podcaster
Dave Rubin
A New Yorker with 14 years' experience, Mr. Rubin, 36, said his career turning point came in 2010, when Bonobos men's wear signed up as a sponsor of his podcast, ''The Six Pack.'' ''It meant freedom,'' he said. ''It meant I didn't have to hunt for ridiculous jobs. It meant my show had legitimacy. Now we can pay an editor and producer. We turned comedy into an actual business.''
ANNUAL SALARY $65,000
TYPICAL SOURCE OF INCOME
$60,000 -- Podcast sponsors like Bonobos and General Motors.
LOSS LEADERS
$25 -- Set at the Upper West Side club Stand Up NY.
$30 -- Set at the Gotham Comedy Club in Chelsea.
$75 -- Host of showcase at the Comix club in Chelsea.
$500 -- Sales of T-shirts and other merchandise.
The Alt Scene Maker
Eugene Mirman
''It's ridiculous to do everything aiming for a moment of monetary gain,'' said Mr. Mirman, 38, a performer who lives in Brooklyn and has 10 years in the business. Though his television credits include ''Delocated'' on Adult Swim and ''Bob's Burgers'' on Fox, he's aware of his position. ''There's no one thing that makes anybody unless you're on a hit show that has your face on it,'' he said, ''and even then, however famous or successful anyone gets, it can all go away.''
ANNUAL SALARY $200,000
TYPICAL SOURCES OF INCOME
$40 -- ''Pretty Good Friends,'' a Sunday night comedy show at Union Hall in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that he hosts and produces with Julie Smith and Caroline Creaghead, both nonperformers. Together they also pay for sound, door and booking staff. Every comic gets the same fee as Mr. Mirman.
$2,000 -- Stand-up set at the Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee. He received $1,000 from the organizers and $1,000 from Comedy Central, which streamed the set online.
$3,000 -- Stand-up set at the Crocodile, a Seattle club.
$4,400 -- Per episode of ''Bob's Burgers,'' the show for which he voices the character Gene.
$7,000 -- Co-headliner, show at an upstate New York theater.
LOSS LEADER
$0 -- The Eugene Mirman Comedy Festival in Brooklyn, a weekend-long event that he helps produce. The 50 to 60 comics are paid $100 to $150 each, and Mr. Mirman and his co-producers also shell out for prizes, food and stunts like an ''awkward party bus'' that runs them $5,500. With admission fees, they break even.
The Comedy Cellar Regular
Kurt Metzger
Money is not the prime motivation for Mr. Metzger, 35, who's been a comedian for 13 years. ''All I want is a job that I don't hate,'' he said. ''Anything else is gravy.'' A Washington Heights resident, he said he preferred New York to Los Angeles ''because you have more access to stage time,'' adding: ''On a slow week I'll do two New York shows. On a good one I'll perform every day.''
ANNUAL SALARY $60,000
TYPICAL SOURCES OF INCOME
$75 -- Weekend spot at the Greenwich Village club the Comedy Cellar, one of the premier clubs in the country right now.
$80 -- Weekend spot at the Broadway Comedy Club in Times Square.
$300 -- Weekday headliner at the Times Square club Carolines on Broadway.
$3,740 -- Voice work for ''Ugly Americans,'' an animated television series on Comedy Central.
LOSS LEADER
$0 -- ''Whiplash,'' a stand-up show at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Chelsea.
The Cruise Ship Star
Al Romas
A 23-year veteran who lives in Florida, Mr. Romas said he was tired of the road life, which meant leaving town for a few weeks at a time and returning with almost nothing. ''Even though comics told me not to become a boat act, I pursued cruises, and now performed around 24 weeks in 2011,'' Mr. Romas, 50, said. ''Ironically, those same comics are now e-mailing me asking how they can get on ships.''
ANNUAL SALARY $85,000 a year
TYPICAL SOURCES OF INCOME
$3,500 -- Royal Caribbean International, 17 shows in 7 nights.
$3,000 -- Carnival Cruises, 10 shows in 7 nights.

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
NOT since Lydia Bennet eloped with Mr. Wickham, not since Anna Karenina ran off with Count Vronsky, has such a hue and cry been heard about purloined affections.
The triangle that flared at the climax, with Chris Christie scampering away from Mitt Romney in the wuthering storm to cling to Barack Obama, the New Jersey governor's brown eyes looking up trustingly into the president's brown eyes, added a frisson to a jaundiced, spendthrift race.
In novels and movies, it's a powerful narrative: the problems of three little people, playing out against a charged backdrop. ''Casablanca.'' ''Gone With the Wind.'' ''The Year of Living Dangerously.'' ''Broadcast News.'' ''L.A. Confidential.''
Christie was unrepentantly swept away by his new pal, the commander in chief, who also likes to wear a jacket with his name and title sewn onto the lapel. 
''So, I do pinch myself every day,'' Christie said at a news conference in Trenton on Wednesday. ''You know, like when I got on Marine One, I'm pinching myself, believe me. Sandy and Bill Christie's son on Marine One was not exactly what I thought was going to be happening with my life.''
A president who has taken a lot of abuse from Republicans -- one refusing to take his urgent calls on the debt deal, one yelling ''You lie!'' during a State of the Union address, many libeling his religion, race and nationality, all plotting to upend his plans -- was finally getting a little G.O.P. love.
It was a jarring sign to Republicans that, despite Romney's humanlike performance in recent weeks, there is no deep tie, nor real respect, among many of those helping with his campaign, even men considered as running mates. Romney is idolized by his wife and sons, and in his close Mormon circle of friends, but beyond that, there is an intensity vacuum.
In the final days, with Christie cheating on him, Mitt was left with Jeb Bush, who offered the faint praise to CBS News that Romney had been slow to respond to the president's attack but had finally ''found his rhythm.''
Pity poor Jeb Bush, trying to drag another entitled, second-rate scion over the finish line in Florida while stifling his own dreams. He told a crowd that Obama's ''entire strategy is to blame others, starting with my brother, of course.'' But his brother is to blame for creating the chaos that swallowed much of Obama's first term. And for derailing Jeb's career and blighting the family name. While Jeb was hawking Romney, W. was giving a speech at a confidential Cayman Islands investment conference. He should go check on Mitt's cash still sunning itself in the Caribbean.
Even some of Romney's own campaign advisers confess they don't really know who he is. Is he the pragmatist who would curb Grover Norquist, John Bolton and Dan Senor, or the severe conservative who would let them run wild? It's sad when you are hoping someone is an opportunist and a liar.
Some of Romney's staffers seemed taken aback by his commanding performance in the first debate, musing about whether, had there been 47 percent fewer gaffes, the rich stiff actually could have had a chance of easily sending Obama packing.
(Maybe Mitch McConnell and other Republicans would prefer that a Democrat keep the White House, given that the out-of-power party might pick up more Congressional seats in the midterms -- not to mention how actually enacting the Romney-Ryan agenda could make the G.O.P. a minority party.)
Having Christie go rogue -- and Colin Powell and Michael Bloomberg cross over from wherever they were -- was a compelling plot twist in a race that has looked more to the gutter than the stars. Two uninspiring candidates, one Americans had fallen out of love with, one they could not fall in love with, one who had lost his narrative, one who offered a narrative with Janus faces and contradictory and occluded positions.
The only thing about Romney that doesn't oscillate, besides the exact quota of salt to pepper in his hair, is his weight. He told ABC's Diane Sawyer that he regularly gets on the scale on the campaign trail to make sure he doesn't deviate too much. If only his consistency extended to his positions on the auto bailout, abortion, climate change, gun control, health care, etc.
Romney's closing argument was that he could spark a stagnant economy, but his false claim that Jeep jobs were moving from the United States to China was a huge mistake, allowing the big car companies to call him out as a liar. Obama found his fire in castigating Romney, saying, ''You don't scare hard-working Americans just to scare up some votes.''
Voting for either man seems a shot in the dark. You have to make that vote still confused about who they are, how they've evolved, and where they're leading us. You have to make that vote without knowing if either would have the mettle, as president for the next four years, to face down destructive forces and restore America's luster.
''After four years as president,'' Obama told voters in Hilliard, Ohio, on Friday, ''you know me.''
But do we? If we know him, why does he seem so much slighter than the Barack Obama who thrilled the country a mere four years ago?
If we know him, why were we so stunned at his crimped, self-destructive performance in the first debate, when the man usually so in control of his emotions could not contain his contempt that he was expected to justify himself while this superrich, superphony, supercilious Republican dauphin stared at him with a smarmy smile? Barry used a vulgarity about Mitt to Rolling Stone, expressing the way he truly feels, but out campaigning the past few days, he toned it down, noting that his rival tried to ''massage the facts'' while ''I tell the truth.''
After his despondent debate and his disheartened remark that ''You can't change Washington from the inside,'' the graying president has to spend his last campaign hours exhorting until he's hoarse, working to reassure us that he's still interested in his job. ''I am a long ways away from giving up on this fight,'' he said in Springfield, Ohio, on Friday. ''I got a lot of fight left in me.''
When a skeptical supporter pressed, ''You're not too tired?'' the president responded: ''I don't get tired. I don't grow weary. I hope you aren't tired either, Ohio.''
David Axelrod, the president's mustachioed medium, strained to paint the president as filled with vigor, telling reporters in Lima, Ohio, that Obama's exhilaration ''is coming from his loins.'' Twitter users quickly dubbed the president the Loin King.
The campaign played Stevie Wonder's ''Signed, Sealed, Delivered'' at rallies in 2008 too, but in Ohio in 2012, the words have a more wistful ring to them: ''Like a fool I went and stayed too long. Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong.''
CAMPAIGNING in Lake Worth, Fla., on Friday, Bill Clinton, as usual, lavished Obama with support that contained a sting: ''I may be the only person in America, but I am far more enthusiastic about President Obama this time than I was four years ago.''
It is clear now that we elected an introvert, which is strange, and a leader who is depleted, rather than recharged, by politics and crowds. As Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a former Obama adviser, told New York magazine: ''It's stunning that he's in politics, because he really doesn't like people. My analogy is that it's like becoming Bill Gates without liking computers.''
Obama denounces Romney as ''a very talented salesman,'' which he considers an insult. At the same time, he admits that his ineptness at selling his policies left him in need of someone like Bill Clinton, who could be a ''secretary of 'splaining stuff.''
As the former community organizer deftly handled the devastation of Sandy -- showing all the fleet response and caring reactions that he had lacked during the BP oil spill -- and pressed the case that ''we're all in this together,'' it seemed as though the president had learned some things about communicating and confidently using the levers of government. And that he understood that Americans will expect more from him if he is re-elected.
But I couldn't help thinking of a ''Star Trek'' episode, ''The Naked Time,'' in which the starship Enterprise sends crew members to a dying planet. The spaceship is contaminated by a strange red liquid that causes everyone to emote like crazy. Even Spock starts crying inconsolably because he can't tell his mother how much he cares about her.
Spock and Captain Kirk fiddle with the matter and antimatter and get away but fall into a time warp and hurtle back 71 hours, so the emotional outpouring never happened.
Has President Spock, who bounded into action on Sandy and rocked a New Jersey woman in his arms, really grown? Or is he giving us what we want for the moment so we'll give him what he wants for the next four years?

HEADLINE: The Political Speechwriter's Life

BYLINE: By ROBERT LEHRMAN. 
Robert Lehrman, who was the chief speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore, is the author of four novels and ''The Political Speechwriter's Companion'' and teaches speechwriting at American University.

 BODY:
Kurt Vonnegut once wrote that ''only nut cases want to be president.'' But he helped me become a White House speechwriter. In 1965, Vonnegut was my adviser at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where I was studying fiction. One day, he said he could get me an assistantship, but I'd have to teach speech.
''I know nothing about speech,'' I said.
He said something like: ''Learn. It's 1,800 bucks.'' 
In class, Kurt had annoyed some students by boiling all fiction down to a diagram: ''Get someone in trouble. Get them out!'' he would say. ''Man-in-the-hole!''
Right, Kurt. But I was in a hole. $1,800 would help.
Next fall, as the Vietnam War was heating up, I stayed one chapter ahead of my students. When I decided that politics mattered to me just as much as writing novels, I'd learned enough to become a speechwriter. But wait! Isn't speechwriting the sewage-filled, dumbed-down tributary of writing, designed to deceive and make inarticulate politicians seem smart?
No, because those charges fall far below even a half-truth. Political speechwriters trade the pleasure of writing under our own names for the power to help achieve policies we're passionate about and, of course, help elect people who favor them. Democratic and Republican speechwriters may differ on the content of the speeches, but we agree on the value of the writing. This is why at midnight, in any political office, you find writers adding detail to a paragraph, compressing a sentence and trying to create the runs of antithesis that bring crowds to their feet.
When I write speeches, I'm influenced by novels. I use story to move listeners. I also plant something in the opening and bring it back at the end, the way Anton Chekhov advised (''If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall...''), and I search for illuminating details, as Joseph Conrad urged (''My task is to make you hear, to make you feel, and, above all, to make you see''). But this hectic, collaborative life is nothing like the novelist's, especially when it comes to the nerve-jangling pressure to meet impossible deadlines.
Once, back in the '90s, when I wrote for Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic House majority whip, he said he wanted to do a one-minute speech. Something about the economy, he said. It was 11:50. ''When do you speak?'' I asked. ''12:02.''
I wrote a 150-word speech, called my mother to tell her if she turned on C-Span she'd see me on the House floor, ran up three flights and handed it to Mr. Bonior just as he was walking to the well.
It's tough to do great work when your first draft is often your last. It also can be difficult to make someone sound like Moses addressing the Israelites when you announce a three-point plan for reducing the deficit. And it's an art to write for a general American audience, which averages a seventh-grade reading level. It genuinely distresses some academics that politicians today speak many school grades below George Washington's Farewell Address. But a few years back researchers gave us a sense of what that seventh-grade level means. They tested adult, English-speaking hospital patients on some common directions about health, like the idiomatic sentence ''Do not take this medicine on an empty stomach.'' Did patients understand it? More than 40 percent didn't.
To speechwriters that means, don't write sentences even that complex. You can't hand your boss a speech saying, ''It's got all your ideas. But 40 percent of your audience won't know what you're talking about.'' Luckily, English is a rich language. Without losing nuance you can say a lot with simple words -- use, not utilize; now, not currently -- and simple sentences.
Speechwriters must help maintain what Aristotle called ethos, or character. Voters cast ballots not just for candidates they agree with, but for those they like. Are they compassionate? Humble? Optimistic?
To convey likability, politicians can't just point to problems. They need to propose solutions. Monroe's Motivated Sequence, the five-step structure most popular in political speech, has problem solving at its core. The most meaningful part of writing in politics is the attempt to make terrible problems real to listeners. But once we do that it's hard to convince people of our sometimes puny solutions.
Even if we do all of that well, we won't please everyone. If a president announces that the United States will invade Iraq or that he favors same-sex marriage, you can't expect those on the other side to appreciate your graceful turn of phrase.
In 1989 I wrote Senator Lloyd Bentsen's Democratic response to President George Bush's address to Congress. It's impossible for someone sitting alone in a room facing a single camera to match the glitzy presence of a president in a packed House chamber. The next morning I complained to my wife: 39 million people had watched Mr. Bush, but as soon as Mr. Bentsen started, 11 million turned off the television. Well, she said, gently, 28 million listeners were about 300 times as many people as had read all my novels.
Much of what lures speechwriters is the prospect of reaching so many people about ideas we think so important -- as Peggy Noonan did for Mr. Bush in 1989 (''thousand points of light'') ; Bob Shrum did for Edward M. Kennedy in 1980 (''the dream shall never die''); and Matt Scully did for Sarah Palin in 2008 (''If character is the measure in this election ...'').
I have passed no bill, stopped no war, created no policy that would bring health insurance to a single person. But if we expect to see such results solely from our work, that dooms many to disappointment. There's plenty to celebrate about being part of the team.
As a speechwriter in the House, Senate and White House, I wrote about 25,000 words a month -- as much as three books each year. I cherish the four novels I wrote. But I am also proud that when Al Gore spoke at Nelson Mandela's inauguration, he read my words. I've written a eulogy for Rosa Parks, speeches against a war I hated and for presidential candidates I loved. I've written about ways to educate children in the United States and to save the lives of children in Africa. At a Rose Garden event where Mr. Gore introduced President Bill Clinton, a photographer snapped a picture of Gore whispering to my son, ''He wrote the president's speech, too.''
So it would have been nice to tell Kurt how much more than 1,800 bucks I got out of his idea. He probably would have thought I put way too much faith in politics, though he would have been too nice to say it. If he picked up one of my speeches, would he have heard echoes of Conrad and Chekhov? Not likely.
But when he read through my problem-solution section he might have said what I now know is true of stories, speeches, speechwriting and, come to think of it, much of life. ''Man-in-the-hole!!''

HEADLINE: Dining Through Disaster

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY. 
A journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE end is near. And nothing takes the edge off Armageddon like freeze-dried beef stroganoff and freeze-dried Neapolitan ice cream. Or so it seems, given the growing demand for such survivalist fare, as Americans become increasingly anxious about natural, economic and geopolitical disasters.
Hurricane Sandy is just the latest in a barrage of unsettling events (tsunamis, earthquakes, droughts, worldwide economic crises, Arab unrest) fueling sales of so-called emergency food, typically freeze-dried and vacuum-packed with a 30-year shelf life. Manufacturers report sales growth ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent annually since 2008. 
And it's not just wide-eyed radicals in camouflage with bowie knives between their teeth stockpiling M.R.E.'s (Meals Ready to Eat) in mountain cabins. Twenty-something hipsters, suburban moms and Jazzercising retirees are also filling their closets and cupboards with emergency food, which now comes in cheery packaging rather than the dreary plain cardboard that was standard back when the worry was Y2K. And with improved taste, not to mention new organic, vegetarian and gluten-free options, it's never been easier to eat well in the face of the Apocalypse.
''Our customer base has moved away from the gun fanatics and political extremists to something more mainstream,'' said Mark Hyland, chief executive of FoodInsurance.com in Kaysville, Utah, where sales increased 80 percent last year. ''It's not hoarding food,'' he went on to explain. ''It's having an ability to take care of the people you care about in case you have an unexpected change in life.''
While five years ago there were only a handful of mail-order suppliers, today there are at least 20 companies selling emergency food online. Discount retailers like Walmart and Costco offer these products, too.
Some new entrants have created multilevel marketing schemes, mostly aimed at young mothers anxious to ensure that their kids never go hungry. Think of Tupperware parties with tastings of freeze-dried fettuccini Alfredo and freeze-dried fudge brownies dispensed from pastel-colored canisters and pouches. Just add water!
Other companies wrap their products in Republican red to appeal to middle-aged men bracing for ''Atlas Shrugged''-style civil unrest. Several brands are endorsed by conservative talk-radio hosts like Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. ''Prepare yourself for what we all hope won't happen but probably will,'' Mr. Beck intones ominously in one promotional spot.
Mr. Beck's endorsement is actually a twofer because he's a Mormon, another key target demographic. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encourages followers to stockpile enough food to survive three months to a year following the prophesied ''End Times'' or some other disaster. The church has 6.2 million members in the United States and is the country's fastest- growing denomination. So it's not surprising that most emergency food manufacturers are run by Mormons and are in Utah, where the church is based. (E-mails to the campaign headquarters of Mitt Romney, who is a Mormon, to find out how much food he might have stashed away, went unanswered.)
But more than motherhood or religion, it's fear and uncertainty that drive people to invest in emergency food. There's always been an uptick in demand during presidential campaigns, according to those in the industry, and weather events and stock market turbulence also spike sales.
''The difference now is people's uncertainty isn't going away and so demand is not receding like it usually does,'' said Jim Merryman, president of Oregon Freeze Dry in Albany, Ore., who has seen his share of market undulation in almost four decades with the company.
And unlike in years past, when people bought emergency food only to have it gather dust in the basement or bunker, now they may actually end up using it. When Kendra Wright's husband, Nathan, was unemployed for a month in 2009, the couple, who live in St. George, Utah, fed their five children the freeze-dried food they'd accumulated according to their Mormon faith.
I was very grateful for what I already had to be able to feed my family and not go hungry,'' said Ms. Wright, a stay-at-home mom who, with a friend, started a blog earlier this year, FoodStorageMoms.com, to counsel others on how to store food for a rainy day. The blog has around 4,000 unique visitors per month.
IT is one of several such dining-through-disaster blogs and Web sites started recently, with tips on buying emergency food, recipes and storage ideas. Many have calculators to figure out how much freeze-dried food is required to satisfy caloric needs for various durations of deprivation. Some offer consumer reviews -- ranking emergency food on taste, ease of preparation, packaging design, price and shelf life.
''The average order size is $1,000 and it's not uncommon for people to drop $20,000 on emergency food, so we thought we'd pull back the curtain so people can make good decisions not just based on fear,'' said Brandon Brooks, co-founder of FoodStorageReviewer.com and father of four, in North Salt Lake, Utah.
He is Mormon, but says most of his site's 5,000 unique monthly visitors are not. ''The size and breadth of the market is bigger than most people imagine,'' he said. ''We have people asking us questions from all states, economic backgrounds and faiths.''
Most companies encourage automatic billing and shipping plans that allow individuals to build up their emergency food stores incrementally, Mylar pouch by Mylar pouch. So far, Mr. Brooks has invested $12,000 in freeze-dried food -- enough to feed his family for a year. ''I like to eat well, so I bought the good stuff,'' he said.
His favorites? Freeze-dried chicken teriyaki and freeze-dried lasagna from Mountain House. ''If you tasted it, you'd probably say it was 8 out of 10,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''But if your ken is a nice New York restaurant, then maybe it's a 6.''

HEADLINE: The Morning After the Morning After

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
THERE are two things I'll predict about Tuesday's election: one is that America's biggest voting bloc -- the center-right/center-left -- will win; the other is that there's going to be a big civil war within the Republican Party and a small civil war within the Democratic Party starting the day after the election, as they're each forced to accommodate this center-left/center-right victory. 
By now, it should be obvious how much America is a center-right/center-left country and how much this center -- not the extremes -- has dominated this election. If Mitt Romney wins on Tuesday, it would be because he moved from the far-right, Tea Party-dictated nonsense that he used to win the G.O.P. primary to the center-right. Had Romney not ''rebranded'' himself a centrist Republican in the last month, this election would have been over long ago in President Obama's favor. Conversely, had Romney run as an authentic center-right former Republican governor of Massachusetts from the start, this election might long ago have been over in his favor. Had Obama, though, embraced the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction plan and run from the center from the start, Romney would have been locked out on the fringes long ago and never been able to pull off his ''born again'' move to moderation. Obama may still squeak by, though, by stressing his ''balanced'' approach to lowering the deficit and pragmatic foreign policy, while downplaying his more leftward initiatives like health care.
The reason the center-left/center-right bloc is dominating this election is because it intuitively knows that the only way our country can progress is with some grand bargains forged at the center. One is a package deal that slows entitlement and defense spending, raises taxes, invests in infrastructure, education and research and institutes tax reforms that unleash more entrepreneurship -- all in the right sequence and scale -- so the economy is nursed back to health. Another is a deal on immigration reform. And a third is a deal that opens the way to exploit our newfound bounty of natural gas, but with a plan that is environmentally sound and doesn't divert us from our long-term goal of a clean-energy economy that mitigates climate change.
If Romney wins, it would be because the center-right/center-left concluded that he would approach these grand bargains with the moderate Republican instincts and willingness to compromise that he has been either faking or sincerely projecting in the last month -- and would be able to impose that moderation on his party. If Obama wins, it would be because the center-right/center-left concluded that he has been trying to govern from the center, has made progress, but has also been obstructed by G.O.P. hard-liners, and they wanted to give him more time.
A lot has been written lately about how, given these two options, we'd be better off going with Romney, because he supposedly can control the crazies in his party to deliver his side of these grand bargains -- but, by sticking with Obama, we'd only get more gridlock. I don't buy that for two reasons. First, it would be saying that since Republicans on the far-right managed to obstruct Obama on many fronts, and held the economy hostage, we should let them rule because otherwise they'd do it again. That would only invite Democrats to behave the same way, which would leave us nowhere.
I also don't buy it because I think the G.O.P. has gone so much farther to the right than the Democrats have gone to left. I do not trust that Romney will be able to tame the radical G.O.P. base without making concessions to it on the environment, the Supreme Court and foreign policy that are not in the nation's long-term interest.
I think the best thing for the country today would be if the Republicans lost the presidency twice in a row, the way the Democrats did under Ronald Reagan, and then had to undergo the same kind of rethinking and reformation that Democrats did under Bill Clinton, which moved their party solidly into the center-left. Parties learn from defeat, not from victory -- especially two defeats in a row.
Granted, the morning after an election defeat, angry G.O.P. hard-liners would surely vow to obstruct Obama more than ever. I'm not afraid. Because the morning after the morning after, G.O.P. governors, mayors and business leaders would see where the country really is and finally do what needs to be done: either crush or separate themselves from a radical base that has forced Republican candidates into a war against math, physics, biology, Hispanics and gays and lesbians -- all at the same time.
Their party has no future if it constantly has to cater to or disguise that narrow base. And America's future is hampered if we don't have a responsible center-right conservative party, offering market-based solutions and a spirit of compromise to solve our biggest problems -- not a radical right-libertarian-Tea Party coalition that is leading the G.O.P. around by the nose, purging unbelievers and signing loyalty pledges to self-appointed conservative ayatollahs.
A truly center-right G.O.P. would force the Democrats to have their own civil war -- the center-left versus the rest -- largely over tax/entitlement reform and defense spending. Obama has never fully tested where the Democratic base is on these issues, but that's coming. The Democratic civil war will encompass fewer issues than the G.O.P.'s, but it will be intense and unavoidable -- if we are to forge the Grand Bargains that America's center-right/center-left majority clearly wants and the country clearly needs.

HEADLINE: Living, and Dying, in Google's World

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
STARTING in February, Jeffrey G. Katz grew increasingly anxious as he watched the steady decline of online traffic to his company's comparison-shopping Web site, Nextag, from Google's search engine.
In a geeky fire drill, engineers and outside consultants at Nextag scrambled to see if the problem was its own fault. Maybe some inadvertent change had prompted Google's algorithm to demote Nextag when a person typed in shopping-related search terms like ''kitchen table'' or ''lawn mower.''
But no, the engineers determined. And traffic from Google's search engine continued to decline, by half.
Nextag's response? It doubled its spending on Google paid search advertising in the last five months. 
The move was costly but necessary to retain shoppers, Mr. Katz says, because an estimated 60 percent of Nextag's traffic comes from Google, both from free search and paid search ads, which are ads that are related to search results and appear next to them. ''We had to do it,'' says Mr. Katz, chief executive of Wize Commerce, owner of Nextag. ''We're living in Google's world.''
Regulators in the United States and Europe are conducting sweeping inquiries of Google, the dominant Internet search and advertising company. Google rose by technological innovation and business acumen; in the United States, it has 67 percent of the search market and collects 75 percent of search ad dollars. Being big is no crime, but if a powerful company uses market muscle to stifle competition, that is an antitrust violation.
So the government is focusing on life in Google's world for the sprawling economic ecosystem of Web sites that depend on their ranking in search results. What is it like to live this way, in a giant's shadow? The experience of its inhabitants is nuanced and complex, a blend of admiration and fear.
The relationship between Google and Web sites, publishers and advertisers often seems lopsided, if not unfair. Yet Google has also provided and nurtured a landscape of opportunity. Its ecosystem generates $80 billion a year in revenue for 1.8 million businesses, Web sites and nonprofit organizations in the United States alone, it estimates.
The government's scrutiny of Google is the most exhaustive investigation of a major corporation since the pursuit of Microsoft in the late 1990s.
The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended preparing an antitrust suit against Google, according to people briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition they not be identified. But the commissioners must vote to proceed. Even if they do, the government and Google could settle.
Google has drawn the attention of antitrust officials as it has moved aggressively beyond its dominant product -- search and search advertising -- into fields like online commerce and local reviews. The antitrust issue is whether Google uses its search engine to favor its offerings like Google Shopping and Google Plus Local over rivals.
For policy makers, Google is a tough call.
''What to do with an attractive monopolist, like Google, is a really challenging issue for antitrust,'' says Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and a former senior adviser to the F.T.C. ''The goal is to encourage them to stay in power by continuing to innovate instead of excluding competitors.''
SPEAKING at a Google Zeitgeist conference in Arizona last month, Larry Page, the company's co-founder and chief executive, said he understood the government scrutiny of his company, given Google's size and reach. ''There's very many decisions we make that really impact a lot of people,'' he acknowledged.
The main reason is that Google is continually adjusting its search algorithm -- the smart software that determines the relevance, ranking and presentation of search results, typically links to other Web sites.
Google says it makes the changes to improve its service, and has long maintained that its algorithm weeds out low-quality sites and shows the most useful results, whether or not they link to Google products.
''Our first and highest goal has to be to get the user the information they want as quickly and easily as possible,'' says Matt Cutts, leader of the Web spam team at Google.
But Google's algorithm is secret, and changes can leave Web sites scrambling.
Consider Vote-USA.org, a nonprofit group started in 2003. It provides online information for voters to avoid the frustration of arriving at a polling booth and barely recognizing half the names on the ballot. The site posts free sample ballots for federal, state and local elections with candidates' pictures, biographies and views on issues.
In the 2004 and 2006 elections, users created tens of thousands of sample ballots. By 2008, traffic had fallen sharply, says Ron Kahlow, who runs Vote-USA.org, because ''we dropped off the face of the map on Google.''
As founder of a search-engine optimization company and a recipient of grants that Google gives nonprofits to advertise free, Mr. Kahlow knows a thing or two about how to operate in Google's world. He pored over Google's guidelines for Web sites, made changes and e-mailed Google. Yet he received no response.
''I lost all donations to support the operation,'' he said. ''It was very, very painful.''
A breakthrough came through a personal connection. A friend of Mr. Kahlow knew Ed Black, chief executive of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Google. Mr. Black made an inquiry on Mr. Kahlow's behalf, and a Google engineer investigated.
The problem, Mr. Kahlow learned, was that the site's state Web pages also had information for national candidates -- reasonable to a person seeking voting information at one digital location. But to Google's algorithm, duplicate content on a site suggests a shady shortcut to try to make a site look bigger than it is.
Mr. Kahlow fixed that, so that someone on a state page must go to another page to see the ballot and information about national candidates. Vote-USA.org quickly moved off Google's black list, and during this election season people have been viewing 333,000 pages a day.
Last year, Mr. Kahlow said, F.T.C. investigators asked him if he thought his site was a target of discrimination. No, he replied. But since then, he has watched Google promote its tools for finding where to vote and sample ballots, just like his site offers.
''At that time, I didn't believe it was intentional, but I'm having second thoughts,'' he says. ''I'm sure they're aware of the amount of money that's being spent in politics and I'm sure they'd like to get their fingers in the pie.''
Google will not comment on its relations with specific Web sites. But a person briefed on its interactions with Vote-USA.org said Google had found additional duplication, like Michigan candidates showing up on the Iowa Web site. The person also said that hardly any other Web sites linked to Vote-USA.org, one of the most important elements in the algorithm.
EARLY last year, operators of small local news sites nationwide found that their number of readers had plummeted. Why? Their Web sites had disappeared from Google News, which in many cases was their No. 1 source of traffic.
Their owners wrote e-mail messages to Google and scoured online forums, to no avail.
''There was no explanation why or place you could go for more information,'' says Hal Goodtree, editor and publisher of CaryCitizen, a local news site in Cary, N.C.
Google News, he says, brings traffic and credibility. ''You're legit if you're on Google News,'' he explains, ''so it was painful.''
Lance Knobel, co-founder of Berkeleyside, a local news site in Berkeley, Calif., complained about the problem on Twitter, and a Berkeleyside reader who was a Google engineer eventually saw it. He promised Mr. Knobel he would look into it, unofficially.
Twelve hours later, Berkeleyside reappeared in Google News. Google said dropping the site was an error.
In North Carolina, Mr. Goodtree heard nothing for months about what had happened. In June, he received an e-mail from Google saying it was ''unable to provide specifics'' about why the site had been dropped.
Then, in August, Google wrote, ''We recently reviewed your site again and have decided to add it to Google News once more.'' No further explanation was given. Traffic to CaryCitizen jumped 24 percent. Mr. Knobel, in California, says of Google: ''It's a totally opaque corporation.''
Mr. Cutts of Google says it is impossible for the company to respond individually to every Web site owner with a question, because of sheer scale; there are 240 million domain names and people search Google more than 3.3 billion times a day.
Yet Google is trying to do more, he says. Last year, it started hosting video chats for Web site owners to ask questions. It has also started publishing blog posts about changes in the algorithm and broadcast eight minutes of a top-secret meeting about it.
''We try very hard to make sure we communicate with Webmasters,'' Mr. Cutts says. For instance, he says, he reassured Gawker Media that it would remain in search results after Hurricane Sandy caused it to crash.
Google does not compete with sites like CaryCitizen and Berkeleyside in the labor-intensive chore of reporting and writing local news. But local news sites, notes Mr. Knobel of Berkeleyside, do compete in their way with Google for local advertising.
As the company builds up Google Plus Local, its local business listing and review service, Mr. Knobel says Google's search engine could give the Internet giant ''a tremendous advantage.'' That would result, he says, if a person seeking information about a local business is steered to Google Plus Local rather than to small sites like Berkeleyside or sizable services like Yelp.
At the Arizona conference, Mr. Page was asked about Google's competition with other Web businesses. ''That's always a hard question,'' he replied, but not a new one. He pointed to Google Maps, which was introduced in 2005. ''If you think back then,'' he said, ''we had the same kind of criticisms, like 'Oh, there's already MapQuest.' Anybody heard of them? No one uses them anymore.''
Today, MapQuest has half the number of monthly visitors as Google Maps, according to comScore.
GOOGLE'S overriding goal, Mr. Page suggests, is continual improvement of its product, which, he says, means adding more services that collect and parse data. Some competitors may suffer. But, he adds, ''our job is to serve users.''
Google has argued that forcefully to regulators because in antitrust, consumer benefit weighs heavily. But this is an evasion to competitors like Mr. Katz of Nextag, who has been questioned by regulators. He says Google increasingly presents itself as a commerce site as much as a search engine, pointing to changes that occurred mainly in the last year or two.
Today, if you Google a phrase like ''patio furniture,'' the results are not just a list of blue links to other Web sites. Instead, you will find a few ads, shaded in beige to identify them. On the right side of the page are product pictures and links to merchants, part of Google Shopping. Below Google Shopping is a Google map with locations of local stores. Then, sprawled down the page, are the blue links.
The effect, Mr. Katz says, is that Google commerce services get more of the prime real estate near the top of the screen. That means that even if Nextag ranks high in the organic search results, which costs him nothing, a user is less likely to see the link. He and his team also say changes in Google's algorithm in recent months have hurt Nextag.
His Google traffic now costs more. Two years ago, 60 percent of Nextag's traffic from Google was from free search and 40 percent paid -- people clicking on ads Nextag bought. Today, it is 30 percent free and 70 percent paid.
But his company has also shifted its strategy to become less vulnerable to Google's charge into commerce. It has invested heavily in its underlying technology to help Web sites attract visitors, especially ones most likely to buy their goods.
Wize Commerce, the Nextag owner, is based in San Mateo, Calif.; it is profitable and employs 450 people. The revised plan, Mr. Katz says, ''gives us a shot at being a very healthy company,'' less dependent on Google.

HEADLINE: One Safety Net That Needs To Shrink

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ELECTION Day is upon us, and neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney has really addressed one of the nation's most pressing economic issues: the risk that one day taxpayers might have to bail out swashbuckling financial institutions again.
Granted, the economic pain many are feeling now -- the snail's pace recovery, the stubbornly high unemployment -- is foremost in voters' minds. But given all we've gone through after the last binge in the financial industry, failing to confront the too-big-to-fail question is a serious oversight. 
Many Americans probably think the Dodd-Frank financial reform law will protect taxpayers from future bailouts. Wrong. In fact, Dodd-Frank actually widened the federal safety net for big institutions. Under that law, eight more giants were granted the right to tap the Federal Reserve for funding when the next crisis hits. At the same time, those eight may avoid Dodd-Frank measures that govern how we're supposed to wind down institutions that get into trouble.
In other words, these lucky eight got the best of both worlds: access to the Fed's money and no penalty for failure.
Which institutions hit this jackpot? Clearinghouses. These are large, powerful institutions that clear or settle options, bond and derivatives trades. They include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange and the Options Clearing Corporation. All were designated as systemically important financial market utilities under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank. People often refer to these institutions as utilities, but that's not quite right. Many of these enterprises run lucrative businesses, have shareholders and reward their executives handsomely. Last year, the CME Group, the parent company of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, generated almost $3.3 billion in revenue. Its chief executive, Craig S. Donohue, received $3.9 million in compensation and held an additional $10 million worth of equity awards outstanding, according to the company's proxy statement.
Make no mistake: these institutions are stretching the federal safety net. The Chicago Merc clears derivatives contracts with a notional value in the trillions of dollars. I.C.E. clears most of the credit default swaps in the United States -- billions of dollars a day, on paper. No wonder they are considered major players in our financial system.
But placing them at the bailout trough is wrong, according to Sheila Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In a recently published book, Ms. Bair wrote that top officials at the Treasury and the Fed, over the objections of the F.D.I.C., pushed to gain access for the clearinghouses to Fed lending.
The clearinghouses ''were drooling at the prospect of having access to loans from the Fed,'' she wrote. ''I thought it was a terrible precedent and still do. It was the first time in the history of the Fed that any entity besides an insured bank could borrow from the discount window.'' .
''The Treasury's and the Fed's reasoning was that since another part of Dodd-Frank was trying to encourage more activity to move to clearinghouses, we should provide some liquidity support to them,'' she said in an interview last week. ''Our argument back was, if you have an event beyond their control with systemwide consequences, then you have the ability to lend on a generally available basis. What they wanted was the ability to lend to individual clearinghouses.''
The clearinghouses have considerable clout in Washington. From the beginning of 2010 through this year, the CME Group has spent $6 million lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Did these players push for special treatment while avoiding other aspects of Dodd-Frank? Representatives of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Options Clearing Corporation say no, noting that access to the Fed meant they would also be overseen by the central bank, in addition to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.
But the Fed's involvement is not likely to be intrusive, because Dodd-Frank directed it to take a back seat to a financial utility's primary regulator, either the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C.
The CME said that it did not support Dodd-Frank's designation of clearinghouses as systemically important, but once it received the designation, it believed the Fed should provide access to emergency lending. The O.C.C. echoed this point.
Whatever the case, the CME Group has argued that it should be exempt from the orderly liquidation authority set up under Dodd-Frank. This authority was designed to unwind complex and interconnected financial firms that could threaten the financial system if they failed. The law appointed the F.D.I.C. as receiver to resolve teetering entities. That authority is supposed to end the problem of institutions that are too big to be allowed to fail and also to hold their managers accountable.
BUT in a letter to the F.D.I.C. a few months after Dodd-Frank became law, the CME Group asked the F.D.I.C. to confirm that the exchange wouldn't fall under that authority's jurisdiction. It is not a financial company as defined by the law, the CME contended, and therefore should not be subject to the resolution process.
The F.D.I.C. has not confirmed the C.M.E.'s view on the matter. But it seems to be gaining traction among other regulators. At an Aug. 2012 presentation last August on resolving financial market utilities, Robert S. Steigerwald of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago noted that it was unclear whether a financial utility such as the Chicago Merc would have to be wound down as required under Dodd-Frank.
So these large and systemically important financial utilities that together trade and clear trillions of dollars in transactions appear to have won the daily double -- access to federal money, without the accountability.
''Dodd-Frank should have been all about contracting the safety net,'' Ms. Bair said last week. ''But this was a huge and unprecedented expansion of the safety net that provided expressed government support for for-profit entities. These financial market utilities are the new government-sponsored enterprises.''

HEADLINE: Some Voters Are Spelling Out Their Indecision on Their Donation Checks

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
For one tiny sliver of swing voters, it is not enough to be wrestling with whether to vote for President Obama or Mitt Romney at a moment when nearly everyone else has long since decided. Their checkbooks, too, are wavering between the two candidates.
Meet the undecided donors. They are not lobbyists or other members of the political class -- donors with a professional imperative to hedge their bets -- but ordinary voters whose back-and-forth donations mirror the undulations of the swing electorate. 
Some have attended small fund-raisers for both men, curious to hear what the candidates' more ardent supporters have to say. Others have responded to the campaigns' daily barrages of e-mail solicitations, or to the ups and downs of the candidates' debate performances and public gaffes. Still others said they simply could not make up their minds.
''I'm all mixed up between being a conservative and a liberal,'' said Kurt Schoeneman, a grape grower from Northern California, who added that some of his friends thought he was ''senile.'' He had found himself seized by waves of enthusiasm, Mr. Schoeneman said -- first for one candidate and then for the other.
''Some of these people, they just loathe Obama, and they'll write something really nasty about him,'' said Mr. Schoeneman, who has given checks to both candidates, most recently $100 to Mr. Romney in June and $100 to Mr. Obama in July. ''And then something else will happen, and I'll go give Romney some money.''
Charles Y. Chen, a salesman in Virginia, gave Mr. Romney $100 on the day of his convention speech in late August. But in September, Mr. Chen donated to Mr. Obama every few days, $50 here, $55 there. Then he switched again, giving Mr. Romney $50.
''I think the Republicans have better ideas on the economy and the Democrats have better ideas on social issues, immigration and social justice,'' Mr. Chen said in an interview. ''Just like anything, both have something that they do great and something that they need to improve.''
Gretchen Davidson, a homemaker in Birmingham, a Detroit suburb, said she had gone to several events to hear different ideas and arguments. She gave $500 to Mr. Romney in early August and $1,500 to Mr. Obama in late September.
''You have friends that throw parties on each side, and honestly, I am someone in the middle that didn't really know which way I was going,'' Ms. Davidson said. ''You try to sort of see what people are so excited about.''
Ms. Davidson has since settled on a candidate but declined to say which one. Other undecided donors suggested that they -- unlike the wealthy executives funneling millions of dollars into pro-Romney or pro-Obama ''super PACs'' -- did not have their hearts set on a particular outcome.
''I think the race is quite close, and I don't care much about who gets elected,'' said Kallol Bagchi, a business professor at the University of Texas, El Paso, whose areas of research include ''decision sciences.''
Mr. Bagchi gave $100 each to both candidates on Sept. 8, he said, because ''they are doing good work for the country. And I want them to come together. So for that reason, I gave to them both.''
Mr. Bagchi said that while he usually gave equally to both candidates, he had recently responded to a particularly personal appeal from the Obama campaign.
''I have given a little more to Barack Obama because he and Michelle were celebrating their anniversary,'' he said. ''But on balance it was very equal.''
Lobbyists or contractors, the sort of Beltway tradesmen and -women who need to ensure access no matter who wins, have always hedged their political giving. Chief executives of large companies face similar imperatives. Andrew N. Liveris of Michigan, the chairman of Dow Chemical, gave $5,000 to each candidate in the space of three weeks. He did not respond to a request for an interview.
But some of the less prominent undecided donors said they had been strategically bipartisan for different reasons.
Alexandre Scherer, an insurance executive in New York, said he had made his contributions -- $250 to Mr. Obama in August, $250 to Mr. Romney a day later -- because he believed that both candidates' reliance on corporate money had made it difficult for them to speak their real views on issues that are important to him, like financial regulation and Internet privacy.
''I thought to myself, maybe the best way to help is to give money to both candidates,'' Mr. Scherer said. ''I am not sure who I am going to vote for yet, but I want them to address the topics that are important to me.''
Alan Lezak, who helps run a family meatpacking business in Chicago and lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he had given to Mr. Obama because the president was his first choice and to Mr. Romney because he thought the former financial executive was his least worst alternative.
''I thought of all the people who might be running against Obama and who I thought really held the closest values to me,'' Mr. Lezak said. ''Romney has come much more towards the center since he was nominated. So it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world as far as I am concerned.''
Brian Schroeder, an executive based in Green Bay, Wis., said he was definitely voting Republican but had a particular reason for giving to Mr. Obama's campaign.
''First, I'm a Romney supporter,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''Secondly, I was being audited by the I.R.S.''
Mr. Schroeder said he had been inundated with e-mails from the Obama campaign requesting contributions and feared consequences if he did not give.
''They get personal and aggressive,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''And I figure if he would be re-elected, I don't want to be on their list.''

HEADLINE: Costs of Canceling Marathon Are Uncounted but Immense

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS and KEN BELSON; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The finish line for the 43rd New York City Marathon stood silent in the stillness of Central Park on Friday night, its signs listing the sponsors of a race that had been canceled hours earlier. The statue of Fred Lebow, the race's founder, overlooked the empty scene.
''Few things in life match the thrill of a marathon,'' read a quotation from Lebow on a poster placed beneath his statue.
Few things in New York life, however, have matched the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. And no matter how the city's officials and marathon organizers tried to soften its impact to preserve this year's 26.2-mile race through five boroughs, its end came abruptly Friday. 
Earlier last week, in the face of mounting criticism, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood firm in defending the marathon, saying it would lift the city's spirits and fill its coffers. Mary Wittenberg, the president and chief executive of New York Road Runners, the organization that directs the race, championed the event as a symbol of resilience.
Now the city, along with Road Runners, will be forced to reckon with significant losses, ones officials could not even begin to calculate in light of the natural disaster.
''This was a difficult decision, but the right decision,'' Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson said at the cancellation news conference in the elaborate temporary structure near the finish line. ''Next year it will go back to being a wonderful, unifying, celebratory event.''
The marathon generates an estimated $340 million in spending, thanks in part to more than 20,000 runners from overseas who spend money at hotels, restaurants, theaters and shops.
''The marathon is an enormous economic generator for the city,'' Wolfson said, acknowledging that the taxes helped to ''pay our police officers and our fire officers and our teachers.''
''It helps businesses,'' he added. ''I am sure there will be a lot of businesses in Brooklyn that will be feeling the absence of the marathon on Sunday. People won't be buying things as they watch.''
Nor will they be buying as much beer in Manhattan on First Avenue north of the Queensboro Bridge, probably the most boisterous, fan-packed stretch of the course. ''It's our busiest weekend of the year,'' John Teevan, the owner of the Baker Street Pub, said outside the bar late Friday. ''I wish the mayor had made the call earlier because we brought in extra food for Sunday.''
But Teevan, who has owned the bar for 12 years, said he understood the outrage that led to the cancellation. ''It's a tough call,'' he said. ''You have so many people out in Staten Island who have no water, no basic necessities, and you're catering to all the tourists coming to the city? I think I would be peeved, too.''
With some runners staying home or leaving the city early, resources like hotel rooms were made available to local residents without power or shelter; marathon officials said they would donate water, blankets and portable toilets, as well as at least $1 million in cash.
But as the city took initial steps to heal, just how long it would take Road Runners to recover -- financially, and in terms of reputation -- was in question.
Road Runners, a nonprofit organization, relies on the marathon for more than half its $60 million in annual revenue, which officials say goes into financing its programs and conducting races. This was the first time in nearly 20 years that the marathon was going to be broadcast live on national television, and officials had adjusted the script to be sensitive to Sandy's aftermath.
''This was going to be our version of a telethon to raise funds for New York,'' Wittenberg said.
According to tax returns and interviews with officials, Road Runners has a relatively slim cushion, generating a couple of million dollars more than it spends each year.
Now Wittenberg's organization will still have to determine how much to pay the television sponsors and the race sponsors, as well as the elite runners who came from as far as Africa and Australia, some of whom would have earned the bulk of their income from appearance fees in the race.
A clause in the insurance policy about ''extreme weather conditions'' seems to cover the storm cancellation, but just how extensive that coverage will be has not yet been determined.
''We have some insurance,'' Wittenberg said, ''but there's going to be some heavy hits as a result of this.''
The public relations hit could be far worse.
All the amateur athletes who trained for months will want to know whether their entry fees, which were as high as $347, will be refunded. Road Runners will, at least for now, stick to its firm no-refund policy, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak for the organization. But the club has not ruled out offering some form of compensation.
The 2012 entrants will be guaranteed spots in the 2013 marathon ''or, if they prefer, the New York City Half,'' Wittenberg said, referring to a half-marathon that is run in March. It was not clear whether runners would have to pay an additional entry fee next year.
About 140,000 runners applied this year for roughly 60,000 spots in the race. If nearly all of the 2012 entrants want to run in the 2013 marathon, in a race squeezed by multiple wave starts, it could make next year's lottery nearly unwinnable. ''We will assess that,'' Wittenberg said.
It is also unclear how the organization will rework its five-year television rights contract with ESPN and WABC, the local affiliate. A spokesman for ESPN, Chris LaPlaca, said the network had not had time to discuss it with Road Runners. One possibility is extending the contract a year, other network executives said.
Road Runners will also have to negotiate with sponsors like Asics, Nissan, Timex and United Airlines, which were swept into the marathon debate. ING, celebrating its 10th year as title sponsor of the marathon, said it fully supported the decision to cancel the race and donated $500,000 to relief efforts.
In a statement, the company said it ''understands that many people, businesses, as well as its own New York-based employees have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy.''
The larger problem for the city, though, is how to recoup the dollars that would have been spent by the runners, their families and their friends. On average, each participant spends $1,778 on hotels, transportation, food and beverage, entertainment and shopping, according to an independent survey, produced by Aecom last year.
About 40,000 of the 47,500 runners had arrived, though, and Wolfson, the deputy mayor, said he hoped they would still enjoy the city. Spending by marathon tourists generates an estimated $17.3 million in taxes, about two-thirds of which goes to the city.
The marathon course moved out of Central Park and into the five boroughs in 1976, as a way to invigorate a bankrupt city. There were no guarantees that it would even be run in 1977.
But enthusiastic crowds watched, and marathon stars like Grete Waitz and Alberto Salazar emerged to win multiple times, increasing the popularity of running in New York.
The marathon has become big business over the last decade. Now, with the great demand for entry to the race, many runners join charity teams to raise thousands of dollars for a guaranteed spot. This year, 300 charity teams were projected to raise more than $34 million, even though the runners were unable to compete in the race.
On Saturday morning, thousands of runners from all over the world streamed into Central Park, taking pictures at the finish line. Overnight, marathon officials had removed the quotation below Lebow's statue.

HEADLINE: Sex and the Weight Of National History

BYLINE: By STEVEN McELROY

 BODY:
EARLY in ''Mies Julie,'' a South African adaptation of Strindberg's play, a domestic servant takes a garden fork to the kitchen floor of her boss's house in a feverish attempt to free her ancestors' spirits, trapped beneath flagstones that were placed over a burial ground. In moments like this South African history merges with Strindberg's drama in a production that speaks boldly about that nation today.
''Mies Julie,'' adapted and directed by Yael Farber, enthralled critics and audiences at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this summer when it was presented by the Baxter Theater Center of Cape Town and the South African State Theater. The show drew raves and won several awards, including a coveted Fringe First from the newspaper The Scotsman and the Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award. 
Ms. Farber, 41, who grew up in Johannesburg, said in a recent interview in New York that Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' drew her attention because she is always interested in texts ''that had an extraordinary impact on their society when they were written.'' Though Strindberg's drama ''lacks teeth in today's society,'' she said, she was curious how it might work when placed in a different context. ''I saw that the spine of the narrative had an extraordinarily potent potential to speak about ownership through the domination of the body,'' she said, ''and how this dynamic gets unlocked over a single night in one kitchen, in the heat of the kitchen.''
Ms. Farber will now see how New York audiences respond to her take on Strindberg's play, about an idle young rich woman who has an affair with her father's footman. Susan Feldman, the artistic director of St. Ann's Warehouse, saw ''Mies Julie'' in Edinburgh and worked quickly to bring the show to New York, where it will run Nov. 8 through Dec. 2 at St. Ann's new theater in Dumbo, Brooklyn.
Ms. Farber's adaptation places Strindberg's tale in contemporary South Africa and features an interracial couple at its heart. The affair between Julie (Hilda Cronje) and a black servant, John (Bongile Mantsai), not only crosses lines of race and class but also is informed by the complex issue of land restitution for South African blacks. In this telling Julie's family took the land from John's generations ago, and though there is love between them and a common desire for freedom from their current circumstances, their relationship is intricately, and hopelessly, complicated by the shared history of oppression.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but South Africa in some ways has not changed. ''Those who have, still have, and those who didn't, for the large part, don't,'' Ms. Farber said.
The third main character in Ms. Farber's adaptation is Christine (Thokozile Ntshinga), John's mother, who highlights the generations-old economic construct of blacks serving whites on land formerly owned by black families. Christine helped to raise Julie too, and maternal love adds to the Gordian knot of the drama. (In Strindberg the Christine character is John's girlfriend.)
There are no simple solutions in the play, or in South Africa. ''The land is an issue that hasn't been addressed, which means wealth has not been addressed,'' Ms. Farber said. ''Mies Julie has lived on that land. Her family's been there for three generations. So I wanted to express the complexity of the issue. Not straight up 'this should just be given back to people.' There is an enduring dilemma inside the country about how you create some level of justice.''
Ms. Farber is a third-generation white South African who earned her bachelor's degree in dramatic art from University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. She said she sought a career as an actor before deciding that directing suited her better, and she went on to win awards for it. Though romance brought her to Montreal almost a decade ago, and family and work keep her there today, Ms. Farber still considers South Africa her home.
''It's my identity,'' she said. ''I don't know if we ever lose that sense of where home is.''
Perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects of Ms. Farber's production is that it was done in South Africa at all: It had its premiere in July at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival and then was presented at the Baxter before heading to Edinburgh in August. The bold staging includes nudity and graphic sexual interaction between a white actress and a black actor. In 2012 New York this is hardly outré, but interracial marriage and sexual intercourse across color lines were illegal in South Africa until 1985.
A production of the Strindberg play presented at the Baxter in 1985 was far tamer but included an interracial couple -- played by Sandra Prinsloo and John Kani -- and their kiss. Ms. Farber said she read letters in the Baxter's archives written to Ms. Prinsloo, and ''the hatred, the bomb threats, the threats of violence: it was really a society of extraordinary fear that manifested itself with such deep suspicion that there was a hatred, a deep hatred.''
When ''Mies Julie'' was presented in South Africa this year, the reaction was quite different. Ms. Ntshinga, who saw the 1985 production, said by telephone from Cape Town: ''People walked out then. This time sometimes people just sit in the theater, and they can't move. It's like people are glued onto the seats.''
The play challenges its actors, though. Ms. Cronje, also speaking from Cape Town, said that facing her upbringing as a child of apartheid, ''as much as I thought I was free,'' made her nervous. ''But I noted it, and I thought: How can I not embrace this beautiful man in front of me? It's just skin color. It was hard, but it was beautiful and freeing.''
Although ''Mies Julie'' has a distinctly South African flavor, it spoke to a wide demographic in Edinburgh. ''For any audience outside of South Africa you get some kind of understanding of what the temperature is about this land issue,'' Ms. Ntshinga said. ''There's heat. People are not saying much, but people are angry. And it's not only black people who are angry. White people are angry as well.''
Such questions ''belong to all of us,'' Ms. Farber said. ''Many of the modern nations rest on very subversive and dark histories.''

HEADLINE: Borrowing to Build

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
AS the housing market begins to improve, new homes are popping up again in prime areas. If lenders are staying away from speculative building projects, some are willing to finance new construction for buyers who put substantial money down.
Construction financing isn't the type of loan one goes shopping for online; it is more likely to be found up the street. ''The places that are offering construction financing are typically the credit unions and the regional banks,'' said John Walsh, the president of Total Mortgage Services, a Milford, Conn., lender.
Local banks are more comfortable making home construction loans because they know the local market. But qualifying is more complicated than for a conventional mortgage. Borrowers have to do a lot more legwork ahead of time because, in addition to proving that they can afford the cost of the house, they must show that they have a viable project. 
''People want to make sure they know what they need to do early in the process,'' said Penn Johnson, the president of the Stamford Mortgage Company, a broker. ''You can't apply until after you have building plans, a construction contract and a cost estimate.''
The cost of the land may be figured into the construction loan amount, if the borrower doesn't already own the lot.
''People either pay cash for the land, or they contract to pay cash for the land when the project's completed, or they pay it out of the construction loan,'' said Debi Orr, an agent with Keller Williams Realty in Ridgefield, Conn. But if they're not paying at the outset, ''they're going to have to have a pretty solid down payment to qualify.''
The down payment is figured as a percentage of the total cost of the project (land and construction costs). In general, the loan-to-value restrictions are ''pretty onerous,'' requiring 20 to 30 percent down, said Mark Yecies, an owner of SunQuest Funding in Cranford, N.J.
Some lenders offer construction financing as a separate, short-term loan -- usually no longer than a year. The borrower refinances into a permanent mortgage after the house is completed.
Increasingly, lenders are combining the two into a single 30-year loan, with a single closing, called construction-to-permanent financing. The streamlined loan process cuts down on closing costs, but some borrowers may prefer not to be locked in and to retain instead the flexibility to shop for mortgages.
That is because interest rates on construction-to-permanent loans are a little higher than on conventional mortgages.
''You might be paying an extra quarter to a half a percent above Fannie Mae'' on such a loan, Mr. Johnson said, comparing that with ''a 30-year fixed in the low 4 percent, and a 5-to-1 adjustable-rate mortgage at 3 percent.''
As funds are disbursed during construction, lenders charge the borrower only for interest on the amount owed. Yet the steep down-payment requirement for construction loans is limiting.
And those who hope just to buy land for a future home will find financing no easier. Lending for land alone, with no clear timeline for construction, is difficult to find, mortgage brokers say. Banks deem these loans to be very risky, ''because there's nothing really tying anybody to a piece of raw land,'' said Mr. Walsh of Total Mortgage.
''If the borrower loses a job or runs into financial trouble,'' he said, ''the land will probably be one of the first things they stop paying on. Banks may compensate for that by asking for 50 percent down.''
In Scarsdale, New Rochelle and Mamaroneck, N.Y., builders are paying all cash for building lots, said Iris Kalt, an agent with Prudential Centennial Realty. Likewise, in Litchfield County, Conn., ''the people that are buying the expensive pieces of land are usually buying them straight out,'' said Kathleen Harrison, a principal of Fazzone & Harrison Realty in Sherman.

HEADLINE: How Early Mormons Shaped Utah

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
MITT ROMNEY'S run for president has drawn new attention to Mormonism, but if you really want to learn about the church and its roots in Utah, the Romney you may want to talk to is the candidate's distant cousin Clive.
Clive Romney (he and the Republican nominee share a great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney) is a passionate promoter of Mormon and Utah pioneer history. As the executive director of Utah Pioneer Heritage Arts, Clive Romney writes and produces songs and stories about Utah history and the Mormon faith and helps lead tours that show how early Mormons shaped the state -- not always for the better. 
Mr. Romney's newest passion is promoting the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area, established by Congress in 2006 with a mission to preserve the area's history and to generate economic development. It includes natural areas like Bryce Canyon National Park as well as entire towns platted to encourage sharing resources, reflecting an early Mormon philosophy called the United Order. The heritage area includes six rural counties in south-central Utah that are threaded by Highway 89. Mr. Romney and others provide tours in the area, but travelers are free to explore on their own.
Below are edited excerpts from a conversation about what he sees as important stories told through the Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area.
Q. What will a tourist learn about Mormonism and Utah history in the heritage area that they might not learn in Salt Lake City?
A. If you go to Temple Square in Salt Lake, you learn all about the doctrines of the Mormon Church. If you go to the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area, you see the doctrines put into practice on the ground. The mind-set affected how the people interacted with the territory. For instance, you see all of these almost carbon-copy town plats, where they laid down a grid pattern and they surveyed it. People drew lots to find out what lot of land was going to be theirs, and then they put up their cabins or, in many cases, stone homes. These pioneers built for the future, so there are a lot of old stone homes.
Q. Why was the platting important?
A. It was called the plat of Zion. These were all viewed as little miniature experiments in Zion, in building Zion in each little town. Some of them even were communal living. They were called the United Order, a way of living where everybody just deeded over all of their belongings to the church and then they were given back as they needed: whatever they needed for living, according to what their assigned tasks were in a community. If they were a cattle herder, then they needed a horse. If you wove cloth for clothes, you didn't really need a horse because you could walk from house to house.
Q. What impact did Mormon pioneers have on Utah's natural environment?
A. Some places have really blossomed as the rose, which is a biblical phrase that they kind of took as their mandate, to make the desert ''blossom as the rose.''There were some that were pretty barren and now they've got farms, homes, trees. But there were other places where the valleys historically had hip-high grass all the way through the valleys and up into the mountains, and by overgrazing, those have been damaged. The pioneers were not nearly as knowledgeable as we are today about the effect people have on the land. Utah is still struggling in some areas to repair the damage that was done. Some places may never be the same.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
Landlord Raises Garage Rent
Q I have a rent-stabilized apartment with a garage space in New York City. For my upcoming lease, the landlord wants to apply the rent guideline increase of 2 percent or $20, whichever is greater, to the current rent for the garage. A neighbor who rents storage space in the building for $50 a month is also being told that she has to pay the $20 increase on her new lease. Can the landlord do this?
A Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, says the writer is asking about rent increases on what the rent laws call ''ancillary services.'' These include garage, laundry and recreational facilities. 
The Rent Guideline Order that allows for ''minimum'' increases like the one the writer describes has been challenged in the courts. While they ruled that minimum increases could be applied to apartment leases, they have not specifically ruled on whether they could apply to ancillary services.
But Mr. Bailey noted that in a 1991 advisory opinion, the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal said the formula for increases on ancillary services must be the same as those for apartment rent increases. So, he said, it would appear that the $20 increase is allowable in both instances the writer describes. At the same time, he said there was a caveat to that general rule. If the ancillary service is included in the apartment lease itself, there can be only one increase. But if the ancillary service is covered by its own lease, a separate minimum increase can apply separately to that lease.
Condo Refinancing Troubles
Q I am trying to refinance the mortgage on my condominium in Little Italy with the lender who gave me the original mortgage. My application was denied because of an owner-occupancy issue. There are 10 units in the building, and two owners each own two apartments and rent them out. Why is it more difficult to refinance my mortgage than it was to get the original loan?
A Eric D. Sherman, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, says many lenders have owner-occupancy rules for mortgages on condominium units.
''The rule provides that a certain ratio of units within a condominium must be occupied by their owners,'' Mr. Sherman said, adding that this was mainly because ''investor-owned units tend to result in higher rates of foreclosure.''
He noted that the ratio requirements can vary by lender, though the requirements typically apply whether the loan is a first-time mortgage or a refinancing. That the writer's original mortgage was not subject to such scrutiny was probably a function of timing. ''Over the last few years,'' Mr. Sherman said, ''lenders have imposed much more stringent lending requirements.'' So the writer may have to shop around to find a new lender with less stringent requirements.
Keeping a Co-op Balcony Safe
Q We have a balcony that we enjoy using. Because we have small children, and the balcony has widely spaced horizontal rails, we attached plastic netting for safety. The board is planning to enforce a house rule prohibiting attaching items to the balcony. Is there any rule related to the design of balcony railings when children are present?
A ''There most certainly are requirements pertaining to railing design,'' said Marcel De Winter, a Manhattan architect. ''And they are not just for children, but for adults and objects as well.''
Basically, Mr. De Winter said, a railing must be of a certain height, as well as able to withstand substantial forces and resist the passage of objects greater than 3.5 inches in diameter. The requirements are the same whether the balusters are vertical or horizontal.
Mr. De Winter said that the writer should verify whether the railing meets the minimum design criteria, and that if it doesn't, he should try to come up with a temporary solution satisfactory both to himself and the board. Design modifications made by occupants are typically subject to approval by the board, which should take into consideration safety and aesthetic considerations. One option might be to install acrylic sheets with vent holes to relieve high wind pressure. It would be wise for the board to have any design modifications reviewed by both its insurance company and an architect.
''This is a serious matter,'' Mr. De Winter said, ''and failure to address it could result in serious consequences.''

''Homeowners should not have to pay hurricane deductibles for damage caused by the storm.''
Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York. Tens of thousands of homeowners who suffered wind and storm damage last week will get financial relief from rulings by several governors that insurers must treat Sandy as a tropical storm and not a hurricane, which would have resulted in higher deductibles. 
''I always look forward to a natural disaster.''

HEADLINE: Ryan, Quiet for Now, Is Said to Be Planning for an Active Role

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL; Mark Leibovich contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- Representative Paul D. Ryan may have largely disappeared from the national spotlight down the campaign homestretch, ceding attention to Mitt Romney. But if the Republican ticket prevails, Mr. Ryan plans to come back roaring, establishing an activist vice presidency that he said would look like Dick Cheney's under President George W. Bush.
Mr. Ryan would dedicate most evenings to dinners with senators and House members of both parties, aides said, as he steps into the role Mr. Romney promised: architect of a Romney administration's drive to enact a budget that shrinks the government and overhauls programs like Medicare.
On a grinding schedule in the election's final hours, rushing to as many as five states in a day, Mr. Ryan avoids specifics in his speeches about his duties if elected. Behind the scenes, he speaks at least weekly to the office of Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who leads the Romney campaign's transition team. 
The prospect of a deeply engaged vice president was described in interviews with campaign aides, close House colleagues and the few times Mr. Ryan has discussed his potential future job. Asked by a reporter last month if he expected the kind of broad responsibility for the economy that Mr. Cheney held for national security -- as an aide suggested -- Mr. Ryan said, ''I do.''
''A large reason he was chosen was to help Romney govern,'' an adviser to the campaign said. ''Paul's going to focus on being a partner.''
Democrats in the Bush years, of course, criticized Mr. Cheney for usurping for himself a kind of co-presidency.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney seem to have an effective partnership on the trail; the younger man has been deferential to a fault since he was tapped for the ticket, modifying long-held positions to conform with Mr. Romney's. That said, Mr. Ryan has made clear that he would not be relegated only to attending funerals.
Before Mr. Ryan accepted the nomination, aides said, he had extensive conversations about his position with Mr. Romney, who assured him he would play a guiding role on fiscal and economic matters. Already seen as an intellectual leader of the Republican Party because of his sweeping House budget proposals, Mr. Ryan would wield the clout that comes from being recognized as the party's most likely next in line for the presidency, prominent Republicans said.
''My guess is Paul will be an extraordinarily consequential vice president,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the Republican House leadership, who was a visitor to the Ryan family box during the Republican convention in August. ''He's going to play an important role in outlining, shaping and passing the Romney agenda from the day he walks in the door.''
''He becomes emissary in chief to the Hill,'' Mr. Cole continued, ''especially to House Republicans, who are likely to become the tip of the spear in terms of anything Romney wants to do.''
Whether Mr. Ryan would be a wrangler of House conservatives in support of a White House seeking to reach across the aisle, or an agent of the Tea Party who keeps Mr. Romney from deviating from the true path, is a subject of much debate.
Mr. Romney has promised over the past month to bridge the partisan chasm in Washington, as he has modulated his talk in an appeal to swing voters. ''When I am elected,'' he said Friday in Wisconsin, in a speech billed as a closing argument, ''I will endeavor to find those good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than about the politics.''
Aides to Mr. Ryan said that he received congratulatory phone calls when he was selected from former Vice Presidents Cheney and Dan Quayle, but that they did not offer him counsel on how to define a role as vice president.
Mr. Ryan's friends and aides said his disarming personality and willingness to listen to opponents had made him well liked by lawmakers of both parties; and he would continue to build bridges through regular dinner discussions, he told aides. On a return to the House floor for a vote in September, Mr. Ryan spent several minutes in friendly conversation with Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip.
''I think Mitt Romney wants to be realistic, but also work in a bipartisan way,'' said Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, a Tea Party favorite who is a friend of Mr. Ryan's. ''You're not going to get to the finish line unless you can get the House and the Senate to come together.''
Among Mr. Ryan's advisers on the campaign trail, many of whom come from the office of House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, it is accepted wisdom that one of President Obama's biggest failings was to hold himself apart from lawmakers. Thus, the thinking goes, the president lacked the relationships to build bipartisan support on issues like health care and debt reduction.
But Democratic lawmakers who have worked with Mr. Ryan said that he has no record of compromise. They said his idea of a meeting of the minds was sticking to his guns and persuading opponents that he was right.
''He lives in an ideological bubble,'' said Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a Democratic member of the House Budget Committee that Mr. Ryan heads. ''I've been on the Budget Committee two other times. The lack of bipartisanship was striking'' under Mr. Ryan.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, said Mr. Ryan became a favorite of conservatives because of his passionate advocacy for drastically reducing government.
''He has said if Romney and Ryan prevail they will have a mandate to enact the Ryan budget or a close version of that budget,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''That's not a recipe for compromise.''
Mr. Ryan rejected the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles budget deficit compromise last year that included a balance between cuts to government programs and increased revenues through eliminating tax deductions and credits. He did so, he has explained, because it did not tame the increase in health spending.
Should Mr. Romney win the election, it is widely expected that his first major legislative effort will be an attempt at a ''grand bargain'' that reforms the tax code, including across-the-board cuts, and an overhaul of entitlement programs.
Republicans have said that they would seek to buy time to put together such a package by postponing the tax increases and automatic spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff that go into effect in January.
With Republicans favored to keep their majority in the House, much of the success of a Romney administration's ambitions will turn on which party controls the Senate. If Democrats' current three-seat advantage slips to a 50-50 balance, a Vice President Ryan would be in position to cast a tiebreaking vote.
But if Democrats retain a majority, and with it the power to prevent bills from reaching the floor, a President Romney would need to find common ground with at least a handful of Democratic senators.
Then Mr. Ryan's true mettle is likely to be tested, as he becomes the White House's emissary to the conservative wing of the House. ''That will be part of Paul's job -- to come in and sell it to people who otherwise will feel let down and disappointed,'' said Mr. Cole, the congressman from Oklahoma.

HEADLINE: Crime Increases in Sacramento After Deep Cuts to Police Force

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- At first, it seemed just an unwelcome nod to frugality. Overtime for police officers was reduced. Vacant positions went unfilled.
But each year brought more bad news for this city's Police Department. In 2011, faced with the biggest budget cuts yet -- $12.2 million -- Chief Rick Braziel was forced to take drastic action: he laid off sworn officers and civilian employees; eliminated the vice, narcotics, financial crimes and undercover gang squads, sending many detectives back to patrol; and thinned the auto theft, forensics and canine units. Police officers no longer responded to burglaries, misdemeanors or minor traffic accidents.
Earlier this year, the traffic enforcement unit was disbanded. The department now conducts follow-up investigations for only the most serious crimes, like homicide and sexual assault.
''You reach the point where there is nothing left to cut,'' Chief Braziel said. 
The shrinking of Sacramento's police force has been extreme; the department has lost more than 300 sworn officers and civilian staff members and more than 30 percent of its budget since 2008. But at a time when many cities are curtailing essential services like policing -- the Los Angeles Police Department said last week that it could lay off 160 civilian employees by Jan. 1 -- the cutbacks in this sprawling city of 472,000 offer a window on the potential consequences of such economizing measures, criminal justice experts say.
''Sacramento may be a good city to watch in terms of what we can predict for the future,'' said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.
Noting that crime rates have plummeted across the country in the last two decades, Mr. Wexler said, ''You could argue that the police have been doing something right.'' But with budgets being cut, he continued, ''police chiefs are caught between saying, 'Look what we have done,' and having to rethink the strategies that have been successful.''
Chief Braziel said he had tried to make the cuts strategically, making sure that the public's highest priority -- having a police officer respond in a timely fashion when a 911 call comes in -- is met and preserving a focus on violent crimes. (''There's no law that says you have to investigate homicides, but you don't just stop investigating homicides,'' he said.) Detectives serve on regional task forces led by the F.B.I. that focus on gangs and trafficking. To help morale, Chief Braziel has also offered short-term rotations to patrol officers, providing some variety now that their chances for promotion are severely limited.
''I could cry all day long about the budget cuts and the 30 percent and the loss of people and everything else,'' Chief Braziel said. ''But it doesn't do any good because you get dealt a hand of cards with a budget crisis and you're playing stud poker -- you can't give back the cards and say deal me two or three more.''
''You've got to figure out within the new rules of the game how to do it better,'' he said.
But he is not blind to the effects of paring down a police force to its core.
In 2011, Chief Braziel said, the cuts, in his opinion, went past the tipping point. While homicides have remained steady, shootings -- a more reliable indicator of gun violence -- are up 48 percent this year. Rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries and vehicle thefts have also increased, though in smaller increments.
Complicating matters, the cutbacks have coincided with a flow of convicted offenders back into the city as California, heeding a Supreme Court ruling, has reduced its prison population. Once released, former inmates have less supervision -- the county's probation department also suffered cuts.
Chief Braziel, an optimist by nature, said the reductions have in fact had some benefits -- more experienced officers on street patrols, for example. But the gaps are increasingly evident.
When a patrol officer stopped a car a few weeks ago and found the driver in possession of half a pound of recently cooked methamphetamine, worth $20,000 on the street, there was no one to spend the 10 hours it would take to write up and execute a search warrant for the man's residence, despite the suspicion that a meth laboratory would be found there.
''It's frustrating,'' said the officer, Darrald Bryan, who had worked his way up to an investigative job in the robbery unit but was sent back to patrol last year along with 24 other detectives, a demotion that involved a 5 percent pay cut, a switch to the graveyard shift in order to keep his weekends off and the loss of his take-home car.
''You just don't have the manpower,'' said Officer Bryan, adding that the best he could do was arrest the man for possession and sale of narcotics. Now that the gang squad is gone, patrol officers take turns in 90-day assignments that focus on gang activity. But undercover work is a thing of the past, and a highly successful program called Ceasefire, intended to reduce gang violence, was halted for lack of money, staffing and community resources.
Sacramento has consistently ranked at the top for traffic accidents among cities of similar size in California. But with the demise of the traffic enforcement unit, citations are down, volunteers have to be called in for large-scale events like races and parades, and efforts to analyze the city's most collision-prone intersections and address their hazards have been abandoned.
Teams of police officers -- known as problem-oriented policing teams -- once worked the city's troubled neighborhoods, following up with residents, landlords and government offices to solve problems identified on patrol. But those teams, too, were a casualty of the 2011 cuts.
''Would I rather be a drug dealer, a speeder or, if I was involved in the prostitution trade, would I rather be involved in that today as opposed to four years ago? Absolutely,'' said Lt. Justin Eklund of the major crimes section. ''The issue comes down to, 'If we have X amount of bodies, what are we going to do?' ''
Not every attempt to prioritize has worked out as planned. Burglaries had been dropped from the list of crimes that officers responded to. But that policy has now been reversed, after patrol officers heard complaints and residents resisted filing the online reports that were intended as a substitute.
For many residents, said Deputy Chief Dana Matthes, ''the one time in their life they have to call the police is because their house is burglarized, and we tell them: 'Oh, report that online. We can't come out.' It doesn't send that customer service message that we're there for them.''
A local sales tax measure on the ballot in Tuesday's election could restore some financing for the Police Department and other essential services in Sacramento. But Chief Braziel said the budget crisis had forced the department to re-examine how it is organized and what its priorities should be. Even when the economy relents, he said, some things may be done differently. ''You've got to have a business model,'' he said. ''The world's changing, and you've got to change. You've got to get out in front of it.''
Bernard K. Melekian, the director of the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, said a similar rethinking was taking place across the country as departments coped with dwindling budgets. Many are consolidating services or merging with other agencies to form regional law enforcement authorities -- in November, Camden, N.J., will close its department, terminating 273 officers and ceding control to a county police force.
The result, Mr. Melekian said, will be significant shifts in how policing is practiced. Whether the outcome will be simply an increase in efficiency or an increase in crime is anyone's guess.
''That's the big question that everybody is looking at,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Built to Last (and Somehow They Did)

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THEY are the scrap metal of a shiny skyscraper city, three little Civil War-era cast-iron buildings on a milelong strip of Broadway between Cortlandt and Thomas Streets. From near-collapse to neglected gem to contested landmark, Nos. 175, 287 and 319 Broadway have emerged from decades of neglect in varied states -- and one barely emerged at all.
The advent of cast-iron for facades in the 1860s allowed large windows and heavily molded surfaces with intricate columns and cornices in deeper relief, greater detail and much greater economy than possible in brownstone. 
Although up to the minute when it was built in 1865, the Germania Building, at 175 Broadway near Cortlandt Street, is now a little lost lamb among the skyscrapers of the financial district. The Germania Fire Insurance Company built the four-story building and put its name in the center of the cornice. The unidentified architect -- or iron founder -- gave the modillioned cornice a swell set of rivet-head bosses.
The Germania Company was gone by 1869, succeeded by merchants, brokers and lawyers like Levi Underwood, a former lieutenant governor of Vermont and a prominent railroad lawyer.
An account of a fire in 1891 found a mixed bag of businesses: insurance, jewelry, tailors and, in the basement, the Gotham, ''an expensively furnished restaurant,'' according to The New York Times.
By the 1910s the area was a skyscraper district, and in 1919 The Times observed that the entire blockfront was low-rise, calling it a ''dead spot.'' Helpfully, the Broadway Association announced plans to get rid of this and other recalcitrant parcels standing in the way of a nice tall city. But over time the buildings here became not higher, but lower, with some cut down to two-story taxpayers.
A 1956 projection for a 21-story building a few lots north at 185 Broadway came to naught.
Farther north, at Reade Street, 287 Broadway was long notable not so much for its respectable but ordinary cast-iron facade as for the delicate ironwork cresting on the top of its mansard, a remarkable survivor. The building was designed by John B. Snook, and his original drawings at the New-York Historical Society show it with a flat top.
The cresting -- indeed the entire building -- neared disaster in 2008 when excavation next door created a Pisalike lean of perhaps eight inches, and the Department of Buildings closed the structure, fearing collapse. A gargantuan Erector Set of steel bracing was one of the great sights of Broadway for some time. The building's posture was corrected when the adjacent structure was finished.
Between 2008 and 2010 the cresting was removed, but Lisi de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, says the owner plans to restore it.
A few blocks uptown, at Thomas Street, two identical cast-iron buildings once stood at the north and south corners. Thomas Street itself was once the property of New York Hospital; entry gates flanked the driveway on what is now the roadbed. The corners were built simultaneously in 1870 and designed by David and John Jardine.
The northerly building, 319 Broadway, was in the 1880s occupied by the Louisiana Lottery Company. It operated openly, infuriating Anthony Comstock, the founder of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. He sent decoy letters from out of town asking for tickets that were duly honored -- even though he signed them with names like ''U. Arcaute.''
In his 1883 book ''Traps for the Young,'' Comstock said that although the police dutifully kept order in the ticket line, it took him awhile to secure an arrest. He said he spoke for ''the women and children that are beggared and starving because of this gambling scheme.'' The company eventually went out of business.
In 1929 the real estate broker Charles F. Noyes announced plans to build a 150-story building on the two blocks spanning Thomas Street; that was in early October 1929, a few weeks before the stock-market crash.
The two cast-iron structures came to be called the Thomas Twins, and attracted early attention from Margot Gayle, the cast-iron advocate. In 1966 both buildings were considered for landmark status. The owners protested that keeping the buildings would lower the property value, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission backed off.
No. 317 was demolished in 1971, but 319 survived to be receive landmark designation in 1989. PropertyShark.com indicates the current assessed valuations are almost the same, $1.19 million for the two-story building at 317, and $1.18 million for the original structure at 319.
No. 287 Broadway, too, was designated a landmark in 1989, but the Germania Building has escaped the attentions of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
So how has it survived? What The Times described in 1919 as a ''dead spot'' is still that way, a rattletrap low-rise block surrounded by skyscrapers. Reason dictates that the whole block should have been redeveloped years ago, but the buildings soldier on.
As president of the David M. Baldwin Realty Company, Charles Gengler manages the Germania, and he says the survival of the row is really just happenstance.
''The buildings are owned by second- and third-generation layers of three separate families whose patriarchs accumulated exactly this type of real estate,'' he said in an e-mail: ''low maintenance, high trafficked retail rentals. The current operators/owners are content with the same rewards.''

HEADLINE: The Military's Swift Path to Citizenship

 BODY:
The Pentagon has just restarted a program to enlist skilled immigrants into the Army, giving recruits a swift path to citizenship in return for their special abilities in languages and medicine. 
The program was suspended nearly three years ago as part of a broad security review prompted by the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Tex. To have squelched a good idea so quickly and for so long was surely an overreaction (the man charged in the Fort Hood killings is a native-born American). But now that it's back, we hope that the Army swiftly makes up for lost time with new classes of high-caliber recruits, and that the other service branches ramp up their own participation.
The program will accept 1,500 people a year for the next two years -- good for the Army, but only a sliver of America's untapped supply of immigrant talent and patriotic yearning.
We hope, too, that those who recognize the Army's success concede the bigger point. The happy confluence of opportunity and skills is not a phenomenon peculiar to the Defense Department but is the essence of America's immigrant history, whether the newcomer is an Army surgeon or translator or an Oregon entrepreneur or a Long Island landscaper. America's economy and society benefit mightily when immigration works, but the system today is a mess of bottlenecks and frustrations, stymied by political paralysis and a sour, restrictionist mood.
The program, called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or Mavni, seeks immigrants who speak certain high-priority languages -- from Albanian to Yoruba -- and dentists, surgeons, psychiatrists and other health professionals.
Undocumented immigrants and people with criminal records are not eligible, but people in other categories previously denied military service, like natural-disaster survivors with temporary visas, are welcome to apply. Those who are accepted can be naturalized in record time -- right after basic training, or in about 10 weeks.
The Army's study of the first Mavni class found that recruits were highly educated (a third had master's degrees or higher) and highly motivated (their attrition was one-fourth that of other recruits).
The program could not have a finer standard-bearer than Sgt. Saral Shrestha, who came to the United States from Nepal at age 17 and joined the Army through Mavni in 2009, when he was 21. Sergeant Shrestha, who repairs power-generation equipment, is with Special Forces at Fort Bragg, N.C. According to the Army News Service, he has a bachelor's degree in computer information science and wants to earn a master's in computer engineering and become an officer. On Oct. 22, he was named the Army's 2012 Soldier of the Year.

HEADLINE: Bringing an F1 Vibe to a Counterculture City

BYLINE: By JAY ROOT. 
jroot@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Austin, a liberal college town and the state capital, is perhaps best known for its hip counterculture, live music and string of successful high-tech companies.
Fast cars? Not so much.
But in a couple of weeks, Austin will become the epicenter of the auto racing world when its gleaming new $400 million track, the Circuit of the Americas, hosts the first Formula One race in the United States since 2007.
For top drivers like Sebastian Vettel of Germany and Fernando Alonso of Spain, the Nov. 18 race offers the penultimate chance to improve their standing in the coveted F1 championship -- arguably the most prestigious prize in motor sports -- on a track with one of the most challenging turns in the world.
But for the host city, it will be an opportunity to prove that screaming-fast race cars and the well-heeled clientele that follows them around the globe will be welcome in a town that made a homeless transvestite a local celebrity and whose most famous bumper sticker is ''Keep Austin Weird.'' 
''It's a new stage of life for the city of Austin,'' Mayor Lee Leffingwell said. ''We want to keep what's good about Austin, but we also want to be open to new things.''
City planners and race promoters have their work cut out for them. They will still have to work out any last-minute kinks on a project that was beset with construction delays and uncertainty about tax incentives. Fears of a monster traffic jam and complaints from skeptical neighborhood associations and community activists also have race backers on edge.
Some 120,000 people are expected to pack the new state-of-the-art facility for the two-hour race, and thousands more will attend a series of sideshows, musical performances and fanfests during the three-day event. Underscoring the deep music culture of the city, Willie Nelson will headline a concert in downtown Austin on Nov. 15 to help kick things off.
The design of the twisting 3.4-mile track takes inspiration from some of the world's most famous F1 tracks, including Silverstone in England, Interlagos in Brazil and Istanbul Park in Turkey. The signature feature of the Circuit of the Americas track, Turn 1, has been compared to the Red Bull Ring in Austria -- only more difficult. The cars, over dozens of laps, can reach speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour.
''To have that steep of a hill right beyond the start-finish line is pretty much unique in Formula One,'' said Bob Varsha, longtime F1 announcer for the Speed network, which will broadcast the Austin race. ''At the top, this hill is a very sharp braking area for a left-hand hairpin, and then plunging downhill.''
The state estimates the event will pump more than $200 million into the Texas economy as visitors pay increased hotel rates, buy local products and stage exclusive parties.
Unlike the United States-based Nascar series, which tends to attract a beer-drinking, blue-collar crowd, Formula One has cultivated a more glamorous, international image. As part of the deal to land the Formula One race in Austin over the next 10 years, Circuit of the Americas had to build 12 spacious suites -- known as the Paddock Club -- where patrons will plunk down more than $4,000 each to watch the race while consuming Champagne and hors d'oeuvres.
Helicopter charter companies are hoping to do brisk business ferrying the affluent to and from the track, which has six helipads.
''They don't want to sit in traffic, and they can afford to pay the ticket price in and out,'' said Randy Riggs, owner of Austin Helicopter Tours. The round-trip fare, for about 10 minutes in the air, is $545.
Homeowners eager to cash in have not been as successful. Advertisements for house rentals for as high as $6,000 a night -- some with airplane hangars and helicopter landing pads -- have gone unanswered, but fans are snapping up R.V. sites on Web sites like austinracerentals.com, which caters to F1 visitors.
''Right now the ones that are cheaper are going the fastest,'' said Danielle Crespo, who owns the Web site. ''I think there was a misconception that there wouldn't be any hotel rooms available and everybody was having Champagne and caviar for breakfast. That's just not the case.''
The race will be the end of a long journey to reintroduce Formula One in the United States. While popular globally, the racing series has been eclipsed in the United States by Nascar. The last F1 race in the country was in 2007 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
Eager to get back into the lucrative United States market, Bernie Ecclestone, the chief of Formula One, signed off on a deal in 2010 to bring F1 to Austin on the first American track built specifically for open-wheel Formula One race cars.
But a series of setbacks almost derailed it. Contract negotiations dragged on longer than expected; bitter legal wrangling caused construction delays; and Susan Combs, the state comptroller, withdrew a pledge made in May 2010 to grant a taxpayer subsidy worth $250 million over 10 years.
As it turned out, no local entity had signed off on the deal as required under Texas law. And once the Austin City Council examined the particulars, members balked at coughing up the city's $4 million contribution, an amount equal to the expected sales tax revenue that out-of-town F1 visitors are expected to generate.
Tea Party activists and lawmakers did not like the subsidy deal, either, and they are vowing to fight such tax incentives -- along with a slew of others -- when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
In the meantime, at least for the first race, the F1 track owners have taken care of the $4 million contribution the city was supposed to chip in and now expect to get the estimated $25 million state tax incentive payment the old-fashioned way -- after the first event is held and the economic impact is measured. It is the same process the state has used when the N.C.A.A. college basketball tournament and the Super Bowl have been held in Texas.
''We wouldn't have gone forward without the state as a partner, because economically it doesn't make sense for us,'' said Bobby Epstein, who, along with the Texas billionaire Red McCombs, is one of the largest investors in the track.
Mr. Epstein, 47, had planned on building a housing development on the property in southeastern Travis County when he was approached about the project. He did not know much about race cars, but he quickly saw the potential to create a world-class entertainment complex in fast-growing Central Texas. (Mr. Epstein and his wife, Susan, are major donors to The Texas Tribune.)
Now Mr. Epstein sees the 1,200-acre facility, which has more than 200,000 square feet of indoor meeting space and 25,000 parking spots, as an economic engine for the region. Circuit of the Americas has already booked four non-F1 racing events, including the MotoGP motorcycle race in April.
An amphitheater, modeled in part after the Hollywood Bowl, can accommodate 15,000, and Mr. Epstein has already signed an agreement with Live Nation to bring top-name musical acts there.
''I hope the music fan looks at it and says: 'This is the best music venue I've ever been to. And oh, there's a racetrack around it,' '' Mr. Epstein said.

HEADLINE: Businessmen As Presidents: A Historical Circle

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
WITH so much attention on the income divide between the top 1 percent and the other 99 percent of Americans, it might seem that having enormous business wealth wouldn't be a great qualification for election as president. And if such a candidate pledged to keep taxes low for the wealthy, he would appear to have no chance at all in a troubled economy.
Mitt Romney's campaign has been showing that these factors may not be insurmountable. To the contrary, many Americans are showing deep affection for stories of business success -- like Mr. Romney's at Bain Capital -- and many are shrugging off the inequality issue. 
In some ways, this isn't so surprising. Americans have long been seen as admirers of business wealth. In 1840, Alexis de Tocqueville observed in ''Democracy in America'' that ''in no country in the world is the love of property more active and more anxious than in the United States.''
And in his 1906 book, ''Why Is There No Socialism in the United States?,'' the German sociologist and economist Werner Sombart wrote: ''If the American prays before the god of Success, he strives to lead a life acceptable to his god. Therefore we see in every American -- beginning with the paperboy -- restlessness, yearning and compulsion to be way and beyond other people.''
Sombart's observation about American national identity still looks spot-on. The other day in Chicago, a taxi driver told me that he had emigrated from Romania and had grand plans to develop at a distance a vacation resort in his home country. America continues to attract people who have the utmost respect for wealth.
Not long after, a taxi driver in New Haven confided to me that he was a high-school dropout. When I asked if we should tax the rich more, he replied with an emphatic ''No!'' He saw himself as a small-businessman who happened to be in the taxi business, and he identified strongly with the rich.
The pursuit of wealth is a real source of identity in America. We are accustomed to seeing ourselves chasing riches, even if we're not in business the way Mr. Romney was.
Still, Americans haven't elected many businessmen as presidents. The principal examples come from the Roaring '20s, a time of huge stock market gains, when faith in business reached all-time highs. Consider our presidents in that decade: Warren G. Harding had been a newspaper publisher in Ohio. Calvin Coolidge, trained as a lawyer, was once a vice president of the Nonotuck Savings Bank in Northampton, Mass., and was known for saying that ''the chief business of the American people is business.'' And Herbert Hoover was a mining expert who traveled to Australia in its 1890s gold rush and became a mine manager.
But businessman presidents disappeared after the market crash of 1929 and during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when many Americans believed that the business world had failed the nation. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who came from a wealthy family but was never a businessman and never talked like one, handily defeated both Hoover in 1932 and Alf Landon, a banker and independent petroleum producer, in 1936.
Not until the Bush presidencies did businessmen, in the suit-and-tie sense of the word, retake the White House -- though it otherwise could be argued that Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer, was a businessman, too. George H. W. Bush was elected during a soaring stock market, and his son George W. Bush won during a real estate boom. Both men were oil venture entrepreneurs.
You might think that the current economic slump would drain support for businessmen, as it did in the Great Depression. But there are differences. Back then, the United States hadn't yet reached the pinnacle of economic power. Today, many people worry about an apparent crumbling of American economic growth as emerging markets surge around us. There is a widespread fear that the American wealth machine is faltering -- and, as a result, many people are aiming to rediscover the nation's traditional strengths.
In Connecticut, the typically ''blue'' state where I live, Linda McMahon, the Republican candidate for senator, is campaigning on a story of self-made riches, and is presenting a serious challenge to the Democrat, Representative Christopher S. Murphy.
Ms. McMahon lacks legislative or governmental experience, but she cites her success in managing World Wrestling Entertainment as evidence that she can be an effective legislator. Her life story -- involving an early bankruptcy, then redemption through earning millions running staged wrestling bouts -- is a rags-to-riches tale, and she says it demonstrates her capacity to succeed as a senator. Americans have long heard stories of how entrepreneurs from John D. Rockefeller to Steven P. Jobs have achieved phenomenal success, and many derive a sense of identity from seeing themselves as having the qualities that could lead to riches, too.
FOR many voters this year, a central question is how to maintain what they consider as America's greatness, its exceptionalism. They are concerned with both lowering the unemployment rate and creating good jobs -- jobs that are exciting and can create substantial wealth. This attitude may be improving the odds for businesspeople seeking office.
If elected, Mr. Romney wants to enforce a general pro-business mandate and to bolster business confidence. That is quite possible. Still, any such confidence boost will most likely be offset by his promise to drastically cut government spending. The weight of evidence from studies of fiscal austerity indicates that, at least in times like these, it is very costly to economic activity. Big cuts now could easily plunge the country back into a recession.
Yes, many Americans admire business success and believe that business experience is a plus in a president. But Americans have usually also understood that other factors -- like wise policies and strong leadership ability -- are much more important.

HEADLINE: America's Leftward Tilt?

BYLINE: By DREW WESTEN. 
A psychology professor at Emory University and the author of ''The Political Brain.''

 BODY:
The presidential election is now a close contest, but barring an Electoral College tie, someone is going to win, someone is going to lose, and both sides will have to make sense of it all.
The obvious story line of this election, whoever wins, is that Americans want pragmatic solutions to the relentless distress they have experienced for over a decade, whether that means a more active or a more passive government. They are looking for anyone who can provide a coherent vision of how to fix an economy that is not working for people who work for a living. But rather than a victory for pragmatism, we may well see both the winners and losers take away a very different lesson: that this election was a mandate for another shift to the right. 
If Mitt Romney loses, conservatives will no doubt conclude that he just wasn't conservative enough, that they should have picked someone more appealing to their base. If President Obama loses or squeaks out a victory just four years after President George W. Bush destroyed the economy (which should have discredited conservative economics once and for all), many Democrats are likely to conclude that he tried to move too left too fast when he pushed for a stimulus and health care reform for which Americans were simply not ready, rather than that he simply sold both programs poorly (something he now acknowledges).
Similarly, whichever candidate wins, the first order of business will be deciding which programs to cut -- unless a deal to prevent us from going over the fiscal cliff is reached during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election. Most voters intuitively understand that jobs and deficits are linked -- too much of an emphasis on deficits leads to too few jobs -- because working people with money in their wallets drive demand, whereas wealthier people with money in their wallets drive Jaguars (and send the rest of their income to their hedge fund managers). Even in the heart of red America, people understand that high unemployment and income disparities of the magnitude we are now witnessing are bad for economic growth.
But you have to speak in a way that brings out their inner Keynes, as I discovered when testing the following message in the Deep South: ''The only way to cut the deficit is to put Americans back to work.'' That message beat the toughest austerity message by over 30 points.
The reality is that our government hasn't become this dysfunctional because the parties are so ''polarized.'' It's because there is only one pole in American politics today, and its magnetic field is so powerful that it has drawn both parties in the same direction -- rightward. And it is in that same direction that the magnetic field of contemporary American politics is likely to pull the stories the two parties tell after the election -- and the policies the winner pursues.
The data, however, suggest just the opposite -- that both candidates have benefited in the general election every time they have taken a left turn. President Obama was in deep political trouble 15 months ago when he cut the closest thing he could to a ''grand bargain'' with House Speaker John A. Boehner to slash the federal budget by trillions, and he did nothing for his popularity nine months earlier when he extended the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy. Not until he began talking like a populist did he begin picking up steam in the polls. Indeed, one of the most powerful messages the Democrats chose not to use in the 2010 midterm elections -- which would have supported a policy that was extremely popular then and remains as popular now -- was a simple message on taxes I tested nationally, which won in every region and with every demographic, including Tea Partyers: ''In tough times like these, millionaires ought to be giving to charity, not getting it.'' Once that position (and other populist appeals) became central to Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, the election looked like it would be a rout.
BUT then in the first debate, Mr. Romney moved to the center, taking back his promise of tax cuts for the rich and proposing instead to let people choose which tax deductions they wanted to take (for their home mortgages, for example) but limiting the amount that can be deducted. Perhaps understandably, the president didn't know what to do with a Republican challenger who was outflanking him half the time on his left, and suddenly the race was competitive again. For both men, a pragmatic left-hand turn helped them steer their way toward a middle class desperate for hope.
This should have come as no surprise. A majority of Americans still holds Bush accountable for the Great Recession, and with good reason. We are still breathing the fumes of his toxic brew of deregulation, massive transfers of wealth to the rich and a doubling of the national debt. His policies, and those of a Republican Congress that had its way with the economy for six years, were in fact the culmination of a right-wing ideological revolution led by Ronald Reagan, which changed the way Americans view their government. Mr. Reagan's shadow continues to loom large, because Democrats have yet to make the case for a compelling alternative and have too often accepted the premises of the right.
There are, of course, differences in how both sides view the role of government. But too often the consensus among the parties is that the solution to what ails us is deficit cutting and attacks on, or failure to support, the unions that gave us the weekend, 20th-century benefits and the eight-hour day. Both candidates have implicitly or explicitly blamed ''public employees'' with their ''bloated pensions'' and waste-filled jobs for our economic woes (with Mr. Obama sending a signal by freezing the pay of federal workers, as if tightening their belts would somehow loosen the noose around the Treasury).
The term ''public employees'' itself evokes faceless bureaucrats, rather than images of firefighters and police officers, E.P.A. scientists monitoring our air and water to protect our children's health, or the people who get up at the crack of dawn to pick up our trash. Both candidates have been as relentless in their attacks on teachers' unions as Mr. Reagan was with the air traffic controllers whom he summarily fired for going on strike. Both parties have seen the austerity so many Americans are feeling at the kitchen table and concluded that the answer to austerity is more austerity -- with ''grand bargains'' and ''sequestrations'' that promise to undo the effects of a stimulus that virtually all economists agree kept us from falling deeper toward a depression in early 2009. Austerity has been a failure almost everywhere governments have tried it, with Spain, where one in four working people is no longer working, being the most recent example. Both parties preach the gospel of free trade, which polls poorly because ordinary Americans can see with their own eyes how we have freely traded the good American wages and benefits away.
SO what underlies this powerful pull to the right? Many factors, but two stand out. The first is campaign money. When Americans saw the scope of the savings and loan scandal in the 1980s, which today seems like just a bad day on the unregulated derivatives market, Ronald Reagan's attorney general, Edwin Meese III, put nearly a thousand bankers behind bars. In contrast, Mr. Obama's attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., can't seem to smell the stench of a fraud that cost millions of people their jobs or homes.
The second is an ideological vacuum. For years, even Republicans accepted the premises of the New Deal, which drew them leftward just as today's political winds blow everything in their path rightward. President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Interstate highway system. President Richard M. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither believed in the radical dismantling of programs that protected ordinary Americans, and both believed that a crucial role of government is to provide the infrastructure that makes economic prosperity possible.
Then came the conservative movement that ushered in Reagan, whose ideology has dominated our political discourse ever since, even after its proven failure. If Nixon and Bill Clinton were the last gasps of Roosevelt's breath, then Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama and perhaps Mr. Romney may well be the last gasps of Reagan's. If the centrifugal pull of the 2012 election is likely to be to the right, is there any potential counterweight?
Perhaps one: both presidential candidates want a legacy. The most important legacy Mr. Obama could have would be to spend his second term using executive orders, judicial appointments and the bully pulpit to return democracy to everyday Americans by demanding clean elections, uncorrupted by money. If Mr. Obama wins a close election on the strength of the country's changing demographics, he may feel a special responsibility to tackle the seemingly intractable problems that a second-term president can more easily address.
If Mr. Romney wins and wants a second term, he would be wise to wed an economic narrative about innovation with a narrative that will save his party from extinction by making comprehensive immigration reform a central item on his agenda. If Mr. Romney succeeds in reviving a moderate Republicanism that recognizes that an increasingly interconnected world will require an increasingly diverse work force, he could potentially drag his party into the 21st century.
In other words, if the candidate who wins takes a left turn like the one that won him the presidency, the Reagan era would finally be over. We can only hope.

BYLINE: By GREGORY COWLES

 BODY:
SEEING RED: Kate Morton's latest Gothic-tinged mystery, ''The Secret Keeper,'' cracks the list this week at No. 8. It's Morton's first hardcover best seller (after an eight-month run on the trade paperback list for ''The Forgotten Garden,'' a book-club favorite), and it's sure to cement her status in her native Australia, where her novels are the most successful literary exports since Colleen McCullough's ''Thorn Birds'' stormed the world in 1977. 
Morton has obvious star power. She's young, modest and beautiful -- with ''the best legs in the business,'' according to her husband -- and her books, behind their soothing pastoral covers, offer plenty of plot twists and soapy atmospherics. She also has a righteous temper, as she told S Magazine a few years ago: ''There was a time when seeing red was part of my daily life. When the post office sold me star-shaped Christmas cards without advertising the fact that they required more expensive stamps, I refused to pay the extra. When the bus driver pulled away just as I made my puffed arrival at the bus stop, I cussed like a lumberjack. And when my share-house neighbors threw loud parties on weeknights, I felt no compunction about marching next door in my pj's to lay down the law. Terrible behavior, to be sure.''
MY PRIVILEGE: Chrystia Freeland's ''Plutocrats,'' about the rise of the 0.1 percent and the fall of everybody else, is new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 15. Freeland told NPR last month that many of the economic elites she interviewed resist President Obama's call for higher taxes because they associate wealth with honor and integrity. ''In America, we have equated personal business success with public virtue,'' she said. ''And what I think has entered the political discourse now, and I think the president has been one of the people pushing this, is he's saying wait a minute. What is good for the guys at the very top is not necessarily good for the people in the middle. . . . I think it's actually an existential threat. People don't just want to be rich and successful, they want to be good. And I think it's really threatening to feel like, wow, you mean I'm not as full of virtue and goodness as I thought I was?''
NOTORIOUS: What Justin Bieber is to today's tween girls, the Duran Duran bassist John Taylor was to their mothers in the 1980s. This is the guy whose picture was pasted (or hair-gelled) in middle school lockers everywhere, and whose videos were in near-constant rotation on MTV. So it's not hard to guess which readers have propelled his autobiography -- titled, dubiously, ''In the Pleasure Groove'' -- to No. 6 on the hardcover nonfiction list. (Hint: A lot of them probably have E. L. James on their e-readers.) As it happens, Taylor's editor at Dutton, Jill Schwartzman, was herself a fan. ''Women of my generation, we all loved Duran Duran in general, but women just loved John,'' she told The Hollywood Reporter. ''I was at my friend's 40th birthday a few months ago. We're all dancing, and a Duran Duran song came on. I was about to meet John for the first time the next day, and I said to my friends: 'Guess who I'm having lunch with tomorrow? John Taylor.' They all screamed so loudly, I can't even tell you.'' On MTV's Hive Web site recently, Taylor admitted the band had taken its hairstyles very seriously. ''Every three months we had to come up with a new look,'' he said. ''It wasn't just videos. There were album covers and picture discs and posters. We had to come up with a new identity, a new band persona, for every photo shoot. . . . We had to completely reinvent the look of the band at least four times a year. And that's a lot of work.''

THE SIGNAL AND THE NOISEWhy So Many Predictions Fail -- but Some Don't
By Nate SilverIllustrated. 534 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95.
Nate Silver has lived a preposterously interesting life. In 2002, while toiling away as a lowly consultant for the accounting firm KPMG, he hatched a revolutionary method for predicting the performance of baseball players, which the Web site Baseball Prospectus subsequently acquired. The following year, he took up poker in his spare time and quit his job after winning $15,000 in six months. (His annual poker winnings soon ran into the six-figures.) Then, in early 2008, Silver noticed that most political prognostication was bunk. Silver promptly reinvented that field, too. His predictive powers were such that at one point the Obama campaign turned to him for guidance.
These triumphs have built Silver a loyal following among fantasy-baseball aficionados and the political buffs who flock to his New York Times blog, FiveThirtyEight. His signature approach is to concentrate enormous amounts of data on questions that lend themselves to pious blather. For example: television blowhards are fond of proclaiming that the winner of the Iowa caucuses enjoys a big bounce in the New Hampshire primary. Silver crunched numbers dating back to the 1970s and found that the bounce comes less from winning Iowa than from exceeding expectations there. 
Silver's method is completely straightforward: how else would you approach a question like this if not by considering every previous example? But the method is so empowering that it's intoxicating -- as if there's no question he couldn't answer with a big enough spreadsheet.
Which is why it's slightly heartbreaking to read in the introduction to Silver's new book, ''The Signal and the Noise,'' that, having set out to write a geek-conquers-world tell-all in the vein of ''Moneyball'' and ''Freakonomics,'' Silver decided to write an altogether different book. This one isn't so much about his rise to statistical godliness, though it includes a smidgen of back story. It's largely about evaluating predictions in a variety of fields, from finance to weather to epidemiology. We learn about a handful of successes: when, for instance, meteorologists predict a hurricane's landfall 72 hours in advance, they now come within a 100-mile radius, whereas the radius was 350 miles a quarter-century ago. But mostly we learn about failures. It turns out we're not even close to predicting the next catastrophic earthquake or the spread of the next killer bird flu, despite the enormous amounts of brainpower trained on these questions in the past few decades.
As science, this investigation is wholly satisfying. As a literary proposition, it's a bit disappointing. It's always more gripping to read about how we might achieve the improbable than why we can't. And when books about statistical wizardry succeed, it's generally on the strength of their narrative elements, not their analytical rigor. ''Moneyball'' was a classic underdog tale about the cash-deprived Oakland A's; ''Freakonomics'' read like a series of detective stories. Silver's volume is more like an engagingly written user's manual, with forays into topics like dynamic nonlinear systems (the guts of chaos theory) and Bayes's theorem (a tool for figuring out how likely a particular hunch is right in light of the evidence we observe).
And yet, while ''The Signal and the Noise'' doesn't chronicle Silver's rise, it marks an important milestone in his ascent. For that reason, it could turn out to be one of the more momentous books of the decade. Journalism is in a strange place these days. Cable and the Internet crippled the old media establishment; political polarization dealt it a death blow. In the meantime, no new establishment has risen up to take its place. What we have is a growing sense of intellectual nihilism. The right-wing media speak only to true believers. Liberal journalists are often more fact-conscious but equally partisan, while mainstream outlets have a rapidly dwindling audience. Few media institutions command widespread credibility.
I think Silver -- or at least Silver-ism -- has the potential to fill the void. Silver uses statistics to scrutinize the claims of people who don't always have an incentive to be accurate. Until now, he took aim mostly at sports pundits and political handicappers. But the book hints at his ambitions to take on weightier questions. There's no better example of this than his chapter on climate change. In recent years, the most sophisticated global-warming skeptics have seized on errors in the forecasts of the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.) in order to undermine efforts at greenhouse gas reduction. These skeptics note that global temperatures have increased at only about half the rate the I.P.C.C. predicted in 1990, and that they flatlined in the 2000s (albeit after rising sharply in the late '90s).
Silver runs the numbers to show that the past few decades of data are still highly consistent with the hypothesis of man-made global warming. He shows how, at the rate that carbon dioxide is accumulating, a single decade of flat temperatures is hardly invalidating. On the other hand, Silver demonstrates that projecting temperature increases decades into the future is a dicey proposition. He chides some environmental activists for their certainty -- observing that overambitious predictions can undermine a cause when they don't come to pass -- without descending into false equivalence.
What Silver is doing here is playing the role of public statistician -- bringing simple but powerful empirical methods to bear on a controversial policy question, and making the results accessible to anyone with a high-school level of numeracy. The exercise is not so different in spirit from the way public intellectuals like John Kenneth Galbraith once shaped discussions of economic policy and public figures like Walter Cronkite helped sway opinion on the Vietnam War. Except that their authority was based to varying degrees on their establishment credentials, whereas Silver's derives from his data savvy in the age of the stats nerd.
That Silver is taking this on is, by and large, a welcome development. Few journalists have the statistical chops; most scientists and social scientists are too abstruse. Though his approach doesn't apply to every issue, it's not hard to imagine Silver and his ilk one day letting the air out of an inflating housing bubble, or unmasking tobacco-company spin, by appealing to nothing but the numbers.
Still, I can't help feeling a twinge of ambivalence. Silver is scrupulous about not claiming more certainty than he has. He echoes the famous line from Donald Rumsfeld about ''unknown unknowns'' -- knowledge gaps that we aren't aware of because we haven't even thought to ask the right questions. As he and his fellow stat-heads colonize more disciplines, will they know which questions to ask? Sorting through the numbers on climate change is a much more daunting challenge than figuring out which shortstops will hit for power or which candidate will carry Ohio. There are nuances in scientific and financial data -- to say nothing about how we discuss the data in the context of a raging political debate -- that people spend their careers assimilating. And, of course, the stakes are much higher when we're talking policy.
As long as someone's going to fill the role of public statistician, I'm glad it's Nate Silver. But I do worry about the appearance of accuracy without the real thing. Statistics can dazzle with their aura of authority, yet reality is relentlessly messy. Genuine understanding, as even Silver knows, is more than a numbers game.

HEADLINE: Show Me Your Badge

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAREY. 
Kevin Carey is director of the education policy program at the New America Foundation.

 BODY:
AT the end of ''Fundamentals of Atomic Force Microscopy,'' a short online course offered by Purdue University, students who score at least 60 percent on the final exam will receive an e-mail with a file attached. It will contain a picture of a blue-and-white circle, roughly one inch in diameter, embossed with the stylized image of an atomic force microscope bouncing a laser beam off a cantilever into a photodiode, which is how scientists take photographs and measure the size of very small (nanoscale) things.
The picture is a digital badge, a new type of credential being developed by some of the most prominent businesses and learning organizations in the world, including Purdue, Carnegie Mellon, the University of California, the Smithsonian, Intel and Disney-Pixar. The badge movement is being spearheaded by the Mozilla Foundation, best known for inventing the free Firefox Web browser, the choice of nearly one-quarter of all Internet users worldwide.
While they may appear to be just images, digital badges are actually portals that lead to large amounts of information about what their bearers know and can do. They are also being used to improve education itself, by borrowing techniques from video games that keep users playing, until they advance to the next level. 
Badges are gaining currency at the same time that a growing number of elite universities have begun offering free or low-cost, noncredit courses to anyone with access to the Internet and a desire to learn. Millions of students have already signed up for massive open online courses, or MOOCs. By developing information-age credentials backed by a wide array of organizations outside the education system, creators of badge programs may be mounting the first serious competition to traditional degrees since college-going became the norm.
One of the most important functions of college degrees is signaling knowledge and skill to potential employers. Yet degrees and certificates often do a poor job of communicating detailed information about graduates. Grade inflation has steadily obscured the meaning of G.P.A.'s, and there's no easy way to know what someone who got, for example, an A-minus in Econ 206 actually learned. A badge, on the other hand, is supposed to indicate specific knowledge and skills.
Stack Overflow, an Internet forum with 1.4 million registered users, awards members ''reputation'' points and a variety of badges based on answers to questions posed by fellow computer programmers. Some members devote hundreds of hours to writing and editing posts that are judged by the Stack Overflow community to display high levels of expertise. Tomasz Nurkiewicz, an Oslo software engineer and one of only 88 users to earn a ''Legendary'' Stack Overflow badge, writes, ''I received numerous job offers from people who either saw my profile with reputation and all the badges, or were particularly impressed by one of my answers.''
Carnegie Mellon has developed online courses in robotics and computer science in which students are awarded badges as they reach learning milestones -- one for teaching robots to move and another for manipulating robot motion sensors -- ultimately leading to a final badge certifying their overall robot programming skills. It's similar to the process used in video games. Players accumulate enough points to achieve higher levels and thus the opportunity to undertake new, more challenging quests.
Anyone who has ever seen a teenager glued to a screen for hours playing World of Warcraft can attest to the powerful lure of digital rewards. The buzzword is ''gamification'' -- the use of gaming elements like points, levels and badges to engage with a product or service. Carnegie Mellon researchers are finding that integrating badges into courses motivates students to keep learning. Gamification is even spreading to bricks-and-mortar classes. Some Purdue professors are awarding badges for reaching benchmarks in regular credit-bearing courses, including one in health care communications and another in curriculum and instruction.
Long before gamers began displaying their badges online to demonstrate prowess, Girl Scouts were sewing theirs on sashes for everyone to see. So it's not surprising that they are among winners of a competition last year held by Mozilla, with $2 million from the MacArthur Foundation, to recognize the best digital badge systems. In their program, Girl Scouts who learn to build apps for the Android operating system earn badges they can display and share on their mobile phones.
All of this points toward a world where nontraditional credentials become more valuable. Instead of taking Advanced Placement tests, high school students can jump directly into online courses like those offered at Purdue and Carnegie Mellon and present their badges on college applications. The National Association of Manufacturers is developing a system of digital badges in the fields of industrial motor control, robotics and welding -- the kinds of jobs that, even in a time of high unemployment, can be hard to fill. Over the next year, Mozilla will be working with the National Human Resources Association and other organizations to help employers better understand how to use badges.
Over the next year, Mozilla will be working with the National Human Resources Association and other organizations to help employers better understand how to use badges.
Of course, the more valuable something becomes, the more vulnerable it is to fraud. The badge system is designed to be ''open.'' Anyone can create a badge. How will employers know which to trust?
Colleges and universities have a great deal of built-in credibility and are regulated by accrediting organizations. Heavyweight badge creators like the Smithsonian and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will bring their own credibility to the table. Everyone else (Mozilla contest winners include 4H, local youth mentoring groups, and the Minnesota Historical Society) will rely on one of the principal design features of digital badges: metadata, or information about information.
Just as photographs taken by GPS-enabled smartphones have latitude and longitude coordinates embedded within them, digital badges contain information about where they came from. The metadata within Carnegie Mellon's ''Cortex Principles of Advanced Programming, Level 2'' badge, for example, provides the date the badge was issued, the name, title and organizational affiliation of the teacher who verified the badge, the score the student received on the final exam, and a link to exam questions.
Anyone can click on Tomasz Nurkiewicz's Stack Overflow badge to examine the answers he wrote to earn it. With metadata, badges are instantly accessible portals to evidence of a person's accomplishments, like internship experiences and portfolios of work. Imagine organizing your credentials into ''groups'' representing a larger body of skill, much as a sequence of college courses adds up to a major. Except these come from many different sources, not just from formal institutions. (Mozilla has created a site where badges earned in different places can be organized and stored.) In this way, badges may be not just an alternative to traditional résumés and transcripts but an improvement on them.
It's no coincidence that Mozilla is leading the badge movement. The organization was born from the wreckage of Netscape, whose multibillion-dollar I.P.O. touched off the 1990s dot-com boom before the company ultimately lost the ''browser wars'' to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. A group of Netscape programmers didn't like the idea of Web access being dominated by a browser owned by a gigantic profit-seeking company. So they spun off the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, which built a lighter, faster browser -- Firefox -- and gave it away. Explorer's market position has since badly eroded.
Mozilla sees the digital badge effort in similar terms. Erin Knight, its senior director of learning, says that ''the browser was the first example where there was a monopoly and we decided to provide an open-source alternative.'' A system whereby only accredited colleges can offer valuable degrees, she says, is a ''shared monopoly across education, where you have to go down a very prescribed path to get learning that quote-unquote counts. We want to open that up.''
If digital badges infiltrate the credential market, they could shake the economic foundations of a higher education industry that over the last 30 years has consistently increased prices much higher than inflation and family income, resulting in over $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. Colleges have gotten away with this in large part because the gap in earnings between people with and without degrees significantly widened during that time. Degree holders were less likely to lose their jobs during the recent recession, and the number of jobs requiring degrees grew faster during the recovery. Degrees are valuable, and only colleges can sell them. So students and parents pay and, increasingly, borrow, because they feel they have no choice.
Alternative credentials with value in the labor market could change that equation. Purdue charges in-state students about $1,050 for a three-credit course. A digital badge earned through its nanoHUB-U subsidiary, which offers the microscopy and other nanotech courses, costs $30.
Mozilla is talking to providers of MOOCs, some of which offer certificates with metadata, about adopting its badge design. For now, the credentials are worth less than traditional credits, at least while employers learn how to use them. But at 100th the price -- or nothing at all -- badges are still a fantastic bargain. Elite research universities can provide low-cost courses and badges without threatening their own business models, which rely heavily on research financing and a selective, intensive residential experience for undergraduates. Other colleges may struggle to justify ever-rising tuition.
A flourishing of digital badges could change the way people think about how much credentials should cost, and what they can be.

HEADLINE: Major Decisions

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON

 BODY:
WHAT'S your major? It's the defining question for college students -- and the cliché that's launched a thousand friendships and romances. It's also a question that has become harder for students to answer.
Blame it on the growing number of possibilities. Colleges and universities reported nearly 1,500 academic programs to the Department of Education in 2010; 355 were added to the list over the previous 10 years as colleges, to stay competitive and current, adopted new disciplines like homeland security and global studies, cyberforensics and agroecology.
At the University of Michigan and Arizona State University, students choose from a dizzying 251 and 250 majors, respectively. DePaul University in Chicago offers 24 more majors than it did in 2002, for a total of 98.
And graduating with a double (or triple) major, minor or concentration as a way to hedge bets in an uncertain job market has become increasingly popular; the number of bachelor's degrees awarded with double majors rose 70 percent between 2001 and 2011, according to the Education Department. 
Some students go to college knowing exactly what they want to do. But most don't. At Penn State, 80 percent of freshmen -- even those who have declared a major -- say they are uncertain about their major, and half will change their minds after they declare, sometimes more than once. How to decide?
THE NEW EXPLORER
Colleges and universities have vested interests in students declaring early. Retention rates for declared students are better, and they are more likely to graduate in four years. But college officials also recognize that deciding on a major can be overwhelming, especially when coupled with the fear that a wrong choice will result in added semesters and tuition. ''Students no longer have the luxury of stumbling into a major or making mistakes,'' says Neeta P. Fogg, a research professor at Drexel University's Center for Labor Markets and Policy, and a co-author of ''College Majors Handbook With Real Career Paths and Payoffs.''
''Exploratory'' is the new undeclared. Colleges have moved away from the negative-sounding ''undecided'' label to encourage students to experiment with unfamiliar disciplines and, perhaps, discover a passion and career path. ''We want to remind them that they have an active role'' in their academic choices, says Mary Beth Collier, the dean of academic advising at the State University of New York at New Paltz. At SUNY, exploratory students are urged to try new subjects using general education electives.
Ms. Collier tells students: ''You've taken the same six subjects since kindergarten. If you don't know your major, don't come here and take the same subjects expecting to figure it out.*'' That can mean fulfilling a U.S. studies requirement with a political science or black studies course instead of a rehash of U.S. history that you should have learned in high school.
Some schools have made exploration official. At the University of Florida, where 61 percent of students change their majors by the end of their second year, there are three exploratory tracks -- engineering and science, humanities and letters, and social and behavioral -- that students can declare for three semesters before choosing a specialized major. At the University of Cincinnati, undecided students can enroll in an exploratory studies program.
WHEN IN DOUBT, TAKE IT
Advisers caution: Don't abandon subjects that you may need later. Students often don't realize that many popular majors -- psychology, social sciences, business -- have math and science requirements. You might have to forgo majoring in economics, for example, if come junior year you have to make up courses in calculus and statistics.
This requires thinking ahead, says Fritz Grupe, the creator of MyMajors.com and an emeritus professor of computer science at the University of Nevada. You may not know what to do with the rest of your life at age 18, but you can cover your bases with prudent planning. Some majors have a curriculum that follows a tight sequence of courses. It's easier to switch out of engineering than it is to take it up (if that's possible at all) later in your college career.
The ''biggest mistake'' students make, Dr. Grupe adds, is failing to research what's required of the major, and the profession. Nursing may sound attractive because ''you like to help people,'' he says, but nursing students take the same demanding math and science curriculum as pre-med students, and the work is often technical and not for every kindhearted soul.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Colleges ''do not make decisions in a vacuum,'' Dr. Fogg says. They are constantly tweaking their offerings. The Department of Education's list shows clusters of new programs in established fields of study that mirror scientific, cultural and societal developments. Some are cross-disciplinary or specializations, like biosystems engineering, clinical nurse leadership, computational biology and international policy analysis.
Quirkier additions to the list obviously reflect marketplace trends and student demand, like culinary science/culinology, digital arts, casino management and sports communication. At Montclair State University in New Jersey, which offers 300 majors, minors and concentrations, a new fashion studies major has been hugely popular, thanks to the university's proximity to Manhattan; with Madison Square Garden and Giants Stadium in sight, it also saw opportunity in a sports industry and event-planning major within its business school.
Still, it's difficult to predict the employment market, says Michele Campagna, the executive director of the Center for Advising and Student Transitions at Montclair State. Many students choose majors they think will lead to jobs, but ''four years from now,'' she says, ''freshmen will be applying for jobs that don't even exist today.''
Most employers are looking for transferable skills -- the ability to problem solve, work in teams, write and communicate, and think critically, says Ms. Collier of SUNY New Paltz. These can be developed in any liberal arts discipline. It makes no sense, she says, to ''suffer through a major'' because you think it will lead to employment. ''We tell students, 'Find a major that makes you intellectually engaged, that expands your brain and deepens your understanding of the world.' ''
At the same time, cautions Dr. Fogg, the stakes for college students today couldn't be higher: 41 percent of graduates are employed in jobs that don't require a college degree. Many employers today lack the resources and patience for on-the-job training, she says, and are looking for college graduates who are ''shelf-ready employees.'' So pick up professional direction, job-related skills and work experience, she says, and of course follow your heart.

HEADLINE: Puppy Love Can Cost You

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
FOR Allison Ward, treating animals is a passion and a calling. She can't imagine doing anything else. But that passion came with a big price tag. Dr. Ward graduated from Kansas State University with a degree in veterinary medicine last year, and as an out-of-state student accrued $250,000 in debt, including undergraduate loans.
It's not uncommon to meet students who have ''wanted to be a veterinarian since they were 6,'' says James F. Wilson, a veterinarian who teaches two-day classes in career development and personal finance at more than a dozen schools a year. But for many, he adds, that calling ''is so powerful they disregard the economics.'' 
Anyone thinking of applying to veterinary school needs to balance the likelihood of high job satisfaction against the probability of financial strain.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Veterinary schools are expensive to run. After all, they must cover a multitude of species, whereas medical schools handle just one.
In addition, ''there is no federal support for residency training or teaching hospitals in veterinary colleges,'' says Michael Kotlikoff, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University.
To help cover rising expenses, tuition has doubled over the last decade, according to the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, which represents the institutions. Most vet schools are public, with an average tuition of $38,000 for out-of-state students and $18,000 for state residents.
Class size has also inched upward, by about 2 percent a year for the last 30 years, according to the association.
There has been much hand-wringing over the debt load faced by doctors of human medicine -- an average of about $160,000, the Association of American Medical Colleges reports. But a family-practice physician makes, on average, around $200,000.
The average income for veterinarians in private practice, on the other hand, is $121,000, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, an advocacy group for vets (citing figures from 2009, the most recent available). Meanwhile, graduating vet students carry an average debt of $125,000.
The early years can be particularly harsh. Internships, which are the first rung in the career ladder, pay about $29,000.
Dr. Ward, who moderates an online forum on veterinary education, says debt is the biggest problem her profession faces.
GETTING IN
The operational complexity of vet schools is one reason there are only 28 accredited programs in the nation, compared with 138 medical schools. That makes the application process highly competitive, though not as much as in the past and not, as persistent myth would have it, more than medical school. A little more than 40 percent of applicants end up attending a veterinary school, about the same as for medical school.
One popular option is applying to a foreign school. Two for-profit programs in the Caribbean -- at St. George's University in Grenada and Ross University on St. Kitts -- recently received accreditation and mostly serve American students. Applications and enrollments have risen at both schools in recent years, although tuition is roughly on par with out-of-state rates.
Almost all schools expect applicants to have significant animal-related experience -- at least 400 hours working at a veterinary office, shelter or research lab, for example -- as well as advanced math and science.
SHORTAGES AND SURPLUSES
More than 75 percent of veterinarians go the pet route, ending up in small-animal practices, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. ''I'm absolutely convinced we're at a full saturation point,'' Dr. Wilson says, ''and we're rapidly going to be in a surplus.''
In May, a report by the National Research Council sounded an alarm over how ''the profession has shifted fromfarm animal health to companion animal care.'' The focus on pet care is diverting resources from research, public service and food production, the report said, and the safety of the food system and ability to prevent infectious diseases could become compromised.
In fact, jobs are incredibly varied. A graduate could pursue work in large-herd or equine medicine, wildlife conservation, emergency medicine, product development or lab animal medicine.
Public health, another option, is especially important because so many diseases are transmitted from animals to humans.
Just about any specialty in human medicine exists in veterinary medicine. Dr. Ward is training to be a neurologist in an internship at a Miami practice. She chose the specialty because results can be ''dramatic and meaningful,'' she says.
''To help a dog recognize his owner again, to stop seizures or help a dog walk again -- it makes a tremendous difference in their lives.''
LOAN RELIEF
The federal government has created a strong incentive for graduates to take jobs in the nonprofit or public sector: if they work in certain jobs for 10 years, like public health or shelter medicine, their loans will be forgiven along with any related tax obligations.
In addition, the veterinary medical loan repayment program, offered by the Department of Agriculture, pays up to $25,000 toward loans of veterinarians who serve for three years in parts of the country where there is a shortage, usually rural communities.
The government's income-based repayment plan, which has been available since 2009 for many federal loans, has been a big help to qualifying veterinarians because it deducts just 15 percent from adjusted gross income. Then, after 25 years, the loan is forgiven. A new program will deduct only 10 percent, with the loan forgiven after 20 years if certain conditions are met.
But these programs have a drawback, Dr. Wilson says. After the loan is forgiven, the recipient must often still pay tax on the canceled principal and interest. Some students are carrying debt so high they haven't even hit the principal by the time the loan is forgiven; a graduate could still end up owing a substantial amount in taxes.
Dr. Ward has enrolled in the income-based repayment plan, but she's crossing her fingers that ''either I make enough money one day that I can pay down my debt on my own, or that Congress figures out an alternative to that huge tax bill.''
Still, she points out, no one she knows has gone into veterinary medicine for the money. Indeed, veterinarians have the shabbiest cars in the parking lot. ''This is personal fulfillment,'' she says. ''That's worth more than a paycheck.''

HEADLINE: Would You Wish This On Your Child?

BYLINE: By ANDREW SOLOMON. 
Andrew Solomon is a lecturer in psychiatry at Cornell. His book ''Far From the Tree,'' from which this essay is adapted, will be published this month by Scribner.

 BODY:
Drew Petersen didn't speak until he was 3½, but his mother, Sue, never believed he was slow. When he was 18 months old, in 1994, she was reading to him and skipped a word, whereupon Drew reached over and pointed to the missing word on the page. Drew didn't produce much sound at that stage, but he already cared about it deeply. ''Church bells would elicit a big response,'' Sue told me. ''Birdsong would stop him in his tracks.'' 
Sue, who learned piano as a child, taught Drew the basics on an old upright, and he became fascinated by sheet music. ''He needed to decode it,'' Sue said. ''So I had to recall what little I remembered, which was the treble clef.'' As Drew told me, ''It was like learning 13 letters of the alphabet and then trying to read books.'' He figured out the bass clef on his own, and when he began formal lessons at 5, his teacher said he could skip the first six months' worth of material. Within the year, Drew was performing Beethoven sonatas at the recital hall at Carnegie Hall. ''I thought it was delightful,'' Sue said, ''but I also thought we shouldn't take it too seriously. He was just a little boy.''
On his way to kindergarten one day, Drew asked his mother, ''Can I just stay home so I can learn something?'' Sue was at a loss. ''He was reading textbooks this big, and they're in class holding up a blowup M,'' she said. Drew, who is now 18, said: ''At first, it felt lonely. Then you accept that, yes, you're different from everyone else, but people will be your friends anyway.'' Drew's parents moved him to a private school. They bought him a new piano, because he announced at 7 that their upright lacked dynamic contrast. ''It cost more money than we'd ever paid for anything except a down payment on a house,'' Sue said. When Drew was 14, he discovered a home-school program created by Harvard; when I met him two years ago, he was 16, studying at the Manhattan School of Music and halfway to a Harvard bachelor's degree.
Prodigies are able to function at an advanced adult level in some domain before age 12. ''Prodigy'' derives from the Latin ''prodigium,'' a monster that violates the natural order. These children have differences so evident as to resemble a birth defect, and it was in that context that I came to investigate them. Having spent 10 years researching a book about children whose experiences differ radically from those of their parents and the world around them, I found that stigmatized differences -- having Down syndrome, autism or deafness; being a dwarf or being transgender -- are often clouds with silver linings. Families grappling with these apparent problems may find profound meaning, even beauty, in them. Prodigiousness, conversely, looks from a distance like silver, but it comes with banks of clouds; genius can be as bewildering and hazardous as a disability. Despite the past century's breakthroughs in psychology and neuroscience, prodigiousness and genius are as little understood as autism. ''Genius is an abnormality, and can signal other abnormalities,'' says Veda Kaplinsky of Juilliard, perhaps the world's pre-eminent teacher of young pianists. ''Many gifted kids have A.D.D. or O.C.D. or Asperger's. When the parents are confronted with two sides of a kid, they're so quick to acknowledge the positive, the talented, the exceptional; they are often in denial over everything else.''
We live in ambitious times. You need only to go through the New York preschool application process, as I recently did for my son, to witness the hysteria attached to early achievement, the widespread presumption that a child's destiny hinges on getting a baby foot on a tall ladder. Parental obsessiveness on this front reflects the hegemony of developmental psychiatry, with its insistence that first experience is formative. We now know that brain plasticity diminishes over time; it is easier to mold a child than to reform an adult. What are we to do with this information? I would hate for my children to feel that their worth is contingent on sustaining competitive advantage, but I'd also hate for them to fall short of their potential. Tiger mothers who browbeat their children into submission overemphasize a narrow category of achievement over psychic health. Attachment parenting, conversely, often sacrifices accomplishment to an ideal of unboundaried acceptance that can be equally pernicious. It's tempting to propose some universal answer, but spending time with families of remarkably talented children showed me that what works for one child can be disastrous for another.
Children who are pushed toward success and succeed have a very different trajectory from that of children who are pushed toward success and fail. I once told Lang Lang, a prodigy par excellence and now perhaps the most famous pianist in the world, that by American standards, his father's brutal methods -- which included telling him to commit suicide, refusing any praise, browbeating him into abject submission -- would count as child abuse. ''If my father had pressured me like this and I had not done well, it would have been child abuse, and I would be traumatized, maybe destroyed,'' Lang responded. ''He could have been less extreme, and we probably would have made it to the same place; you don't have to sacrifice everything to be a musician. But we had the same goal. So since all the pressure helped me become a world-famous star musician, which I love being, I would say that, for me, it was in the end a wonderful way to grow up.''
While it is true that some parents push their kids too hard and give them breakdowns, others fail to support a child's passion for his own gift and deprive him of the only life that he would have enjoyed. You can err in either direction. Given that there is no consensus about how to raise ordinary children, it is not surprising that there is none about how to raise remarkable children. Like parents of children who are severely challenged, parents of exceptionally talented children are custodians of young people beyond their comprehension.
Spending time with the Petersens, I was struck not only by their mutual devotion but also by the easy way they avoided the snobberies that tend to cling to classical music. Sue is a school nurse; her husband, Joe, works in the engineering department of Volkswagen. They never expected the life into which Drew has led them, but they have neither been intimidated by it nor brash in pursuing it; it remains both a diligence and an art. ''How do you describe a normal family?'' Joe said. ''The only way I can describe a normal one is a happy one. What my kids do brings a lot of joy into this household.'' When I asked Sue how Drew's talent had affected how they reared his younger brother, Erik, she said: ''It's distracting and different. It would be similar if Erik's brother had a disability or a wooden leg.''
Prodigiousness manifests most often in athletics, mathematics, chess and music. A child may have a brain that processes chess moves or mathematical equations like some dream computer, which is its own mystery, but how can the mature emotional insight that is necessary to musicianship emerge from someone who is immature? ''Young people like romance stories and war stories and good-and-evil stories and old movies because their emotional life mostly is and should be fantasy,'' says Ken Noda, a great piano prodigy in his day who gave up public performance and now works at the Metropolitan Opera. ''They put that fantasized emotion into their playing, and it is very convincing. I had an amazing capacity for imagining these feelings, and that's part of what talent is. But it dries up, in everyone. That's why so many prodigies have midlife crises in their late teens or early 20s. If our imagination is not replenished with experience, the ability to reproduce these feelings in one's playing gradually diminishes.''
Musicians often talked to me about whether you achieve brilliance on the violin by practicing for hours every day or by reading Shakespeare, learning physics and falling in love. ''Maturity, in music and in life, has to be earned by living,'' the violinist Yehudi Menuhin once said. Who opens up or blocks access to such living? A musical prodigy's development hinges on parental collaboration. Without that support, the child would never gain access to an instrument, the technical training that even the most devout genius requires or the emotional nurturance that enables a musician to achieve mature expression. As David Henry Feldman and Lynn T. Goldsmith, scholars in the field, have said, ''A prodigy is a group enterprise.''
Some prodigies seem to trade on a splinter skill -- an ability in music that occupies their whole consciousness, leaving them virtually incompetent in all other areas. Others have a dazzling capacity for achievement in general and select music from among multitudinous gifts. Mikhail and Natalie Paremski held comfortable positions within the Soviet system: Mikhail with the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Agency; Natalie with the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. Their daughter, Natasha, born in 1987, showed a precocious interest in the piano. ''I was in the kitchen, and I thought, Who is playing?'' Natalie recalls. ''Then I saw: it's the baby, picking out nursery songs.'' By the time she was 4, Natasha had played a Chopin mazurka in a children's concert.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, Mikhail emigrated to California; the family followed in 1995. Natasha entered fourth grade, two years younger than her classmates. Within months, she was speaking English without an accent and coming in first on every school test. The family couldn't afford a good piano; they finally found a cheap one that ''sounded like cabbage,'' Natasha recalls, and she began performing Haydn concertos, Beethoven sonatas and Chopin études. ''Everyone would say, 'You must be so proud of your daughter,' '' Natalie told me. ''I used to say that it's not for me to be proud; it's Natasha who does this herself -- but I learned that this is not the polite American way. So now I always say, 'I am so proud of my daughter,' and then maybe we can have a conversation.'' Natasha agreed. ''What did they do to make me practice?'' she asked when I first interviewed her, at 16. ''What did they do to make me eat or sleep?''
Natasha graduated with top honors from high school at 14 and was offered a full scholarship by Mannes College the New School for Music in New York. Her mother worried about a deficit of soul in New York. ''There is no time for vision! People are just struggling to survive, like in Moscow,'' Natalie said -- to which her daughter replied, ''Vision is how I survive.'' In those early New York days, Natasha and her mother spoke by phone constantly. Nonetheless, Natalie said, ''that was my present to her: I gave her her own life.''
In 2004, when Natasha was 16, I went to her Carnegie Hall debut, for which she played Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. She's a beautiful young woman, with cascades of hair and a sylphlike figure, and she wore a sleeveless, black velvet dress, so her arms would feel free, and a pair of insanely high heels that she said gave her better leverage on the pedals. Her parents were not there. ''They're too supportive to come,'' Natasha told me just before the concert. Afterward, Natalie explained, ''If I am there, I am so worried about every single note that I can't even sit still. It's not helpful to Natasha.''
Natasha later said she saw nothing strange in a musician's ability to express emotions she has not experienced. ''Had I experienced them, that wouldn't necessarily help me to express them better in my music. I'm an actress, not a character; my job is to represent something, not to live it. Chopin wrote a mazurka, Person X in the audience wants to hear the mazurka and so I have to decipher the score and make it apprehensible to Person X, and it's really hard to do. But it has nothing to do with my life experience.''
After the English lawyer Daines Barrington examined the 8-year-old Mozart in 1764, he wrote: ''He had a thorough knowledge of the fundamental principles of composition. He was also a great master of modulation, and his transitions from one key to another were excessively natural and judicious.'' Yet, Mozart was also clearly a child. ''Whilst he was playing to me, a favorite cat came in, upon which he immediately left his harpsichord, nor could we bring him back for a considerable time. He would also sometimes run about the room with a stick between his legs by way of horse.''
Every prodigy is a chimera of such mastery and childishness, and the contrast between musical sophistication and personal immaturity can be striking. One prodigy I interviewed switched from the violin to the piano when she was 7. She offered to tell me why if I didn't tell her mother. ''I wanted to sit down,'' she said.
Chloe Yu was born in Macao and came to the United States to study when she was 17. She married at 25, and her son, Marc, was born a year later, in Pasadena, Calif. While she was pregnant, Chloe played the piano to him. When Marc was almost 3, he picked out a few tunes on the piano with two fingers; within a few months, Chloe had found him a teacher advanced enough to respond to his emerging talent. At 5, he added the cello to his regimen. ''Soon he asked for more instruments,'' Chloe told me. ''I said: 'That's it, Marc. Be realistic. Two is enough.' ''
Chloe gave up on the master's degree she was working on. She had divorced Marc's father, but because she had no money, she and Marc ended up living with her ex-in-laws, in a room over the garage. Marc's grandparents did not approve of his ''excessive'' devotion to the piano. ''His grandmother loves him a lot,'' Chloe said. ''But she just wanted him to be a normal 5-year-old.'' When Marc was in preschool, Chloe felt he was ready to perform, and she contacted local retirement facilities and hospitals to offer free recitals. Soon the papers were writing about this young genius. ''When I began to understand how talented he is, I was so excited!'' Chloe said. ''And also so afraid!''
At 6, Marc won a fellowship for gifted youth that covered the down payment on a Steinway. By the time Marc was 8, he and Chloe were flying to China frequently for lessons; Chloe explained that whereas her son's American teachers gave him broad interpretive ideas to explore freely, his Chinese teacher taught measure by measure. I asked Marc whether he found it difficult traveling so far. ''Well, fortunately, I don't have vestigial somnolence,'' he said. I raised an eyebrow. ''You know -- jet lag,'' he apologized.
Marc was being home-schooled to accommodate his performance and practice schedule. At the age of a third-grader, he was taking an SAT class. Chloe serves as his manager and reviews concert invitations with him. ''In America, every kid has to be well rounded,'' Chloe said. ''They have 10 different activities, and they never excel at any of them. Americans want everyone to have the same life; it's a cult of the average. This is wonderful for disabled children, who get things they would never have otherwise, but it's a disaster for gifted children. Why should Marc spend his life learning sports he's not interested in when he has this superb gift that gives him so much joy?''
At their home in California, I asked Marc what he thought of a normal childhood. ''I already have a normal childhood,'' he said. ''Do you want to see my room? It's messy, but you can come anyway.'' Upstairs, he showed me a yellow remote-controlled helicopter that his father had sent from China. The bookshelves were crammed with Dr. Seuss, ''Jumanji'' and ''The Wind in the Willows'' but also ''Moby-Dick''; with ''Sesame Street'' videos and also a series of DVDs on the music of Prague, Vienna and so on. We sat on the floor, and he showed me his favorite Gary Larson cartoons, and then we played the board game Mouse Trap.
Then we went downstairs, and Marc sat on a phone book on the piano bench so his hands would be high enough to play comfortably and launched into Chopin's ''Fantasie-Impromptu,'' which he imbued with a quality of nuanced yearning that seemed almost inconceivable in someone with a shelf of Cookie Monster videos. ''You see?'' Chloe said to me. ''He's not a normal child. Why should he have a normal childhood?''
A parent is the progenitor of much of a child's behavior, telling that child repeatedly who he has been, is and could be, reconciling accomplishment and naïveté. In constructing this narrative, parents often confuse the anomaly of developing fast with the objective of developing profoundly. There is no clear delineation between supporting and pressuring a child, between believing in your child and forcing your child to conform to what you imagine for him. If society's expectations for most children with profound differences are too low, expectations for prodigies are often perilously high. ''When you have a child whose gift is so overshadowing, it is possible for parents to be distracted and lose track of the child himself,'' says Karen Monroe, a psychiatrist at Boston's McLean Hospital who works with prodigious children.
If you dream of having a genius for a child, you will spot brilliance in your child, sometimes even when it isn't there. Such children, despite being the subjects of obsessive attention, can suffer from not being seen; their sorrow is organized not so much around the rigor of practicing as around invisibility. And yet, accomplishment entails giving up the pleasures of the present moment in favor of anticipated triumphs, and that is an impulse that must be learned. Left to their own devices, children do not become world-class instrumentalists before they turn 10.
When I spoke to the mother of one musical prodigy on the telephone to set up an interview, I invited her and her daughter to dinner, but she said, ''We have a family of fussy eaters, so we'll eat before we come.'' The girl and her parents, whom I've granted anonymity for their own protection, arrived wearing coats, and I offered to hang them up. ''That won't be necessary,'' the mother said, and they sat holding them through the interview. I offered them something to drink, but the woman said, ''We are so used to our schedule, and it's not time for a drink right now.'' In three hours, none of them had a sip of water. I had put out homemade cookies, and the daughter kept glancing at them; every time she did, the mother shot her a look. Whenever I asked the daughter a question, her mother jumped in to answer on her behalf; when the daughter did reply, she did so with an anxious glance at her mother, as if worried that she delivered the wrong response.
The daughter was holding her instrument case, so I invited her to play. ''I think I'll play the Bach Chaconne,'' she said. Her mother said, ''How about the Rimsky-Korsakov?'' She replied, ''No, no, no, the Chaconne is better.'' The daughter had told me that she chose her instrument for its resemblance to her voice; now it provided her only chance to be heard over her mother. She played the Chaconne. When she finished, her mother said, ''Now you can play the Rimsky-Korsakov.'' The daughter dutifully launched into ''Flight of the Bumblebee,'' the proof of every virtuoso. ''Vivaldi?'' her mother said, and she played ''Summer'' from ''The Four Seasons.'' She played with a clear, bright tone, although not with such brilliance as to resolve the question of why a childhood had been sacrificed for this art. I had hoped this child would light up when her bow met the strings, but instead she brought out her instrument's searing melancholy.
Throughout much of history, prodigies were thought to be possessed; Aristotle believed that there could be no genius without madness. Paganini was accused of putting himself in the hands of the devil. The Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso said in 1891, ''Genius is a true degenerative psychosis belonging to the group of moral insanity.'' Recent neuroscience demonstrates that the processes of creativity and psychosis map similarly in the brain, each contingent on a reduced number of dopamine D2 receptors in the thalamus. A continuum runs between the two conditions; there is no sharp line.
The parents of children with disabilities must be educated to see the identity within a perceived illness, but the parents of prodigies are confronted with an identity and must be educated to recognize the prospect of illness within it. Even those without a sideline diagnosis like A.D.D. or Asperger's need to mitigate the loneliness of being peerless and of having their primary emotional relationship with an inanimate object. ''If you're spending five hours a day practicing, and the other kids are out playing baseball, you're not doing the same things,'' Karen Monroe says. ''Even if you love it and can't imagine yourself doing anything else, that doesn't mean you don't feel lonely.''
If Chloe Yu scorned the idea of a normal childhood, May Armstrong simply had to bow to the reality that no such thing could be achieved with her only son, Kit. Born in 1992, Kit could count at 15 months; May taught him addition and subtraction at 2, and he worked out multiplication and division for himself. While digging in the garden, he explained the principle of leverage to his mother. By 5, he explained Einstein's theory of time dilation to her. May, an economist, was frankly bemused: ''By nature, every mother wants to be protective, but he didn't need protection. I can't say that was easy.''
May had left Taiwan at 22 to study in the United States and spent holidays by herself. ''I knew what loneliness was all about, and I thought he needed a hobby he could enjoy on his own,'' she says. So she started him on piano lessons when he was 5, even though she had no interest in music. After three weeks of lessons, Kit started composing without an instrument on staff paper: the written language of music had come to him whole.
When Kit was 3, a supervisor of his play group told May that he let other children push him around. ''I went in one day and saw another child snatch a toy away from him,'' May said. ''I told him he should stand up for himself, and he said: 'That kid will be bored in two minutes, and then I can play with it again. Why start a fight?' So he was mature already. What did I have to teach this kid? But he always seemed happy, and that was what I wanted most for him. He used to look in the mirror and burst out laughing.'' May enrolled him in school. ''His teacher told me that she wanted her other kids to grow up in kindergarten,'' she said. ''She wanted mine to grow down.''
By age 9, he had graduated from high school and started college in Utah. ''The other students often thought it was strange that he was there,'' May says, ''but Kit never did.'' His piano skills, meanwhile, had advanced enough so that by the time he was 10, he appeared on David Letterman. Shortly after, Kit toured the physics research facility at Los Alamos. A physicist said that, unlike the postdoctoral physicists who usually visited, Kit was so bright that no one could ''find the bottom of this boy's knowledge.'' A few years later, Kit attended a summer program at M.I.T., where he helped edit papers in physics, chemistry and mathematics. ''He just understands things,'' May said to me, almost resigned. ''Someday, I want to work with parents of disabled children, because I know their bewilderment is like mine. I had no idea how to be a mother to Kit, and there was no place to find out.''
May moved them to London to pursue Kit's musicianship, and he soon met the revered pianist Alfred Brendel; he took Kit on and refused payment for lessons. When he learned that Kit was practicing at a piano showroom, he had a Steinway delivered to their apartment.
''I have no ear to be any help to Kit,'' May said. ''All I can do is remind him that he is very lucky to have been born with those talents. I'd have preferred that he be a professor of mathematics. It's an easier life.'' Then she added, ''But Kit has decided that mathematics is his hobby, and the piano is his work.'' At 18, Kit was pursuing an M.A. in pure mathematics in Paris; he said he did it ''to unwind.'' I asked May if she ever worried that Kit, like many young people of remarkable ability, might have a nervous breakdown. She laughed. ''If anyone's going to have a nervous breakdown in this setup,'' she said, ''it's me!''
There is no federal mandate for gifted education. But if we recognize the importance of special programs for students whose atypical brains encode less-accepted differences, we should extrapolate to create programs for those whose atypical brains encode remarkable abilities. Writing in Time magazine in 2007, the educator John Cloud faulted the ''radically egalitarian'' values underlying the No Child Left Behind Act, which provided little support for gifted students. Once again, it falls to parents to advocate for their children's needs, often in the face of a hostile or indifferent educational system. Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, himself a conductor and a former wunderkind, remarked dryly, ''If Beethoven were sent to nursery school today, they would medicate him, and he would be a postal clerk.''
Growing up gay in the 1970s, I encountered prejudice from the world at large that often crossed into disdain. My parents were never derisive, but they were uncomfortable with the ways I differed from them and encouraged me to try to be straight. I began researching children of difference in a quest to forgive my mother and father for pressing me to be untrue to myself. I wanted to look at the process through which parents reconcile themselves to children who throw up significant challenges. I found that many families come to celebrate children with characteristics they initially found incomprehensible -- just as my parents did. Having seen how hard it was for other parents, I decided, with considerable relief, that mine had actually done a pretty good job and realized that I was ready to be a parent myself.
My research on prodigies echoed my study of children with other differences. Sue Petersen compared her experience to having a child with a wooden leg; May Armstrong saw common ground with parents of disabled children; and I realized that parenthood always entails perplexity and that the valence of that perplexity matters less than the spirit with which parents respond to it. Half the prodigies I studied seemed to be under pressure to be even more astonishing than they naturally were, and the other half, to be more ordinary than their talents. Studying their families, I gradually recognized that all parenting is guesswork, and that difference of any kind, positive or negative, makes the guessing harder. That insight has largely shaped me as a father. I don't think I would love my children more if they could play Rachmaninoff's Third, and I hope I wouldn't love them less for having that consuming skill, any more than I would if they were affected with a chronic illness. But I am frankly relieved that so far, they show no such uncanny aptitude.

BYLINE: By NANCY MACDONELL

 BODY:
Climate change and shifting population patterns are not typically fashion fodder - which makes two new scarf collections all the more intriguing. For the latest Sportmax Carte Blanche collaboration, the creative consultant and Design Miami and Design Miami/Basel co-founder Ambra Medda tapped the illustrator Ying Wu, a Royal College of Art graduate whose work she discovered at the most recent Salone del Mobile in Milan. Wu's silk foulards comment on the unforeseen side effects of unbridled economic growth, a phenomenon that the Chinese-born artist has experienced firsthand and frequently alludes to in her work. With their poster-art palette and Maurice Sendak-ish animal imagery, Wu's scarves are highly decorative. But if you look closer, says Medda, "you start to realize that there is a whole other dimension that brings you back to a starker reality." The limited-edition collection will be available at the Sportmax flagship store in Milan in January. 
Only marginally less colorful is the reality explored by the Dutch photographer and designer Reineke Otten, who devised the palette for her collection of statistics-driven silk scarves from Data.gov and The CIA World Factbook. "I was fascinated by the idea of seeing people as color pixels," says Otten, who created the scarves as part of her larger World Skin Colors project. After compiling information on the distribution of skin colors, G.D.P., number of airports and other factoids from 231 countries - a time-consuming process that involved four months of plugging numbers into spreadsheets and a close study of the Pantone color system - Otten was able to map the world's complexion, wealth and access to air travel in pie charts, polka dots and other symbols. Because each country generates unique data, no two designs are alike. Beginning this month, Otten's United States and Israel squares, packaged in the same cardboard used for archive folders, will be available at the Jewish Museum in New York. They come with a small caveat: "Like populations, these maps are ephemeral," she says, "snapshots of the world as it is composed today, poised to change tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Balancing Act

BYLINE: By JULIA FELSENTHAL

 BODY:
Lately it seems that everybody is either a gluten-free vegan or a fanatical connoisseur of meat. What's a host to do? For a start, take a lesson from Justin Patterson and Anna Burke. 
By day Burke is a designer at Kemble Interiors and Patterson runs an investment partnership. By night they are perfecting the art of hosting the foolproof vegan/carnivore dinner party for their picky-eater friends and family at their house on the Hudson River in Palisades, N.Y. Patterson is intimately acquainted with both herbivorous eating and excellent meat: he grew up in Virginia in a family of vegetarians - who happen to run a heritage grass-fed-cattle farm. These days, Patterson, who started eating meat at the age of 21, enjoys the yield of the family business (though he avoids gluten). He and Burke, who eats everything and loves to cook, are avid entertainers. They're passionate about high-quality ingredients (just listen to them wax rhapsodic about Le Saunier de Camargue Fleur de Sel or the merits of cooking with high-smoke-point fats, like ghee or macadamia nut oil) and meticulous about style and presentation. And rather than balk at preparing a menu that has to do double duty, they've figured out the formula for making it a breeze. See the interactive slide show >>
Two cocktail recipes beloved by Burke and Patterson:
Burke's non-vegan Pisco Sour
Ingredients:
1 shot Barsol Pisco
1 shot simple syrup
1 shot fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 organic egg white
Angostura bitters
Preparation: Make the simple syrup by cooking on the stove equal parts sugar and water (you can store it in the fridge for a few weeks, so make a big batch). Combine all ingredients except the bitters, and shake over ice in a cocktail shaker. Top with a few shakes of angostura bitters. Serve very cold.
Patterson's vegan Mojito Antioquian
Ingredients:
1-2 shots of Aguardiente Antioqueño (he prefers the sugar-free version with the blue top)
Flat water (to taste)
Panela (to taste. Panela is a unrefined cane sugar popular in Colombia. Patterson says the best substitute in the States is rough brown sugar)
A few sprigs of fresh mint
Preparation:
Dissolve panela/sugar in water; the proportions depend on your sweet tooth. Add one to two shots of Aguardiente, depending on what kind of week it's been. Chop the fresh mint and add. Shake and refrigerate. Serve over ice.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: The Drinks Patterson and Burke are fans of Karlsson's Gold Vodka, made from Swedish new potatoes. ''It's the smoothest, hangover-free vodka,'' Burke says. Patterson discovered aguardiente, an anise-flavored liquor, while in Colombia for work. Now he mixes it with sugar water and mint to make a drink he calls the Antioquian mojito. Over dinner they opt for David Bruce California pinot noir, which Patterson describes as clean tasting and well balanced. The couple differ on white wines: she prefers chardonnay and he likes Sancerre. They compromise on an Olivier Leflaive Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly. ''It's somewhere in the middle,'' Burke says.
The Menu: When concocting a menu to satisfy a spectrum of food preferences, making several dishes is key, so ''we look for preparations that are efficient from a time standpoint,'' Burke says. They choose main courses that cook very quickly -- quinoa, game meat like venison and simple reduction sauces -- so they can focus on making a number of crowd-pleasing sides. For picky eaters, it's a good idea to write out menus. Burke uses simple note cards like these, designed for her by the Brooklyn-based illustrator Happy Menocal, a friend.
The Playlist: Patterson updates his iPod with new music he hears about through an e-mail-based playlist called Friday Freshmix. For a dinner party, the couple prefers tunes that are upbeat. ''Not nightclub,'' Burke says, ''but not depressing.'' Dinner-party-worthy albums: Clive Tanaka Y Su Orquesta, ''Jet Set Siempre No. 1,'' Coconut Records, ''Nighttiming'' Walter Meego, ''Voyager'' D. Gookin, ''When You're Lonely Everybody's a Celebrity'' Nino Moschella, ''Boom Shadow'' Nada Surf, ''Let Go'' Jack Peñate, ''Everything Is New'' Lake, ''Let's Build a Roof'' The Police, ''Outlandos d'Amour.''
The Main Event: A typical meal: pan-seared venison from the Patterson farm
Ancient Harvest Inca Red quinoa (nuttier and tastier than the regular kind) cooked with vegetable broth and peas
sautéed leeks with goat cheese on the side
vegan acorn squash soup with kale (a Vitamix blender ''is able to make most things taste creamy'')
and a big salad of local lettuces. Why it works: A bold meat dish satisfies adventurous carnivorous appetites, and the quinoa is a protein-rich accompaniment to vegetable-heavy starters and sides. Making a bunch of different, simple dishes means nobody gets a raw deal.
The Table: ''I really like the table to change seasonally,'' says Burke about her elaborate settings. To economize, she uses reasonably priced dinnerware from Anthropologie, makes tablecloths from fabric she buys by the yard, and creates runners from Uzbek ikats she buys from the Islimi design shop on Etsy. Centerpieces are colorful flowers, like peonies or dahlias, from Dutch Flower Line on 28th Street in Manhattan, and topiaries from NYTopiary, across the street.
The Dessert: Patterson and Burke often opt for ice cream -- organic, pasture-fed Blue Marble for dairy-philes and creamless Organic Nectars Cashewtopia for the dairy-phobes -- because it's easy. Even Burke, who prefers the real thing, approves of the vegan option. ''It's rich and creamy,'' she says.
 The Hors d'oeuvres Burke usually makes a bountiful cheese plate (her favorites are Fromager d'Affinois and Nancy's Hudson Valley Camembert), and also goes heavy on non-cheese options. ''I always like to have a few different vegetables for people to dip into hummus,'' Burke says. She makes her own or serves Bobbi's Garlic Hummus (supergarlicky, and ''not for kissing,'' says Patterson). Crackers are gluten-free Mary's Gone, and Raincoast Crisps, which are great with cheese and look pretty on the platter. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CEDRIC ANGELES)

HEADLINE: A Winning Ticket Of Style and Handling

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
NOW that the Fusion has restored Ford's standing as a maker of top-flight family sedans, it might perform one other service: kicking the Taurus, its couch-potato roommate, out of the apartment.
For five years, the Fusion and the reborn Taurus have coexisted uneasily in showrooms. The Taurus had been treated heedlessly by Ford, relegated to rental fleets and finally put down in 2006 -- an undignified end for a sedan that had been America's best seller of 1992-97. Then Ford clumsily revived the name, re-christening its tepid Five Hundred sedan as a Taurus before creating the underwhelming model offered today.
In contrast, the second-generation Fusion, with its rakish style and engaging performance, belongs on any midsize sedan shopping list. And Ford loyalists, unless they prefer a cinder block to Cinderella, can skip the larger, less space-efficient Taurus.
That's because the Fusion runs the midsize bases and bowls over lingering misconceptions about Detroit's ability to make top-notch family cars. 
A requisite bottom-line version, the Fusion S, lures bargain hunters with a $22,495 base price and a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower.
The Fusion SE, at $24,495 and up, sprinkles in 17-inch wheels and other goodies, and for another $795 you can add a 179-horse 1.6-liter turbocharged Ecoboost 4-cylinder. A fuel-saving stop-start system -- it cuts the engine when the car isn't moving -- is $295 more.
Adding muscle, with a 2-liter, 240-horse turbo 4-cylinder, kicks the SE's starting price to $26,745.
I tested two upper-tier models, including the Fusion Hybrid that starts at $27,995. Its 47 m.p.g. rating crushes midsize rivals, including the Toyota Camry Hybrid, beneath its green feet.
My other test car was a Fusion Titanium with a base price of $30,995; all-wheel drive costs $2,000 more. Options, including a navigation system, kicked my maxed-out Titanium test car to $37,670. That is $3,450 more than the most expensive Honda Accord sedan, the V-6 Touring, though the Honda doesn't offer all-wheel drive.
Every Fusion gets a handsome metal wrapper that puts it among the few family sedans -- the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima are others -- to poke their heads above the sea of anonymity. The Ford leads with an Anglophile face: a ribbed Aston Martin-style grille that seems a vestige of Ford's previous ownership of that British marque. Perhaps Ford's leaders borrowed the look on the reasoning that, since Aston never made them a dime, they might as well get something out of the deal.
I may be the only one to find that social-leaping grille a bit overweening; it reminds me of the days when Chrysler 300 owners would proudly tack on fake Bentley grilles. When I've asked Ford designers about Aston influence, they claim to not see it, which is rather like Coldplay saying, ''U2? Never heard of 'em, mate.''
Strands of the Hyundai Sonata also play through the Fusion's sweeping roofline and rear end. Sources aside, the Fusion will brighten gray suburban driveways as few family sedans can.
The cabin is comfortable and uncluttered. Unfortunately, only the Titanium includes a Sony audio system with sleeker flush-mounted controls. The clean-and-simple theme is undermined by MyFord Touch, which combines a sometimes dodgy touch screen with a pair of configurable LCD screens flanking the speedometer. The system manages navigation, phone, audio and other functions with touch controls, voice commands or steering wheel buttons. Operating the system gets easier after you climb the learning curve, and this latest version seemed quicker to respond to inputs.
Still, every time I use MyFord Touch, I imagine a digitally challenged grandparent being flummoxed or distracted -- and driving off a cliff.
Add the irritations of MyFord Touch to a growing list of consumer grievances against Ford. These include a problem-plagued dual-clutch transmission (used in the Fiesta and Focus, but not the new Fusion), several large recalls and the brand's plunge -- to 27th place out of 28 auto brands -- in Consumer Reports' reliability ratings.
The 2013 Fusion was too new, however, to be included in the 2012 Consumer Reports survey, which was released last week.
Yet judged strictly on performance, the Ford is a marvel. It is a bona fide driver's car, the rare family sedan that loves a curve-chucking detour on the way to work. The chassis, suspension, brakes and steering all rank at the top of the class, or near it. The Fusion sets the sporty sedan standard over formidable new rivals like the Nissan Altima and Volkswagen Passat, leaving the Honda Accord as its closest competitor.
The 2-liter Ecoboost, especially when burdened with the extra weight of all-wheel drive, is a tad slower than some rivals' turbo 4s and V-6s. Equipped this way, the Fusion accelerates from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in a still-respectable 6.8 seconds. The engine is also smoother and sweeter-sounding than, say, the competing Hyundai Sonata Turbo. And all of the Ford Ecoboost's solid 270 pound-feet of torque, managed through a 6-speed automatic transmission, is on tap at a low 3,000 r.p.m.
The 2-liter, all-wheel-drive model is the least fuel-efficient Fusion at 22 miles per gallon in town and 31 on the highway. Choosing front drive raises the highway fuel economy to 33 m.p.g.
As with many turbos, however, Ford's drumbeat claims of V-6 power with 4-cylinder mileage become suspect when you dip into the power supply. I averaged 22 m.p.g. with the Titanium test car.
The smaller 1.6-liter Ecoboost improves fuel economy to 23 city, 36 highway, with a 6-speed automatic. A 6-speed manual gearbox is also offered, but only with the 1.6 engine.
The cheapest Fusion, with its carried-over 2.5 engine, is rated at 22 city, 34 highway, and is perhaps best left for the rental-car companies.
But considering the typical Detroit sedan of even a decade ago, the new Fusion is a revelation, so sophisticated over the road that enthusiasts will be looking for the missing VW badge.
Yes, Ford has taken a beating in recent consumer ratings, but give it some credit: across a big chunk of its lineup, from the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact to the Fusion, Mustang, Explorer and Flex, the company has nailed the ride and handling formula for mainstream cars.
If Ford can also get a handle on the issues dragging it down, the Fusion could be the first Detroit car in years to challenge the Accord as the critics' choice among family sedans.
INSIDE TRACK: Ford's bid for the middle-class vote.

HEADLINE: The Brain Trainers

BYLINE: By DAN HURLEY

 BODY:
IN the back room of a suburban storefront previously occupied by a yoga studio, Nick Vecchiarello, a 16-year-old from Glen Ridge, N.J., sits at a desk across from Kathryn Duch, a recent college graduate who wears a black shirt emblazoned with the words ''Brain Trainer.'' Spread out on the desk are a dozen playing cards showing symbols of varying colors, shapes and sizes. Nick stares down, searching for three cards whose symbols match.
''Do you see it?'' Ms. Duch asks encouragingly.
''Oh, man,'' mutters Nick, his eyes shifting among the cards, looking for patterns. 
Across the room, Nathan Veloric, 23, studies a list of numbers, looking for any two in a row that add up to nine. With tight-lipped determination, he scrawls a circle around one pair as his trainer holds a stopwatch to time him. Halfway through the 50 seconds allotted to complete the exercise, a ruckus comes from the center of the room.
''Nathan's here!'' shouts Vanessa Maia, another trainer. Approaching him with a teasing grin, she claps her hands like an annoying little sister. ''Distraction!'' she shouts. ''Distraction!''
There is purpose behind the silliness. Ms. Maia is challenging the trainees to stay focused on their tasks in the face of whatever distractions may be out there, whether Twitter feeds, the latest Tumblr posting or old-fashioned classroom commotion.
On this Wednesday evening at the Upper Montclair, N.J., outlet of LearningRx, a chain of 83 ''brain training'' franchises across the United States, the goal is to improve cognitive skills. LearningRx is one of a growing number of such commercial services -- some online, others offered by psychologists. Unlike traditional tutoring services that seek to help students master a subject, brain training purports to enhance comprehension and the ability to analyze and mentally manipulate concepts, images, sounds and instructions. In a word, it seeks to make students smarter.
''We measure every student pre- and post-training with a version of the Woodcock-Johnson general intelligence test,'' said Ken Gibson, who began franchising LearningRx centers in 2003, and has data on more than 30,000 of the nearly 50,000 students who have been trained. ''The average gain on I.Q. is 15 points after 24 weeks of training, and 20 points in less than 32 weeks.''
The three other large cognitive training services -- Lumosity, Cogmed and Posit Science -- dance around the question of whether they truly raise I.Q. but do assert that they improve cognitive performance.
''Your brain, just brighter,'' is the slogan of Lumosity, an online company that now has some 25 million registered members. According to its Web site, ''Our users have reported profound benefits that include: clearer and quicker thinking; faster problem-solving skills; increased alertness and awareness; better concentration at work or while driving; sharper memory for names, numbers and directions.''
Those results are achieved, the companies say, by repurposing cognitive tasks initially developed by psychologists as tests of mental abilities. With technical names like the antisaccade, the N-back and the complex working memory span task, the exercises are dressed up as games that become increasingly difficult as students gain mastery.
Conceived to appeal to adults, especially baby boomers looking to stanch the effects of aging, Lumosity now draws one-quarter of its audience from students between the ages of 11 and 21, according to Michael Scanlon, the company's scientific director. ''I was taken aback that so much of our user base is so young,'' he said. ''The particular audience I had in mind at the earliest stages of the company was my mother.'' In response to requests from schoolteachers, the fee is now waived -- $15 a month -- for students in their classrooms. More than 1,000 teachers and 10,000 students have enrolled this year, Mr. Scanlon said.
For the one-on-one training at LearningRx, fees are decidedly higher, from about $80 to $90 an hour in Upper Montclair. The students come with learning disabilities, with grades they want to improve in a competitive academic environment, all with hopes of just being sharper.
TAYLOR WEBSTER, 16, trains daily for lacrosse with a personal coach. ''She has natural athletic ability,'' said her mother, Samantha Newman-Webster. ''But it's really through her training that she has been able to achieve to the point where she's being sought out by college recruiters.'' Would brain training, the family wondered, do for her grades what physical training did for her lacrosse game?
Ms. Newman-Webster enrolled Taylor, already a B student at the private Montclair Kimberley Academy, at LearningRx in February. ''I felt like I wanted to do whatever I could to make her learning easier, faster, deeper,'' she said. ''I knew she was going to be taking the SATs, and they say it will improve whatever you're trying to do.''
Speaking by cellphone on the way to a lacrosse game, Taylor explained, with a laugh, what it's like: ''In the beginning your head is sore. Honestly, I had headaches after going there the first few times. It was kind of tedious and made my brain hurt. But I started getting better and better at it. It kind of became a competition for me to do better each time.''
She's now studying for the SAT. ''It used to take me an hour to memorize 20 words. Now I can learn, like, 40 new words in 20 minutes.''
Others -- a majority, according to LearningRx -- seek cognitive training in the hopes of remediating a learning disability.
Nathan Veloric had learning issues since elementary school. Last December, he had just graduated from William Paterson University with a degree in communications when his mother heard about LearningRx from a business networking group. His goal was to build up skills. ''I've got to keep on bettering myself,'' said Mr. Veloric, whose first job out of college is as a part-time cashier at a CVS near his home in New Providence, N.J. ''I'm happy to have a job in this economy. While looking for something better I'm working my way up at CVS -- I'm trying to go full time and then get into their management training program.''
Of his brain training, he said, ''I don't know if it makes you smarter. But when you get to each new level on the math and reading tasks, it definitely builds up your self-confidence.''
Nick Vecchiarello struggles with attention deficit disorder. ''During middle school we had every kind of tutor known to man,'' said his mother, Diane. ''Name it, we've done it'' -- stimulant medication, sessions with a psychologist. ''He never liked anything to do with education.'' A brochure from LearningRx showed up in the mail, and the scientific aura around the program impressed the Vecchiarellos. They decided to spend $12,000 for a year of visits, one to three times a week.
''It has been a financial strain,'' acknowledged Nick's father, Richard, a fifth-grade teacher in nearby Fair Lawn. ''Yes, I think it's made a change in Nick. His grades are better. If it gives him a leg up on life, you can't put a price on that.'' In September, after six months, Nick and his parents decided he had made enough progress to stop his medication.
For all the glowing testimonials, there are postings to be found online from parents of children with learning disabilities, complaining about substantial fees and minimal benefit.
Whether the results last beyond the blush of training -- indeed, whether I.Q. can truly be bolstered in a meaningful way -- are questions on which serious scientists still disagree. Studies have been published in recent years finding that intelligence can be improved through training, but not enough of them are of sufficient scientific quality to convince everyone in the field.
One skeptic is Douglas K. Detterman, professor of psychology at Case Western Reserve University and founding editor of the influential academic journal Intelligence. His research would seem to offer reassurance to college-bound brain trainees, because he has found a close correlation between I.Q. and SAT scores. ''All of these tests are pretty much the same thing,'' he said. ''They measure general intelligence.''
The catch, however, is that Dr. Detterman believes that cognitive training only makes people better at taking tests, without improving their underlying intelligence. Dr. Detterman said of brain training, ''It's probably not harmful. But I would tell parents: Save your money. Look at the studies the commercial services have done to support their results. You'll find very poorly done studies, with no control groups and all kinds of problems.''
Executives at traditional tutoring and test-prep services tend to share Dr. Detterman's view -- perhaps not surprisingly, because some of the brain training programs pitch themselves in direct contrast to standard tutoring. (''Brain Training vs. Tutoring,'' says the headline of a LearningRx brochure. ''Is tutoring what your child really needs?'') Bror Saxberg, chief learning officer of Kaplan Inc., questions whether improving performance on an intelligence test will translate directly to improved grades and test scores.
''I keep looking for good studies that show how math performance or an ability to write an essay or some other really important set of skills have been dramatically enhanced for normal kids,'' Dr. Saxberg said. ''What you care about is not an intelligence test score, but whether your ability to do an important task has really improved. That's a chain of evidence that would be really great to have. I haven't seen it.'' Dr. Saxberg, by the way, holds a master's in mathematics from Oxford University, a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an M.D. from Harvard Medical School.
Still,a new and growing body of scientific evidence indicates that cognitive training can be effective, including that offered by commercial services.
Oliver W. Hill Jr., a professor of psychology at Virginia State University in Petersburg, recently completed a $1 million study, yet to be published, financed by the National Science Foundation to test the effects of LearningRx. He looked at 340 middle-school students who spent two hours a week for a semester using LearningRx exercises in their schools' computer labs and an equal number of students who received no such training. Those who played the online games, Dr. Hill found, not only improved significantly on measures of cognitive abilities compared to their peers, but also on Virginia's annual Standards of Learning exam.
He's now conducting a follow-up study of college students in Texas and, he said, sees even stronger gains when the training is offered one on one.
Michael Merzenich, who spent years conducting brain plasticity research in animals as a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, started Posit Science to make the results of his research more widely available. ''This is medicine,'' he insisted. ''It is driving changes in the brain.''
The programs offered by Posit, Lumosity and Cogmed are now being used by psychologists not affiliated with the companies to help people with diagnosed cognitive disorders, including traumatic brain injury, A.D.H.D., and the aftereffect of chemotherapy.
Kristina K. Hardy, a neuropsychologist at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, is testing the use of Cogmed with childhood cancer survivors, whose ability to learn is sometimes significantly reduced after chemotherapy and radiation. Founded by a Swedish neuroscientist, Cogmed was bought in 2010 by Pearson, the largest provider of testing and teaching materials, and is offered via psychologists and other clinical specialists.
''I entered this work with some skepticism that just doing some computer work at home could help anybody,'' she said. ''I thought we wouldn't be able to move the needle on their cognitive abilities. And not everybody has been able to make gains. But I've had some kids who not only reported that they had very big changes in the classroom, but when we bring them back in the laboratory to do neuropsychological testing, we also see great changes. They show increases that would be highly unlikely to happen just by chance.''
Julie Schweitzer, director of the A.D.H.D. Program at the University of California, Davis, published a study in July finding that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who used Cogmed for 25 days were significantly better able to stay on task and to perform on a test of working memory -- the ability to not just hold but to juggle items in the mind despite brief distractions.
''We got positive results, but it was a very small study,'' she said. It involved just 26 children. Even so, she said: ''In general, I'm cautiously optimistic about the potential for cognitive training. I'm concerned that some of the studies out there have not had the rigor that ought to be there. But I think the potential is there.''
AT Lumosity's headquarters on the sixth floor of a rehabbed building in downtown San Francisco, bicycles line a wall, the meeting room has foosball, and the intensely focused young employees tap at their computers in a sprawling room without cubicles. It could be mistaken for a satellite office of Google. Except, oh, wait a minute, that guy who won the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament five times in a row? He actually quit Google last year to work here.
''I looked around for a place that would get me closer to the kinds of games and puzzles I enjoy,'' said Tyler Hinman, who is now a software developer and game designer at Lumosity. ''But where crosswords and Sudoku are intended to be a diversion, the games here give that same kind of reward, only they're designed to improve your brain, your memory, your problem-solving skills.''
More than 40 games are offered by Lumosity. One, the N-back, is based on a task developed decades ago by psychologists. Created to test working memory, the N-back challenges users to keep track of a continuously updated list and remember which item appeared ''n'' times ago. Practice on the N-back has been shown in some studies to lead to significant increases in fluid intelligence. Unlike crystallized intelligence, the mental storehouse of knowledge and procedures, fluid intelligence is the ability to solve novel problems, to see patterns and understand complex relationships -- to find order in the chaos.
Not all the exercises offered by the commercial services carry the scientific pedigree of the N-back. Some offered by LearningRx exude an undeniable whiff of the theatrical, like having trainers shout and clap to help students learn to ignore distractions.
Perhaps that reflects the company's origins. Whereas the founders of Posit, Cogmed and Lumosity all have advanced degrees in psychology and neuroscience, the founder of LearningRx obtained his Ph.D. in pediatric optometry.
''Largely my focus was on visual training,'' Dr. Gibson said. Treating children with problems involving focusing or eye movement, he developed an interest in dyslexia and other learning disorders. ''I realized I could help those who had eyes crossed, but I wasn't helping very much with their academic performance,'' he said. ''I started reading the literature about training abilities of every skill, not just visual, but auditory and memory and speed of processing.''
Dr. Gibson is self-taught in the field of psychology; his confidence in his program, he said, comes from the gains students make on I.Q. tests. Trainers and franchise owners must be college graduates but need not have expertise -- beyond the training given to them by LearningRx. Ms. Duch and Ms. Maia, the Montclair trainers, have B.A.'s in psychology.
''This has been a process since 1986,'' Dr. Gibson said. ''We have so systematized the program that the educational background of the trainers and franchise owners is not an issue. I don't come from the perspective of an academic. We're not part of Duke University or Harvard. We have to get results to justify the fees that we charge and get referrals.''
Back at the franchise in Upper Montclair, Nathan Veloric is trying to do his ''speed numbers'' exercise just a bit faster, in 45 seconds rather than 50, still without missing a single pair of numbers that add up to nine. Four times in a row he goes down a list, each time missing just one of the pairs.
''O.K., try it again,'' says Ms. Duch. ''I know you're getting tired. Just give me two more tries.'' And again she starts the timer.

HEADLINE: After Getting Back to Normal, Big Job Is Facing New Reality

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD; Reporting was contributed by Charles V. Bagli, David W. Chen, Patrick McGeehan and John Schwartz.

 BODY:
First, life has to be rewound to Friday, Oct. 26 -- the last weekday before Hurricane Sandy crippled and disoriented the New York area. To make that happen, repairs to damaged power grids, transportation networks and housing will grind on for weeks, if not months, at a staggering cost.
But the bigger question is what occurs after that.
Basic restoration leaves everything just as vulnerable to the next monster storm. Hurricane Sandy is now a gauge of the region's new fragility. Climate change and extreme weather are presenting government -- and the public -- with some overwhelming choices. 
The authorities must not only reopen the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, but also ponder whether to put up sea gates or install inflatable plugs to protect it. Shorted-out circuits in Consolidated Edison's flooded substation in the East Village stand a foot off the ground in metal sheds. They always seemed impervious to flooding but no longer are.
In New Jersey, the historic Hoboken train terminal had five feet of water sloshing in the waiting room and switches and power substations exposed to salt water. Will it do just to dry them out?
More broadly, officials must ask whether it is sensible to replace buildings on the Manhattan waterfront, the Jersey Shore or the Long Island coast -- and continue to dare nature. After all, the waters surrounding New York have been rising an inch a decade, and the pace is picking up.
In recent days, elected officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, have warned that bold steps are needed, that to simply mop up is a fool's errand. Experts agree.
''It's a no-brainer for New York,'' said J. David Rogers, a professor of geological engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.
''You've got such enormous assets and infrastructure that you want to protect.''
But some experts also say that after rhythms return to normal, a no longer frazzled public may rebel if taxes and fees rise sharply to pay for better defenses.
The cost of the repairs alone will certainly reach tens of billions of dollars. Far-reaching solutions will cost many billions more.
And the cost of not doing them, Professor Rogers said, includes the threat that disrupted businesses might abandon an environment that feels unsafe. New Orleans, he noted, was the banking and insurance capital of the South until the great flood of 1927.
There is evidence of what is possible. The Netherlands, one of the world's lowest-lying countries, has made storm protection a function of national security.
Following the severe flooding in 1953 that killed more than 1,800 people in the Netherlands, the Dutch strengthened their oceanfront defenses to what is known as 10,000-year protection -- something that will repel a menace that has a 0.01 percent chance of occurring in a given year. With climate change rejiggering storm calculations, there is talk of elevating that protection to the 100,000-year level.
Not that the Dutch system has an unblemished record of success. Environmental experts point out that by the 1970s, the large-scale building projects had caused environmental damage.
More recent efforts to harmonize the defenses with nature leave enormous gates open to allow water to flow. The gates can be shut in the face of a storm.
In New Orleans, the Army Corps of Engineers erected 100-year protection after Hurricane Katrina. Already, most experts feel it is inadequate; efforts are under way to imagine a 500-year defense system, though such an undertaking remains years away.
While New York building codes generally set standards to account for 100-year protection, Professor Rogers said he believed that the city should consider nothing less than 500-year protection.
Few Simple Solutions
Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent urban research group, said the region should consider measures like storm barriers and sea gates, as well as better ways to seal transit stations, tunnels and utility plants against water.
Power companies, he said, need to rethink continually putting wires back on telephone poles -- when winds knock them down -- rather than burying them, as costly as that can be. Robert G. Bea, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said he was unimpressed by the aggressive plans trumpeted by some politicians, including those that call for a levee around New York. Some solutions could end up causing more problems, Professor Bea said.
He said tightening and improving the current system might be more sensible than an enormous new system. ''At least with the current system, you know where it's weak,'' he said.
In New Jersey, the storm surge swamped the electric switch yards and substations of Public Service Electric and Gas. But Ralph LaRossa, the utility's president, expressed skepticism about the need for making all of its equipment stormproof.
''If we moved them back, we'd have to condemn property that people are living on,'' Mr. LaRossa said. ''Some people say, 'Why don't they raise them up?' We'll raise them up eight feet and the next storm will be nine feet.''
Mr. LaRossa, who is trained as an engineer, said he would opt to build in more redundancy, so that when one path was interrupted, electricity could be rerouted.
'A Different World'
In the days since the storm, landlords in New York City have begun to evaluate whether they should move electrical distribution systems or backup generators from basements to higher levels. One issue is that the city currently requires that fuel tanks for generators stay in basements. Nearly every building near the Hudson or East Rivers experienced flooding and power failures, though newer towers fared far better.
William Rudin of the Rudin real estate family, which owns buildings across Manhattan, said he was weighing moving generators. The Rudin data center building at 32 Avenue of the Americas, at Canal Street, has rooftop generators and has remained open.
Most new skyscrapers like 1 Bryant Park, at 42nd Street, have generators and electrical panels situated on higher floors. But because Con Ed connected 1 Bryant Park, also known as the Bank of America Tower, to a downtown substation, it is the only office building in Midtown without electricity.
Many older buildings have sump pumps to expunge intrusion from the streams beneath Manhattan. They can handle 100 to 200 gallons per minute, but not a tidal surge of tens of thousands of gallons. During the hurricane, they burned out.
Rudin Management had problems at both 80 Pine Street and 110 Wall Street. Across the street at the 27-story Citibank Building at 111 Wall Street, water climbed to the second floor. The pumps, backup generators and electrical panels on the ground floor or basement were rendered useless.
''Our buildings downtown were all built in the late '50s and early '60s, when 11 feet was the surge level, not 13 or 14 feet,'' Mr. Rudin said. ''We're living in a different world.''
Some downtown building owners privately expressed fears that in places like Lower Manhattan -- which has blossomed over the past decade and where the World Trade Center site is being rebuilt -- insurance rates will climb and bankers will impose more stringent requirements for construction loans.
In the most flood-prone areas, the question is what should and should not be rebuilt. In recent years, the Bloomberg administration has aggressively promoted waterfront development.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said: ''We shouldn't stop building on the waterfront. People want to live on the waterfront.''
When Hurricane Sandy made landfall, Vishaan Chakrabarti, a former city planner who is director of the Real Estate Development Program at Columbia University, was in Rotterdam, where sea gates protect the port. ''I don't think the question is whether we should develop the waterfront,'' he said. ''That ship has sailed. To me, the question is, how do we protect the harbor.''
He suggested the formation of a harbor protection commission made up of city, state and federal officials.
As he toured his state's wreckage, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, emphasized the charms of the Jersey Shore and declared that people do not ''just pick up and walk away.'' At the same time, Mr. Christie said it was up to homeowners with ruined homes, not the government, to decide whether to rebuild or sell their property to the state for conservation.
Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and president of the New Jersey Senate, said: ''We just can't rebuild it the way it was. The worst thing to do is to have this experience and not learn from it.''
While acknowledging the Jersey Shore's importance as a tourist magnet, he said rebuilding should focus mainly on full-time residents. The same mentality, he said, should apply to flood-prone areas inland near rivers, like Sayreville, in central New Jersey.
''We've spent a lot of money putting back their houses -- that's chasing good money after bad,'' said Mr. Sweeney, who toured Sayreville on Thursday. ''It was $62 million to put everybody back last year, and this year it's going to cost way more.''
Marshaling Public Will
Bold solutions wither without public will behind them. In the immediacy of a disaster, people may demand that it never be allowed to happen again. But memory recedes.
The sun is shining. The refrigerator cools. The trains are running. Aren't electric bills high enough? Don't we pay enough to ride the subway?
Virtually all of Con Edison's network in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn sits underground. John Miksad, the company's senior vice president for electric operations, said the big issue for its ratepayers was whether to invest the huge sums necessary to waterproof it.
''We're so focused on customers' bills, especially with this economy,'' Mr. Miksad said. ''To take this system to a different level of protection is not going to be a $1 million or a $100 million exercise; it's going to take billions.''
With this storm arriving so close after Tropical Storm Irene last summer, some experts said the moment might be right.
''It takes two catastrophic events of this kind within a generation to build political support to make investments of this sort,'' said Mr. Yaro, of the Regional Plan Association. ''I'm hoping that Irene was the wake-up call and Sandy is the hammer coming down.''
Mr. Yaro lives in Stamford, Conn., which was flooded during storms in 1938 and the mid-1950s. In the early 1960s, he pointed out, the city erected hurricane barriers and has not flooded since.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat who was instrumental in the rebuilding of ground zero in his district, said the public would see the virtue in long-term projects to protect itself, in much the way the country built the Interstate System and helped to develop technology for weather and other satellite systems.
Hurricane Sandy, he said, should lead to a ''massive reordering of priorities.''

HEADLINE: The Year of the MOOC

BYLINE: By LAURA PAPPANO. 
Laura Pappano is author of ''Inside School Turnarounds'' and writer in residence at the Wellesley Centers for Women.

 BODY:
IN late September, as workers applied joint compound to new office walls, hoodie-clad colleagues who had just met were working together on deadline. Film editors, code-writing interns and ''edX fellows'' -- grad students and postdocs versed in online education -- were translating videotaped lectures into MOOCs, or massive open online courses. As if anyone needed reminding, a row of aqua Post-its gave the dates the courses would ''go live.''
The paint is barely dry, yet edX, the nonprofit start-up from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has 370,000 students this fall in its first official courses. That's nothing. Coursera, founded just last January, has reached more than 1.7 million -- growing ''faster than Facebook,'' boasts Andrew Ng, on leave from Stanford to run his for-profit MOOC provider. 
''This has caught all of us by surprise,'' says David Stavens, who formed a company called Udacity with Sebastian Thrun and Michael Sokolsky after more than 150,000 signed up for Dr. Thrun's ''Introduction to Artificial Intelligence'' last fall, starting the revolution that has higher education gasping. A year ago, he marvels, ''we were three guys in Sebastian's living room and now we have 40 employees full time.''
''I like to call this the year of disruption,'' says Anant Agarwal, president of edX, ''and the year is not over yet.''
MOOCs have been around for a few years as collaborative techie learning events, but this is the year everyone wants in. Elite universities are partnering with Coursera at a furious pace. It now offers courses from 33 of the biggest names in postsecondary education, including Princeton, Brown, Columbia and Duke. In September, Google unleashed a MOOC-building online tool, and Stanford unveiled Class2Go with two courses.
Nick McKeown is teaching one of them, on computer networking, with Philip Levis (the one with a shock of magenta hair in the introductory video). Dr. McKeown sums up the energy of this grand experiment when he gushes, ''We're both very excited.'' Casually draped over auditorium seats, the professors also acknowledge that they are not exactly sure how this MOOC stuff works.
''We are just going to see how this goes over the next few weeks,'' says Dr. McKeown.
WHAT IS A MOOC ANYWAY?
Traditional online courses charge tuition, carry credit and limit enrollment to a few dozen to ensure interaction with instructors. The MOOC, on the other hand, is usually free, credit-less and, well, massive.
Because anyone with an Internet connection can enroll, faculty can't possibly respond to students individually. So the course design -- how material is presented and the interactivity -- counts for a lot. As do fellow students. Classmates may lean on one another in study groups organized in their towns, in online forums or, the prickly part, for grading work.
The evolving form knits together education, entertainment (think gaming) and social networking. Unlike its antecedent, open courseware -- usually written materials or videotapes of lectures that make you feel as if you're spying on a class from the back of the room -- the MOOC is a full course made with you in mind.
The medium is still the lecture. Thanks to Khan Academy's free archive of snappy instructional videos, MOOC makers have gotten the memo on the benefit of brevity: 8 to 12 minutes is typical. Then -- this is key -- videos pause perhaps twice for a quiz to make sure you understand the material or, in computer programming, to let you write code. Feedback is electronic. Teaching assistants may monitor discussion boards. There may be homework and a final exam.
The MOOC certainly presents challenges. Can learning be scaled up this much? Grading is imperfect, especially for nontechnical subjects. Cheating is a reality. ''We found groups of 20 people in a course submitting identical homework,'' says David Patterson, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who teaches software engineering, in a tone of disbelief at such blatant copying; Udacity and edX now offer proctored exams.
Some students are also ill prepared for the university-level work. And few stick with it. ''Signing up for a class is a lightweight process,'' says Dr. Ng. It might take just five minutes, assuming you spend two devising a stylish user name. Only 46,000 attempted the first assignment in Dr. Ng's course on machine learning last fall. In the end, he says, 13,000 completed the class and earned a certificate -- from him, not Stanford.
That's still a lot of students. The shimmery hope is that free courses can bring the best education in the world to the most remote corners of the planet, help people in their careers, and expand intellectual and personal networks. Three-quarters of those who took Dr. Patterson's ''Software as a Service'' last winter on Coursera (it's now on edX) were from outside the United States, though the opposite was true of a course on circuits and electronics piloted last spring by Dr. Agarwal. But both attracted highly educated students and both reported that over 70 percent had degrees (more than a third had graduate degrees). And in a vote of confidence in the form, students in both overwhelmingly endorsed the quality of the course: 63 percent who completed Dr. Agarwal's course as well as a similar one on campus found the MOOC better; 36 percent found it comparable; 1 percent, worse.
Ray Schroeder, director of the Center for Online Learning, Research and Service at the University of Illinois, Springfield, says three things matter most in online learning: quality of material covered, engagement of the teacher and interaction among students. The first doesn't seem to be an issue -- most professors come from elite campuses, and so far most MOOCs are in technical subjects like computer science and math, with straightforward content. But providing instructor connection and feedback, including student interactions, is trickier.
''What's frustrating in a MOOC is the instructor is not as available because there are tens of thousands of others in the class,'' Dr. Schroeder says. How do you make the massive feel intimate?
That's what everyone is trying to figure out.
Many places offer MOOCs, and more will. But Coursera, Udacity and edX are defining the form as they develop their brands.
THE FLAVOR OF THE MOOC
Coursera casts itself as a ''hub'' -- Dr. Ng's word -- for learning and networking. The learning comes gratis from an impressive roster of elites offering a wide range of courses, from computer science to philosophy to medicine. Not all are highbrow or technical; ''Listening to World Music'' from the University of Pennsylvania aims to broaden your iPod playlist.
While Coursera will make suggestions, Dr. Ng says, ''ultimately all pedagogical decisions are made by the universities.'' Most offerings are adapted from existing courses: a Princeton Coursera course is a Princeton course. But the vibe is decidedly Facebook -- build a profile, upload your photo -- with tools for students to plan ''meet-ups'' with Courserians in about 1,400 cities worldwide. These gatherings may be bona fide study groups or social sessions. Membership may be many or sparse.
No one showed at the meet-up that Stacey Brown, an information technology manager at a Hartford insurance company, scheduled for a 14th-floor conference room on a Thursday after work, despite R.S.V.P.'s from a few classmates in the area. He's taking three Coursera MOOCs, including ''Gamification'' from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School. In addition to the learning -- and dropping to bosses that he's taking a Wharton course -- Mr. Brown says, ''I hope to get a network.''
Others like the discipline a group offers. Kimberly Spillman, a software engineer, started taking seven MOOCs and completed three. ''The ones I have study groups with people, those are the ones I finish,'' Ms. Spillman says. She first joined a group for Dr. Thrun's artificial intelligence course, and then ran one for a Udacity course on building a search engine, organizing Thursday-evening discussions of the week's material followed by a social hour at a nearby pub. Fifteen people met each week at the Ansir Innovation Center, a community space with big tables and comfortable chairs, in the Kearny Mesa neighborhood of San Diego.
Udacity has stuck close to its math and computer science roots and emphasizes applied learning, like ''How to Build a Blog'' or ''Building a Web Browser.'' Job placement is part of the Udacity package. ''The type of skills taught in computer science, even at elite universities, can be very theoretical,'' Dr. Stavens explains.
Udacity courses are designed and produced in-house or with companies like Google and Microsoft. In a poke at its university-based competition, Dr. Stavens says they pick instructors not because of their academic research, as universities do, but because of how they teach. ''We reject about 98 percent of faculty who want to teach with us,'' he says. ''Just because a person is the world's most famous economist doesn't mean they are the best person to teach the subject.'' Dr. Stavens sees a day when MOOCs will disrupt how faculty are attracted, trained and paid, with the most popular ''compensated like a TV actor or a movie actor.'' He adds that ''students will want to learn from whoever is the best teacher.''
That means you don't need a Ph.D. While there are traditional academics like David Evans of the University of Virginia, ''Landmarks in Physics,'' a first-year college-level course, is taught by Andy Brown, a 2009 M.I.T. graduate with a B.S. in physics. ''We think the future of education is guys like Andy Brown who produce the most fun,'' Dr. Stavens says. Mr. Brown's course is an indie version of ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' -- filmed in Italy, the Netherlands and England, with opening credits for ''director of photography'' and ''second camera and editor.''
Whether explaining what the ancients believed about the shape of the earth or, in Dr. Thrun's statistics course, why you are unpopular, statistically speaking, voice-overs are as nonthreatening as a grade school teacher.
''You feel like you are sitting next to someone and they are tutoring you,'' says Jacqueline Spiegel, a mother of three from New Rochelle, N.Y., with a master's in computer science from Columbia who has enrolled in MOOCs from Udacity and Coursera. While taking ''Artificial Intelligence,'' she discovered she liked puzzling through assignments in online study groups.
The class was tough and took ''an embarrassing amount of time,'' says Ms. Spiegel, who found that consuming lectures by smartphone during her 14-year-old's 6 a.m. ice skating sessions worked less well than being parked at a desktop. ''I would listen to the lectures, then I would listen to them again.'' Her effort was huge -- some 22 hours a week -- but rewarding. Ms. Spiegel befriended women in India and Pakistan through Facebook study groups and started an online group, CompScisters, for women taking science and technology MOOCs.
If Udacity favors stylish hands-on instruction, edX aims to be elite, smart and rigorous; don't expect a gloss of calculus if you need it but never took it. Some 120 institutions have been in touch; only Berkeley and the University of Texas system have been admitted to the club.
EdX's M.I.T. roots show in its staff's geeky passion for building and testing online tools. They collect your clicks. Feedback from the MOOC taught last spring by Dr. Agarwal (who, students learn, is obsessed with chain saws) revealed that participants would rather watch a hand writing an equation or sentence on paper than stare at the same paper with writing already on it.
The focus is on making education logical. ''Someone who is consuming the course should know it is not serendipity that the course is chunked in a certain way, but that there is intentionality to sequencing video,'' says Howard A. Lurie, vice president for content development.
With mini-notebook in hand, he has been leading the ''daily stand-up'' meeting (so called because attendees lean against walls) to keep course development on schedule. After one meeting, Lyla Fischer, a 2011 M.I.T. graduate and edX fellow, sat at her computer, a tag still dangling from the chair, and edited the answers for problem sets in Dr. Agarwal's course. Last spring, students could download PDFs with brief answers. Now, she says, ''there is a full explanation of how to do it, here are the steps,'' right on the site.
''We are trying to use the magic of all the tool sets we have,'' Mr. Lurie says. Students control how fast they watch lectures. Some like to go at nearly double the speed; others want to slow down and replay. Coming: If you get a wrong answer, the software figures out where you went wrong and offers a correction.
WORKING OUT THE KINKS
Assignments that can't be scored by an automated grader are pushing MOOC providers to get creative, especially in courses that involve writing and analysis. Coursera uses peer grading: submit an assignment and five people grade it; in turn, you grade five assignments.
But what if someone is a horrible grader?
Coursera is developing software that will flag those who assign very inaccurate grades and give their assessment less weight. Mitchell Duneier, a Princeton professor, is conducting a study that compares peer grading of the final exam in his sociology MOOC on Coursera last summer with the grades he and his course assistants would have given the students.
Mr. Brown, the Hartford I.T. manager, does not have confidence in peer feedback. ''This could be a 14-year-old kid in South Africa answering me,'' he says, thinking of his 14-year-old. The challenge is not just in grading. The diversity of MOOC takers -- teenagers to retirees, and from across the globe -- means classmates lack a common knowledge base and educational background. Out-of-their-league students, especially in highly technical courses, can drag down discussions.
Which course is right for you? What prerequisites are really needed to perform well? Princeton's ''Networks: Friends, Money and Bytes'' on Coursera recommends basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus but the ''instructor will see if part of the course material can be presented without requiring this mathematical background.'' ''Introduction to Computer Science'' from Harvard lists prerequisites as ''none'' -- as long as you're Harvard-ready. Where are the Yelp reviews?
''We desperately need crowdsourcing,'' says Cathy N. Davidson, a Duke professor of English and interdisciplinary studies. ''We need a MOOCE -- massive open online course evaluation.''
Most important, what do you get for your effort? Do you earn a certificate? A job interview? Or just the happy feeling of learning something?
''If one is going for the knowledge, it's a boon,'' says Dr. Schroeder of the University of Illinois. ''If one is looking for credit, that is one of the challenges. How do we fit this into the structure of higher education today?''
Dr. Agarwal predicts that ''a year from now, campuses will give credit for people with edX certificates.'' He expects students will one day arrive on campus with MOOC credits the way they do now with Advanced Placement.
The line between online and on campus is already blurring. This spring Dr. Davidson will teach a class called ''Surprise Endings: Social Science and Literature'' at Duke and as a MOOC, with her Duke students running the online discussions. This fall, San Jose State students are taking Dr. Agarwal's course on circuits and electronics, with professors and teaching assistants on campus leading discussions. They add their own content, including exams. In the spring, Massachusetts Bay Community College in Wellesley will use an edX MOOC in introductory computer science.
Dr. Stavens promises more change, and more disruption: ''We are only 5 to 10 percent of the way there.''

HEADLINE: Empire of the In-Between

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON

 BODY:
As anyone who rides Amtrak between New York and Washington knows, the trip can be a dissonant experience. Inside the train, it's all tidy and digital, everybody absorbed in laptops and iPhones, while outside the windows an entirely different world glides by. Traveling south is like moving through a curated exhibit of urban and industrial decay. There's Newark and Trenton and the heroic wreckage in parts of Philadelphia, block after block of hulking edifices covered in graffiti, the boarded-up ghost neighborhoods of Baltimore made familiar by ''The Wire'' -- all on the line that connects America's financial center and its booming capital city. 
The weirdness of this juxtaposition is hardly acknowledged anymore, because we've all had a few decades to get used to it. But for most of the 180 or so years of the train line's existence, the endpoints of this journey -- New York and D.C. -- were subordinate to the roaring engines of productivity in between. The real value in America was created in Newark's machine shops and tanneries, Trenton's rubber and metal plants, Chester's shipyard, Baltimore's steel mills. That's where raw material was turned into valued products by hard-working people who made decent wages even if they didn't have a lot of education. Generation after generation, and wave after wave of immigrants, found opportunity along the corridor. Washington collected the taxes and made the rules. Wall Street got a small commission for turning the nation's savings into industrial investment. But nobody would have ever confused either as America's driving force.
This model was flipped inside out as Wall Street and D.C. became central drivers, not secondary supports, of the nation's economy. Now, on its route between them, the train passes directly through or near 8 of the 10 richest counties in the United States, but all of this wealth is concentrated near the endpointsof the journey: Manhattan's satellites in northern New Jersey and the towns where lobbyists and government contractors live in suburban Virginia and Maryland. This is a geographic representation of a telling contradiction. For the past 30-plus years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, there has been much lip service paid to the idea that the era of big government is over. Long live free enterprise. And yet in the case of those areas surrounding the capital, wealth has gravitated to the exact spot where government regulation is created. Why? Because many businesses discovered that renegotiating the terms between government and the private sector can be extraordinarily lucrative. A few remarkable books by professors at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business argue that a primary source of profit for Wall Street over the past 15 to 20 years could be what I call the Acela Strategy: making money by exploiting regulation rather than by creating more effective ways to finance the rest of the economy.
But how do we make sense of what has become of the in-between? That was the challenge we posed to the South African photojournalist Pieter Hugo. This fall, Hugo spent two weeks documenting life along the corridor, focusing his gaze on what can be found roughly within sight of the train tracks. That was our animating idea and organizing principle: to stop and look carefully at what can be glimpsed only fleetingly from a passing train.
Though industrial decline can have a perversely romantic appeal, we weren't especially interested in rehashing the sad state of old factories. Instead, Hugo sought out the everyday life that dwells in these fissures of the American economy: the retired factory worker still making his home in a neighborhood that has decayed around him, the kids playing on blown-out streets, the store that sells used tools.
This is an economy changing too fast for the residents to keep up. For many who live along the corridor, the central theme is the decline that's all too visible. The old brick factory buildings with huge windows that gave workers light and air in a pre-air-conditioned world are boarded up, crumbling or, in a few of the luckier spots, being converted into condos. There's also another, somewhat more hopeful story on display, though you have to look a little harder to see it. These are the decidedly unromantic houses of modern production: short, vast complexes, built without any nod to aesthetics. There are few windows in these buildings, because precision machinery operates best without the fluctuations in heat and humidity caused by exposure to the sun. They are one story high, because it's too costly to build a second or third floor capable of withstanding the weight and pounding of massive machinery. There are some workers inside -- there to make sure the machines keep running -- but not many. These jobs, which go to people with advanced, post-high-school training, typically offer a good-enough wage to afford a house in the suburbs, far from the industrial zones that hug the rail line. The people who do make their lives right next to these factories -- in Elizabeth, N.J., or Chester, Pa., say -- generally can't afford the technical schooling that would qualify them for jobs inside.
The atrophying of the country's ability to ''make real things'' has been much lamented, but the truth is that U.S. manufacturing has never been stronger. While there are no universally accepted numbers, the United Nations Statistics Division calculates that the dollar value of goods made in America is at an all-time high of $1.9 trillion, just about even with China. The catch is that the number of American workers needed to create all thatvalue has dropped steadily. In the mid-1940s, more than half of the New Jersey work force was in factories; today around 7 percent do. Thereare the same number of manufacturing jobs nationwide as there were in 1941, when the country was just more than one-third its current population. For much of the 20th century -- and especially in the boom decades of the '50s and '60s, when U.S. factories had little global competition -- manufacturing provided something that simply doesn't exist anymore: a job for anyone willing to put in a hard day's work. The Boeing plant making Chinook helicopters outside Philly, the Johnson & Johnson campus in New Brunswick, N.J., the Merck plants in Rahway, N.J., and Fort Washington, Pa., and the acres of chemical and natural gas refineries throughout New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- they all tell the same story: a handful of highly trained workers guiding machines that return huge value to shareholders while all the time finding ways to produce more goods with fewer workers.
That doesn't stop both presidential candidates from constantly invoking the magnificent working-class economy we once had and can have again, if only we give them our vote. Manufacturing nostalgia is as powerful as ever. But one more look out the Amtrak window reveals something else: the shiny new buildings that are actually filled with workers have nothing to do with manufacturing. They're in the broad service sector, in the anonymous office centers that bloomed out of nowhere -- near Metropark Station in New Jersey and in Claymont, Del., and Aberdeen, Md. -- to hold law firms and engineering companies and I.T. firms. For people with advanced training, the service sector means an above-average wage, a below-average risk of unemployment and days sitting at a desk. For those with only a high-school degree or no degree at all, far fewer jobs are available, and the ones that are pay poorly and disappear quickly. Calling for a return to the days when everybody who was willing to put in a hard day's work could make a good living at the factory is a fantasy, maybe a lie and certainly an implicit acknowledgment that nobody has any idea what to do with the underemployed in the slums of Trenton, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Southeast D.C. It's safer to talk about Pakistan.
The contradictions along the line converge near the center, in the city that is arguably the most representative of our new and confusing economy. Wilmington, Del., has become wildly successful as the place where Wall Street and D.C. meet. In 1981, Gov. Pierre S. du Pont, who got to office, in part, because of his family's old-economy wealth, pushed through the Financial Center Development Act, which led to the state's new economic engine: regulatory arbitrage. For large financial firms, the state offers uniquely compliant rules (European politicians and economists talk, with horror, of the Delaware effect, which will inevitably lead toward ever-looser regulation). The state's Web site claims that 63 percent of Fortune 500 companies and half of all publicly traded companies are legally incorporated in Delaware -- ''because we provide a complete package of incorporation services including modern and flexible corporate laws . . . [and] a business-friendly state government'' -- and yet only two have their headquarters there: DuPont and, notably, Sallie Mae, technically a private firm but one that owes its existence and profit to government guarantees. The rest of the buildings house tens of thousands of highly paid lawyers, accountants and other specialists engaged in the arcane work of taking advantage of flexible, business-friendly corporate laws.
After all those workers return to the wealthy suburbs at the end of the day, what's left behind is one of the most dangerous cities in America, its unemployment stuck stubbornly two points above the national average. For those who live there, the future is grim. As the C.E.O. of the global outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas, John Challenger, who might as well have been speaking at any point in the past 30 years, said the week before last that the recent announcement of 1,500 layoffs ''may be a harbinger of things to come.''

HEADLINE: A Gay Voice, on the Edge of History

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
THE event held late last month in the penthouse of the lawyers Barry Skovgaard and Marc Wolinsky had all the trappings of a top-flight fund-raiser, with five-star finger foods, four-finger cocktails and three-term senators, as Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, spoke -- and everyone else listened. Even the address, 252 Seventh Avenue, had a patina of glamour, being the building where Katie Holmes holed up after dumping Tom Cruise.
The only thing missing that evening was the guest of honor, another woman locked in a battle with a powerful man: Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic congresswoman who is running neck and neck with the longtime Republican lion Tommy Thompson for a United States Senate seat in Wisconsin. Scheduled to speak, Ms. Baldwin (who, like the hosts and many of the people in that room, is openly gay) was instead back home to respond to a sharp-elbowed new ad from Mr. Thompson, something that demanded the candidate's presence in Wisconsin, and not amid fawning followers in a Chelsea loft. 
And it is that just that balancing act -- being a loyal, hard-working representative of her home state and an emerging national figure in the gay community -- that has Ms. Baldwin, 50, on the edge of making history, and her supporters, including some of nation's most important gay donors, on the edge of their seats.
Though a victory by Ms. Baldwin on Tuesday would represent the election of the first openly gay or lesbian person to the Senate, gay groups have been surprisingly low-key about their public support. Fund-raisers have largely been intimate affairs at people's homes; no giant fund-raising galas in gay enclaves like West Hollywood or the Castro in San Francisco. There have been no celebrity onslaughts like those unleashed in the federal court fight against Proposition 8 (California's same-sex marriage ban).
And while outside money from everywhere has been gushing in, a mere trickle of staff members from gay groups are showing up in the election's final days. Even a round of reporting phone calls to some of the country's biggest gay groups and activists, most of whom are typically eager to talk about their political support for issues and candidates, were initially greeted with requests to go off the record or speak on background.
Gay rights groups, particularly those based outside Wisconsin, seemed to have been careful not to look too involved, concerned that the appearance of outside influence on Lombardi-land politics might be used against Ms. Baldwin, particularly at the last minute.
Being out, it would seem, is not a problem. But being from outside Wisconsin could be. Such fears aren't unfounded: candidates in a few other races have seen recent attacks suggesting that national gay groups are trying to push a ''radical agenda,'' though the Wisconsin race, to date, has been largely focused on the economy.
Not that any Congressional race is really local anymore. Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest civil rights organization devoted to gay and lesbian issues and a backer of Ms. Baldwin, said that both she and Mr. Thompson have big-time financial supporters all over the country. But he said the race was not about national issues, per se. ''She is the candidate that has captivated the folks in that state,'' he said.
The president and chief executive of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Institute, Chuck Wolfe, agreed, adding that the 2010 Citizens United case had effectively ''nationalized'' Senate races. In Wisconsin, he said his group (a nonpartisan organization that works to get gay candidates elected) had raised and spent ''seven figures'' helping Ms. Baldwin, more than it had ever spent ''on any other race.''
Then, a moment later, he joked, ''Mind you, those lines will probably appear in a tweet now.''
Mr. Wolfe noted that Mr. Thompson, a former governor, has received far more support from deep-pocket conservative groups like Karl Rove's Crossroads, based in Washington, which paid for a recent ad proclaiming ''Tommy Thompson governs the Wisconsin way.'' And indeed, giving by nongay groups, on both sides, has dwarfed money raised by groups like the Victory Fund.
For instance, Emily's List, a group that supports Democratic women who favor abortion rights, has raised $4.5 million on Ms. Baldwin's behalf.
John Kraus, a Baldwin spokesman, didn't directly answer questions about her out-of-state support from gay groups and others, but noted that 95 percent of their individual contributions had been $200 or less.
Kate Kendell, the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, said that she had heard of gay donors across the country giving generously to Ms. Baldwin but that much support was coming from the middle of the country.
''It used to be that if a gay politician wanted to get elected, they had to go to the coasts to find money to support their candidacy,'' Ms. Kendell said. ''I don't think that's true any longer.''
Sarah Schmidt, the group's chairwoman and treasurer of LPAC, a new lesbian political action committee, said she thought that Wisconsin's seeming nonchalance about Ms. Baldwin's sexuality ''is another milestone.'' Ms. Baldwin is open about her sexuality at home or on the road, where she has proved to be a popular draw. In April, for example, she was featured at the Victory Fund's National Champagne Brunch, a $150-a-seat fete held at the Washington Hilton, and at a similar Victory Fund event in Houston in March.
Fund-raising for her campaign began even earlier than that, including a cocktail reception in February held at the SoHo home of Sean Eldridge, an investor and activist, and his husband, Chris Hughes, a founder of Facebook, which drew a wide array of gay movers and shakers, including Christine C. Quinn, the openly gay City&#x003C;/b> &#x003C;b>Council&#x003C;/b> (NYC)" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/%3Cb%3Ecity%3C/b%3E_%3Cb%3Ecouncil%3C/b%3E_new_york_%3Cb%3Ecity%3C/b%3E/index.html?inline1=nyt-org">City Council speaker, who spoke at the event.
Big East Coast fund-raisers are a staple for most candidates, including President Obama and Mitt Romney, but Ms. Baldwin's visits have tended to be smaller affairs, including another recent New York City event (for about 25 people) at the West Village home of Lela Goren, who works in real estate development and investment.
Brian Ellner, who helped lead the charge to get same-sex marriage legalized in New York and who was at the Seventh Avenue event, said that Ms. Baldwin's campaign was ''enormously important in real terms and symbolic terms,'' for the nation's most important gay rights donors.
''I think most people have been all in,'' Mr. Ellner said.
That said, gay rights backers are also finding their pocketbooks pulled by the presidential races and three state ballot measures that would legalize same-sex marriage. So much of the grunt work has been handled by Wisconsin-based grassroots groups like Fair Wisconsin, which has been mobilizing voters on campus and online. Some out-of-state volunteers have come to help, with a handful of Victory Fund staff members, but they say their numbers are small.
Richard Socarides, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, said that Ms. Baldwin had a ''dignified, humble Midwestern approach.''
And again, he emphasized, her potential election had nothing to do with her being gay.
''Her sexual orientation is really not relevant to why she would make a great U.S. senator,'' he said in an e-mail. ''But to us it makes all the difference in the world because she is one of us.''

HEADLINE: A Time for Choosing

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
OVER the 40 years preceding Barack Obama's first term in office, under Republican and Democratic presidents alike, the federal government claimed, on average, about 18 percent of America's gross domestic product in taxes every year and spent slightly under 21 percent.
This equilibrium was always going to be threatened by the retirement of the baby boomers. But the financial crash and the Great Recession upset it sooner than anyone expected. As the economy cratered, so did tax revenue, dropping below 15 percent of G.D.P. in 2009. Government spending, meanwhile, climbed to 25 percent of G.D.P., as the president's stimulus bill tried to help fill the gap left by the private sector's collapse. 
This gulf between taxes and spending has closed, somewhat, in the three years since, thanks to the limping recovery and some halting attempts at deficit reduction in Washington. But a new equilibrium will take many more years of growth and many more painful policy decisions to achieve.
The choice voters face on Tuesday will not determine exactly where this new equilibrium ends up. An Obama second term and a Romney first term would both feature a certain amount of can-kicking and a certain amount of compromise. A President Obama would probably accede to further spending cuts; a President Romney would likely accept the need for slightly higher tax revenue. Both men would continue to run large deficits as long as the recovery seemed weak.
But this year's choice will make a long-term difference nonetheless. A vote for President Obama is a vote for a future where spending stabilizes well above its 40-year average, and where tax revenue gradually rises -- thanks to the leverage afforded the president by the expiration of the Bush tax cuts -- to pay for Social Security, Medicare, the president' health care law and more.
A vote for Romney, on the other hand, is a vote for a future in which we at least try to make the fiscal adjustments necessary to keep taxing and spending at roughly the same rate as under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
As I've written before, there are good reasons that a nonideological voter might be undecided between these two futures. The conservative vision requires making structural changes to popular programs, and asking the middle class to accept further creative destruction in an age of insecurity. The last 50 years of Western European life, meanwhile, suggest that the higher-tax, higher-spending equilibrium favored by liberals can be comfortable rather than dystopian.
But there's a strong rebuttal to the case for accepting a bigger-government new normal.
The European model of social democracy has its virtues, but it has always depended on the wealth created by American laissez-faire. As a recent economic paper entitled ''Can't We All Be More Like Scandinavians?'' points out, it's easier for smaller countries to afford a more ''cuddly'' form of capitalism if big countries like the United States are driving global economic growth. And the price of a permanently larger government -- in growth lost, private-sector jobs left uncreated, breakthroughs forgone -- is much higher for a country of our size and influence than it is for a Sweden or a France.
What's more, we would be paying this increased price at a very different demographic and economic moment than when the European welfare states were built, or for that matter when our own entitlement system was established.
It's one thing for a young, fast-growing nation -- like the America of the 1960s -- to embrace a permanently larger public sector. It's quite another for a graying society with a stagnant economy and a sinking birthrate to do the same. There's a risk of a vicious cycle, in which a shrinking working-age population bears the burden of growing old-age entitlements, which in turn discourages precisely the kind of risk-taking and family formation required to keep the system solvent.
Already our government redistributes too much from the young to the old, from working families to retirees, from productive entrepreneurs to protected clients. To accede to this government's permanent expansion is to walk, with eyes wide open, into the kind of economic and demographic trap that has ensnared the weaker economies of Europe today.
President Obama did not single-handedly put us on this path. But he has kept us on it, accelerated our progress down it, and campaigned for re-election as though taking this course had no downsides whatsoever. He's the candidate of the Medicare status quo in a country facing an entitlement crunch, of government bailouts in an economy with a crony capitalism problem, and of contraceptive mandates in a society with a birth dearth.
For an incumbent president facing a mistrusted opposition party, this may prove a formula for a narrow electoral victory. But for the country that might vote to re-elect him, it risks four more years of drift, stagnation and decline.

HEADLINE: I Didn't Write That

BYLINE: By DAVID KAISER. 
A professor of the history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
THERE must be an election coming up. I know this because of the number of times I have been getting a certain e-mail, one that begins, ''Take the three minutes to read this. Maybe he is wrong, but what if he's right?'' I first received the e-mail -- which includes an essay railing against President Obama and the Federal Reserve -- back in March 2009, just weeks after the president's inauguration. Since then, 267 people have e-mailed me about it; about two dozen more have called my office to talk about it. A vast majority of them agree with the essay's sentiments and want to compliment me for my work. 
The essay, which has been promoted on blogs across the Internet, is attributed to a person named David Kaiser. As it happens, my name is David Kaiser. We are not the same person. In fact, the e-mail states clearly that it was written by a historian and ''professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the United States Naval War College.'' Some versions included a photo of this David Kaiser, taken from his Wikipedia entry. I teach physics and the history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and my Web site includes a photograph of myself right next to my e-mail address. We look nothing alike.
The essay includes a short curriculum vitae for the professor (now retired from the Naval War College), the names of several of his books and his prior teaching appointments. Each of those items is true, except for one detail: that David Kaiser did not write it, either.
After the false attribution, the essay launches into a tirade against the president that culminates in a comparison between him and Adolf Hitler. There are elementary flaws throughout -- Winston Churchill never served in the British House of Lords, for one -- piled on top of outlandish claims like the one that Mr. Obama promised to ''create and fund a mandatory civilian defense force stronger than our military for use inside our borders.'' In between are sneering gibes at religious minorities, schoolteachers and supporters of same-sex marriage.
The rate at which the essay lands in my in-box follows the political news cycle. About one e-mail arrived each day during April and May 2009, when the stimulus plan and the auto-industry bailout were in the headlines. Then the traffic fell by half until the pitched battles over the Affordable Care Act: I received about twice as many e-mails about the essay during September 2009 as I did at the peak period of the previous spring. Again there followed a brief quiescence until the Congressional election of 2010. After each of those spikes, I foolishly thought that the episode had run its course. But no: with each new round of partisan finger-pointing in Washington, my in-box would fill up again.
One concerned citizen wrote to me: ''I just got an e-mail that I believe you authored and I agree with every word. Now, what do we do to stop this?'' Another wrote, ''All I can say is keep up the good work until the 'brown shirts' come along with a wide sweeping 'Fairness doctrine' to shut you down.'' A year later one satisfied reader greeted me, ''Hello, 'soul mate'!'' This past July someone e-mailed to thank me for the essay, adding: ''It is time for people to speek [sic] out and voice their thoughts and findings on Obama. Facts are facts.'' Several correspondents have requested permission to reprint ''my'' essay in their local newspaper. Others clearly have had tastes that run beyond the mainstream media, like the reader who opined, ''this country has been under the control of satanic, antichrist powers -- not government.''
I first wrote to the other David Kaiser about the essay at the end of March 2009. He confirmed that he had not written it, either, that it absolutely did not represent his views, and that he was also being inundated. Neither of us had any idea how to get our names off it.
By the first week of April 2009, fact-checking Web sites like snopes.com had declared the essay's attributed authorship to be bogus. According to Snopes, the real provenance of the essay was an anonymous comment on a blog. By that time, I had received precisely 11 e-mails about it. More than 250 e-mails arrived after it had been publicly declared a hoax. And that's what troubles me. The essay falls in a beguiling category: the zombie fact, claims that are shown to be untrue but which simply will not die.
Zombie facts were hardly created by the Internet; even a brief perusal of the partisan newspapers of the 19th century will make that plain. But today's rumors have a self-perpetuating quality, which is accentuated by the erosion of trust in institutions that had once seemed authoritative. Gallup reported in September that Americans' distrust of traditional media had hit a historic high, while approval of Congress had hit an election-year low. As more people turn to blogs for news and commentary, readership separates between conservative and liberal sites, with little cross-traffic. Self-proclaimed fact-checking sites proliferate, beholden to no particular standards. An editor of one of these sites contacted me about the Obama-Hitler essay, thinking he had reached the David Kaiser of the Naval War College. That did not inspire confidence.
The legal scholar Cass R. Sunstein recently wrote in these pages that efforts to forge common understanding on politically divisive issues might be most effective if we paid attention to the sources of information and not just how the information was presented. ''Our initial convictions are more apt to be shaken if it's not easy to dismiss the source as biased, confused, self-interested or simply mistaken.'' Exactly -- which is presumably why the authorship of the e-mail hoax was faked in the first place. About a month after the first one arrived, the e-mails showed a note had been added to the opening of the essay: ''This is enlightening. Lest you think it was written by some right-wing kook, David Kaiser is a respected historian.''
As the great political theorist (and famous comedian) George Burns taught us, ''if you can fake sincerity, then you've really got it made.'' (Tellingly, versions of that quotation have been attributed to Groucho Marx, Jean Giraudoux and Daniel Schorr, among others.) Mr. Sunstein's solution might work in a world in which identities were less easily faked, forged or stolen. After three and a half years of trying to debunk it, however, the Obama-Hitler essay still haunts the Internet (and my in-box).
And yet there is a bright side. After I began receiving the e-mails, I drafted a brief form letter to send in reply, pointing out the fake authorship. Whereas many correspondents had spewed incredibly hateful slogans in their initial messages, nearly all reverted to polite civility once the error had been pointed out.
One reader had been so inspired by the essay that he took my photograph from my Web site and posted it, along with my full résumé and the text of the essay, on his own -- a conspiracy-addled ''new world order'' site that made the essay's contents seem tame. When I finally reached him by phone to ask if he might take the posting down, he agreed, and I was surprised by how quickly our conversation turned to remarkably ordinary topics. There was no more howling about government plots or millennial apocalypse; the talking points faded away. We found we were but two people caught in a misunderstanding. Despite the rancor and factual recklessness of our latest election season, there might be hope for us yet.

HEADLINE: Man Behind FEMA's Makeover Built Philosophy on Preparation and Waffle House

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- America may know W. Craig Fugate as the slightly weary-looking guy on CNN explaining the ins and outs of flood insurance. But in the world of emergency management, he is known for his Waffle House matrix.
Mr. Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, learned in his many years of battling natural disasters that fully operational Waffle Houses mean that a community is doing O.K. But if those same restaurants are serving half menus, it means that power has been lost. And if their doors are closed, it signifies that things are really bad.
''It's a shorthand for us to get in there and quickly get a snapshot,'' Mr. Fugate said Friday in an interview at FEMA headquarters in Washington. ''Is the Waffle House open? Everything normal there?''
Mr. Fugate acknowledges that the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy poses a challenge to the Waffle House matrix because the chain, popular in the South, has so few restaurants in the Northeast. In place of Waffle Houses, he said, he has looked to Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts as bellwethers, but he said he did not believe that they had the same philosophies about reopening quickly. 
''Waffle House has a very simple operational philosophy: get open. They never close. They run 24 hours a day,'' he said. ''They have a corporate philosophy that if there is a hurricane or a storm, they try and get their stores open. It don't matter if they don't have power, it don't matter if you don't have gas. They have procedures that if they can get a generator in there, they'll get going. They'll make coffee with bottled water.''
After the agency's poor handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA was the Homer Simpson of federal agencies, a symbol of pitiful incompetence. The storm even created a national punch line after President George W. Bush said at a news conference that his FEMA director, Michael D. Brown, was doing a ''heck of a job'' even as the agency was bungling its response.
While FEMA is still viewed with caution -- and in some places in New York City in the last week, with continued scorn -- Mr. Fugate has done much to shore up its image. That is in part simply through self-flagellation, as he races around storm-savaged regions, ticks off statistics about water levels and procures baby formula for a mother in need.
Mr. Fugate -- or Mr. Emergency Management, as President Obama referred to him last week -- is a straightforward, honey-toned former director of Florida emergency operations who judges the post-storm condition of communities by the viability of their local economic activity. His hyper-focus on local preparation long before disasters hit has been the key to his success, according to several people who have worked with him.
''He speaks the language of first responders because he was one of them,'' said Alan Rubin, who oversaw Florida's economic recovery after Hurricane Andrew. ''He doesn't have to be brought up to speed on what FEMA can do and when they can do it.''
In an administration long on Ivy League degrees and Washington pedigrees, Mr. Fugate, who wears cowboy boots, stands out. Both of his parents died before he graduated from high school. He never finished college, started out as a paramedic and spent most of his career in Florida.
''He is very down to earth, and that always helped him out a lot,'' said Dwayne Phillips, an information technology expert who worked at FEMA when Mr. Fugate was the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, a job he held until 2009, when Mr. Obama appointed him to run FEMA. Citing Mr. Fugate's Waffle House theory, Mr. Phillips said: ''He would talk about stuff like that, and had this 'O.K., that's a problem, let's address it and move on forward' way about him. He doesn't get caught up in the weeds.''
Mr. Fugate is known for his ''lightning bolt'' drills, in which he surprises employees midday with a fake disaster and forces them to respond. He peppers each day with a short phrase to keep responders focused. On Friday, he was pushing ''People, Power and Pumps.'' He is known in the field for positioning equipment ahead of time so that states know immediately how many cots and water bottles are needed when a disaster hits, which proved a huge problem during Hurricane Katrina.
As people in New York and New Jersey on Thursday and Friday remained without power and struggled to find fuel to fill their cars and generators, reports emerged that some were angrily denouncing FEMA as responding too slowly in the aftermath of the hurricane.
''It's part of how people cope,'' Mr. Fugate said of the anger toward FEMA. ''I don't care that they don't understand FEMA, and I'm not going to defend it and say you shouldn't be mad at us. It's a natural part of it. They get frustrated, and they are going to get angry. I need to acknowledge that, but I need to focus on what are their needs and are we taking care of their needs longer term.''
FEMA's programs, Mr. Fugate said, were really designed to deal with a disaster several days after it occurred and to provide the local authorities and first responders with capabilities and equipment that they did not have. The agency may provide financial aid, water removal specialists and advanced search and rescue teams.
''Because we always talk about FEMA so much,'' he said, ''I think the general public assumes we are part of the response team that will be there the first couple of days.''
While a vast majority of Obama appointees have drawn sharp criticism from Republicans in Congress, Mr. Fugate has managed to impress members of the committees that oversee FEMA, who say he testifies without notes and worked his way from the ground up in Florida, a state well versed in disasters.
''I would call him apolitical,'' said one aide to the House Appropriations Committee who is not permitted to speak to the news media, pointing to an absence of criticism of the agency in Alabama, a deeply conservative state, after tornadoes hit there last year. ''He can be very direct, but our members respect him, bottom line.''
Mr. Fugate, 52, got his start in emergency response as a volunteer firefighter and paramedic in Alachua County, Fla., and then made his way through the administrative ranks, becoming the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management in 2001. He has won several awards in the field and was named to the National Guard Association of Florida Hall of Fame in 2006.
At the end of the Bush administration, he was interviewed to be the head of FEMA -- the acting director, R. David Paulison, ended up getting the job -- and he said later in an interview that it was a post he would ponder with trepidation. He told a reporter, ''A lot of people are looking at what Mike Brown went through'' and believed it was ''not a good encouragement for people to put their professional careers on the line.''
Mr. Fugate has said several times that he is not satisfied with FEMA's response in New York and New Jersey and would not be until all residents had power, water and a means of transportation.
But he did allow himself a tad of self-defense last week when Mr. Brown, his predecessor, criticized the administration for predetermining states as disaster areas. ''Better to be fast than to be late,'' Mr. Fugate told an NPR reporter in an interview.
At a conference for emergency workers, Mr. Fugate said, ''If you know me, I don't sound like many people from Washington,'' and emphasized the importance of strong building codes and risk management before disasters strike. ''Mitigation of natural disasters took a back seat to the threat of another terrorist attack'' in recent years, he said.

HEADLINE: A Long-Shot Campaign Could Threaten Romney's Chances in Virginia

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
POWHATAN, Va. -- Virgil Goode has absolutely no chance of winning the presidency. But here in his home state, his quixotic quest for the White House as the Constitution Party candidate could peel votes away from Mitt Romney, and that is making some Republicans nervous.
''Why would you do this?'' Susan Ferreri, a small-business owner, asked Mr. Goode recently when he dropped by an Italian restaurant in this Richmond suburb to hand out leaflets and rustle up votes. ''I'm against Obama, and I will go with Romney, and I just really hope you don't upset it.'' 
Mr. Goode, 66, a former congressman who is a staunch opponent of immigration and is a fiscal and social conservative, politely defended himself and moved on. ''I have heard that argument before,'' he said later in his distinctive Southern drawl.
Indeed he has. In many states, Republicans have worked to suppress Mr. Goode's candidacy. He is on the ballot in 26 states and is running as a write-in candidate in an additional 14. Republicans succeeded in blocking him in Pennsylvania; Mr. Goode says that it would have cost him $100,000 to fight to have his name included and that he did not have the money.
But the efforts failed here in the swing state of Virginia, where President Obama and Mr. Romney are running neck and neck in the battle for 13 electoral votes. In the latest Fox News poll in Virginia, Mr. Goode is backed by 1 percent of likely voters.
Silver-haired and lanky, Mr. Goode has roots as a country lawyer in the bucolic southwestern town of Rocky Mount, where he is a household name and has a base of regional support.
''The problem for Romney is he is culturally so opposite from most voters in Southside Virginia that there is an area for Virgil Goode to win votes,'' said David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''In 2008, there were close to 40,000 votes cast for third-party candidates in Virginia. What if Virgil Goode took 25,000 votes? That could be a potential difference maker.''
The Romney campaign says it is not worried. ''This election is a very clear choice between two candidates,'' said Rich Beeson, Mr. Romney's political director. ''We are running a campaign that will ensure Mitt Romney wins regardless of who is in the race.''
But Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, is more cautious. ''I don't think his candidacy is helpful,'' Mr. Davis said of Mr. Goode.
To say Mr. Goode is running his campaign on a shoestring would be an understatement. He does not take money from political action committees and refuses all donations over $200. So far, he has spent about $200,000 -- including, he said, $65,000 to $70,000 of his own money.
He has been crisscrossing the country in a blue Honda Civic with 140,000 miles on it and a pile of blue and white ''Goode for President'' signs stuffed in the trunk. He keeps a shower caddy filled with toiletries on the floor near the front passenger seat. In the back seat, there is a box of Raisin Bran cereal -- ''In case I need breakfast,'' Mr. Goode said.
His sister answers the phones, and his wife, Lucy, keeps the books. He has a driver, a friend named Danny Turner. But there is no press secretary; Mr. Goode returns calls from reporters himself.
His platform is fairly simple. His jobs plan is to end all illegal immigration -- and legal immigration, too, until the American unemployment rate drops below 5 percent. He also favors ending automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants and would not allow them to attend public schools.
He also says he would ''end the stranglehold of 'super PACs' on politics,'' drastically reduce regulation on businesses and balance the budget immediately, though he does not say how. He is against abortion and same-sex marriage. If elected, Mr. Goode says, he would serve only one term.
Mr. Goode, who was elected to Congress in 1996 but lost his seat in 2008, began his career as a Democrat but infuriated the party by voting to impeach President Bill Clinton. Then he was an independent and later a Republican; in 2010, he joined the Constitution Party, which advocates a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
In 2006, he offended many of his colleagues -- and constituents -- by attacking Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Muslim elected to Congress, for taking the oath of office with his hand on a Koran. Mr. Goode's remarks helped in his losing his seat, said Mr. Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.
But here in Powhatan, Mr. Goode found at least one supporter: Rachel Bondurant, 69, who grew up near Rocky Mount. As she dug into a plate of spaghetti at the Italian restaurant, he slipped a campaign flier on the table, and soon they were talking about family connections and a new movie about moonshiners set in their home county.
''I don't like who else is running,'' she said afterward. ''I like him.''

Opened
THE BAY The veteran director Barry Levinson (''Rain Man'') tries his hand at the ''found footage'' style, with an ecological thriller from the producers of the ''Paranormal Activity'' series. With Nansi Aluka, Christopher Denham, Stephen Kunken, Frank Deal, Kether Donohue and Kristen Connolly.
BONES BRIGADE: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY From the skateboarder turned documentary filmmaker Stacy Peralta (''Dogtown and Z-Boys''), the story of how he assembled a remarkable team of skateboarders called the Bones Brigade in the early '80s.
THE DETAILS Jacob Aaron Estes's film is an existential horror story about a suburban couple (Tobey Maguire and Elizabeth Banks) whose decision to tidy up their backyard leads to grotesque complications. With Laura Linney. 
FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS In the New York City of the 1980s, a teenager tries to negotiate a difficult relationship with her mother while yearning for the Guyanese father she has not seen in 13 years. With Melinda Shankar, Aidan Quinn, Ritu Singh Pande and Jimi Mistry; Shundell Prasad wrote and directed.
FLIGHT ''Flight'' (Nov. 2) represents Robert Zemeckis's return to live-action filmmaking after eight years of experimentation with motion capture technology, beginning with ''The Polar Express'' in 2004. What he's gained from that experience is a thorough understanding of how the new digital techniques can be used to enhance a classical style, rather than displace the art and science of framing, lighting and editing with the pixelated sludge so common in contemporary Hollywood films.
Denzel Washington stars as an airline pilot who becomes a national hero when he lands a damaged plane with minimal casualties; subsequent investigation threatens to reveal the secret he's long managed to hide -- that he's a high-functioning drug and alcohol abuser. Like many of Mr. Zemeckis's films it's the story of an emotionally isolated individual who finds his way back to society, this time with the help of another addict (the British actress Kelly Reilly) and the hindrance of a group of friends and business associates who don't always have his best interests in mind, played by John Goodman, Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood. Made on a small budget and a tight schedule, the film is an intimate drama with room for two heart-stopping suspense sequences -- one involving the aircraft, the other a considerably more humble device: a hotel room refrigerator. With Melissa Leo and Nadine Velazquez.
GIRL WALK// ALL DAY Jacob Krupnick's ''feature-length music video'' features Anne Marsen as a woman who literally dances her way through New York City, inspiring others to join in.

LUV SHUV TEY CHICKEN KHURANA On the run from a London gangster, an unsuccessful immigrant returns to the Punjabi village where he was born, where he hopes to cajole his infirm grandfather into recalling the chicken recipe that once made their family restaurant famous.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE Sean Penn as a retired rock star who hasn't abandoned his goth look at the age of 50; when his estranged father dies, he sets out to honor his memory by tracking down the former S.S. officer who humiliated him in Auschwitz. Paolo Sorrentino (''Il Divo'') directed; with Frances McDormand, Judd Hirsch, Harry Dean Stanton and Heinz Lieven.
VAMPS The director Amy Heckerling reunites with Alicia Silverstone 17 years after they worked together in ''Clueless'' for a tale of vampire gal pals (Ms. Silverstone and Krysten Ritter) who consider abandoning immortality for true love. With Sigourney Weaver, Wallace Shawn, Kristen Johnston and Malcolm McDowell.
WRECK-IT RALPH John C. Reilly provides the voice of the title character, a villain in an old-school video game, who breaks into the world of a modern first-person shooter, with disastrous consequences. Rich Moore directed this animated film from Walt Disney Studios; with the voices of Alan Tudyk, Jane Lynch, Rachael Harris, Ed O'Neill and Sarah Silverman.

HEADLINE: In Ohio, a Study in Contrasts As 2 Campaigns Get Out Vote

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- Inside a peeling former nightclub here, Obama volunteers are perched on any seats they can find, trays of half-eaten sandwiches line an old mirrored bar and a hand-scrawled list of ''office needs'' includes toilet paper and Teddy Grahams.
But if this campaign office conveys a casual, ragtag feel, it belies a sprawling operation with an intricate chain of command, volunteers who have been here for years and a lexicon worthy of the military. Volunteer red, white and blue team captains bear particular duties for getting voters to the polls, not to mention ''comfort captains,'' assigned to tend to coffee, meals and sore feet.
After extensive test runs the past few weekends for this Election Day get-out-the-vote machine, an Obama staff member held one final meeting with volunteers in a back room the other night, saying, ''Next Tuesday, it's showtime!''
The Kenwood Romney Victory Center -- one of but three in this county around Cincinnati, five fewer than the Obama camp -- is 10 miles and a world away. Inside a suburban office building populated by insurance firms and walk-in medical clinics, there are no dry runs, no flowchart bureaucracy and fewer young faces; many of the 20 or so volunteers are north of middle age. 
What there is, is passion.
As a marathon campaign in Ohio nears a conclusion that its weary residents surely yearn for, the contest between President Obama and Mitt Romney has devolved into political trench warfare. It is a close-quarters fight: Mr. Obama's operation, built over four years with more than a hundred offices around Ohio and hundreds more living rooms, office basements and even garages set aside as Election Day ''staging locations,'' versus the raw anger, worry and drive of a more recent set of Romney organizers.
At age 62 still as earnest as a college student, Edward R. O'Donnell left his music production company in the hands of associates to walk neighborhoods for Mr. Romney, driven by a growing panic that government debt is dragging the nation into bankruptcy. Like many here, ''I have never been involved in an election campaign before,'' he said. But, he added, ''I committed months ago to doing anything and everything I can to try to change that direction.''
The outcome rides largely on which campaign succeeds in getting its supporters to the polls by pestering, begging, calling, offering early-voting instructions or Election Day buses and then pestering some more. It is a competition that has played out here with paid workers and volunteers in a strange universe of sleep deprivation, interminable door-to-door marches through cold rains, borrowed guest rooms and donated junk food.
In Cincinnati, the signs of the showdown are everywhere -- not just from the campaigns, but also from a vast array of groups that have descended, knocking on the doors of residents so exhausted by all the knocks that one resident warded off more by posting an announcement on her front door that she had voted early and was, thank you very much, done.
The fight is bitter, with reports of yard signs stolen, run over and even set afire, political phone calls so endless that at least one man was answering his home telephone by barking ''Romney'' rather than hello, and tales of front-door confrontations ending in curse words or worse.
''There's nothing coming in this house that has the word 'Obama' on it,'' one man told Liz Ping, an Obama volunteer, when she appeared at a doorstep. After the two disagreed over who ought to be blamed for the nation's debt, Ms. Ping, who is 61 and retired, was chased from the porch and down the driveway, she recalled.
''We're the tip of the spear,'' she said.
One rejected Romney door knocker said, ''I just tell them, 'You can run me out of here, but somebody will be back next week unless you vote.' ''
Publicly, at least, strategists on both sides here claim the edge.
The Obama campaign's extensive infrastructure is intended to include as many volunteers as possible without forcing them to drive long distances to take part, a senior campaign adviser said.
''The whole goal is to allow for everyone who wants to help us to go communicate to voters who are likely to vote for the president in every corner of the state,'' said the adviser, Aaron Pickrell. ''So that's the purpose -- it's not to have muscle and show that we have a bunch of offices.''
The Romney campaign was dismissive. ''There are places in the state where we don't have bricks and mortar,'' said Scott Jennings, a public relations executive from Louisville, Ky., who directs Romney field operations in Ohio. ''But I didn't set out to build a campaign structure that had as its core function rent payments. I don't need to pay rent to somebody to achieve my door-knocking goals.''
The President's People
The Obama campaign has been here so long that there has been time to decorate.
Offices are equipped with streamers, cheery multicolored posters, piles of charging campaign cellphones labeled ''firing up'' and even the occasional goofy riddle taped to a wall. Inside an office in Forest Park, north of Cincinnati, a ''Let's Move Corner'' provides jump ropes, Hula-Hoops and instructions for stretches (''Reach down to your grass roots'') near a well-stocked snack table that on a recent morning included enough Krispy Kreme doughnuts that Michelle Obama, had she seen them, surely would have cringed.
By now, though, no one is jumping rope. Or eating much.
Any frivolity has been eclipsed in these final hours, overtaken by exhaustion, tension and an overriding focus on meeting this operation's carefully monitored numerical goals for volunteers signed up, doors knocked on, voters met. ''Can I ask you to run a marathon for us in the last four days?'' a young staff member in jeans earnestly beseeched a white-haired volunteer as he stepped into the Forest Park office.
The essential theory in Obamaland: In a world of cellphones and caller ID, a door knock from a neighbor who can say, for instance, what high school he went to around here will be far more effective at luring a voter to the polls than a call from a stranger in some faraway state.
And so, for months, neighborhood teams have canvassed at houses they have now grown thoroughly familiar with -- and some of which can expect three more inquiries on Tuesday alone, unless and until their occupants have voted.
Before then, these visits are intended, in part, to get Obama-leaning residents with histories as inconsistent voters to form a specific plan for voting this time, whether it by pondering aloud what time of day they might go on Tuesday or by remembering to mail in the absentee ballot that records show they have requested.
''When do you want to go ahead and do it?'' Irvin Carney, a 24-year-old volunteer, asked a woman at her front door on a recent evening after she said she favored Mr. Obama. ''Want to say you'll do it early next week? Monday? How're you going to get there?''
The Obama operation established itself here by 2008, winning Ohio and, to the shock of local leaders in the county that surrounds this city, Hamilton, which had long favored Republican presidential candidates. Then it never left. At least one staff organizer stayed put, keeping a desk for a while in the cluttered county Democratic office. Some in the old network of volunteers remained too, occasionally summoned to work phone banks for Mr. Obama's health care law or efforts to oppose Ohio legislation to limit early voting.
By October 2011, some among the 2008 ''Neighborhood Team Leaders,'' top local volunteers like Michele Fisher, began holding monthly meetings for the re-election effort.
''It seemed early then, but we've been going ever since,'' said Ms. Fisher, 55, an owner of bagel shops in the area. On Election Day, she will serve as director of one of this county's scores of campaign staging locations -- the volunteered living rooms, alcoves and basements where team captains responsible for polling places (red), logistics (white) and canvassing (blue) will focus on getting people to vote.
If anything, the operation here looks similar to the one from 2008, just more established, more polished.
The technology has grown elaborate: rather than using only old-fashioned printouts of addresses and maps in manila folders, some volunteers use smartphones to be directed to homes the campaign wishes to target and then send back results of their stops electronically. Campaign officials will not say how many paid staff members have flooded into Ohio by now, though they seem to be everywhere, and volunteers in Ohio number in the thousands -- some from other states but mostly, volunteers here say, locals.
''We're kicking their tails!'' Mayor Mark L. Mallory of Cincinnati, an Obama supporter, said of the comparative ground games after emerging from a last-minute meeting with a small group of Obama volunteers. One reason for Mr. Mallory's confidence about the Obama campaign's efforts: his own father, William L. Mallory Sr., a longtime former state lawmaker, got a call the other day from the campaign, which noted, accurately, that he had not yet voted early. It urged him to do so.
Still, imperfections have emerged. Some volunteers sign up to appear for door-knocking shifts but ''flake'' when a Saturday afternoon arrives cold and wet. From time to time, the campaign has shown flashes of arrogance, at least one local Democratic leader says, not always giving enough attention to its supporters and volunteers. And some addresses on what should by now be a carefully culled list turn out not to be homes at all, like a shuttered industrial building the other night.
''I don't feel like I've been overly effective,'' Skip Tate, 50, said a little gloomily after volunteering for a long afternoon of climbing steps in a steep-hilled neighborhood. So few people answered their doors that Mr. Tate finally accosted a passer-by just to have someone -- anyone -- he could urge to vote.
The entire task of building this largely volunteer operation has changed since four years ago as the novelty of Mr. Obama's first run has faded some. Caleb Faux, the executive director of the Hamilton County Democratic Party, said he had observed an increase among black volunteers, but a drop among some white liberals who helped Mr. Obama four years ago.
Among the pack of outside groups on both sides leading their own parallel campaigns here, unions say they have seen an increase in volunteers -- passions driven more now perhaps by fury over Republican state leaders' recent efforts to reduce early voting hours and to limit collective bargaining rights. ''If Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan get elected, woe be to us!'' Robert H. Baker, a transit union leader, told a room full of union members who gulped coffee as they prepared to head out into drizzle on a recent morning to knock on labor's own list of doors.
For the Obama campaign itself, there is no shortage of volunteers now, people here insist, but the wild, rushing emotions of 2008 have been replaced for some with a sense of determination and seriousness.
''It was sort of like a giddy high school kind of thing,'' Ms. Fisher said of the first Obama election. ''You were so excited. It was just something new, that you were really going to make a change. And we did. And we're going to keep it going. But I think a lot of people this time around, they definitely still want to see him stay, but their lives are a lot different now.''
The Challenger's Effort
Mr. Romney's Kenwood Victory Center, like the five others in metropolitan Cincinnati, is the antithesis of funky, the inverse of cool.
Its phone bank workers often connect to empty houses when even advocacy groups let computers do the dialing, and find the actual humans their workers talk to. The neighborhood door-knockers record their successes and failures in pencil, when many others have long switched to smartphones tied wirelessly to databanks.
But neither advanced technology nor uber-organization nor a carpeting of campaign offices drive Mr. Romney's campaign. Rather, it is people like Henry and Donna Peters, a stream of volunteers that swelled to a flood after Mr. Romney's strong showing in last month's presidential debates.
''For a 67- and 65-year-old to get out of bed every Saturday morning -- and other mornings -- you have to feel very strongly about supporting a man who can make changes,'' Mr. Peters said.
He and Ms. Peters were driving to Blue Ash, a northeast Cincinnati suburb, to target likely Republican voters. She held a clipboard stuffed with campaign handouts and sheets of addresses to visit.
The Peterses are the ideal next-door neighbors, soft-spoken people so courteous that they assiduously avoided stepping on the lawns of the homes they visited. But they had intensity: political newcomers, they regularly trek from Kentucky, a safe Romney state, in hopes of tipping Ohio into the Republican column. And they are not alone.
''We focus on quality, not quantity,'' said Alex Triantafilou, the Hamilton County Republican chairman.
Mr. Triantafilou and campaign officials insist that Mr. Romney has overcome Republicans' early ambivalence to become his party's favorite, not just its nominee. ''No one I'm talking to is complaining we've got the wrong guy,'' he said.
Maybe. In talks with grass-roots conservatives, Mr. Romney seems considerably less beloved than his opponent is despised. It is too late for conservatives to find a perfect candidate, George Brunemann, who is head of the Cincinnati Tea Party, said over a recent coffee. But ''Obama can get people as different as white supremacists and Black Panthers to walk in the same direction,'' he added.
At Kenwood this particular Friday, a wall of sign-up sheets held names of nearly 300 volunteers, local residents and loyalists from afar. Lloyd Kelley, a 72-year-old retired administrative law judge, came to Kenwood from St. Louis, on the heels of workers from California and Tennessee and Louisiana. At the Westwood center in western Cincinnati, Nancy Pennell, a stay-at-home mother from Greenville, S.C., who came on impulse, was knocking on doors with volunteers from Kentucky and California.
And there are flashes of over-the-top ardor, the sort suggesting that a campaign feels it is gaining the edge.
At a long table, Luke and Moriah Swanger, ages 10 and 11, worked the phones after finishing their home-schooling. ''They don't like what's going on with the economy,'' said their father, Kraig, ''and I said, 'If you don't like it, then do something about it.' ''
Mr. Triantafilou said he had seen internal surveys that give Mr. Romney's supporters a wide edge in enthusiasm over Mr. Obama's. ''We didn't have it in '08. We didn't have it in '06; we got creamed,'' he said. ''But we've got it back.''
For both the Romney and Obama campaigns, this is the culmination of a long winnowing of the voter rolls, a political gold-panning of Hamilton County's 800,000 residents and 347,000 households that washes away the unconvertible until only the nuggets -- the persuadable and the committed -- remain.
Here, the harvest of new information from data-mining, polls, focus groups and telephone and door-to-door surveys culls those households where an appeal for support would be wasted.
''The point is to try to build yourself a get-out-the-vote list in which, if everyone on the list voted, you'd win the election,'' said Mr. Jennings, the Ohio field operations director.
Now, with the end in sight, the time for persuasion has passed. The volunteers' single goal is to ensure that every known Romney supporter votes.
Most join an army of foot soldiers who have slogged the northeast suburbs since early summer. By last Wednesday, the campaign had knocked on doors 151,887 times in Hamilton County -- an imposing figure, but deceptive, as many knocks went unanswered and many households were covered more than once.
Thousands more were to be blitzed before Election Day.
''This is the first time in many cycles that the Republican presidential campaign has emphasized door-knocking over phone banks,'' Mr. Jennings said. Across Ohio, he said, Mr. Romney's campaign is knocking on 19 times as many doors as Senator John McCain's campaign did four years ago.
In large part, of course, that is because Mr. McCain's Ohio campaign was starved for money. But it also reflects reality: land lines are being replaced by cellphones that canvassers cannot reach, and those landlines that remain are so overwhelmed that owners have become deadened to appeals.
''Look, everybody in Ohio with a phone and a pair of scissors is going to figure it out sooner or later,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''They're being bombarded. Everyone in Ohio has a robo-dialer.''
Indeed, as of six days before the election, Mr. Romney's telephone banks had made 397,741 calls in Hamilton County alone, albeit far fewer were successfully completed.
Consider a recent evening at the Kenwood center, where Mr. Kelley punched buttons on a telephone linked to a computer database of numbers of likely Republican voters.
''Is this Mr. Weaver?'' he asked.
The person on the other end immediately hung up.
The second call went better: ''I'm calling to remind you and your husband to vote in this election,'' Mr. Kelley said, then exclaimed ''Great!'' when his target pledged to back Mr. Romney.
The third call reached an answering machine. Nobody answered the fourth. The fifth, sixth and seventh reached more answering machines.
''This is the fifth phone bank I've worked on,'' he said later. ''I'd say that out of 10 people, on average, four aren't at home, one is undecided, three are Romney and one's Obama.''
The Targets
It is the most expensive and technically sophisticated campaign in American history. But in the end, after months of work, after hundreds of hours of commercials and hundreds of thousands of front-porch visits and millions of telephone calls -- after focus groups, fliers, yard signs and rallies -- Shelley and Dennis Russell are unmoved.
Days before the polls open they are still undecideds, targets in the cross hairs of a yearlong political cannonade who somehow, miraculously have yet to be persuaded by either side.
Yet on closer inspection, it is no miracle. To the contrary, they personify the angst that defines the dying days of this especially bitter contest, an emotion that the campaigns have longed to capitalize on, but have never captured.
The Russells live with their three children in a white clapboard house in Blue Ash, in middle-class east Cincinnati. She is a payroll supervisor; he works for a towing company. Their oldest son, 18, heads to boot camp next February because military service will pay for a college education that his family cannot afford.
Their pay is steady, but even low inflation has eaten away their income. They wonder openly whether the system is broken. They say they doubt either candidate can fix it.
Mr. Obama, they say, is honest and has good ideas, but no spine to carry them out. ''Obama says he's going to put more out for education,'' said Mr. Russell, who wants to improve his skills but lacks money for more schooling. ''But like his medical plan, I highly doubt that what comes out the other end is going to be what went in.
''If you're willing as a leader to say, I'll get 100 percent -- oh, I'll take 60 -- you're not accomplishing what you set out to do. Do you really believe he's going to do it in next four years?''
Mr. Romney might run the country better, they say, but he is clueless about the average person's needs. Witness, Ms. Russell said, his comments about the 47 percent of Americans who pay no taxes or depend on government handouts. ''Me personally, I've never been on public assistance,'' she said. ''But I definitely have friends who are single mothers who could not go to work without it.
''To me, it shows he's in a different wage bracket than the rest of us,'' she said.
Mr. Russell scoffed at Mr. Romney's suggestion that children should borrow from their parents to pay college tuition instead of seeking government loans. It is a notion, he said, that only someone with wealthy parents would propose.
Then again, Ms. Russell said: ''I don't know that that will make him worse than Obama -- that he can do enough good that it will trickle down to us.''
The Russells concede that their indecision is not for lack of information. Like virtually every family in Ohio, they have watched the debates, talked with friends and read the material hung on their doorknobs, although they have drawn the line at listening to robo-calls. In short, they have been drenched by a fire hose of creative persuasion of the quality and volume that only two billion-dollar campaigns could muster.
Still, Ms. Russell mused, it is not altogether clear what this monumental ground game has added up to.
''I think this is one of those races that could go either way,'' she said. ''They both have enough money backing them.
''If they'd put some of that money to work instead, it'd be amazing.''

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan Can't Lose

 BODY:
I thought your cover illustration told the whole story of Paul Ryan. Like a perfect koan, nothing more could have been added -- the boy is a cartoon. The entire presidential campaign has become an exchange of non sequiturs in place of serious argument. A cartoon campaign is not worthy of a democratic society. EMANUELE CORSO, Penasco, N.M. 
Beneath Ryan's aw-shucks Midwestern bonhomie and earnest policy-wonkish demeanor beats the heart of a hard-core trickledown plutocrat. He cannot hide his penchant for privatizing Medicare and Social Security. But what makes the prospect of a Romney-Ryan victory truly frightful is the presence of the foreign-policy adviser Dan Senor and his Straussian ilk. The United States can ill af ord another war of choice -- against Iran, Syria or any member of the fungible axis of evil. Fifty years ago, J.F.K. chose jaw-jaw over war-war in defusing the Cuban missile crisis. Détente and diplomacy appear to be missing from the gospel according to Representative Ryan and Governor Romney.
ROSARIO A. IACONIS, Adjunct Professor of Economics and Political Science, Briarclif e College, Bethpage, N.Y.
That Ryan is a ''professor'' is a big part of the hype that Mark Leibovich bemoans between the lines. And Congressional Republicans are more than happy to feed the hype. National Review's Robert Costa, for instance, wrote in August that Ryan's fellow members, especially the Tea Party-rich freshman class of 2010, are like ''students.''. . . Paul Ryan is a ''professor'' to the extent that his ''students'' are woefully and comically underinformed. And it is on the back of this ignorance that Paul Ryan the ideologue may ride into the U.S. Naval Observatory.
SCOTT GALUPO, in the State of the Union blog on theamericanconservative.com
Regarding Ryan's PowerPoint on the national debt, the importance lies not with citing concepts that are beyond the grasp of ''f fth graders'' but in taking the matter seriously. We do; the left doesn't. And yes, it is mathematically and politically possible to remain revenue neutral by leaving ef ective tax rates in place while broadening the base and lowering marginal rates. Of course, all clamor for details on which deductions, credits or incentives will be eliminated. Those items get negotiated in committee and caucuses, do they not? Finally, some of your characterizations of Ryan, when juxtaposed with his rivals, are striking. You write of a ''full-faced smirk'' coming from Ryan, yet Joe Biden's debate behavior merits only a euphemistic label of ''amped-up mannerisms.''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Pakistan-Afghan Options

 BODY:
Is Pakistan friend or foe? What does that mean for the region?
To the Editor:
In a recent editorial, you said, ''If there was ever a chance of 'victory' in Afghanistan, it evaporated when American troops went off to fight the pointless war in Iraq'' (''Time to Pack Up,'' Oct. 14).
The possibility of victory was in fact precluded when both the Bush and Obama administrations made it dependent on the support of Pakistan, which, as you put it so well, ''supports jihad in Afghanistan, Kashmir and Indian cities'' -- and has been doing so for over 40 years.
The deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan has been the inevitable result of America's continuation of the very dynamic that led to the Sept. 11 attacks -- hefty, decades-long military assistance to Pakistan, which it used to incite proxy militants to crush socioeconomic reform at home and commit aggression against its neighbors. 
Viewed in this historical perspective, your call for a precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan is quite simply a forfeiting of the game to Pakistan. Why should the Afghan people have to pay for the United States' insistence, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that Pakistan is an ally when it is in fact an enemy? And how will the American people emerge more secure if we leave behind the Pakistani-fostered jihadist safe havens that inflicted such agony on our nation?
Both presidential candidates sidestepped this issue in their final debate. Mitt Romney's pledge to encourage the Pakistanis to ''move to a more responsible course'' ignores the reality that this tack has long been pursued with utter failure. President Obama's claim that ''we have stood on the side of democracy'' in the region evades the truth that funding Pakistan's army serves to smother civil society.
Continued military and diplomatic engagement in South-Central Asia, with a truer aim of containing Pakistan's ability to destabilize its neighbors and effecting a transition to real civilian rule there, is our best option. Such a policy would proceed not from triumphalist myopia but from tragic recognition, and is the only course that will bring peace and security to Afghanistan, the region and America.
VANNI CAPPELLI Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Oct. 29, 2012
The writer, a freelance journalist, is president of the Afghanistan Foreign Press Association.
Readers React
Few countries understand Afghanistan's pain better than Pakistan. If Pakistan is barely recognizable from the country it was in the late 1970s, the reason, according to most Pakistanis, is Afghanistan.
Pakistan has made enormous sacrifices and paid an incalculable price in blood and treasure in the fight against terrorism over the last decade, and earlier, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which forced more than three million Afghans to seek refuge in Pakistan. We have hosted, housed, fed (at one point releasing supplies from our strategic food reserves) and educated these refugees for more than 30 years at a cost to us of billions of dollars. Pakistan is proud to have been of assistance to our Afghan brothers and sisters, and we look forward to the day when the refugees can return to their homeland in honor and dignity.
Pakistan has lost over 37,000 innocent civilians and 7,000 military and police personnel to terrorism. Terrorism claimed our most charismatic and popular leader, Benazir Bhutto. Every day Pakistanis make the supreme sacrifice against terrorism. There was one suicide bombing in Pakistan before 9/11, 300 since then. Our economy has been shattered by violence that was previously unknown in Pakistan.
Terrorism in our region and around the world is not financed through American military assistance, as alleged by Mr. Cappelli. Terrorism is financed by the unrestricted production and sale of illegal drugs.
Pakistan wants nothing more than a stable, peaceful and economically viable Afghanistan. These goals will be achieved only through Afghanistan's transition to a real and functioning democracy. Pakistan is committed to helping Afghans realize this goal.
To roll out tired clichés rather than focus on the problems confronting Pakistan and Afghanistan amounts to a disservice to the countries and their citizens. This is not the time for recriminations but for resolve to work together and defeat our common enemy.
NADEEM HOTIANA Press Attaché, Embassy of Pakistan Washington, Nov. 1, 2012
Assuming that Mr. Cappelli is correct about Pakistan's true motives, the interminable military commitment necessary to thwart its objectives, on top of 11 years of fruitless effort in Afghanistan, is far beyond our political and popular will, not to mention our financial capacity.
Perhaps we are being ''played'' by our purported ally, but we are forced to pursue a policy toward nuclear-armed Pakistan that offers the best chance of influencing its conduct in a way that does not increase tensions and instability in the region. Declaring it an enemy, as Mr. Cappelli appears to suggest, is probably the worst of our bad alternatives.
ROBERT OKSNER Winter Park, Fla., Oct. 31, 2012
There can be no peace and stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia at large, within Pakistan and in Kashmir until Pakistani generals stop interfering in Afghanistan and in other parts of their region and in their own country's constitutional dynamics. And they will not do so until they are stripped of the basis of their arrogance: their nuclear weapons. Because of this trump card, they feel emboldened to act dangerously and have become accustomed to getting their way at the expense of other countries and the people of Pakistan.
The generals developed their nuclear toys while America was under the illusion that the army-controlled ''Pakistan is an ally when it is in fact an enemy.'' Even if America is no longer under this illusion, it now has no choice but to dance to the generals' tune.America must find a way to neutralize this nuclear tinderbox. This is a prerequisite for peace in the region and for a fair sociopolitical order for the people of Pakistan.
But is America ready to defang the nuclear-armed Pakistani coterie? Considering the comments on Pakistan by both presidential candidates in the debate on Oct. 22, the answer is a resounding no.
SIDDIQUE MALIK Louisville, Ky., Oct. 31, 2012
Mr. Cappelli is absolutely right that Pakistan has played a destabilizing role in Afghanistan from at least 1994, when it essentially created the Taliban, to this day. We should recognize that the principal reason for this continuing Pakistani policy has been its relationship with India.
Just as Pakistan has used terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to attack targets in India itself, so, too, it has used the Taliban to attack targets in Afghanistan such as the Indian Embassy in Kabul, twice. This reflects the Pakistani fear that India, through its support of the Karzai government, will somehow succeed in creating a position of influence in Afghanistan that would further weaken Pakistan in its confrontation with India.
Thus the solution to the crisis in Afghanistan, if there is one, has to be sought in the Pakistan-India relationship, beginning with the long-festering Kashmir issue. As long as the Pakistani Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence sees the Taliban as part of its defense against India, all of our demands that Pakistan cease its support of the Taliban will fall on deaf ears.
THOMAS NILES Scarsdale, N.Y., Oct. 31, 2012
As one who lobbied on behalf of the Afghan cause at the 1980 Republican Convention, I was sorely disappointed when the moderator in the third debate let both candidates get away with not answering his well-thought-out question on the future of Afghanistan.
The question of what we should do in 2014 if the Afghans, as is likely to be the case, are not yet able to successfully defend their country against the Taliban is a vital one, needing serious discussion. And the question of what to do about Pakistan is surely no less serious.
We owe the Afghan people a great debt for helping, at great costs to themselves, to remove the Soviet threat. Allowing the Taliban to recapture control in Afghanistan is not only selling out the Afghans once again, but also risks an even worse situation in Pakistan. The likely resulting Talibanization of Pakistan will surely metastasize into an even more dangerous threat against us all.
In such circumstances, can our next president ensure that this will not be an ever greater threat than the Soviet one, given the virulent anti-American ideology that group shares with other jihadists and Pakistan's possession of nuclear weapons?
JOHN HOWARD WILHELM Ann Arbor, Mich., Oct. 31, 2012
One can agree with Mr. Cappelli that it was a strategic mistake for the United States and Pakistan to arm and train the anti-Soviet mujahedeen in the 1980s. They morphed into the Taliban and created conditions for the emergence of Al Qaeda. The rest of Mr. Cappelli's thesis, however, reflects the fictions popularized by a discredited Kabul elite that assigns blame to all except itself for its country's plight.
The Pakistani ''jihadists'' were born in the triumphalist aftermath of the anti-Soviet war. There is no evidence to suggest that either the military or civilian leadership in Islamabad has any interest any longer in supporting the jihadists against India or Afghanistan.
It is Pakistan that should rue its repeated unequal alliances with the United States and its generosity toward the millions of Afghan refugees, most of whom, including the families of some of the elite, remain in Pakistan. The Taliban are indigenous to Afghanistan, not Pakistan, to which they fled from American military action. Pakistan's post-9/11 alliance with the United States made it the target of Al Qaeda and ''Pakistani Taliban'' terrorists, leading to 30,000 civilian and military fatalities, a disrupted economy and a destabilized polity.
The United States should aim to leave Afghanistan in conditions of peace by promoting political and ethnic reconciliation by 2014. This can be achieved through Pakistan's cooperation. Likewise, preventing cross-border attacks by the Taliban, which are taking place in both directions, can be realized only through a cooperative and reciprocal process among Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States and NATO. Attempts to ''contain'' Pakistan will prove counterproductive, if not disastrous, for Afghanistan and the region.
Given the failure of nation-building in Afghanistan, suggestions that America impose specific governance structures on Pakistan are delusional.
MUNIR AKRAM Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Oct. 31, 2012
The writer was ambassador of Pakistan to the United Nations from 2002 to 2008.
Mr. Cappelli argues that departing Afghanistan precludes ''the possibility of victory'' and that continued engagement ''is the only course that will bring peace and security to Afghanistan.'' I disagree.
There will be no peace in Afghanistan until its own people forge peace. Our engagement with Pakistan will continue on many parallel fronts. We will be engaged commercially, militarily and diplomatically. For those parallel lines to meet, Pakistanis, like the Afghans, will have to create a way to unite on their own. We do not have a good track record intervening in fractured societies.
HERBERT S. GROSS Rockville, Md., Oct. 31, 2012
The Writer Responds
The readers underestimate the historical and existential depth of this problem, and the degree to which Pakistan is what American military assistance has made it.
In a brilliant essay in The Times in 1970, Chester Bowles, a Kennedy-era under secretary of state, prophesied that arming Pakistan would come to be counted ''as among our most costly blunders.'' He outlined the enduring contradictions of the American-Pakistani relationship: It is based on false assumptions, Pakistan uses military aid for its own ends, this aid enables the guns-not-butter paradigm of its ruling generals and America never learns from its mistakes in the region.
Viewed within this framework, Mr. Hotiana's denial of Pakistani support for terrorism is negated by the continuity and logic of this behavior. The army has successively deployed militants since the 1970s in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Kashmir under the cry ''Islam in danger'' to effect the crushing of socioeconomic reform at home while expanding its power abroad.
Given the tragic role of American money in enabling all this, Mr. Oksner's claim that we lack the resources to reverse it rings hollow. Chester Bowles warned over 40 years ago that our policies toward Pakistan did not serve ''the interests of the American people in Asia. Or the cause of world peace. Or the welfare of the people of Pakistan, who need tractors, not tanks.''
Even in the wake of Sept. 11, America has yet to realize that it must compel the beating of swords into plowshares across South-Central Asia. My containment strategy is a first step toward that necessity for our security.

THE WHITE-HOT MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
Excellent reporting from Afghanistan, but the headline focuses on the negative. The important part of this article is the security chief who is trying to maintain order, the old man who oversees the water distribution and the hospital staff that soldiers on despite few supplies. It is the ability of so many people to do the right thing in such a fierce environment that most impresses me. STEPHEN LANDRIGAN, West Roxbury, Mass., posted on nytimes.com
When Bush proclaimed his axis of evil, Iran was a possible ally in the struggle against the Taliban. In fact, Iran had a better record in opposing the Taliban than the United States at that time. Iran-backed political leaders like Ismail Khan were the ones fighting the Taliban. Luke Mogelson shows the possible costs to the United States and to the anti-Taliban movement of persistence in foolish ideology. Iran was -- and perhaps still is -- the natural ally in fighting the Taliban. IAN BEDFORD, Sydney, Australia, posted on nytimes.com

HEADLINE: Still Waiting for the Narrator in Chief

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai is the magazine's chief political correspondent. He last wrote about the economy in Ohio.

 BODY:
Presidents generally don't like to admit mistakes, so it was interesting when Barack Obama owned up to one during an interview with Charlie Rose on CBS last summer. It was the job of the president, Obama said, to ''tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism,'' and it was on this score that he had fallen short. Conservatives gleefully mocked the president, saying that the country needed jobs more than it needed stories, and the remark did seem to hint at some genuine denial. After 40-plus months of high unemployment, a president who thinks his mistakes rest not in his policy choices but rather in his ability to articulate them is probably telling himself a story, if no one else. 
And yet Obama's admission resonated with his supporters, who can be forgiven for wondering why he hasn't been better at promoting what is, by any standard, an impressive series of accomplishments. (As the comedian Chris Rock tweeted recently: ''Only Pres Obama could prevent a depression, end a war, get bin Laden, bring unemployment below 8 percent, then be told he can't run on his record.'') In books and speeches before he became president, Obama showed himself to be an evocative storyteller; even the controversy over his memoir, in which Obama condensed some characters into one, says something about his narrative sophistication, his novelistic instinct for developing themes and characters that make his point.
All of which makes it even more baffling that Obama's presidential alter-ego, this grayer and more somber version of his literary self, spent the past four years immersed in legislative minutiae and marching out dull slogans -- ''an economy built to last,'' ''winning the future'' and so on -- while failing to advance any larger theory of the moment confronting the country and what it required. ''They haven't talked about how the pieces of the puzzle fit together and move us forward from where we've been,'' says Don Baer, who served as President Clinton's communications director and now runs the public relations giant Burson-Marsteller. ''It's been random and unconnected.'' David Gergen, who advised four presidents on communications, likens the larger story of an administration to a clothesline. ''You adopt your clothesline, and then you hang all your policies from it,'' he told me. ''They're missing the clothesline.''
If Obama somehow manages to lose an election that seemed well within his grasp a few months ago, this question of how he squandered his narrative mojo will pain Democrats for years to come. As with so much else about this presidency, the answers can probably be traced back to those first overwhelming months after the 2008 election. Remember that John McCain's most effective line of attack against Obama during the campaign was that he was more of a motivational speaker than a leader. And so, having won the election and facing crises on several fronts, the president's advisers were understandably wary of too much speechifying, which might have underscored the idea that Obama was going to orate his way through the presidency while leaving the business of governing to others. As a result, Obama spent much of his first months -- the period when he might have been speaking directly to an anxious public, much as Franklin Roosevelt did in a less technological age -- holed up with aides and members of Congress, rather than pushing any kind of overarching narrative.
Remember, too, that Obama and Joe Biden were the first president and vice president to be elected directly from the Senate since 1960, and most of the senior aides they brought with them came from Capitol Hill. This had real consequences. Congressional aides know a lot about how to slap around their opponents, but because they're always either taking direction from a president or trying to thwart one, they think very little about how to build support for a governing agenda. A classic case here was the controversial stimulus measure passed in the early days of Obama's presidency; the White House and its allies skillfully managed to win approval for nearly $800 billion in aid to states, long-term investment and tax cuts, but they gave almost no thought to whether the public understood the differences between these categories of spending or the economic reasoning behind them.
A president who had governed from a statehouse, as most of Obama's recent predecessors have done, might have grasped right away the need to take the case to the local level, repeating the same argument for investment at every ribbon-cutting ceremony the White House could find. But senators aren't as accustomed to making that kind of sales pitch for their agendas, unless they're campaigning for re-election, and Obama seems especially uncomfortable with it. ''For a narrative to work, a president has to be extremely repetitive,'' Gergen says. Obama's obvious aversion to political theatrics and mindless repetition contributed to an impression of inconsistency (and lack of passion) that dogged him throughout his term. It was as if in the president's determination to keep it real, he kept it confusing instead.
You might have assumed that Obama's imaginative campaign team, the consultants who so slickly drafted his story for 2008, would have provided the same expertise in the White House. After all, David Axelrod, one of the best political admen of his generation, accompanied his candidate to Washington and installed himself in an office not 20 feet from the boss's. But the problem with campaign consultants who come to the White House -- Karl Rove is a good example -- is that they aspire to be more than campaign consultants; they always want to transform themselves into policy aides, making historic decisions and striding the halls purposefully like characters from ''The West Wing.'' Rather than continuing to market the Obama agenda, Axelrod traded in his video-editing software for a closetful of suits and began furiously gathering votes for legislation. The result, perhaps, was that Obama's most talented storyteller moved on to bigger things at exactly the moment the president needed a new kind of campaign, and no one of Axelrod's caliber filled the void.
There's probably another reason that Obama and his most trusted advisers seemed unconcerned about advancing a sustained argument, though, which is that they decided their argument had already won. And this, more than anything, explains how the narrative really got away from the president in those early days. When I interviewed Obama during the closing weeks of the 2008 campaign -- at the very moment that Congress was debating a bank bailout and the stock market was tumbling toward oblivion -- he spoke about the fragile reality of his impending election and his understanding that a lot of independents and conservatives might vote for him, but they were yet to be persuaded that he shared their values and sympathized with their anxieties. This, he said, would be a central challenge for him as president.
But then Republicans collapsed under the weight of the Bush era, and Obama emerged from the election as only the fourth Democrat in history to break the 51 percent barrier, with Rooseveltian majorities in Congress and an approval rating above 70 percent. Both Obama's campaign strategists and his former colleagues on Capitol Hill congratulated themselves on having earned a clear mandate from the voters. And suddenly the president, rather than interpreting his approval ratings as a sign that hopeful voters were waiting to hear what he had to say, seemed to proceed as if he already had the public's enthusiastic endorsement for whatever steps he and his allies felt they needed to take.
You could have imagined, at that moment, an Oval Office address, followed by a national tour, in which the new president laid out the causes and depth of the crisis he had inherited and the measures he would take over the first 18 months of his term -- short-term stimulus, long-term investment, modernization of financial regulation and the tax code -- to put the country on a different course. All of these policies were probably necessary, and they were probably salable too, if Obama had seen it as one of his central responsibilities to explain how they all fit together. The president and his advisers were, to be fair, inundated with the realities of multiple crises, and so Obama forged ahead with all of these policy solutions (not to mention a massive health care plan and what amounted to the temporary nationalization of the car companies), which, absent any real marshaling of public opinion, emboldened his opponents and caught much of the country by surprise.
It was a crucial misreading of the moment, and if Obama narrowly loses, it will most likely be the moment he wishes he had back. If he wins a second term, however, then the president, who has laid out no clearer policy agenda this time than he did four years ago, will have the opportunity -- the imperative, really -- to learn from the one mistake he has been willing to acknowledge. In this era of elections that teeter on the votes of a handful of states, of campaigns characterized by waxy clichés but very little courageous explanation, an election result isn't a final verdict on one governing philosophy over another, but rather a signal that the voters have agreed to hear your case. Once you're in office, the story you tell about and to the country isn't some barely tolerable performance that distracts you from the job of being president. It is, to a large extent, the presidency itself.

HEADLINE: China Leader With Close Army Ties Would Be Force for U.S. to Contend With

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- On one of his many visits abroad in recent years, Xi Jinping, the presumptive new leader of China, met in 2009 with local Chinese residents in Mexico City, where in a relaxed atmosphere he indirectly criticized the United States.
''There are a few foreigners, with full bellies, who have nothing better to do than try to point fingers at our country,'' Mr. Xi said, according to a tape broadcast on Hong Kong television. ''China does not export revolution, hunger, poverty nor does China cause you any headaches. Just what else do you want?''
Mr. Xi is set to be elevated to the top post of the Chinese Communist Party at the 18th Party Congress scheduled to begin here on Nov. 8 -- only two days after the American election. He will take the helm of a more confident China than the United States has ever known. He will be assuming supreme power in China at a time when relations between the two countries are adrift, sullied by suspicions over a clash of interests in Asia and by frequent attacks on China in the American presidential campaign. 
In the last four months, China has forged an aggressive, more nationalistic posture in Asia that may set the tone for Mr. Xi's expected decade-long tenure, analysts and diplomats say, pushing against American allies, particularly Japan, for what China considers its territorial imperatives. The son of a revolutionary general, Mr. Xi, 59, boasts far closer ties to China's fast-growing military than the departing leader, Hu Jintao, had when he took office. As Mr. Xi rose through the ranks of the Communist Party, he made the most of parallel posts in the People's Liberation Army, deeply familiarizing himself with the inner workings of the armed forces.
Even if Mr. Xi does not immediately become head of the crucial Central Military Commission as well as party leader, he will almost certainly do so within two years, giving him at least eight years as the direct overseer of the military.
This combination of political power as head of the Communist Party and good relations with a more robust military could make Mr. Xi a formidable leader for Washington to contend with, analysts and diplomats in China and the United States say.
''The basic question is whether Xi will suspend the drift in the U.S.-China relationship and take concrete steps to put it on a more positive footing -- or will he put it on a different, more confrontational track?'' said Christopher K. Johnson, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and until recently a China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.
The answer appears to lie somewhere in between.
In a speech in Washington in February, Mr. Xi said that China and the United States should forge a ''new type of relationship between major countries in the 21st century.''
Mr. Xi offered little specificity beyond respect for each side's ''core interests and major concerns,'' ''increasing mutual understanding and strategic trust'' and ''enhancing cooperation and coordination in international affairs.''
But essentially, said Jin Canrong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, Mr. Xi was challenging the global leadership of the United States by suggesting that Washington needs to make room for China's rising power.
''China should shoulder some responsibility for the United States and the United States should share power with China,'' Dr. Jin said. ''The United States elites won't like it,'' he added, ''but they will have to'' accept it.
Dr. Jin predicted that the Chinese economy would continue to grow at a much faster pace than America's. ''That fact will change their minds,'' Dr. Jin said of American attitudes toward sharing power with China.
Before becoming heir apparent -- ascending at the last party congress in 2007 to the position of first secretary of the Communist Party and then a few months later to the vice presidency of the Chinese government -- Mr. Xi had little exposure to the world beyond China.
Significantly, though, he spent much of his career before moving to Beijing in the coastal area of Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces across from Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province. In that capacity, he nurtured economic ties with Taiwan, and met frequently with Taiwan business leaders who made huge investments transforming the two provinces into one of China's most powerful economic engines.
In 2003, when he was elevated from provincial governor to party chief in Zhejiang, the top position there, Mr. Xi kept the portfolio of relations with Taiwan, even though Taiwan affairs were usually relegated to the governor, said Joseph Wu, a former representative of Taiwan in Washington and a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. In the medium term, Mr. Wu said, he expects Mr. Xi to be ''tougher'' in calling for greater integration between Taiwan and the mainland, a policy that Taiwan has resisted so far.
Since becoming vice president, Mr. Xi has visited more than 50 countries, a concerted effort to get to know the world before taking power, said Bo Zhiyue, senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, who tracks elite politics in China.
In contrast, Mr. Hu made 17 foreign visits during his tenure as vice president, Dr. Bo said.
One of the big changes from the past decade, when China's foreign policy was focused on securing raw materials from abroad for its soaring domestic economy, will be a stronger emphasis on building up the military to protect China's interests in Asia and expand its reach abroad. Mr. Xi is perfectly positioned to take on that role.
''The P.L.A. considers he is their man,'' said Dr. Jin, the professor at Renmin University.
Mr. Xi will be in charge of a military whose budget almost certainly will grow at a pace with the economy, or even faster. The People's Liberation Army is awaiting an array of sophisticated weaponry now under development, including space and long-range missiles capable of use against American aircraft carriers in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The question is how it plans to exploit them.
''There are voices in China saying that now that the military has the capacity, they should use them,'' said Phillip C. Saunders, director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at the National Defense University in Washington.
As vice president, Mr. Xi has served as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission since 2010 under President Hu. As part of the brutal factional politics at the top of the Communist Party, Mr. Hu delayed Mr. Xi's rise to the deputy post by one year, but that did little to undermine his longstanding ties to army leaders, Chinese officials say.
The Chinese military's new buoyancy comes as America's allies across Asia -- Japan, South Korea, Australia and other friends, particularly Singapore and India -- worry whether the United States has the money, and the will, to enhance its military presence in Asia, as President Obama has promised.
In this situation, China will try to make inroads across the region, Asian diplomats say.
But Mr. Xi, with his strong standing with military leaders, may also find himself called on at times to restrain the ambitions of the army. ''Xi will have to guide strategy,'' Dr. Saunders said. ''Then he has to go back to the P.L.A. and say, 'This is how it will be.' That is potentially contentious.''
Even before his watch begins, many see the stiffer hand of Mr. Xi in disputes in the South China Sea with the Philippines and Vietnam and in the East China Sea with Japan.
Chinese officials and commentators have alluded recently to what they see as the need for Japan to distance itself from the United States, even forgo the mutual defense treaty with Washington.
When Mr. Xi met with Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta in Beijing in September, he delivered ''an earful,'' and left the unmistakable message that the United States should stay out of the way in the standoff between Japan and China over claims to the disputed islands.
Many see that as a harbinger of an effort by Mr. Xi over the next decade to increase the power and presence of China in Asia, a region where the United States has held the upper hand since the end of World War II.
Changing of the Guard: Articles in this series are examining the implications for China and the rest of the world of the coming changes in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Bonuses on Wall St. Expected to Edge Up

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Year-end incentives will be flat to up to 10 percent higher when compared with last year, a survey is forecasting, but the increase is from one of the worst years for bank pay in recent memory. 

 BODY:
Wall Street employees, whose paychecks have often been cut in recent years, are likely to get a slight bump in their bonuses this year. The catch: the increase will come on top of one of the worst years for bank pay in recent memory.
Year-end incentives, which include cash bonuses and stock awards, will be flat to up to 10 percent higher when compared with last year, according to a closely watched compensation survey to be released on Monday. But firms drastically cut costs, employment and, as a result, pay, in 2011.
"It has been a slow recovery, just like the economy," said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the privately held firm that conducted the survey. "Following a year when year-end incentives declined by as much as 30 percent, the fact that many firms are able to keep this year's bonuses flat or slightly larger is notable."
 Johnson Associates, based in New York, surveyed 10 public asset management firms, eight major banks and more than a dozen other financial institutions.
Business on Wall Street has picked up somewhat in 2012, but firms are still cutting both compensation and other expenses to save money and improve their profits.
Just last week, UBS said it was laying off 10,000 employees worldwide, or 15 percent of its staff. Most of these cuts will come from its investment bank, which houses businesses like sales and trading. Firms have found these units, where bonuses were once lucrative, more costly to sustain in the wake of regulatory changes.
Investment bankers, whose pay has fallen consistently in recent years, should not hold out for a pay increase this year, Mr. Johnson said. Bankers' pay is expected to drop as much as 10 percent this year. "Bankers have gone from masters of the universe to masters of their block," he joked.
Roy C. Smith, a professor of finance at New York University, said firms had cut positions since the financial crisis as revenue fell. Firms are also contending with regulations that are forcing them to sell off certain segments, or at least cut back, like proprietary trading, or trading for their own accounts. "They are cutting back as much as they can get away with," he said.
Wall Street firms set aside money all year for bonuses and allocate it to employees after they know their year-end results. Top executives and boards are now starting to think about who will make what, and the stakes are high.
These bonuses are typically in addition to a base salary, which on Wall Street can range from $100,000 to more than $1 million for top executives.
Roughly half of all the revenue generated on Wall Street goes toward compensation, and most of it is paid in the form of a year-end bonus. So far this year, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have set aside $92.49 billion to pay employees, down slightly from $92.81 billion in the year ago period, according to Johnson Associates.
It's too early to tell what this will mean for individual bonuses in early 2013. Investors will know in January when fourth-quarter results are announced how much firms have set aside to cover compensation and benefits.
Bond or fixed-income traders, who had the deepest declines in 2011, are projected to gain the biggest increase in the bonuses this year, from 10 to 20 percent, Mr. Johnson said. Employees in less volatile businesses, like asset management and commercial banking, will take in roughly what they did last year, or possibly be given an increase of as much as 10 percent.
Employees at the firms' hedge funds and private equity units can expect, on average, no increase to a 5 percent increase in bonuses, the survey predicted.
Bonuses for top executives, like Lloyd C. Blankfein at Goldman Sachs, will stay roughly the same as well, falling or rising about 5 percent. In 2011 Mr. Blankfein made about $12 million.
"These figures, compared to what real people make, are enormous, but compared to what Wall Street executives made in 2006 and 2007 it's a fraction of the pay," Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Blankfein, for instance, made $68.5 million for his work in 2007, the year before the financial crisis. At the time it was a record payday for a chief executive of a big Wall Street firm.

HEADLINE: The End of 'Marriage'

BYLINE: LAURIE SHRAGE


HIGHLIGHT: Getting the government out of the marriage business sounds like a good idea, until we consider the dangers to women and girls. 

 BODY:
The institution of marriage has become the focus of public debate and reform, not just in the state-by-state political battles familiar to us in the United States, but across the world. Some of the longstanding practices currently being scrutinized both here and in other countries include parental approval in the choice of a spouse, permission for a husband to take more than one wife (polygyny), temporary marriage, close relative (incestuous) marriage, strict or permissive divorce terms, mandatory bride virginity, child marriage or betrothal and gender-structured marriage in which wives and husbands have different duties and privileges and therefore must be gender "opposites." 
Marriage reform is typically part of a larger agenda for social change. In earlier eras, challenges to bans on interfaith and interracial marriage were tied to political movements promoting religious, ethnic and racial equality and social integration. In the Middle East, Africa and Asia today, marriage reformers often aim to expand the rights and liberty of girls and women, while in the Americas and Europe, their primary aim is to advance social equality and respect for lesbians and gay men.

While marriage reform is moving forward in many countries (for example, to extend access to same-sex couples), many prominent legal and political theorists - such as Cass Sunstein, Richard Thaler, Martha Fineman, Tamara Metz, Lisa Duggan, Andrew March, and Brook Sadler (to name only some of those who have put their views in writing) - are proposing that the institution of marriage be privatized. More specifically, they propose that we eliminate the term "marriage" from our civil laws and policies, and replace it with a more neutral term, such as "civil union" or "domestic partnership." The state would then recognize and regulate civil unions rather than civil marriage, and people would exchange marriage-like rights and duties by becoming "civilly united." Some private organizations, such as religious institutions, might still perform and solemnize marriages among their congregants, but these marriages would have no official state recognition.
The primary argument for this change of policy is that the state allegedly has no business regulating marriage, which is a complex cultural and religious practice. However, the state does have an interest in promoting private caregiving within families - the care of children, elderly parents and sick or disabled relatives. According to advocates for marriage privatization, the state can better pursue its interest in promoting nongovernmental forms of caregiving by establishing and regulating civil unions for all who qualify, and steering clear of defining, interfering with or regulating "marriage." 
Of course, private lives are complicated. Many different kinds of families and households exist and are capable of providing care and nurturance to their members. This includes single-parent families, unmarried partners who care for each other and/or children, and non-spousal relatives - for example, siblings - who together care for parents and children. Those who advocate for replacing civil marriage with civil union maintain that the many tangible benefits of civil marriage (such as tax relief, benefit sharing and inheritance rights) should be available, not only to families headed by heterosexual couples, but to all families that relieve taxpayers of much of the cost of the care and nurturance of their members. 
The political theorists mentioned above argue that the best way for the state to begin treating all families equally is for governments to avoid the highly contested terrain of licensing marriage and granting a package of rights only to citizens who achieve this status. Instead, they contend, governments should license civil unions for a wide range of caregiving units and extend the benefits that promote private caregiving to those units that gain this status. Caregiving units are defined in terms of the commitments of ongoing support that adults make to each other and their dependents, rather than in terms of the sexual/romantic attachments that happen to exist between a pair of adults.
This is an ingenious proposal that has many advantages. First, by eliminating "marriage" and revising state policies to focus on caregiving activities rather than sexual/romantic relationships, the state advances its legitimate interest in insuring that vulnerable citizens receive care and nurturing without illegitimately interfering in the private sphere of marriage. Our sexual, romantic or marital relationships are governed by values and beliefs that may not be shared by all citizens, and so noninterference in this sphere is generally a good policy. Keeping the government out of our bedrooms is especially important for democracies that value religious diversity and personal freedom. 
Second, by licensing a wide range of caregiving units, the state treats families that are differently structured equally. Some families may be headed by a heterosexual married couple, but others may be organized around one or more nonromantically attached adults and there is no good reason for the state to prefer one caregiving arrangement over others. State support for diverse families is especially good for democracies that value social equality among citizens and equality of opportunity for all, no matter how one starts out in life. 
So why not advocate for the end of civil "marriage"?
Unfortunately, this proposal has some serious problems. First, "privatizing" marriage will not cause it to disappear - it will just leave it to be regulated by private institutions, especially religious and ethnic ones. For many centuries, marriage has been the primary mechanism by which people who are not related "by blood" become relatives, and it is unclear that civil unions will acquire this social power. Many families will then be structured and governed primarily by private marriage customs and practices now freed of state regulation. Because of the deep and rich cultural significance of marriage, in many cases marriage arrangements will take precedence over the terms of civil unions. When these arrangements exist in tension with widely shared public values - like those that subordinate wives and daughters and limit their opportunities - privatizing and deregulating marriage will curtail the government's ability to promote gender equality within families structured by marriage. In other words, privatizing marriage will give private organizations, including inegalitarian ones, more influence over the institution of marriage without giving individuals negatively affected much protection by having access to civil union status. 
Second, because civil unions are designed to include many kinds of households, their terms will need to be flexible and individually negotiated. Importantly, adults who are not in marriage-like relationships may not want to exchange the same set of rights as those who are, such as debt and income sharing. An inclusive institution of civil union then is likely to become equivalent to a system of privately negotiated domestic contracts that the state merely enforces and also protects from outside interference. The problem with this is that, when the terms of civil unions are individually rather than publicly negotiated, they will be less responsive to widely-shared public values and beliefs. Moreover private negotiations will require hiring legal professionals to protect the interests of all parties, which will put civil unions outside the reach of many. 
In short, the arguments against privatizing marriage are similar to those against privatizing formal schooling or all forms of public assistance. Private institutions may do socially valuable work, but because they are governed by their own rules, they may also engage in forms of discrimination that conflict with public values. 
Those advocating for privatizing and deregulating marriage are operating with too narrow a vision of the state's (and society's) interest in recognizing families. I agree with marriage privatizers that the state should not promote marriage among adults as a way to establish parent responsibility or to avoid poverty. The state can pursue these aims less intrusively - by formalizing agreements of child support and custody between both unmarried and married parents, that is, independently of marriage. Indeed the terms of marriage are not comprehensive enough to cover this, though they traditionally assigned the bulk of childcare to wives. But not promoting marriage is different from deregulating or privatizing it. In countries or states where women have achieved formally equal rights, such as the United States, there is no need to support heterosexual marriage as a way to insure the well-being and security of women. 
Sadly, for many women today, marriage rarely is a means to economic and social security and often puts these goals at risk. Wives who perform unpaid caregiving and place their economic security in the hands of husbands, who may or may not be good breadwinners, often find their options for financial support severely constrained the longer they remain financially dependent. Decades of research on the feminization of poverty show that women who have children, whether married or not, are systematically disadvantaged when competing for good jobs. Marriage is neither a recipe for economic security nor responsible parenting.
To help move the state away from promoting marriage as a way to advance its interest in protecting children, we need to design policies that support caregivers of all kinds and cooperative caregiving schemes among parents, whether they are married or unmarried, or civilly united or not. Flexible civil unions may work for some, marriage for others, but the state should offer a mechanism for formalizing co-parenting agreements independently of the commitments that adults make to each other.
While many marriage privatizers are anxious to limit state control over sexual intimacy between adults, they seem to forget the importance of state regulation in protecting the fundamental rights of those whose intimate social relationships become abusive, coercive and exploitative. Public regulation of marriage is critical for protecting vulnerable citizens in such situations. Public reform of marriage is also critical for improving the general social condition of women and children in many countries today, as well as the social standing of lesbians and gay men. Having the state regulate only civil unions is much less certain to accomplish profound social change. 
Imagine that the states had not repealed "head and master" laws (which gave a husband in a marriage ultimate control of the family's property) or made other changes that rendered spouses formally equal and profoundly changed the status of married women in American society. These changes include the right of married women to own property in their name and greater protections against domestic violence. They also include laws prohibiting credit and employment discrimination against married women. Suppose instead the states had simply privatized marriage and accomplished the above reforms for people who become civilly united. 
Under a system in which the state only recognizes and supports civil unions, shouldn't it still prohibit discrimination against women who are married and protect them against domestic violence, whether they are also civilly united or not? Shouldn't the state also restrict child marriage and nonconsensual marriage? And shouldn't the state also prohibit terms of marriage that require involuntary servitude from a spouse? Without these restrictions, the condition of married women and girls would be unlikely to improve much. But if the state has to regulate marriage to protect married women or minors in some ways, then it has not fully privatized marriage or eliminated "marriage" from our laws. 
The state need not (and should not) use its power to coerce domestic and sexual intimacy (civil marriage or union) between co-parents in order to advance its legitimate goal in protecting the welfare of children. Instead the state can pursue the latter goal less intrusively by formalizing schemes of cooperation among parents in different kinds of relationships. Moreover, the state should recognize the marriages of same-sex couples that desire to participate in this institution and make the commitments thought appropriate to it. Even if marriage becomes more inclusive in ways that protect equality and freedom for all, some caregivers will prefer more flexible civil union agreements, or only to formalize their child support and custody arrangement. Public regulation and recognition of all of these options is an important step toward achieving social justice for women, lesbians and gay men, ethnic and religious minorities and children.
 Laurie Shrage is a professor of philosophy and women's studies at Florida International University. She was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Fellow at Princeton's University Center for Human Values during 2011-12, where she wrote several papers about the regulation and promotion of marriage by the state.

HEADLINE: In Virginia, It's Tradition Versus Change

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Disagreement among polls in the state is essentially disagreement about which Virginia will predominate on Election Day: "traditional" Virginia, which is more religious, rural, working-class and white; or "new" Virginia, which is more secular, urban, diverse and white-collar. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it is changing. Here is Virginia, the Old Dominion. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Daniel Palazzolo, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond, and Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. 
Polling of the presidential race in Virginia has been particularly volatile. Since the beginning of October, polls at various points have shown both a seven-point lead for Mitt Romney and a seven-point lead for President Obama.
The political landscape in Virginia has shifted dramatically in recent years, and the disagreement among the polls is essentially a disagreement about which Virginia will dominate on Election Day: the reliably Republican "Old Virginia," which is more religious, rural, working-class and white, or the politically competitive "New Virginia," which is more secular, urban, diverse and white-collar.
In 2008, New Virginia made its debut at the presidential level, with Mr. Obama becoming the first Democrat to carry the state since 1964. He won by six percentage points.
But in the following two years, Old Virginia has roared back. Turnout in nonpresidential elections tends to be substantially more favorable to Republican candidates. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, won the governor's race in 2009, and the party picked up three House seats in 2010. Republicans now represent 8 of Virginia's 11 Congressional districts.
Political analysts often group Virginia and North Carolina together as the "New South." Both states -- reliably red for years -- turned blue in 2008, pushed toward the political center by highly-educated white-collar voters who have moved there and by fast-growing Hispanic populations.
But while similar demographic trends have been reshaping both states' politics, the changes have been more apparent in Virginia. Mr. Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina was razor thin. In Virginia, however, Mr. Obama's margin of victory matched his margin nationwide almost exactly.
Virginia's political balance has shifted far enough left that it is now very close to a tipping point. In fact, it has the smallest Republican lean, 1.9 percentage points, of any state in FiveThirtyEight's Presidential Voting Index. North Carolina, by contrast, is almost eight percentage points to the right of the national average.
As Mr. Romney's polling improved nationally after the first presidential debate, North Carolina appeared to fall off the list of main battleground states. Mr. Romney is currently a 79 percent favorite to carry North Carolina, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast. In Virginia, Mr. Obama is still favored.
Democrats there have an advantage that Democrats in North Carolina do not: The explosive growth of suburban Washington.
In 1970, Northern Virginia accounted for 12 percent of the state's population, according to the Almanac of American Politics, and 61 percent of Virginians lived in small towns and rural communities.
But in the 2010 census, one-third of Virginia residents lived in Northern Virginia. The Richmond area and the Hampton Roads region have grown too, and more than half of the state's residents live in urban areas.
Northern Virginia now has a much greater influence in statewide elections. As the Washington suburbs have expanded, Northern Virginia has become more diverse and better educated. It is home to thousands of government workers and contractors, including many employed by defense and high-tech companies.
Northern Virginia has also become more affluent. The top 3 richest counties in the nation by median income (and 5 of the top 10) are all in the Virginia portion of suburban Washington. Loudoun County is No. 1, followed by Fairfax and Arlington Counties.
Fairfax County -- the most populous in the state, with more than a million residents -- has been ground zero for the demographic change, Mr. Skelley said. In 1996, Bob Dole edged out Bill Clinton in Fairfax County, and in 2000 George W. Bush beat Al Gore there. By 2008, however, Mr. Obama carried Fairfax County with slightly more than 60 percent of the vote.
Prince William County, southwest of Fairfax, has grown to more than 400,000 residents, and one-fifth of them are African-American and one-fifth Hispanic.
The Richmond area is more politically competitive, Mr. Palazzolo said. The city of Richmond is heavily African-American and Democratic-leaning, but suburban Chesterfield County to the south is Republican territory. Henrico County -- which wraps around Richmond -- is a tossup. There are state government employees who lean left, and more socially conservative voters who lean right.
The Hampton Roads region, along the coast in southest Virginia, is also competitive. There are significant African-American communities in Norfolk and Hampton. But Hampton Roads is also home to a number of military installations, including Marine, Army and Air Force installations as well as the largest naval base in the world, Norfolk Naval Station. Virginia Beach, home to many active and retired military personnel, skews Republican.
Western Virginia is sparsely populated, more rural and economically depressed. It is also ruby red. The gains Democrats have made in Virginia, with a few exceptions, have been in the east.
"If anything," Mr. Skelley said, "the western, rural part of the state has become more Republican."
 The Bellwether: Montgomery County 
Montgomery County has been an almost perfect barometer of Virginia's statewide political orientation. Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, is Montgomery County's stand-in for left-leaning Northern Virginia, while the area around the university is more Old Virginia, Mr. Skelley said.
In the past three presidential elections, Montgomery County has never been more than one percentage point off of the statewide vote shares of the two parties.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is a 71 percent favorite in Virginia, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. The model projects Virginia to be one of the closest states, with Mr. Obama prevailing by 1.5 percentage points. If Mr. Romney over-performs his polling even slightly on Election Day, Virginia's 13 electoral votes will end up in the Republican column.
Mr. Obama carried Virginia in 2008 by far exceeding John Kerry's 2004 vote totals in Hampton Roads, the Richmond area and especially in the Washington suburbs.
Virginia "has moved further left since 2008," Mr. Palazzolo said, "but Romney is more acceptable to moderate Republicans. The McCain and Palin ticket didn't sell very well with moderate Republican-leaners in Northern Virginia."
Suburban communities, particularly in Northern Virginia, are likely to decide who carries the state again this year. Prince William, Loudoun, and Henrico Counties may prove decisive, Mr. Skelley said. All are densely populated, and all were won by Mr. Bush in 2004 and by Mr. Obama 2008.
"The candidates who can win the suburbs have always won," Mr. Skelley said. "In recent years, the suburbs have become more liberal, which has made it easier for Democrats."

HEADLINE: The Brazilian Economic Model

BYLINE: DAVID ROHDE


HIGHLIGHT: While Europe, the United States and China engage in ideological fights, Brazil's Dilma Rousseff reaches for a centrist economics. 

 BODY:
SUAPE, Brazil - As Britain experiments with austerity, China struggles with state capitalism and the United States fights a political civil war over debt vs. spending, Brazil's leaders are increasingly governing from the economic center. 
This sprawling, $18-billion port and industrial complex in northeastern Brazil - the largest shipyard in the southern hemisphere - is one example. State-run companies are the dominant economic engines in a 50-square-mile venture that employs 40,000 workers and includes a heavy oil refinery and a petrochemical plant. 
But the container port has been privatized, is run by a Filipino company and the local government has used generous tax breaks to convince European and American multinationals, from Fiat to Pepsi, to build factories. Together, state and private sector investment has made Pernambuco state one of the fastest growing areas in Brazil. 
Fabiana Maria da Conceição, a 33-year-old mother of two who lives in a favela in the state capital, hailed the growth when I visited in September. She told me she was quitting her job as a maid to become a sales clerk in a new 476-store shopping mall, doubling her salary. 
"We get access to electronics, TVs, microwaves," she said, referring to the area's poor. "We are in the consumer market."
Much of the credit goes to two centrist politicians, according to analysts. Eduardo Campos, the technocratic local governor, and Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's increasingly centrist president. Both are left-leaning economists who are trying to mix liberal and conservative economic approaches. 
Mr. Campos, a 47-year-old scion of a local political dynasty, is widely seen as a rising political star in Brazil and aleading presidential contender. A demanding manager, he is both a pro-free-market technocrat and an old-style Brazilian political boss. He tries to use public-private partnerships to address social problems like security and education.
Ms. Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla and the successor of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has adopted a series of surprisingly centrist economic positions. 
In February, she allowed two private companies to build and run new airport terminals in São Paolo and Brasília, abruptly bringing an end to decades of state control. The move was an unprecedented step for Brazil's governing Workers' Party, a center-left political movement that normally tightly guards the state's role in the economy.
In August, Ms. Rousseff unveiled a $66-billion infrastructure initiative that granted licenses to private companies to fund, build and operate badly needed roads and railways. In September, she extended a sweeping payroll tax cut that will cost $14.6 billion over the next four years. She has also championed pro-business reforms designed to drive down interest rates and energy costs. 
At the same time, Ms. Rousseff has expanded Mr. Lula's left leaning "bolsa familia," or "family allowance" program - where poor families receive a stipend in exchange for vaccinating their children and sending them to school. The initiative has played a key role in reducing the poverty rate in Brazil by 40 percent and cutting extreme poverty - defined as families struggling to obtain enough food - by 52 percent since 2003, according to Pablo Fajnzylber, the World Bank's lead economist in Brazil. 
Ms. Rousseff has vowed to eliminate extreme poverty and has enacted one of the most sweeping affirmative action programs in the Western hemisphere in public universities.
The bold moves are needed. Because of the global economic downturn, growth in Brazil has stalled. After a decade of 4 percent annual growth that moved 35 million Brazilians into the country's middle class, GDP growth dropped to 2.7 percent in 2011. In the first half of this year, Brazil's economy grew at an anemic .6 percent, the lowest of any BRIC nation. 
Ms. Rousseff, though, enjoys a 60 percent approval rating. The reason is simple: jobs. While unemployment rates in the United States and parts of Europe remain stubbornly high, the unemployment rate in Brazil in September was 5.4 percent, far below the historic high of 13 percent in 2003. 
Brazil's challenges remain enormous. If it hopes to revive its economy, Ms. Rousseff must convince a deeply fractured federal legislature to enact sweeping tax, regulatory and education reforms that will allow Brazil to move beyond a commodity- and consumer-driven economy. There are plenty of skeptics, as Simon Romero reported.
Ms. Rousseff and Mr. Campos have their flaws but they should be applauded for breaking free of blindly ideological approaches to economic growth. In too many countries, politicians present voters with a stark choice between sweeping austerity or state largesse.
Europeans and Americans are not used to looking to Latin America for economic guidance. Pernambuco suggests they should.

HEADLINE: Romney Returns to Iowa for One Last Shot at Victory

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The Romney campaign went to Iowa hoping to reverse some bad luck there. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES - Holding four events in four states, Mitt Romney kicked off his second consecutive day of packed campaigning Sunday in an attempt to edge out President Obama - who polls show holds a slight lead in several critical battleground states - in the final 48 hours before Election Day.
On the busy schedule: Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Speaking at an early morning rally here to a crowd of 4,400, Mr. Romney implored voters to turn out for him on Tuesday.
"I need Iowa," Mr. Romney said. "I need Iowa so we can win the White House and take back America, keep it strong, make sure we always remain the hope of the earth. I'm counting on you."
Iowa is a state that has bedeviled the Romney campaign since the very beginning. In 2008, his failure to win over social conservatives here - and his subsequent second-place finish to Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas - helped dash his presidential hopes.
This time around, Mr. Romney seemed to have won the Iowa caucuses by eight votes, only to have the victory overturned and handed to Rick Santorum (by 34 votes) just two days before the South Carolina primaries.
Aides privately joke that if the race goes to a recount, the hold-up will be in Iowa - the state on which they just haven't quite been able to get a grip.
But Iowa is also the state that first launched Mr. Obama four years ago, and a state where the president hasn't quite been able to rekindle the enthusiasm and sense of hope that galvanized his 2008 bid. The Des Moines Register, which endorsed him four years ago, switched its support to Mr. Romney this year, making the same case against the president that Mr. Romney offers on the stump.
 "The president's best efforts to resuscitate the stumbling economy have fallen short," wrote the editorial board. "Nothing indicates it would change with a second term in the White House."
Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa introduced Mr. Romney at the rally, and tried to remind the state's voters about what he said were the president's failed promises.
 "Iowans feel betrayed," Mr. Branstad said. "Almost a sense of - not only disappointed, but almost a sense of betrayal that our principles of sound budgeting and responsible government have been ignored by this administration for four straight years."
 He concluded, "Iowa's message for Obama is: it's time for a change. It's time for you to go back to Chicago."
 Mr. Romney, speaking from teleprompters - which he has used on and off since he rolled out his closing argument on Friday - attacked Mr. Obama for not achieving any real bipartisanship in Washington.
"Instead of building bridges, he's made the divide between our parties wider," Mr. Romney said. "Let me tell you why it is he's fallen so far short of what he's promised: it's because he cared more about a liberal agenda than he did about repairing the economy."
Leading the crowd in a call-and-response, he continued: "I mean, do you think Obamacare created jobs? Did his war on coal, oil and gas create jobs? Did Dodd-Frank regulations help banks make more loans? Does raising taxes put people to work?"
"No," cried out the crowd, in response to each question.
Though Mr. Romney's voice was hoarse, he gave a longer-than-usual stump speech - just over 30 minutes - and seemed energized by the response of the crowd. 
"We are Americans!" he enthused suddenly. "We can do anything!"

HEADLINE: At Minnesota Rally, Ryan Emphasizes Bipartisanship

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Expanding the campaign map into a state next to his own, Representative Paul D. Ryan held his first rally in Minnesota in the dwindling hours of the race on Sunday, dividing remarks between criticism of President Obama for failing to lead and promising that a Romney White House would reach across the partisan chasm as the president had not. 

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS -- Expanding the campaign map into a state next to his own, Representative Paul D. Ryan held his first rally in Minnesota in the dwindling hours of the race on Sunday, dividing remarks between criticism of President Obama for failing to lead and promising that a Romney White House would reach across the partisan chasm as the president had not.
The boisterous cheers and clatter of thunder sticks from a crowd that his campaign numbered at 6,500, one of the largest Mr. Ryan has drawn on his own, may have given him reason to wish he had visited Democratic-leaning Minnesota more often.
It is a state where the Romney-Ryan campaign has only recently decided to invest its resources, which is either a sign that it believes that the electoral map has widened, or evidence that it feels its chances in the usual battlegrounds are diminishing.
Mr. Ryan, who was chosen as Mitt Romney's running mate for his ability to excite the conservative base, made one of his strongest appeals yet to bipartisanship. "Minnesota and Wisconsin, Wisconsinites and Minnesotans, we are bipartisan states," he said. "We know you have to work with people across the aisle because they're with us, they're part of us, they're in our own families." 
Mr. Ryan delighted in playing up his ties to Minnesota, telling supporters he woke up Sunday morning in Green Bay, Wis., and was happy to find an ice-fishing show on television. "I've got a 15-year-old Jiffy power auger," he told supporters, thousands of whom were in an airplane hangar and others outside -- assuming that Minnesotans would understand the reference to an ice-drilling tool.
In one breath Mr. Ryan blistered Mr. Obama for failing to meet Republican leaders from the Senate or the House since July.
In the next, he described Mr. Romney's record as a Massachusetts governor of working with a heavily Democratic legislature.
"Did he demean them?" he said of Mr. Romney. "Did he demagogue them? No. He met with them every single Monday. He reached across the aisle. He did not compromise principle; he found common ground, and he did what he said he was going to do: he balanced the budget each and every year without raising taxes."
"That's leadership," he added. "That's the kind of leader we need. That's what he does."
Mr. Ryan spoke as if the bipartisan gridlock in Washington was the fault only of the president and Democrats. Yet, in the same speech in which he called the Obama administration "the most partisan White House I have ever seen," he also praised the leadership of Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, the divisive founder of the Tea Party Caucus in the House.
Mr. Ryan has told aides that if he becomes vice president, he plans to meet regularly with senators and House members from both parties in an effort to gain bipartisan support for sweeping tax and entitlement overhauls he and Mr. Romney propose. But Democrats on the House Budget Committee, which Mr. Ryan leads, say he has no track record of compromising with them, despite being well liked.
Mr. Ryan repeated the litany of grim economic markers that have always been the Republicans' most forceful argument against a second Obama term. He cited an unemployment rate higher now than on the day Mr. Obama took office, rising national debt and the highest poverty rate in a generation.
He personalized the jobs statistics, mentioning a high school friend laid off from a $25-an-hour job at a General Motors plant in Mr. Ryan's native Janesville, Wis., who now works for $9 an hour without benefits at a QuikTrip convenience store.
"We have family and friends that we know of who are in their 40s or their 50s or their 60s, prime working years, they're out of a job or they're out of a good job," he said.
He also found fanciful ways to invoke bipartisanship. Noticing a sign reading "Vikings for Romney," Mr. Ryan chuckled. "Look at this," he said. "Even Viking fans and Packer fans can lay down together. This country is coming together. We can bridge our differences."

HEADLINE: What We Already Know

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: There's quite a bit we can tote up before the returns come in. 

 BODY:
There are a number of conclusions that can be drawn from the 2012 presidential contest without trying to predict the winner. As the polls are about to open, let's look at some of these developments, which fall into four broad categories that will shape the future of politics.
Demographic Trends : The first major development (or non-development) revealed by this year's campaign is that the pro-Democratic demographic tidal wavethreatening to swamp the Republican Party has not crested. The overwhelmingly white Republican Party remains competitive.
The primary factor keeping Romney within reach of President Obama is his decisive margin among white voters. African-Americans and Hispanics remain solidly Democratic. Blacks back Obama by the same 91 point margin that he had in 2008. Obama's margin of support among Hispanics, 69-21, is substantially larger than his 67-31 margin 4 years ago. (The 2008 data is from exit polls in which by definition there are no undecided voters; the 2012 data still have a bloc of the undecided.)
The demographic threat to the Republican Party grows out of the fact that every four years the electorate becomes roughly two percent less white and two percent more minority, primarily as a result of the increase in the Hispanic and Asian-American populations and the relatively low birth rate among whites. By my computation, this translates into a modest 0.85 percentage point gain for Democrats and 0.85 percentage point loss for Republicans every four years. In other words, the changing composition of the electorate gives Democrats an additional built-in advantage of 1.7 percentage points every four years.
Many analysts and strategists were convinced that Obama's victory with 53 percent of the vote in 2008 marked the tipping point in terms of this demographic transition, but in 2010 Republicans reaffirmed the continuing viability of the party's "white" strategy, winning with 62 percent of the white votes cast, the highest margin in a non-presidential year since the start of exit polling in 1972.
The white strategy will be tested once again on Tuesday, when election-day exit polls will provide a verdict. (In general, election-day exit polls are more conclusive than pre-election surveys, with 44 percent of those questioned in 2008 responding, in contrast to a 9 percent response rate in pre-election polls this year.)
Even if Obama wins, however, the Republicans are unlikely to change course on immigration policy in order to court Hispanic votes. Instead, a Romney loss will encourage party leaders to blame his ideological inconsistency, his lack of charisma and his moderate past for the defeat, rather than to swiftly initiate a major re-evaluation of the party's approach to ethnic or racial minorities.
The election-day exit polls will be the most conclusive, with response rates of 44 percent in 2008 much higher than for pre-election polling, which had response rates of 9 percent in 2012. The Republican commitment to remaining a predominantly white party has been profoundly reinforced by growing evidence of declining white support for Obama. Survey data from both the Washington Post and the Pew Research Center show white backing of Obama dropping from 43 percent in 2008 to 37 percent by the end of this October.
There is another crucial demographic issue: Obama's decision to devote huge blocks of time and resourcesto winning the votes of women may backfire, accentuating Democratic liabilities as the party of race and gender preferences and accelerating defections among men. My Times colleague Ross Douthat has written incisively about the shortcomings of Obama's approach to targeting women voters.
There are, I think, additional risks to Obama's approach. Forget race and gender for a moment: focusing on any particular demographic group is likely to revive the image of the Democratic Party as a collection of "special interests" seeking advantage, rather than a coalition supportive of a broader policy agenda. There is some evidence that the strategy of courting women may have done more to alienate males than to win over females. For example, Frank Newport, the editor in chief of the Gallup poll, found in an Oct. 23 survey that:
Barack Obama's support is down seven percentage points among men versus three points among women. In Gallup's latest 21-day rolling average of likely voter preferences, based on interviewing conducted Oct. 1-21, Romney leads Obama by 14 points among men, whereas Obama and John McCain were tied among men in Gallup's final pre-election estimate in 2008. Obama currently leads Romney by eight percentage points among women, whereas he led McCain by 14 among women in 2008.
Obama's tactics vis-à-vis women also risk the loss of some support among economically liberal but socially conservative Catholic voters who find the focus on contraception and abortion - under the rubric of women's rights - problematic.
 Health Care: The second major development of the 2012 campaign has been the failure of Paul Ryan to emerge as the white hot ideological flash point that many on the left and right expected. Instead, from a purely political vantage point, Ryan has not only turned out to be an acceptable running mate - his home state, Wisconsin is unexpectedly in play - but his March 20, 2012 proposal to turn Medicare into a "premium support" (or voucher) plan has not, in and of itself, doomed Republican chances.
In practice, the Ryan Medicare proposal did not become a dagger aimed at the heart of the Republican Party. The Pew Research Center has found that the expected Republican-Romney vulnerability on Medicare never materialized: in a Sept. 12-16 survey, Pew noted that voters, by a 51-38 margin - a 13-point difference - believed that Obama would deal with Medicare better than Romney. By October 24-28, however, Obama's advantage had fallen to 48-43 - just 5 points.
The same survey showed that from 2008 to 2012, Obama experienced his largest declines in backing from two specific age groups: the young, whose support for the president dropped by 13 points from a 34 point advantage in 2008 (66-32), to a 21 point advantage in 2012 (56-35); and the elderly, who supported John McCain in 2008 by 8 points, 53-45, and who now support Romney over Obama by a robust 19 points, 57-38.
This suggests a couple of things. First, that the Republican attacks on Obamacare, particularly the charge that Obamacare will cut $716 billion from Medicare over ten years, have had a substantial impact.
Perhaps more significant, the survey suggests that Democrats may have lost much of their overwhelming advantage among voters on the broad issue of health care, including Medicare. Less than four years ago, Democrats held an impressive lead on this issue. An Ipsos-Reuters survey conducted after the 2008 election in late November found that voters trusted Democrats over Republicans to reform health care by a 62-23 margin, a 39-point difference.
 Truth: An equally significant development has been the strategic decision of the Romney campaign to set new standards in the use of untrue campaign claims.
The ultimate test case of whether it is possible to lie and get away with it will be the outcome in Ohio, where Romney is running ads in open disregard of the truth.
Over the past two weeks, with Ohio once again a key battleground, the Romney campaign has falsely alleged in speeches and in television commercials that Chrysler plans to shift Jeep manufacturing and jobs from the United State to China.
"I saw a story today that one of the great manufacturers in this state, Jeep, now owned by the Italians, is thinking of moving all production to China," Romney told a rally in Defiance, Ohio on Oct. 25. His commercial declares:
Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.
Glen Kessler, the Washington Post fact checker, gave Romney his worst rating, four Pinocchios, for the speech and the ad. Ohio newspapers have written tough editorials and news stories challenging Romney.
If Romney wins Ohio, every campaign in future elections is going to give much more serious consideration to lying and to open defiance of media rebuttals as a legitimate campaign expedient.
 Ideological Conflict: The most important development in the 2012 presidential election is something that did not happen. Many observers expected that the contest this year would draw a clear ideological line between the two parties.
This expectation grew out of the fact that House Republicans, with backing from their partisan allies in the Senate, twice approved budgets radically cutting back the American welfare state that has expanded steadily since the 1930s.
Romney's decision during the Republican primaries to endorse the 2012 Republican budget and his continuing warnings that America is in danger of becoming an "entitlement state" further signaled an ideological battle. Romney's selection of Ryan - the author and leading advocate of the Republican budget - as his running mate further raised the ideological stakes. Democrats at all levels geared up for a counterattack.
The groundwork was laid for a confrontation of unprecedented proportions. But the candidates and the campaigns decided against doing battle on such high ground.
The Obama forces focused on Bain Capital instead of on the Ryan Budget. In the crucial first presidential debate, when Obama had the chance to force Romney to provide specifics and defend his domestic spending cuts, Obama chose instead not to challenge his opponent on this front.
Romney, in turn, has clearly decided that his best chance lies in moving toward the center, muting the Republican call for a shrunken safety net, ducking the Republican commitment to end abortion rights, and avoiding discussion of the belief he expressed behind closed doors that nearly half the population, 47 percent, has been corrupted by government dependency - a conviction widely shared in the conservative community.
Looking back, an election measuring support for the conservative agenda was too much to hope for. Politicians, especially those as malleable as Romney, are inherently adverse to risky strategies, and especially averse to testing voters by giving them an accurate assessment of the costs of their favored policies.
Sharp ideological choices are alien to the American political tradition. Republicans in the House of Representatives have been pushing the margins in this area, but the current contest shows that backpedaling still dominates the post-convention stage of presidential elections.
If Republicans retain control of the House as expected, the same major question will arise regardless of who wins the White House:
Will it be possible to constrain the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party, the wing that has effectively dominated policy making since the 2010 midterm election? This faction has demonstrated a willingness to risk economic collapse in its determination to reject compromise.
The country faces the larger danger of going over the "fiscal cliff" this winter if it fails to address the issues of pending tax hikes and the sequestration of $100 billion in defense and domestic spending.
Both Obama and Romney have demonstrated a relatively insipid leadership style. It is difficult to imagine either of them controlling the destructive forces within the conservative movement or the crisis of government spending vastly exceeding its income. Whichever party steps forward with real solutions will inevitably get kicked in the teeth by voters. At a time when both parties have consigned themselves to a politics of equivocation and retreat, the far right is the only force in Washington with a kamikaze commitment to a defined agenda. The presidential election does not appear likely to produce an effective counterforce.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Spares Seaside Art

BYLINE: By TED LOOS

 BODY:
ATLANTIC CITY -- As devastating a hit as New Jersey took from Hurricane Sandy, the blow was softer than had been feared for this seaside gambling mecca directly in the storm's path. None of the waterfront casinos, for instance, reported major damage.
The hurricane even spared the first phase of a planned five-year, $13 million public art project here called ''Artlantic,'' scheduled to make its debut on Friday, that is attempting to transform a city that has never offered much in the way of public space beyond the famous Boardwalk.
''Artlantic: wonder,'' as the first phase is called, cost $3 million and encompasses two sites, including what was, until a month ago a barren, seven-acre expanse of grass and gravel right off the Boardwalk in the center of town.
This prime real estate, where a casino once stood, was a highly visible eyesore. Before he was grappling with the hurricane's destruction -- and before he got into a war of words with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey about evacuation plans -- Atlantic City's mayor, Lorenzo T. Langford, said in an interview that he had taken to calling this site ''the hole in the middle of the doughnut.'' 
The lot is now dominated by two large outdoor spaces for art, both surrounded by gently terraced, amphitheaterlike hillsides covered in sod. About 22,000 sod staples, inserted just a day before the storm struck, helped the lawn survive the onslaught of wind and water.
''The inspiration for the form came from Atlantic City, just as the inspiration for all of the other works will always be coming from the city,'' said Lance Fung, the freelance curator who designed ''Artlantic.'' Specifically, he added, ''it came from the history of the roller coasters on Steel Pier, which is emblazed in everyone's memory that knows the area.''
Mr. Fung, the principal of Fung Collaboratives, an arts organization, is best known for organizing the 2006 version of ''Snow Show'' -- an exhibition in which works were made of snow, ice and water -- at the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. He said he was well aware not just of the different context here, in such an urban setting, but also of the sensitivity of opening an art project when some people have lost their homes. ''Art has this incredible power of sending out a positive message,'' he said. ''This was true before the storm, and now even more so.''
On one end of the site a large sculpture by Kiki Smith, ''Her'' (2003), will stand surrounded by a seasonally changing ''red garden,'' designed by Ms. Smith.
The sculpture depicts a woman embracing a fawn, which Ms. Smith said she chose partly because it dovetailed with Mr. Fung's overall theme of man interacting with nature. In addition, she said, ''it has some austerity to it, and I liked the idea of it in that context.''
She added that she had always wanted to create a red garden that would remain that color all year. Mr. Fung set her up with the landscape designer Balmori Associates, which led all of ''Artlantic: wonder,'' to turn the idea into reality.
Opposite Ms. Smith's work, in the other amphitheaterlike space, will be an installation of a pirate ship by Ilya and Emilia Kabakov. (Luckily it was still boxed in a truck on Long Island when the storm struck.) Around the outside of both mounds is an illuminated, text-based work by Robert Barry.
For the other site to be unveiled on Friday an 8,500-square-foot portion of a parking lot a few blocks away by the Boardwalk, Mr. Fung asked the artist John Roloff to make a large impact in a much smaller space.
Mr. Roloff's ''Étude Atlantis'' features a wooden-walled stage painted with bold, illusionistic stripes, in front of which is a sunken cistern meant to suggest a passage to the other side of the planet, a reference to the lost city of Atlantis.
When not being used for performances this stage will be an abstract artwork on its own. Durable asphalt paint that had cured properly, and a sturdy base built with strong winds in mind helped the work survive the storm.
The cost of ''Artlantic'' is being split by a new marketing agency, the Atlantic City Alliance, and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, formed in 1984 -- both of which receive funds from local businesses.
The project's organizers are using private land that is on loan for ''Artlantic: wonder,'' a risky approach for a large-scale public art project. There's no set agreement for how long the works can stay put, and the land could be developed by the owners, and the works removed, at any time.
''It's a unique, crazy thing,'' Mr. Fung said.
But the organizers said they hope that the installations, however long they last, will enhance the image of Atlantic City.
''One of the glaring gaps here is really the arts and culture scene,'' said Elizabeth Cartmell, president of the Atlantic City Alliance, and ''one of the other gaps is the lack of economic development in some of these empty, huge, blighted lots.'' She added, ''art is a leading-edge perception driver.''
Because of the temporary nature of the property loans, cooperation from the owners of the two sites was relatively easy.
''They've said, 'O.K., but when we have an opportunity, we want them back,' '' Ms. Cartmell said. ''Which is fine for us.''
But because there are installations that are still years away -- works are expected to be introduced gradually over the five years of the project -- Mr. Fung said that he and the alliance hoped the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority would buy the land, creating permanent public art.
Atlantic City's history of focusing on the tourism district for development and civic projects like this one has made some residents adopt a wait-and-see attitude about ''Artlantic.''
''I do think it has healing potential poststorm,'' said Joseph Rubenstein, an anthropology professor at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey near here who is active in community groups and has worked to dot Atlantic City with gardens and murals. But the history of the city ''has been that all the development is on the boards or two of three blocks in,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, referring to the Boardwalk area. ''Public art we can only applaud, but it has to be in combination with work on the rest of the city.''
Mr. Fung said that he had made serious efforts to get year-round residents emotionally invested in ''Artlantic.'' Local performers will appear at the opening, and interest in the project has been so great that area painting, plumbing and carpentry unions have donated their time to help build ''Artlantic: wonder.''
''That means they believe in us,'' Mr. Fung said. ''One of the most heartening things'' about the days since Hurricane Sandy struck, he added, ''is all the e-mails I have been getting from locals asking, 'How is the art project?' ''

HEADLINE: Twitter's Window On the Election

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH

 BODY:
In Florida, voters responded most when Mitt Romney posted about education and when President Obama did the same about foreign affairs. In Ohio, Mr. Obama's posted about gay rights, more so than any other topic, held the most traction. For Mr. Romney, it was his posts about the economy.
Twitter introduced an interactive map on Thursday showing which of the candidates' tweets drove the most engagement - measured by the number of times the tweet was reposted or favorited - on Twitter at the national and state levels. 
Nationwide, Mr. Obama's most popular post was, "No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money." His second most popular post was actually a quote from Vice President Biden about women's rights: "VP Biden: I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people, women, that they can't control their bodies." Interestingly, at the state level, that post resonated most with voters in Wyoming, followed by Iowa, South Dakota and West Virginia - states where women's rights are not considered the pivotal issue.
Mr. Romney's most popular post was this remark on Sept. 11th: "On this most somber day, America is united under God in its quest for peace and freedom at home and across the world." Second most popular was a comment about wealth distribution: "I am running for president to get us creating wealth again - not to redistribute it."
In swing states, Twitter's map tells an interesting, and sometimes counter intuitive story. According to the latest polls, Virginia, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Colorado and Florida are still toss-ups.
In the last presidential election, the President won Virginia by seven percentage points. This year, the race is expected to be much closer. There, voters' response was highest when the candidates posted about issues related to retirement.
The same was true for Wisconsin. Democrats carried the state in the last six presidential elections, but the addition of one of their own, Representative Paul D. Ryan, to Mr. Romney's ticket has kept the race tight. There, retirement was also the issue that seemed to have the most traction on Twitter.
In Iowa, where six electoral votes are up for grabs, voters were most engaged when Mr. Obama posted about topics related to energy and the environment and when Romney posted about health care.
Nevada voters responded most to Obama's comments on taxes. Mr. Obama's most popular post in that state was "1,240,000 middle-class families in Nevada could face a tax increase under Mitt Romney." Mr. Romney's posts about education drove the highest level of engagement. "With over 60k jobs lost & the highest unemployment rate in the nation, Nevadans aren't better off under @BarackObama," was Mr. Romney's most popular post.
In Colorado, women's issues have taken center stage after women proved crucial to two Democratic victories in the 2010 races for Senate and governor. But according to Twitter's data, Colorado voters responded in the largest numbers when Mr. Obama posted about taxes. For Mr. Romney, it was his remarks about terrorism.
If, as in the 2004 election, the race comes down to Florida, then the candidates may do well to defy conventional wisdom that retirement is all Florida voters care about. Within Florida, Mr. Romney's posts about retirement did not resonate as well as those about education and foreign affairs. Likewise, Mr. Obama's posts about topics relevant to retirement had less traction than his those about terrorism and foreign affairs.
Despite the perception that Twitter is just a place for East and West coasters to talk to each other, Twitter's map shows a surprising level of engagement in states like Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma. The opposite proved true for New Hampshire and Vermont, where Twitter noted it was not able to collect enough data to draw conclusions.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bonuses On Wall St. Expected To Edge Up

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Wall Street employees, whose paychecks have often been cut in recent years, are likely to get a slight bump in their bonuses this year. The catch: the increase will come on top of one of the worst years for bank pay in recent memory.
Year-end incentives, which include cash bonuses and stock awards, will be flat to up to 10 percent higher when compared with last year, according to a closely watched compensation survey to be released on Monday. But firms drastically cut costs, employment and, as a result, pay, in 2011. 
"It has been a slow recovery, just like the economy," said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the privately held firm that conducted the survey. "Following a year when year-end incentives declined by as much as 30 percent, the fact that many firms are able to keep this year's bonuses flat or slightly larger is notable."
Johnson Associates, based in New York, surveyed 10 public asset management firms, eight major banks and more than a dozen other financial institutions.
Business on Wall Street has picked up somewhat in 2012, but firms are still cutting both compensation and other expenses to save money and improve their profits.
Just last week, UBS said it was laying off 10,000 employees worldwide, or 15 percent of its staff. Most of these cuts will come from its investment bank, which houses businesses like sales and trading. Firms have found these units, where bonuses were once lucrative, more costly to sustain in the wake of regulatory changes.
Investment bankers, whose pay has fallen consistently in recent years, should not hold out for a pay increase this year, Mr. Johnson said. Bankers' pay is expected to drop as much as 10 percent this year. "Bankers have gone from masters of the universe to masters of their block," he joked.
Roy C. Smith, a professor of finance at New York University, said firms had cut positions since the financial crisis as revenue fell. Firms are also contending with regulations that are forcing them to sell off certain segments, or at least cut back, like proprietary trading, or trading for their own accounts. "They are cutting back as much as they can get away with," he said.
Wall Street firms set aside money all year for bonuses and allocate it to employees after they know their year-end results. Top executives and boards are now starting to think about who will make what, and the stakes are high.
These bonuses are typically in addition to a base salary, which on Wall Street can range from $100,000 to more than $1 million for top executives.
Roughly half of all the revenue generated on Wall Street goes toward compensation, and most of it is paid in the form of a year-end bonus. So far this year, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have set aside $92.49 billion to pay employees, down slightly from $92.81 billion in the year ago period, according to Johnson Associates.
It's too early to tell what this will mean for individual bonuses in early 2013. Investors will know in January when fourth-quarter results are announced how much firms have set aside to cover compensation and benefits.
Bond or fixed-income traders, who had the deepest declines in 2011, are projected to gain the biggest increase in the bonuses this year, from 10 to 20 percent, Mr. Johnson said. Employees in less volatile businesses, like asset management and commercial banking, will take in roughly what they did last year, or possibly be given an increase of as much as 10 percent.
Employees at the firms' hedge funds and private equity units can expect, on average, no increase to a 5 percent increase in bonuses, the survey predicted.
Bonuses for top executives, like Lloyd C. Blankfein at Goldman Sachs, will stay roughly the same as well, falling or rising about 5 percent. In 2011 Mr. Blankfein made about $12 million.
"These figures, compared to what real people make, are enormous, but compared to what Wall Street executives made in 2006 and 2007 it's a fraction of the pay," Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Blankfein, for instance, made $68.5 million for his work in 2007, the year before the financial crisis. At the time it was a record payday for a chief executive of a big Wall Street firm.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Voice Is Strained, but Support on the Trail Unstinting

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
RALEIGH, N.C. -- By Sunday, Bill Clinton sounded awful, as if he had been gargling with Liquid-Plumr. You could hear his voice dying steadily over the last 72 hours of campaigning: hoarse Friday in Florida, cracking Saturday across Virginia and dissolving fully to a slight husk here Sunday, after two stops in New Hampshire and before another in Minnesota.
''As you can see, I have given my voice in the service of my president,'' Mr. Clinton said, wheezing while introducing President Obama at a late-night set at a Bristow, Va., amphitheater on Saturday. He kept coughing, patting his chest and mouthing words that carried only muffled strains in chilly air. Black tea with honey and a steady diet of cough drops between events helped little.
It was as if the 42nd president could go fully silent at any second, except that he never did -- speaking for 25 minutes Saturday night and more than 40 at his nine solo shows over the weekend to cap off a campaign star turn that could not differ more from what many considered his more dutiful efforts for Mr. Obama four years ago. 
After talking (and pointing and gesticulating) for three-quarters of an hour before a crowd of 4,000 at an amusement park here Sunday night, Mr. Clinton spent an additional 10 minutes high-fiving his way along a rope line with a big grin.
If there has been one enduring lesson from his career, it is that the Big Dog is resilient. He can be disgraced, impeached, defeated -- but he comes back. The full spectacle of this has been on riveting, if raspy, display in the closing days of the presidential campaign.
Mr. Clinton, 66, has jumped into a hopscotch of battleground states in what -- depending on his wife's future plans -- may or may not be his last campaign tour as a Super Surrogate. He is scheduled to appear, if not be heard, at four stops across Pennsylvania on Monday.
He also includes a fair amount in his speeches about Bill Clinton: his enthusiasm (higher than four years ago), his legacy (''I am the only living former president that ever gave you a budget surplus'') and, yes, his wife, the mention of whom brings big applause and the occasional ''We love you, Hillary!'' cry from the crowd.
Whoever wins Tuesday, the 2012 campaign has solidified (or restored) Mr. Clinton's status as the hardest-working man in a game he loves and plays like no one else. ''The master, Bill Clinton,'' Mr. Obama called him on Saturday, hailing his predecessor as ''a great president and a great friend.''
Unsaid, at least here, is that Mr. Clinton has also been a salvation to Mr. Obama. He gave what was widely considered the best speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., rocking a strong endorsement of the president while arguably conveying the re-election rationale better than Mr. Obama or his campaign has.
''He has been our economic validator,'' Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said of Mr. Clinton.
Likewise, Mr. Clinton's presidency exemplifies what Mr. Obama is trying to make a case for. In the early 1990s, President Clinton also inherited a lagging economy, and then he led economic prosperity in his second term. Mr. Obama, who wrapped his former rival in a full-on hug onstage in Charlotte (their recent joint appearances have featured more cursory bro-hugs), said he should name Mr. Clinton to a new position known as Secretary for Explaining Stuff.
Out of public view, the former president has been equally tireless. In a 20-minute car ride Saturday after a rally in Chesapeake, Va., to the Norfolk airport, Mr. Clinton recorded 40 ''robo-calls'' for Democratic Congressional candidates across the country. In addition to headlining 37 rallies for Mr. Obama over the last seven weeks of the campaign (including events scheduled through Monday), Mr. Clinton is serving as a back-channel strategist for the re-election enterprise.
On the morning after the third debate between Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney on Oct. 22 in Boca Raton, Fla., Mr. Clinton met Mr. Messina for an impromptu breakfast meeting in a suite at a Hyatt Regency hotel in Chicago. Red-eyed after arriving from Boca Raton at 3:30 a.m. and subsisting on Coke Zero, Mr. Messina received, he said, a simple directive from former president, who was in Chicago to give a speech: I am yours in the final weeks. Mr. Clinton said he would undertake a heavy regimen in battleground states.
Previously, Mr. Clinton had served as an active behind-the-scenes strategist, speaking regularly to the president, Mr. Messina and David Axelrod, the senior strategist. He made suggestions on what themes the campaign should emphasize and where. He advocated, according to top officials, for Mr. Obama to run advertisements in Florida that portrayed Mr. Romney as a threat to Medicare and Medicaid -- something the campaign ultimately did. As he stumped across the state Friday, Mr. Clinton also drove home that portrayal.
During the Republican primary battle, Mr. Clinton also counseled Mr. Messina and Mr. Axelrod to ''have an early conversation'' with Democratic base voters in battleground states, so as not to let any disappointment they felt over Mr. Obama's record calcify into indifference.
But by far Mr. Clinton's most striking contributions have come in his natural Big Stage habitat. When Hurricane Sandy forced Mr. Obama off the campaign trail early last week, Mr. Clinton called Mr. Messina and suggested that he take on some of the events that the president would miss. Mr. Clinton stumped alone in Orlando, Fla., and with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Youngstown, Ohio.
He has hailed Mr. Obama's post-storm cooperation with Republican leaders like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and has ridiculed Mr. Romney as wishy-washy enough to ''be the chief contortionist for Cirque du Soleil.''
But subtext will inevitably abound in the Clinton orbit. For starters, while his ''friendship'' with the president is clearly improved, it remains a source of intrigue, given the strains that were sown during Mr. Obama's primary run against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008.
''This is not about relationships,'' said Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Clinton's close friend, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and a possible candidate for governor of Virginia, where he accompanied Mr. Clinton on Saturday. ''This is bigger than that.'' By ''bigger,'' Mr. McAuliffe meant that Mr. Clinton is chiefly concerned with the direction of the country, not his relationship with anyone.
It also calls to mind a maxim uttered often among Democrats, and not always with reverence: that it is ''all about the Clintons.'' And it is not difficult to view Mr. Clinton's investment in Mr. Obama's re-election without an eye to whether Mrs. Clinton runs in 2016, something that she has denied interest in but that many Democrats have urged.
It is also impossible to miss what is Mr. Clinton's most reliable applause line on the stump and something he manages to belt out in full voice.
''By the way,'' he says in praising Mr. Obama's foreign policy record, ''he's got a heck of a secretary of state, too.''
And the crowd always goes wild.

HEADLINE: After the Violence, the Rest of Their Lives

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Xavier McElrath-Bey drives past the dilapidated houses, liquor stores and vacant lots in his old neighborhood and sees the landmarks of his youth.
There is the house at 51st and Throop where, at 11, he huddled near some steps to avoid a rival gang member's gunfire; the sidewalk where he carved his gang nickname into the newly laid cement; the lot at 51st and Ada where Sam's store once stood, its back yard a convenient hideaway for weapons. Nearby is the abandoned building where, in 1989, he crossed the line from being a troubled 13-year-old, in and out of a detention center, to a 13-year-old convicted of murder.
Mr. McElrath-Bey, who spent 13 years in prison and is now 36, is not on a nostalgia tour of the violent streets that raised him. He is part of an effort to understand them, gathering data for an ambitious research project that for almost two decades has closely tracked the lives of more than 1,800 youths in Chicago who, as he did, entered the juvenile justice system at an early age. 
The subjects of the study, directed by Linda A. Teplin, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, were first interviewed between November 1995 and June 1998 at what is now the Cook County Temporary Juvenile Detention Center, long known as the Audy Home. They have been followed at intervals since then and will continue to be tracked throughout their adult lives.
Mr. McElrath-Bey's job as a field interviewer -- he was hired four years ago -- has allowed him to gain perspective on his own life. Traveling around the city to interview subjects, he sees the same chaotic family dynamics that landed him in foster care at 6, the hunger to belong that drew him to a gang at 11 and the bad decisions that led him to participate in a gang killing. He also sees the good decisions that helped him change course, leave the gang, complete a college degree while in prison, get a master's degree and move on to a steady job, a comfortable apartment on the North Side, a girlfriend and a 15-month-old daughter he dotes on.
''I get flashbacks every time I interview these guys who are getting out of prison,'' he said. ''I can relate to what they're going through.''
At a time when the homicide rate in Chicago has risen sharply, jumping 25 percent over all since last year and 100 percent or more in a few gang-heavy neighborhoods, the research project offers a portrait of both the perpetrators and the victims in struggling, gang-ridden neighborhoods.
Gang killings are nothing new in Chicago, and city officials have brought in federal agents and requested more police officers in an attempt to stem the increase. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has also thrown support behind community programs that seek to address gang problems.
But the study makes clear the challenges that such measures inevitably encounter.
Dr. Teplin said that when she and Karen Abram, the associate director of the project, proposed it, they were told it could not be done -- that it would be impossible to locate such transient and troubled groups year after year, impossible to gain their trust or persuade them to talk honestly about personal matters. ''People said: 'You'll never get these kids to cooperate. They won't talk to you,' '' Dr. Teplin recalled.
But the researchers hired trackers to find the study subjects as they moved through their lives, searching them out in other neighborhoods, in far-flung suburbs or in prison cells. They brought in street-savvy field interviewers like Mr. McElrath-Bey to talk with subjects in their homes instead of expecting them to show up for appointments at an office building downtown. The researchers paid the subjects small amounts for participating, sent them birthday cards and White Sox tickets and deposited pocket money in their prison commissary accounts.
The interviews became an expected ritual for many in the study.
Charles Hayes, 31, who spent much of his youth and early adulthood in prison or selling drugs, said that the experience reminded him of the self-examination practiced by the Jehovah's Witnesses in his family.
''They remind me of the past and what I was doing and what I'm doing now,'' he said of the researchers.
Now in its 17th year, the research has produced a rich trove of data and a raft of published papers. Yet its findings have gone largely unnoticed by policy makers and the public, Dr. Teplin said, perhaps in part because its focus is on problems largely affecting blacks and Hispanics in poor neighborhoods, both familiar and seemingly intractable.
''It's a segment of the population that many Americans don't think about, don't care about,'' Dr. Teplin said. ''What rivets Americans is the unexpected -- the Colorado massacre, mass school shootings. The everyday violence is something that doesn't concern most people.''
Based on the study's data, more than 80 percent of juveniles who enter the criminal justice system early in life have at some point belonged to a gang. Seventy percent of men and 40 percent of women have used a firearm. The average age of first gun use is 14. At any given time, 20 percent are incarcerated.
Unemployment is rampant: 71 percent of the men and 59 percent of the women are without jobs as adults. Of the 1,829 youths originally enrolled in the study, 119 have died, most of them violently -- a death rate three to five times as high as the one for Cook County men in the same age group over all and four times as high as the one for women. In all, 130 have been shot, shot at, stabbed or otherwise violently attacked. As a group, they show high rates of post-traumatic stress, depression and other psychiatric disorders.
Sandro Santoyo, 33, entered the study when he was 12 and has cycled in and out of prison repeatedly since then for crimes including aggravated battery and attempted murder. By his count, he has been shot six times, stabbed four times and run over by a van driven by rival gang members. That episode injured him so badly that he can no longer do the construction work he used to pick up between stints in prison, though he recently got a job at a furniture warehouse.
He wants a different life. ''It's time for me to take responsibility for my family,'' he said in an interview, but he added, ''It's really hard, it's hard to let go of things like that.''
Jason Shaughnessy, 31, sports a teardrop tattoo next to each eye -- gang markings, he said, that make him a constant target for members of rival gangs. He has spent 11 years and six months in prison, he said. Earlier this year, he suffered a stroke.
Mr. Shaughnessy said that he wanted to help young men avoid the life he has lived, but that he continued to use drugs and was currently out of jail on bond on two charges of aggravated battery.
''A lot of people say, 'You can do it, it's not too late,' and they're right, it's never too late to change your life,'' he said. ''But it could be too late to start training yourself to do things a different way than you've done for 31 years.''
Mr. McElrath-Bey said that he sometimes entered a home to do an interview and was overcome by ''a sense of despair that surrounds me.''
Yet he also meets subjects who, like him, have found a way out. Mr. Hayes, for example, who says, ''I've been arrested so many times I lost count,'' is now a supervisor at the transmission company where he has worked for the last five years. His job gives him a legal way to support his three children A few years ago he moved to an apartment in a Chicago suburb. In February, he married.
''I wouldn't want my kids to grow up like I grew up,'' he said.
The researchers are in the process of trying to tease out the factors that allow youths to succeed despite considerable obstacles. But in Mr. McElrath-Bey's view, such transformations often have little to do with the promises of politicians or the cyclical crackdowns by law enforcement. Instead they are often prompted by less tangible forces: the support of a parent, the insistence of a girlfriend, the encouragement of a priest or pastor, the mobilization of a community, the birth of a child.
Mr. McElrath-Bey began his own move toward a different life at 18, as he sat in a prison cell serving a sentence for helping to lure a 14-year-old rival gang member into an abandoned building, where he was beaten to death, and later setting the body on fire.
He fought against incarceration at first, staying involved with the gang, earning a year in solitary confinement for assaulting a corrections officer. But for the first time in his life, he also began to reflect.
''You can't help but wonder how life could have been different,'' he said, ''and of course, in those rare moments you start to realize all those people that you hurt. I thought about my case, I thought about my family, I thought about my sister, who was out there starting to get involved in gangs, and it all started to eat away at me.''
Now when he goes back to his old neighborhood, he still feels a connection to his old life.
''A great part of who you are is that culture,'' he said, ''and because of that, you're always going to identify with that group, you're always going to feel that affinity toward your community and your neighborhood.''
But he is in a different place now.
''This is what you were born into, this is the misery of your reality,'' he tells young men who remind him of himself at an earlier age. ''But you yourself have the power and strength to rise above this.''

HEADLINE: In Tight 2012 Election, Bill Clinton Is Sure Winner

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Whoever captures the White House on Nov. 6, the election season produced one clear winner: William Jefferson Clinton.
The 42nd president, starting with his speech at the Democratic National Convention establishing the predicate for President Barack Obama's economic message, set a new standard for effective political surrogates. Republicans, including more than a few who voted, on specious grounds, to impeach him 14 years ago, extolled the good old days of the Clinton presidency. There may be no more popular American political figure today.
If Mr. Obama wins, he should be much more solicitous of Bill Clinton in a second term. The relationship between the two political figures has improved. Mr. Clinton's stature is off the charts, given his unsurpassed political instincts and standing at home and around the globe, and the fact that his wife will be the early favorite to be the next Democratic presidential nominee. 
If Mitt Romney wins, Mr. Clinton becomes the patriarch of the loyal opposition, the most effective advocate against Republican efforts to govern from the conservative right.
''Bill Clinton has an incredible shelf life,'' says Vic Fazio, a former top Democratic U.S. representative. ''Whether speaking to the convention or working as a small fund-raiser, the magic is still there. Bill Clinton never walks away.''
If the president is defeated he'll remain a historic figure, the first African-American president. Much of his legacy, including the health care bill and financial regulation overhaul, will be shredded by Republicans. And Democrats will say the defeat was self-inflicted because the president and his top advisers decided to coast during the first debate. He could have knocked out Mr. Romney; instead he let his opponent back in the fight.
In defeat, Mr. Romney would be a political pariah. Other defeated candidates -- Bob Dole, John McCain -- remain respected figures within the party. Mr. Romney will be seen as a mediocre candidate, a chameleon, and an unprincipled political opportunist who snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. There will be few invitations to Republican celebrations like the Lincoln Day dinners.
Political pollsters have a lot at stake, too. Two of the most controversial are the Republican-centered Rasmussen Reports, whose daily surveys tend to favor that party, and the Democratic-oriented Public Policy Polling, whose surveys tilt in the other direction. What they share is a methodology of huge volume, because they conduct automatic surveys, or robo-calls, in which respondents simply push keypad buttons to express preferences.
The more established pollsters doubt the validity of this approach, because it includes very few mobile phones. Both Rasmussen Reports and P.P.P. insist they adjust for this omission.
Other major pollsters pay extra to buy a mobile-phone sample. Peter D. Hart, who conducts the Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls, says 30 percent of his respondents are mobile-phoneusers. J. Ann Selzer, who polls for Bloomberg and The Des Moines Register, sets the quota at 25 percent.
The Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg argues that at least a third of voters would be missed without contacting mobile phones, which are disproportionately used by young people and minorities.
No pollster has more at stake than the venerable Gallup organization, whose daily tracking poll includes 50 percent mobile phones. It has consistently given Mr. Romney an advantage over the past several weeks. Other pollsters question Gallup's methodology for defining likely voters, arguing that it's outdated; Gallup says it stands by its results.
Then there is Nate Silver, a politics and sports statistical guru who runs thousands of models. He became a legend in 2008 when models for his Web site FiveThirtyEight.com correctly predicted all 35 Senate contests and 49 of the 50 state outcomes in the presidential race. Now at The New York Times, he says there is a greater than 80 percent probability that Mr. Obama wins re-election. The Silver legend will either be embellished or diminished this week.
There's no such risk for Bill Clinton, who will be riding high even in a Romney presidency. He'll be the Democrats' patriarch as he seeks to persuade his wife to pick up the torch in 2016. He'd do the same in a second Obama term. It's more interesting to speculate about the role he might play in that administration.
That largely would be up to Mr. Obama. If he is smart -- and if he ignores the pettiness of some advisers -- he'll periodically talk to his predecessor on policy even more than politics. In the first term, Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, regularly checked in with Bill Clinton. The current director of the National Economic Council, Gene B. Sperling, still does. Before the Democratic convention, the president only went through the motions of consulting with and cultivating Mr. Clinton.During this campaign, the 66-year-old former president has done about 100 events, helping more than 50 congressional candidates and going on dozens of occasions wherever Team Obama asked. Late Saturday night, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama electrified a Virginia crowd of 24,000. A raspy-voiced Mr. Clinton effusively praised the incumbent, especially on the economy, and devastated Mitt Romney's economic positions and his flip-flops on the rescue of the U.S. automobile industry. A buoyant Mr. Obama calls his predecessor the ''secretary of explainin' stuff.''
Hours later they headed to New Hampshire for a final joint rally; Mr. Clinton would then be off to Pennsylvania to thwart a last-minute Republican bid for an upset.

HEADLINE: France Tries to Lure Filmmakers

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- When Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro and Tommy Lee Jones arrived in France recently for the shooting of ''Malavita,'' a new mobster movie, they did not have to stray far from the set. While Hollywood stars often shuttle between cramped trailers on movie lots and five-star hotels an hour away, the cast of ''Malavita'' was provided with luxury suites overlooking the studio.
The promoters of the newly opened Studios de Paris hope that French touches like these will give them an edge in a growing global competition to lure international film production and the millions of dollars it leaves behind for local businesses. Despite a troubled economy and an uncertain outlook for the media industry, a worldwide boom in studio-building is under way, with ambitious projects taking shape from the banks of the Seine to China.
Studios de Paris is part of a &#x20ac;180 million, or $230 million, project called Cité du Cinéma, which has transformed a formerly gritty part of the Paris suburb of Saint Denis. It is centered on a decommissioned and renovated power plant, which houses a film school, a movie studio with nine stages and the headquarters of EuropaCorp, one France's biggest television and film producers. 
Cité du Cinéma is the brainchild of Luc Besson, chairman of EuropaCorp, director of movies like ''The Fifth Element'' and producer of the current box office hit ''Taken 2.'' Mr. Besson's plan dates to 1997, when he wanted to shoot ''The Fifth Element'' in France but could not find a facility big enough. Instead, he had to use Pinewood Studios in Britain.
''We built this site for French films but especially for the big American productions that generally go to Italy, to Luxembourg, to Switzerland or to England, but never to France, because we didn't have the tools to accommodate them,'' Mr. Besson said in an e-mail.
''I've worked a lot with American actors,'' he added. ''I know how the studios operate. We have the best technicians in the world, and now we have the most beautiful stages as well.''
While France has the most vibrant domestic movie industry in Europe, many of the hundreds of films shot in the country annually are small-scale, character-led productions, not the big-budget special-effects extravaganzas that are Hollywood's specialty. It does not take much of a studio to shoot scenes of awkward family silences around the dinner table.
EuropaCorp is the exception to this rule, making English-language, blockbuster-style pictures that regularly generate half of their box office receipts in the United States. But France has struggled to attract free-spending Hollywood productions, even as Britain, Germany and other European countries draw ever more of these projects. Studios de Paris aims to close the gap.
With its giant former turbine hall and 9,500 square meters, or about 100,000 square feet, of sound stages, Cité du Cinéma, which was financed by a mix of public and private investment, is an impressive sight. Still, it is dwarfed by other European studio operations, like the Pinewood Studios Group, which has 34 stages in three complexes in Britain, and the Babelsberg studio near Berlin, which has 20 stages on a single site.
Britain has long been the biggest European recipient of Hollywood investment. James Bond movies like the new ''Skyfall'' are shot at Pinewood. Two years ago, one U.S. studio, Warner Brothers, acquired its own British studio, Leavesden, where the ''Harry Potter'' movies were made, and pumped more than $150 million into renovating it.
Pinewood wants to get even bigger. The company that runs it plans an expansion that would double its studio capacity, though its ambitions were scaled back after the government rejected a previous proposal that would have included the construction of 1,400 homes.
Babelsberg, too, attracts substantial Hollywood investment and big international productions like ''Anonymous,'' ''Inglourious Basterds,'' ''The Reader'' and ''The Pianist,'' which were all shot there in recent years.
Elsewhere, Canada has long been a popular destination for Hollywood producers. In Central and Eastern Europe, where costs are lower, there has been substantial investment in production facilities. In China, a media tycoon, Bruno Wu, is building an enormous film complex near the city of Tianjin, with the aim of attracting Hollywood co-productions.
Studio operators say demand for space is rising because movie production remains relatively robust and because the turbulence in the media business has an upside. With video platforms proliferating, whether iPads and other hand-held devices or giant IMAX movie theaters, there is a growing need for original content.
Subsidies are another lure. European governments have long used public money, either directly or indirectly through tax breaks and other incentives, to support local film production; in recent years they have gotten ever more generous about extending these to international, English-language shoots. Even France, long seen as wary of Hollywood's incursions into French culture, established a tax break for foreign film production about two years ago.
The French rebate is currently capped at &#x20ac;4 million a film. That is not enough to make much of a difference for the biggest Hollywood blockbusters, with their nine-figure budgets -- the kinds of films that Studios de Paris wants to attract. So production executives are lobbying for a bigger tax incentive.
Whether they will get it is unclear. Government finances in France are strained, and the European Commission is looking into film subsidies across the European Union amid concerns that member states might bend over too far in their effort to attract Hollywood.
David Hancock, an analyst at Screen Digest, a research firm, said the Paris studio might have better luck attracting midsize films, including pan-European co-productions.
''I'm not dismissing it, but they do face quite a bit of competition from other locations,'' he said.
Christophe Lambert, the chief executive of EuropaCorp, said France had other advantages. While labor costs are high, his studio has a reputation for cost-effectiveness.
''Taken 2,'' for example, was made on a budget of about $45 million -- less than half what a similar thriller might cost if made in Hollywood. Through the end of October, the film had taken in nearly $300 million globally.
Fresh from shooting ''Malavita,'' EuropaCorp plans to begin work on an action film starring Kevin Costner, at Studios de Paris in December. Both films are being made with a Hollywood partner, Relativity Media.
''In Hollywood, it's simple,'' Mr. Lambert said. ''If you deliver, they trust you. If you don't they don't. At the end of the day, when we invest &#x20ac;1, it looks like &#x20ac;2 or &#x20ac;3 on the screen.''

HEADLINE: Officials at G-20 Meeting Warn About Debt in Europe and U.S.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 met here on Sunday amid mounting alarm that the euro-zone crisis and Washington's failure to deal with soaring deficits could endanger the fragile global recovery. 
But the meeting of the largest industrial and emerging economies was not expected to produce any major agreement, coming just ahead of the United States presidential election on Tuesday and the start of the Chinese leadership transition later in the week. Several important officials, including Timothy F. Geithner, the American Treasury secretary, and Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, skipped the talks.
Along with the focus on economic stagnation in Europe and the political stalemate over a fiscal plan in the United States, there was also interest in how China would contribute to strengthening global demand.
Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said that the risks facing the world economy ''should make for a sobering round of discussions that may well deteriorate into recriminations among the major powers'' at the meeting.
Many of the same officials met less than a month ago in Tokyo at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They warned then that the debt crises in developed countries continued to be a drag on global growth.
Before that meeting, I.M.F. economists scaled back their estimates for global growth to 3.3 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year.
The I.M.F. said that those forecasts rested on two assumptions: that European leaders would continue to take steps to bring the region's sovereign debt crisis under control, and that the United States would head off $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect automatically on Jan. 1.
To avert that so-called fiscal cliff, Congress must negotiate a debt-reduction compromise that so far has been hampered by electoral politics. Finance officials in other countries fear that the combined effect of the tax increases and spending cuts could send the United States economy back into recession, deepening global financial instability.
''When I speak to financial officials in emerging markets,'' Mr. Prasad said, ''that concern is rising by the day.''
The worries over global growth threatened to overwhelm other global economic issues that Mexico, which holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 this year, had hoped to keep on the table, like volatile international food prices.
Another topic that got short shrift was a package of banking regulation measures, called Basel III, intended to shore up banks' capital reserves as a bulwark against future financial crises. Although the new rules are supposed to go into effect on Jan. 1, the European Union, the United States and Britain have dragged their feet and published only draft rules for new capital standards
''There's a real concern that it may fall by the wayside,'' Mr. Prasad said.
