HEADLINE: Lessons From the Pits of Travel and Investment

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS I went through my financial and travel records for 2007, I realized that -- as usual -- I had made a great many mistakes. I'd like to help you to avoid making the same mistakes, so here they are. They might be considered New Year's resolutions. Or they might be called Lessons Learned.
 When it comes to travel, do not trust a certain airline as far as you can throw it when it tells you a flight is on a wide-body plane. Like Lucy tricking Charlie Brown about the football, it endlessly snatches away the 777 and gives us miserable swine travelers a narrow-body 757. I guess they do that to save fuel, but it's lying and those 757's are uncomfortable. 
 And do not believe for a minute that flight attendants know how to maintain order on an airplane. A few weeks ago, I was on a flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Phoenix. The tiny, cramped first-class cabin of an ancient MD-80 had six fantastically drunk, rowdy Canadian oil-field truckers in it. They were telling filthy jokes, throwing things, wrestling with one another. I asked them to stop and they did -- until the flight attendant gave them more drinks. Then they were totally out of control. I spoke to them and they laughed at me. I asked the flight attendant to help. She said she was afraid of them. 
 I think that in a situation like this, the plane should land, but instead we continued on the flight from hell. Scary.
 Next, never take a room on the top floor of a hotel without careful examination. Noisy, vibrating air-conditioners are often right above you, driving you crazy. Be warned.
 On to investing. As I was looking at my stock statements for 2007, I noticed I had done fabulously well -- by my very modest standards -- on my large, broad-market index funds (especially Fidelity Spartan Total Market and Vanguard Total Stock Market), on my Canadian and Australian index funds and on an emerging-market index fund and a developed-market index fund. But many of my individual picks had been clobbered.
 My belief is that I am not alone here. Unless you are a thorough genius like Warren E. Buffett, buying individual stocks is tricky, especially in a wildly down market for financial stocks. My resolution for next year is that I will buy only broad indexes and Berkshire Hathaway, if I have any money left over after feeding our three dogs, six (yes, six) cats and my endless extravagance.
 I especially got killed speculating on takeover candidates. I think I will leave that to bigger boys than me. Again, I will stick with the indexes.
 Next, here's a lesson I learned in a 12-step program and should have learned better: avoid contempt prior to investigation. When the financial stock meltdown started, I was on a television show with Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital, who warned that Merrill Lynch could be in very bad shape. I glibly said that I thought that its problems were limited and that the stock was a buy. Mr. Schiff was completely right and I was wrong. I had no idea that Mother Merrill, where I have been a happy stockholder for years, had been turned into a such a wild house of high-stakes gambling. I apologize to Mr. Schiff for my dismissal of his views, which turned out to be far superior to mine in this area. (I could do without his acolytes sending me endless hate mail, though.) 
 In the same vein, I must remember that where Wall Street is concerned, a very healthy dose of skepticism is always merited. Just in the recent past, the movers on the Street have fooled us with junk bonds, savings-and-loan stocks, high-tech garbage, rotten collateralized mortgage obligations (although not as rotten as some think right now, perhaps) and their own highly questionable firms. The problem is always the same: nonsensical greed by the buyers and lack of fiduciary duty by the sellers. An extreme sense of skepticism is warranted whenever anything looks too good to be true anywhere. But if it's coming out of Wall Street and looks complex, look out below.
 Speaking of which, your humble servant expressed doubt about private equity and how it could keep making super returns by basically picking up a penny on the sidewalk, shining it up and selling it for a nickel, and then the next guy does the same and sells it for a dime. My doubts weren't strong enough. It sure looks as if it was all a hot-potato game fueled by easy money. I got caught in it a bit with a few investments. It's sort of terrifying that even I, a longtime investor, could be caught in that game. It was a small amount, but even that is too much.
 On to spending: A famous Chinese philosopher famously said, ''There is no calamity greater than lavish desires.'' My own life is a sort of parable of national life. I spend way too much money, although it's pennies by Wall Street standards. I think like a big baby: if I want it, it's mine.
 You cannot even imagine how many suits and jackets I have. It's a bad joke, since I never wear any of them. I just wear the same pitiful shiny old clothes every day. This leads to endless self-laceration when I get my bills. On a national scale, it leads to low saving and poor preparation for the future. My goal for the future is to be a bit more careful about my spending. Maybe more than a bit. 
 Finally, this year as every year, I learn that there are a lot of people out there who are of more use to the planet than I am: my wife (the world's best human), teachers, parents of autistic children, firefighters, nurses, doctors, police officers, social workers, the incredible superstars of the military and, most of all, their families. 
 I WILL say it until the day I die: the military family is the marrow in the backbone of America. And if it seems that I am too upset about financial fraud, I would just like to say that I often cannot sleep at night seething that men and women are giving their lives for us in faraway places while at home their country is being plundered by men in $3,000 suits who get multimillion-dollar severances when they are caught.
 How many military families lost homes because of predatory lending? I know of at least two, and that's just in my little world. My resolution for 2008 is to keep on plugging for those ''little people'' who are a lot bigger than the hucksters on Wall Street. And to stop being such an extravagant fool myself.

HEADLINE: Where to Go

BYLINE: Compiled by DENNY LEE

 BODY:
1 LAOS
 Vietnam and Cambodia are so 2007. Now, Laos is shaping up to be Indochina's next hot spot. Ancient sites like the Wat Phou temple complex and the capital city of Vientiane are drawing culture seekers. Luxury teak houseboats are cruising down the Mekong. And global nomads are heading to Luang Prabang to sample the Laotian tasting menu at 3 Nagas (www.3nagas.com) or hang out by the infinity pool at the seriously upscale Residence Phou Vao (www.residencephouvao.com). 
 2 LISBON
 Bargain-seeking tourists have long flocked to Lisbon, typically among the most affordable of European cities. But now the Portuguese capital is also emerging as a cultural force. The new Berardo Collection Museum (www.berardocollection.com), in the historic Belem district, boasts a major trove of modern and contemporary art. Designer hotels like Fontana Park (www.fontanaparkhotel.com) and Jeronimos 8 (www.almeidahotels.com) are attracting style-savvy travelers. And the Design and Fashion Museum, scheduled to open in late 2008, will go a long way toward cementing the city's avant-garde status. 
 3 TUNISIA
 Tunisia is undergoing a Morocco-like luxury makeover. A new wave of stylish boutique hotels, often in historic town houses, has cropped up alongside this North African country's white-sand beaches and age-old medinas, drawing increasing numbers of well-heeled travelers. The Villa Didon (www.villadidon.com) in Carthage, for one, has a restaurant originally run by Alain Ducasse. Indeed, TripAdvisor ranks Jerba, a resort island off Tunisia's southern coast, as the No. 1 emerging spot in 2008.
 4. MAURITIUS
 Flying to the sugar-white shores of Mauritius is about to get easier. Virgin Atlantic just began nonstop flights from London to this tiny coral-ringed island off the coast of Madagascar, and it also recently became a hub port for Indian Ocean excursions by the Italy-based Costa Cruises. Meanwhile, new hotels are opening up, including a Four Seasons resort, Anahita Mauritius (www.anahitamauritius.com), that features four restaurants, three beaches and an ayurveda spa.
 5. MID-BEACH, MIAMI
 Move over South Beach. The iconic Eden Roc Resort (www.edenrocresort.com) and Fontainebleau Miami Beach (www.fontainebleau.com) -- faded glitterati hangouts designed by Morris Lapidus -- will reopen in 2008 after multimillion-dollar renovations, returning Mid-Beach to its former glory. Future neighbors include Gansevoort South, a W Hotel and a Mid-Beach outpost of the members-only Soho House. 
 6. SOUTH BEACH, MIAMI
 Not to be outdone, South Beach will also welcome a red carpet of designer hotels: the Angler's Boutique Resort (www.theanglersresort.com) by Gianni Versace's former decorator Wallace Tutt; the Tides South Beach (www.tidessouthbeach.com), revamped by the design star Kelly Wearstler; and the Mondrian South Beach (www.mondriansouthbeach.com) by the Dutch design superstar Marcel Wanders. Meanwhile, Nicky Hilton's much-hyped dreams of running a hotel has ended up in bankruptcy court -- and the auction block. 
 7. MALDIVES
 The 2004 tsunami, a fragile ecology and a recent bombing have done little to dampen a hotel boom in this island-nation of about 1,192 coral islets in the Indian Ocean. Among the high-end hotels expected to open next year is a Regent Hotels & Resorts (www.regenthotels.com) with 50 villas, many set over the water, allowing guests to observe the rich marine life while still lying in bed. 
 8. DEATH VALLEY
 It's too early to predict, but recent heavy rains have some flower bloggers already speculating about a dazzling spring bloom in Death Valley next year. Death Valley is home to more than 1,000 species of wildflower, and in that special spring after a wet fall and winter, the brown desert landscape is carpeted with Technicolor fields of blossoms. 
 9. COURCHEVEL
 The ultra-exclusive French skiing village of Courchevel may be overrun by Russian billionaires these days, but that has only fueled the resort's consumption of Cristal jeroboams and high-ticket hotels. The sumptuous Hotel de Charme Les Airelles (www.airelles.fr) reopens this month following a $31 million renovation, and, late next year, Le Padisha ups the ante with rustic-chic apartments starting at 1.3 million euros, or $1.95 million at $1.50 to the euro.
 10. LIBYA
 It's on and off (and on again) for Libya. Four years after the United States government lifted a ban on American travel, this socialist North African nation is going green. The eldest son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the leader of Libya, is developing a carbon-neutral resort along the country's pristine Mediterranean coastline, home to stellar Greek and Roman ruins and endangered seals. Luxury hotels and golf courses are planned, as well as a new airport in Tripoli. But red tape remains. Tour operators have canceled trips because of visa holdups, and last month planeloads of European tourists were turned away under an odd rule that requires foreign passports to be translated into Arabic. 
 11. HVAR
 As Croatia's Dalmatian Coast has become a new Riviera, Hvar has become its St.-Tropez: a tiny village that fills with yachts and international partyers over the summer. While the waterfront Carpe Diem (www.carpe-diem-hvar.com) remains the island's night-life center, narrow stone alleys are lined with chic cocktail lounges and hotel terraces, including the rooftop pool at the new Adriana hotel, Croatia's first Leading Small Hotels of the World member (www.suncanihvar.com/adriana).
 12. PUERTO VALLARTA
 Maybe it is the lasting memory of the gay icon Elizabeth Taylor's scandalous affair with Richard Burton during his filming of ''Night of the Iguana'' in the early 60's, but Puerto Vallarta is becoming gayer by the year and is now poised to overtake Acapulco as Mexico's leading gay beach. There are now some dozen gay-friendly hotels (www.gayguidevallarta.com/Lodging/gay.html) and a glut of bars and clubs clustered along the aptly named Zona Romantica. 
 13. SYLT
 With a nickname like the ''Hamptons of Germany,'' it's only a matter of time before jet-setters discover the North Sea island of Sylt. Known for its nudist beaches, reed-thatched houses and designer stores, the T-shaped island has long been popular with German celebrities, particularly television stars and sports figures. But now getting there is a simple hop from London and a dozen other European cities, thanks to the low-cost carrier Air Berlin.
 14. PRAGUE
 The verdict is in. The Next Prague is ... Prague. Stag parties have moved on, bohemians have left for cheaper rents, and youth hostels are being squeezed by luxe hotels. Joining a new Mandarin Oriental next year is the Augustine, converted from a monastery and other buildings into a Rocco Forte hotel (prague.roccofortecollection.com), and the just-refurbished Hilton Prague Old Town (www.prague-oldtown.hilton.com), with a buzzing restaurant opened by Gordon Ramsay. 
 15. QUITO
 If you've been to Quito, Ecuador, there's a good chance you were heading to the Galapagos. But Quito, the colonial capital perched 9,200 feet up in the Andes, is no longer just a whistle stop. The city's crumbling historic center, one of Latin America's least altered, has been reborn after a seven-year, $200 million renovation. And a crop of upscale hotels has arrived, including a JW Marriott (www.marriott.com), making Quito a glorious new center in the so-called Middle of the World. 
 16. LIVERPOOL
 There's more to Liverpool than just the Beatles. Next year, this industrial city celebrates its 800th birthday (and its designation as European Capital of Culture), as it trots out everything and everyone, from Turner Prize artists to young emerging bands like the Zutons. But make no mistake: The headliner is Paul McCartney, who is returning to play the ''Liverpool Sound'' concert at Anfield Stadium on June 1 (www.liverpool08.com). 
 17. MUNICH
 Wi-Fi beer gardens, lederhosen-wearing hipsters, hybrid Mercedes-Benz taxis. No wonder Monocle magazine recently named Munich the world's most livable city. The Bavarian capital might get shortchanged when compared with Berlin in terms of liberalism and creativity, but Munich has a robust economy that stimulates high fashion, cutting-edge cuisine and cushy living -- not to mention a new Jewish Museum (www.juedisches-museum.muenchen.de), 79 years in the making, and a posh new hotel in the heart of the city, the Charles, from hotelier Rocco Forte (www.charleshotel.de).
 18. IRAN
 What Axis of Evil? Upscale tour operators are tiptoeing into Iran next year, offering trips that explore the ancient country's Persian treasures and olive-green desert plains. Next spring, the luxury cruise liner Silversea will make stops in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas on its Dubai to Dubai cruise. And California-based Distant Horizons (www.distant-horizons.com) is organizing two 18-day trips that start in Tehran and then weave through the once-forbidden countryside, including stops in Shiraz and Isfahan. Prices start at $5,390 per person.
 19. TUSCANY
 All those rolling fields of green. The cypress-lined fairways. It's surprising that there aren't more golf links in Tuscany. For better or worse, a new course has just opened for guests at the Terme di Saturnia resort (www.termedisaturnia.it ) in southern Tuscany. The nine-hole course covers 247 acres surrounded by wheat, sunflowers, oats and olive groves -- that is, until the next nine holes go in. 
 20. ANGUILLA
 Just when you thought the Caribbean island of Anguilla couldn't get any fancier, the Kor Hotel Group is opening the Viceroy Anguilla -- the latest offshoot of its Viceroy brand (www.viceroyanguilla.com) -- in the spring. The hotel will have 172 luxury accommodations, a 15,000-square-foot spa and beach clubs set along 3,200 feet of private waterfront. 
 21. BOGOTA
 Bogota might be remembered for its death squads and gang violence, but this Colombian megalopolis -- the fourth-largest city in South America -- is cleaning up its act and drawing tourists with its cultural diversity and colonial charms. A new Hilton hotel is being built, and three U.S.-based airlines -- JetBlue, US Airways and Spirit Airlines -- recently applied for the chance to offer direct flights into Bogota. 
 22. PLAYA BLANCA, PANAMA
 Playa Blanca is about to hit the tabloids. Nikki Beach, the tres chic beach club in South Beach and St.-Tropez, is opening a gated resort in the once-quiet fishing village on the Pacific coast of Panama (www.nikkibeachpanama.com). The developers are already calling it the ''sexiest project in Panama.'' Less fabulous families need not worry. Superclubs (www.superclubs.com), the all-inclusive resort, is also dipping its toes into Playa Blanca with the 300-room Breezes Panama, scheduled to open in 2009.
 23. ALEXANDRIA
 The former home of Cleopatra is rising. Alexandria was among the ancient world's greatest cities, but it had fallen into oblivion. Now a string of new monuments is bringing the so-called Pearl of the Mediterranean back. A gleaming $200 million library, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (www.bibalex.org), resurrects the ancient library in steel and glass. A new Four Seasons (www.fourseasons.com/alexandria) stands in the stately Stan Stefano plaza. And throughout town, the city pulses with new shops and upscale cafes.
 24. MAZATLAN
 A faded spring-break haven on Mexico's Pacific coast, Mazatlan has been drawing American retirees and second-home buyers to its less-crowded beaches and cheap real estate. Few tourists show up, partly because there are few hotels. That's changing. A half-dozen resorts are now in the works, including Diamond Beach, a $1.2 billion development with high-rise hotels, a golf course and condominiums.
 25. ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia's upscale progress marches on. After the arrival of eco-hedonistic resorts like Jade Mountain and Discovery at Marigot Bay (which just launched a solar-powered ferry), big-name resorts with $1,000 rooms are on the way. Scheduled to open next year are the Residences at Ritz-Carlton (www.theresidencesstlucia.com), the Westin's Le Paradis (www.leparadisstlucia.com) and the RockResorts' the Landings St. Lucia (www.thelandingsstlucia.com). There's even a private jet terminal in the works. 
 26. OSLO
 In addition to being one of the world's most expensive cities , Oslo is burnishing its reputation as a design and architecture center. Next April, the futuristic National Opera House (www.operaen.no) will open at the head of the Oslofjord, sheathed in white marble. It will be joined by two new design hotels: Thon Hotel Gyldenlove (www.thonhotels.com ) and Grims Grenka Hotel (www.grimsgrenka.no). 
 27. BUENOS AIRES
 Marketed as the first five-star gay hotel in Latin America (but also ''heterofriendly''), the new Axel Hotel Buenos Aires (www.axelhotels.com) confirmed what many gay travelers already knew: the Argentine capital is becoming South America's next party capital. Situated in the bohemian-chic neighborhood of San Telmo, the 48-room hotel features Eames furnishings, a gymnasium and a poolside bar. 
 28. RIMINI, ITALY
 Rimini's nine-mile stretch of sand along the Adriatic Coast once attracted holiday crowds. But the birthplace of Fellini has been reborn as Italy's bling party capital, drawing style-conscious Romans to its raging club scene, cool boites and designer hotels, most notably the new DuoMo hotel (www.duomohotel.com) designed by Ron Arad. 
 29. MALAWI
 Blame Madonna. Safarigoers tended to overlook Malawi, but that has changed since she began her effort to adopt a 1-year-old boy from this tiny African country that lies within the Great Rift Valley. Next July, the luxury lodge Pumulani (www.pumulani.com) is set to open 10 villas on spectacular Lake Malawi, home to rare cichlids and pied kingfishers. 
 30. ROATAN
 The sleepy Honduran island of Roatan, known for scuba diving and fishing, is waking up with big plans, with both Royal Caribbean and Carnival building new cruise terminals there, and the Westin Resort & Spa Roatan scheduled to open in mid-2008. 
 31. MOZAMBIQUE
 Since gaining independence in 1975, Mozambique has moved from a war-torn society to one of Africa's economic success stories. Now its 1,500 miles of pristine coastline is being fashioned into a ''fair trade'' tourist destination. High-end lodges with low-environmental impact are being built along the Bazaruto Archipelago, home to endangered sea cows, staghorn coral and mangrove forests. Farther north, the Guludo Beach Lodge (www.guludo.com) offers nine luxurious tented bandas along the beach, with proceeds going back to the local village.
 32. KUWAIT CITY
 Yes, there's a war next door. But that's not preventing Kuwait City, a bustling metropolis on the Persian Gulf, from welcoming new air service (direct United flights from Dulles Airport near Washington start this month), playing host to international boat shows, or opening a slate of opulent hotels. The most talked-about is the Hotel Missoni, the first of several for the fashion house. Designed by the Italian architect Matteo Thun, it is to open next year.
 33. VERBIER
 The Swiss ski village of Verbier will get decidedly more upper class when the Lodge (www.thelodge.virgin.com), the newest addition to Richard Branson's globe-trotting playgrounds, opens at the Alpine resort next month. The nine-bedroom chalet features a mini-ice rink, indoor pool and 24-hour driver -- all for as little as $:35,250 a week, well over $70,000. 
 34. LOMBOK
 Lombok, a low-key Indonesian island east of Bali, is coming out of the shadows. With Bali oversaturated with villas and designer restaurants, tourists are hopping on short flights to find less-crowded beaches, a bigger volcano and better surfing. It's also cheaper -- not that visitors are slumming it. There's already an Oberoi (www.oberoilombok.com), and other high-end hotels are on the way. 
 35. NORTHWEST PASSAGE
 Notwithstanding last month's sinking of an Antarctic cruise ship, climate tourism is heating up. And few places are warming up faster than the Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route over Canada. Adventure Life Voyages (www.alvoyages.com), for one, is already booking cruises for its Northwest Passage tour next August, with prices from $4,600 a person. 
 36. EASTER ISLAND
 Remote Easter Island, famous for its enigmatic Moai statues, is getting its first luxury resort: Explora en Rapa Nui (www.explora.com). The 30-room resort combines futuristic pod-like design with natural materials like native volcanic rock and Chilean rauli wood, and offers seamless views of the middle of the Pacific Ocean. A three-night stay for two people starts at $3,588. 
 37. VIRGIN GORDA
 Virgin Gorda, one of the lesser-known British Virgin Islands, is raising its profile. The Aquamare (www.villaaquamare.com) is set to open in March with three villas measuring 8,000 square feet, with in-villa spa treatments, observation decks and weekly rates starting at $12,500. 
 38. NAMIBIA
 In the 17 years since Namibia gained independence from South Africa, this desert country on the West African coast carved out an early eco-tourist niche, with government-run campsites like Namutoni (www.nwr.com.na) in the Etosha National Park. Now the country is going eco-deluxe. (Might it have something to do with Brangelina?) Many lodges have just been refurbished with stylish decor and matching rates. And the private sector is following suit; Kempinski Hotels is planning five luxury hotels to open in the next few years. 
 39. SAN FRANCISCO
 When the California Academy of Sciences (www.calacademy.org) opens next fall in Golden Gate Park, it won't just be a stunning architectural addition to San Francisco. The $500 million building, designed by the Pritzker Prize winner Renzo Piano, will feature a 2.5-acre living roof covered with native plants and aims to be the greenest museum in the world.
 40. DETROIT
 Historically crime-ridden Detroit may not spring to mind as a hot tourist spot, but don't tell that to the city's bullish hoteliers. Newcomers include the MGM Grand Detroit (www.mgmgranddetroit.com), the MotorCity Casino Hotel (www.motorcitycasino.com) in an old Wonder Bread factory and the historic Book Cadillac Hotel, being transformed into a Westin (www.westinbookcadillac.com). Plus, the Detroit Institute of Arts (www.dia.org) just reopened after a $158 million renovation. 
 41. ITACARE, BRAZIL
 It ended up on several ''it'' lists before a single guest arrived. But the Warapuru (www.warapuru.com), a lavish eco-resort, is expected to finally open next year. Designed by the London-based Anouska Hempel, the resort has brought attention to Itacare, an under-the-radar beach town on Brazil's north coast that draws celebrities and the elite of Rio de Janeiro. 
 42. KILIMANJARO
 Time may be running out to see the most famous snows of American literature. The ice-capped peak of Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is melting at an alarming rate. Within several decades, scientists predict, the glaciers will have completely disappeared. Expect more adventure seekers to tackle the climb next year: One outfitter, International Mountain Guides (www.mountainguides.com), has seven trips scheduled for 2008. (Prices run $4,975 for the full two-week itinerary and $3,600 for the climb-only portion.) 
 43. ALGERIA
 A nearly decade-long civil war made Algeria off limits to travelers. Now that the war has subsided (though a United States travel warning, citing terrorist attacks, remains) travelers are trickling back to this ancient land of oasis towns and cart-wide streets. Lonely Planet just published its first guide to Algeria. And tour organizers like Row International (www.rowinternational.com) are taking adventure seekers through the meandering alleyways of the Casbah and on camelback into the Sahara. 
 44. SAN DIEGO
 Wildfires this fall didn't prevent the opening of the much-anticipated Hard Rock Hotel San Diego (www.hardrockhotelsd.com), a 420-room resort in the trendy Gaslamp quarter. The 12-story hotel includes a Nobu restaurant, two Rande Gerber bars, a spa and a Pinkberry frozen yogurt shop -- all under one roof. Greasing the wheels is Virgin America, which is starting service between San Diego and San Francisco in February. 
 45. MALAGA
 The southern coast of Spain is not just about high-rise hotels and water-gulping golf courses. Next June, Delta Air Lines plans to inaugurate nonstop service to the Andalusian port city of Malaga -- a major cultural center, with its impressive array of museums and monuments, including an 11th-century Moorish fortress. Delta will fly from Kennedy Airport to Malaga's international airport, named after the city's favorite son Pablo Picasso. 
 46. PUERTO PLATA
 Puerto Plata, the rowdy beach resort on the Dominican Republic's north coast, is about to get rowdier. Maxim, the racy men's magazine, is opening a 108-bungalow resort on Cofresi Beach, near the Las Vegas-style Ocean World Marina and Casino. Expect the drinking to start onboard JetBlue, which is offering nonstop flights between Kennedy Airport and Puerto Plata next month. 
 47. LONDON
 King's Cross in London was once on the wrong side of tracks. But the district's fortunes are changing, thanks to the trans-Chunnel Eurostar, which moved its terminal last month from Waterloo to the reconstructed St. Pancras station. A Gagosian Gallery is there, along with cool bars and supertrendy restaurants like Acorn House (www.acornhouserestaurant.com), which has local foodies in a tizzy. Next up? A Renaissance Hotel with a ballroom. 
 48. VIETNAM
 Three decades after the fall of Saigon, the city (now known as Ho Chi Minh City) has become an unlikely stop on the global golf circuit. In the past decade, old courses like the Dalat Palace Golf Club have been spruced up, and newer ones, like the Ocean Dunes Golf Club in nearby Phan Thiet, on the South China Sea, and designed by Nick Faldo, have raised the bar. Still to come: the Montgomerie Links, just off China Beach, and the first Vietnam course designed by Colin Montgomerie.
 49. ESSAOUIRA
 As Marrakesh gets more touristy, well-heeled Europeans are heading to the Moroccan port city of Essaouira, not only to trek through its ancient streets and windsurf on its beaches, but also to party. The Gnaoua and World Music Festival (www.festival-gnaoua.net), held every June for the past 10 years, now draws 250,000 fans for five days of music, art and budding friendships -- a kind of Burning Man of Morocco. 
 50. LAS VEGAS
 In case you missed those big gold letters, Donald T-R-U-M-P is coming to the Las Vegas Strip. The 64-story, 1,282-room Trump International Hotel and Towers Las Vegas (www.trumplv.com) is opening next spring, becoming, its Web site promises, the ''most striking building on the Las Vegas Skyline.'' If you're merely looking for ''unparalleled luxury, sophistication, and contemporary chic,'' then head to the new Palazzo Las Vegas ( www.palazzolasvegas.com), a 3,000-room sister to the Venetian, with restaurants by Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse and Charlie Trotter, as well as a Barneys New York. 
 51. BAROSSA VALLEY, AUSTRALIA
 The world's love affair with shiraz is bringing wine spectators to Australia's Barossa Valley. The hilly region is home to some of the world's oldest shiraz vines, some dating back to the 1840s. And if the more than 60 wineries aren't enough, Barossa also offers an artisanal cheese trail, and nearby Adelaide is a foodie destination in its own right.
 52. TOKAJ, HUNGARY
 Backpacking wine tours? The Hungarian wine region of Tokaj is regaining its reputation for quality whites, especially wheat-colored dessert wines made from furmint grapes. The region's winemaking was reborn after the fall of Communism. The Grof Degenfeld, housed in an old castle, even has a plush hotel that offers two-day packages starting at 191 euros, or $283 at $1.50 to the euro (www.hotelgrofdegenfeld.hu). 
 53. NEW YORK
 The lights are back on Broadway. And the strike settlement couldn't have come soon enough for several well-publicized productions scheduled to open before the May 7 deadline for the 2007-08 Tony Awards. Among the more highly awaited shows are three revivals: A 40th-anniversary production of ''The Homecoming,'' Harold Pinter's play about a dysfunctional family (as if there were any other kind), starring Ian McShane; ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' the William Inge chestnut, featuring the Emmy Award-winning actress S. Epatha Merkerson; and an inventive take on ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' Stephen Sondheim's Pulitzer Prize winner, which comes to New York via London and the Menier Chocolate Factory theater company. And for lovers of street theater, the action downtown in the meatpacking district continues to heat up with the arrival of the Standard New York hotel.

HEADLINE: Time to Deal with E-Waste

 BODY:
There's no denying that America has become a throwaway society, where old acquisitions don't need to show much wear and tear before being replaced. This is especially the case with electronic waste, the fastest growing piece of the nation's municipal waste stream.
 In New York, the problem is usually in plain sight, out there on the curb, along with the rest of the trash. Some items -- discarded television sets, computers and printers that still have some life in them -- are snapped up by other residents on the prowl for bargains. Some owners, not sure how to get rid of the stuff, store it. More likely, though, it ends up in the regular waste stream. 
 After years of study, the City Council seems ready to move this month on a bill that could set a new and important standard for recycling e-waste. The measure would oblige the manufacturers of certain electronic goods to recover or recycle a gradually increasing percentage of what they sell in the city -- 25 percent in 2012, rising to 65 percent in 2018. How they collect their old equipment -- consisting mainly of television sets, computers, printers and MP3 players -- is up to them, although the Department of Sanitation will have to approve any plans.
 The legislation smartly builds on efforts by several states, led by Maine, California, Washington and Maryland, to get a handle on the proliferation of technological trash. Most of the council has signed on, including the Speaker, Christine Quinn. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has never liked mandates coming from the council, but in this case he should go along. Having built an impressive environmental portfolio, and having supported other types of recycling -- paper, metal and glass -- he can hardly ignore the special problems presented by electronic waste.
 The council's timing could not be better. It's Christmas, and consumers are hungry for the latest must-have devices. But as apartment dwellers eager to reclaim floor space replace their old sets with flat-screen wall TV's, little thought is given to how the old model is discarded. Sometimes owners hold on to their old equipment, especially computers, for fear of losing personal data, but more often they give it to the super or dump it on the curb. And that means trouble for the environment. The Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped draft the bill, says that electronic waste accounts for about 70 percent of the heavy metals found in municipal landfills -- including lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium -- that can leach into water supplies. Some of these gadgets even end up at the Newark incinerator, which handles city rubbish, sending a toxic brew into the region's air.
 The environmental benefits of the bill are clear enough. But there is also an economic benefit. Disposing of thousands of tons of heavy e-waste every year costs city taxpayers dearly. If manufacturers are compelled to help with the burden, it won't be long before they figure a way to streamline designs and include fewer toxic components. Mandating responsible recycling in a market as huge as New York could inspire a welcome wave of environmental conscience in corporate boardrooms.
 As progressive as the council bill is, it cannot solve every problem associated with e-waste. A fair amount of recycling of discarded electronic material already takes place in this country, but much of its ends up being shipped abroad to developing nations, where unprotected workers are exposed to a machine's toxic guts while they extract reusable parts. What cannot be salvaged is often dumped in or near water sources, a practice that environmental groups say has contributed to polluted soil and drinking water for poor populations.
 Even on this score, the council's approach offers hope. The manufacturers who must now take responsibility for this waste may ultimately find ways of disposing of it that do not burden poor countries. Several manufacturers, including HP and Dell and Apple, have designed programs to reclaim old equipment and prevent it from being dumped elsewhere, and there is every reason to expect other makers to join in.

HEADLINE: Where to Go in 2008

BYLINE: By COMPILED BY DENNY LEE

 BODY:
1 LAOS
 Vietnam and Cambodia are so 2007. Now, Laos is shaping up to be Indochina's next hot spot. Ancient sites like the Wat Phou temple complex and the capital city of Vientiane are drawing culture seekers. Luxury teak houseboats are cruising down the Mekong. And global nomads are heading to Luang Prabang to sample the Laotian tasting menu at 3 Nagas (www.3nagas.com) or hang out by the infinity pool at the seriously upscale Residence Phou Vao (www.residencephouvao.com). 
 2 LISBON
 Bargain-seeking tourists have long flocked to Lisbon, typically among the most affordable of European cities. But now the Portuguese capital is also emerging as a cultural force. The new Berardo Collection Museum (www.berardocollection.com), in the historic Belem district, boasts a major trove of modern and contemporary art. Designer hotels like Fontana Park (www.fontanaparkhotel.com) and Jeronimos 8 (www.almeidahotels.com) are attracting style-savvy travelers. And the Design and Fashion Museum, scheduled to open in late 2008, will go a long way toward cementing the city's avant-garde status. 
 3 TUNISIA
 Tunisia is undergoing a Morocco-like luxury makeover. A new wave of stylish boutique hotels, often in historic town houses, has cropped up alongside this North African country's white-sand beaches and age-old medinas, drawing increasing numbers of well-heeled travelers. The Villa Didon (www.villadidon.com) in Carthage, for one, has a restaurant originally run by Alain Ducasse. Indeed, TripAdvisor ranks Jerba, a resort island off Tunisia's southern coast, as the No. 1 emerging spot in 2008.
 4. MAURITIUS
 Flying to the sugar-white shores of Mauritius is about to get easier. Virgin Atlantic just began nonstop flights from London to this tiny coral-ringed island off the coast of Madagascar, and it also recently became a hub port for Indian Ocean excursions by the Italy-based Costa Cruises. Meanwhile, new hotels are opening up, including a Four Seasons resort, Anahita Mauritius (www.anahitamauritius.com), that features four restaurants, three beaches and an ayurveda spa.
 5. MID-BEACH, MIAMI
 Move over South Beach. The iconic Eden Roc Resort (www.edenrocresort.com) and Fontainebleau Miami Beach (www.fontainebleau.com) -- faded glitterati hangouts designed by Morris Lapidus -- will reopen in 2008 after multimillion-dollar renovations, returning Mid-Beach to its former glory. Future neighbors include Gansevoort South, a W Hotel and a Mid-Beach outpost of the members-only Soho House. 
 6. SOUTH BEACH, MIAMI
 Not to be outdone, South Beach will also welcome a red carpet of designer hotels: the Angler's Boutique Resort (www.theanglersresort.com) by Gianni Versace's former decorator Wallace Tutt; the Tides South Beach (www.tidessouthbeach.com), revamped by the design star Kelly Wearstler; and the Mondrian South Beach (www.mondriansouthbeach.com) by the Dutch design superstar Marcel Wanders. Meanwhile, Nicky Hilton's much-hyped dreams of running a hotel has ended up in bankruptcy court -- and the auction block. 
 7. MALDIVES
 The 2004 tsunami, a fragile ecology and a recent bombing have done little to dampen a hotel boom in this island-nation of about 1,192 coral islets in the Indian Ocean. Among the high-end hotels expected to open next year is a Regent Hotels & Resorts (www.regenthotels.com) with 50 villas, many set over the water, allowing guests to observe the rich marine life while still lying in bed. 
 8. DEATH VALLEY
 It's too early to predict, but recent heavy rains have some flower bloggers already speculating about a dazzling spring bloom in Death Valley next year. Death Valley is home to more than 1,000 species of wildflower, and in that special spring after a wet fall and winter, the brown desert landscape is carpeted with Technicolor fields of blossoms. 
 9. COURCHEVEL
 The ultra-exclusive French skiing village of Courchevel may be overrun by Russian billionaires these days, but that has only fueled the resort's consumption of Cristal jeroboams and high-ticket hotels. The sumptuous Hotel de Charme Les Airelles (www.airelles.fr) reopens this month following a $31 million renovation, and, late next year, Le Padisha ups the ante with rustic-chic apartments starting at 1.3 million euros, or $1.95 million at $1.50 to the euro. 
 10. LIBYA
 It's on and off (and on again) for Libya. Four years after the United States government lifted a ban on American travel, this socialist North African nation is going green. The eldest son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the leader of Libya, is developing a carbon-neutral resort along the country's pristine Mediterranean coastline, home to stellar Greek and Roman ruins and endangered seals. Luxury hotels and golf courses are planned, as well as a new airport in Tripoli. But red tape remains. Tour operators have canceled trips because of visa holdups, and last month planeloads of European tourists were turned away under an odd rule that requires foreign passports to be translated into Arabic. 
 11. HVAR
 As Croatia's Dalmatian Coast has become a new Riviera, Hvar has become its St.-Tropez: a tiny village that fills with yachts and international partyers over the summer. While the waterfront Carpe Diem (www.carpe-diem-hvar.com) remains the island's night-life center, narrow stone alleys are lined with chic cocktail lounges and hotel terraces, including the rooftop pool at the new Adriana hotel, Croatia's first Leading Small Hotels of the World member (www.suncanihvar.com/adriana).
 12. PUERTO VALLARTA
 Maybe it is the lasting memory of the gay icon Elizabeth Taylor's scandalous affair with Richard Burton during his filming of ''Night of the Iguana'' in the early 60's, but Puerto Vallarta is becoming gayer by the year and is now poised to overtake Acapulco as Mexico's leading gay beach. There are now some dozen gay-friendly hotels (www.gayguidevallarta.com/Lodging/gay.html) and a glut of bars and clubs clustered along the aptly named Zona Romantica. 
 13. SYLT
 With a nickname like the ''Hamptons of Germany,'' it's only a matter of time before jet-setters discover the North Sea island of Sylt. Known for its nudist beaches, reed-thatched houses and designer stores, the T-shaped island has long been popular with German celebrities, particularly television stars and sports figures. But now getting there is a simple hop from London and a dozen other European cities, thanks to the low-cost carrier Air Berlin.
 14. PRAGUE
 The verdict is in. The Next Prague is ... Prague. Stag parties have moved on, bohemians have left for cheaper rents, and youth hostels are being squeezed by luxe hotels. Joining a new Mandarin Oriental next year is the Augustine, converted from a monastery and other buildings into a Rocco Forte hotel (prague.roccofortecollection.com), and the just-refurbished Hilton Prague Old Town (www.prague-oldtown.hilton.com), with a buzzing restaurant opened by Gordon Ramsay. 
 15. QUITO
 If you've been to Quito, Ecuador, there's a good chance you were heading to the Galapagos. But Quito, the colonial capital perched 9,200 feet up in the Andes, is no longer just a whistle stop. The city's crumbling historic center, one of Latin America's least altered, has been reborn after a seven-year, $200 million renovation. And a crop of upscale hotels has arrived, including a JW Marriott (www.marriott.com), making Quito a glorious new center in the so-called Middle of the World. 
 16. LIVERPOOL
 There's more to Liverpool than just the Beatles. Next year, this industrial city celebrates its 800th birthday (and its designation as European Capital of Culture), as it trots out everything and everyone, from Turner Prize artists to young emerging bands like the Zutons. But make no mistake: The headliner is Paul McCartney, who is returning to play the ''Liverpool Sound'' concert at Anfield Stadium on June 1 (www.liverpool08.com). 
 17. MUNICH
 Wi-Fi beer gardens, lederhosen-wearing hipsters, hybrid Mercedes-Benz taxis. No wonder Monocle magazine recently named Munich the world's most livable city. The Bavarian capital might get shortchanged when compared with Berlin in terms of liberalism and creativity, but Munich has a robust economy that stimulates high fashion, cutting-edge cuisine and cushy living -- not to mention a new Jewish Museum (www.juedisches-museum.muenchen.de), 79 years in the making, and a posh new hotel in the heart of the city, the Charles, from hotelier Rocco Forte (www.charleshotel.de).
 18. IRAN
 What Axis of Evil? Upscale tour operators are tiptoeing into Iran next year, offering trips that explore the ancient country's Persian treasures and olive-green desert plains. Next spring, the luxury cruise liner Silversea will make stops in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas on its Dubai to Dubai cruise. And California-based Distant Horizons (www.distant-horizons.com) is organizing two 18-day trips that start in Tehran and then weave through the once-forbidden countryside, including stops in Shiraz and Isfahan. Prices start at $5,390 per person.
 19. TUSCANY
 All those rolling fields of green. The cypress-lined fairways. It's surprising that there aren't more golf links in Tuscany. For better or worse, a new course has just opened for guests at the Terme di Saturnia resort (www.termedisaturnia.it ) in southern Tuscany. The nine-hole course covers 247 acres surrounded by wheat, sunflowers, oats and olive groves -- that is, until the next nine holes go in. 
 20. ANGUILLA
 Just when you thought the Caribbean island of Anguilla couldn't get any fancier, the Kor Hotel Group is opening the Viceroy Anguilla -- the latest offshoot of its Viceroy brand (www.viceroyanguilla.com) -- in the spring. The hotel will have 172 luxury accommodations, a 15,000 -square-foot spa and beach clubs set along 3,200 feet of private waterfront. 
 21. BOGOTa
 Bogota might be remembered for its death squads and gang violence, but this Colombian megalopolis -- the fourth-largest city in South America -- is cleaning up its act and drawing tourists with its cultural diversity and colonial charms. A new Hilton hotel is being built, and three U.S.-based airlines -- JetBlue, US Airways and Spirit Airlines -- recently applied for the chance to offer direct flights into Bogota. 
 22. PLAYA BLANCA, PANAMA
 Playa Blanca is about to hit the tabloids. Nikki Beach, the tres chic beach club in South Beach and St.-Tropez, is opening a gated resort in the once-quiet fishing village on the Pacific coast of Panama (www.nikkibeachpanama.com). The developers are already calling it the ''sexiest project in Panama.'' Less fabulous families need not worry. Superclubs (www.superclubs.com), the all-inclusive resort, is also dipping its toes into Playa Blanca with the 300-room Breezes Panama, scheduled to open in 2009. 
 23. ALEXANDRIA
 The former home of Cleopatra is rising. Alexandria was among the ancient world's greatest cities, but it had fallen into oblivion. Now a string of new monuments is bringing the so-called Pearl of the Mediterranean back. A gleaming $200 million library, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (www.bibalex.org), resurrects the ancient library in steel and glass. A new Four Seasons (www.fourseasons.com/alexandria) stands in the stately Stan Stefano plaza. And throughout town, the city pulses with new shops and upscale cafes.
 24. MAZATLaN
 A faded spring-break haven on Mexico's Pacific coast, Mazatlan has been drawing American retirees and second-home buyers to its less-crowded beaches and cheap real estate. Few tourists show up, partly because there are few hotels. That's changing. A half-dozen resorts are now in the works, including Diamond Beach, a $1.2 billion development with high-rise hotels, a golf course and condominiums.
 25. ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia's upscale progress marches on. After the arrival of eco-hedonistic resorts like Jade Mountain and Discovery at Marigot Bay (which just launched a solar-powered ferry), big-name resorts with $1,000 rooms are on the way. Scheduled to open next year are the Residences at Ritz-Carlton (www.theresidencesstlucia.com), the Westin's Le Paradis (www.leparadisstlucia.com) and the RockResorts' the Landings St. Lucia (www.thelandingsstlucia.com). There's even a private jet terminal in the works. 
 26. OSLO
 In addition to being one of the world's most expensive cities, Oslo is burnishing its reputation as a design and architecture center. Next April, the futuristic National Opera House (www.operaen.no) will open at the head of the Oslofjord, sheathed in white marble. It will be joined by two new design hotels: Thon Hotel Gyldenlove (www.thonhotels.com ) and Grims Grenka Hotel (www.grimsgrenka.no). 
 27. BUENOS AIRES
 Marketed as the first five-star gay hotel in Latin America (but also ''heterofriendly''), the new Axel Hotel Buenos Aires (www.axelhotels.com) confirmed what many gay travelers already knew: the Argentine capital is becoming South America's next party capital. Situated in the bohemian-chic neighborhood of San Telmo, the 48-room hotel features Eames furnishings, a gymnasium and a poolside bar. 
 28. RIMINI, ITALY
 Rimini's nine-mile stretch of sand along the Adriatic Coast once attracted holiday crowds. But the birthplace of Fellini has been reborn as Italy's bling party capital, drawing style-conscious Romans to its raging club scene, cool boites and designer hotels, most notably the new DuoMo hotel (www.duomohotel.com) designed by Ron Arad. 
 29. MALAWI
 Blame Madonna. Safarigoers tended to overlook Malawi, but that has changed since she began her effort to adopt a 1-year-old boy from this tiny African country that lies within the Great Rift Valley. Next July, the luxury lodge Pumulani (www.pumulani.com) is set to open 10 villas on spectacular Lake Malawi, home to rare cichlids and pied kingfishers. 
 30. ROATaN
 The sleepy Honduran island of Roatan, known for scuba diving and fishing, is waking up with big plans, with both Royal Caribbean and Carnival building new cruise terminals there, and the Westin Resort & Spa Roatan scheduled to open in mid-2008. 
 31. MOZAMBIQUE
 Since gaining independence in 1975, Mozambique has moved from a war-torn society to one of Africa's economic success stories. Now its 1,500 miles of pristine coastline is being fashioned into a ''fair trade'' tourist destination. High-end lodges with low-environmental impact are being built along the Bazaruto Archipelago, home to endangered sea cows, staghorn coral and mangrove forests. Farther north, the Guludo Beach Lodge (www.guludo.com) offers nine luxurious tented bandas along the beach, with proceeds going back to the local village.
 32. KUWAIT CITY
 Yes, there's a war next door. But that's not preventing Kuwait City, a bustling metropolis on the Persian Gulf, from welcoming new air service (direct United flights from Dulles Airport near Washington start this month), playing host to international boat shows, or opening a slate of opulent hotels. The most talked-about is the Hotel Missoni, the first of several for the fashion house. Designed by the Italian architect Matteo Thun, it is to open next year.
 33. VERBIER
 The Swiss ski village of Verbier will get decidedly more upper class when the Lodge (www.thelodge.virgin.com), the newest addition to Richard Branson's globe-trotting playgrounds, opens at the Alpine resort next month. The nine-bedroom chalet features a mini-ice rink, indoor pool and 24-hour driver -- all for as little as $:35,250 a week, well over $70,000. 
 34. LOMBOK
 Lombok, a low-key Indonesian island east of Bali, is coming out of the shadows. With Bali oversaturated with villas and designer restaurants, tourists are hopping on short flights to find less-crowded beaches, a bigger volcano and better surfing. It's also cheaper -- not that visitors are slumming it. There's already an Oberoi (www.oberoilombok.com), and other high-end hotels are on the way. 
 35. NORTHWEST PASSAGE
 Notwithstanding last month's sinking of an Antarctic cruise ship, climate tourism is heating up. And few places are warming up faster than the Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route over Canada. Adventure Life Voyages (www.alvoyages.com), for one, is already booking cruises for its Northwest Passage tour next August, with prices from $4,600 a person. 
 36. EASTER ISLAND
 Remote Easter Island, famous for its enigmatic Moai statues, is getting its first luxury resort: Explora en Rapa Nui (www.explora.com). The 30-room resort combines futuristic pod-like design with natural materials like native volcanic rock and Chilean rauli wood, and offers seamless views of the middle of the Pacific Ocean. A three-night stay for two people starts at $3,588. 
 37. VIRGIN GORDA
 Virgin Gorda, one of the lesser-known British Virgin Islands, is raising its profile. The Aquamare (www.villaaquamare.com) is set to open in March with three villas measuring 8,000 square feet, with in-villa spa treatments, observation decks and weekly rates starting at $12,500. 
 38. NAMIBIA
 In the 17 years since Namibia gained independence from South Africa, this desert country on the West African coast carved out an early eco-tourist niche, with government-run campsites like Namutoni (www.nwr.com.na) in the Etosha National Park. Now the country is going eco-deluxe. (Might it have something to do with Brangelina?) Many lodges have just been refurbished with stylish decor and matching rates. And the private sector is following suit; Kempinski Hotels is planning five luxury hotels to open in the next few years. 
 39. SAN FRANCISCO
 When the California Academy of Sciences (www.calacademy.org) opens next fall in Golden Gate Park, it won't just be a stunning architectural addition to San Francisco. The $500 million building, designed by the Pritzker Prize winner Renzo Piano, will feature a 2.5-acre living roof covered with native plants and aims to be the greenest museum in the world.
 40. DETROIT
 Historically crime-ridden Detroit may not spring to mind as a hot tourist spot, but don't tell that to the city's bullish hoteliers. Newcomers include the MGM Grand Detroit (www.mgmgranddetroit.com), the MotorCity Casino Hotel (www.motorcitycasino.com) in an old Wonder Bread factory and the historic Book Cadillac Hotel, being transformed into a Westin (www.westinbookcadillac.com). Plus, the Detroit Institute of Arts (www.dia.org) just reopened after a $158 million renovation. 
 41. ITACARe, BRAZIL
 It ended up on several ''it'' lists before a single guest arrived. But the Warapuru (www.warapuru.com), a lavish eco-resort, is expected to finally open next year. Designed by the London-based Anouska Hempel, the resort has brought attention to Itacare, an under-the-radar beach town on Brazil's north coast that draws celebrities and the elite of Rio de Janeiro. 
 42. KILIMANJARO
 Time may be running out to see the most famous snows of American literature. The ice-capped peak of Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is melting at an alarming rate. Within several decades, scientists predict, the glaciers will have completely disappeared. Expect more adventure seekers to tackle the climb next year: One outfitter, International Mountain Guides (www.mountainguides.com), has seven trips scheduled for 2008. (Prices run $4,975 for the full two-week itinerary and $3,600 for the climb-only portion.) 
 43. ALGERIA
 A nearly decade-long civil war made Algeria off limits to travelers. Now that the war has subsided (though a United States travel warning, citing terrorist attacks, remains) travelers are trickling back to this ancient land of oasis towns and cart-wide streets. Lonely Planet just published its first guide to Algeria. And tour organizers like Row International (www.rowinternational.com) are taking adventure seekers through the meandering alleyways of the Casbah and on camelback into the Sahara. 
 44. SAN DIEGO
 Wildfires this fall didn't prevent the opening of the much-anticipated Hard Rock Hotel San Diego (www.hardrockhotelsd.com), a 420-room resort in the trendy Gaslamp quarter. The 12-story hotel includes a Nobu restaurant, two Rande Gerber bars, a spa and a Pinkberry frozen yogurt shop -- all under one roof. Greasing the wheels is Virgin America, which is starting service between San Diego and San Francisco in February. 
 45. MaLAGA
 The southern coast of Spain is not just about high-rise hotels and water-gulping golf courses. Next June, Delta Air Lines plans to inaugurate nonstop service to the Andalusian port city of Malaga -- a major cultural center, with its impressive array of museums and monuments, including an 11th-century Moorish fortress. Delta will fly from Kennedy Airport to Malaga's international airport, named after the city's favorite son Pablo Picasso. 
 46. PUERTO PLATA
 Puerto Plata, the rowdy beach resort on the Dominican Republic's north coast, is about to get rowdier. Maxim, the racy men's magazine, is opening a 108-bungalow resort on Cofresi Beach, near the Las Vegas-style Ocean World Marina and Casino. Expect the drinking to start onboard JetBlue, which is offering nonstop flights between Kennedy Airport and Puerto Plata next month. 
 47. LONDON
 King's Cross in London was once on the wrong side of tracks. But the district's fortunes are changing, thanks to the trans-Chunnel Eurostar, which moved its terminal last month from Waterloo to the reconstructed St. Pancras station. A Gagosian Gallery is there, along with cool bars and supertrendy restaurants like Acorn House (www.acornhouserestaurant.com), which has local foodies in a tizzy. Next up? A Renaissance Hotel with a ballroom. 
 48. VIETNAM
 Three decades after the fall of Saigon, the city (now known as Ho Chi Minh City) has become an unlikely stop on the global golf circuit. In the past decade, old courses like the Dalat Palace Golf Club have been spruced up, and newer ones, like the Ocean Dunes Golf Club in nearby Phan Thiet, on the South China Sea, and designed by Nick Faldo, have raised the bar. Still to come: the Montgomerie Links, just off China Beach, and the first Vietnam course designed by Colin Montgomerie.
 49. ESSAOUIRA
 As Marrakesh gets more touristy, well-heeled Europeans are heading to the Moroccan port city of Essaouira, not only to trek through its ancient streets and windsurf on its beaches, but also to party. The Gnaoua and World Music Festival (www.festival-gnaoua.net), held every June for the past 10 years, now draws 250,000 fans for five days of music, art and budding friendships -- a kind of Burning Man of Morocco. 
 50. LAS VEGAS
 In case you missed those big gold letters, Donald T-R-U-M-P is coming to the Las Vegas Strip. The 64-story, 1,282-room Trump International Hotel and Towers Las Vegas (www.trumplv.com) is opening next spring, becoming, its Web site promises, the ''most striking building on the Las Vegas Skyline.'' If you're merely looking for ''unparalleled luxury, sophistication, and contemporary chic,'' then head to the new Palazzo Las Vegas ( www.palazzolasvegas.com), a 3,000-room sister to the Venetian, with restaurants by Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse and Charlie Trotter, as well as a Barneys New York. 
 51. BAROSSA VALLEY, AUSTRALIA
 The world's love affair with shiraz is bringing wine spectators to Australia's Barossa Valley. The hilly region is home to some of the world's oldest shiraz vines, some dating back to the 1840s. And if the more than 60 wineries aren't enough, Barossa also offers an artisanal cheese trail, and nearby Adelaide is a foodie destination in its own right.
 52. TOKAJ, HUNGARY
 Backpacking wine tours? The Hungarian wine region of Tokaj is regaining its reputation for quality whites, especially wheat-colored dessert wines made from furmint grapes. The region's winemaking was reborn after the fall of Communism. The Grof Degenfeld, housed in an old castle, even has a plush hotel that offers two-day packages starting at 191 euros, or $283 at $1.50 to the euro (www.hotelgrofdegenfeld.hu). 
 53. NEW YORK
 The lights are back onBroadway. And the strike settlement couldn't have come soon enough for several well-publicized productions scheduled to open before the May 7 deadline for the 2007-08 Tony Awards. Among the more highly awaited shows are three revivals: A 40th-anniversary production of ''The Homecoming,'' Harold Pinter's play about a dysfunctional family (as if there were any other kind), starring Ian McShane; ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' the William Inge chestnut, featuring the Emmy Award-winning actress S. Epatha Merkerson; and an inventive take on ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' Stephen Sondheim's Pulitzer Prize winner, which comes to New York via London and the Menier Chocolate Factory theater company. And for lovers of street theater, the action downtown in the meatpacking district continues to heat up with the arrival of the Standard New York hotel.

HEADLINE: An Old Master Still in Development

BYLINE: By CHARLES ROSEN. 
Charles Rosen, a concert pianist, writes and lectures extensively on music.

 BODY:
ELLIOTT CARTER, a celebrated figure on the international stage even before Georg Solti took his Variations for Orchestra to Europe with the Chicago Symphony in 1971, is the most respected and admired of American composers. Festivals devoted to his music have taken place in many cities, including London, Paris and Madrid.
 And he is a prophet increasingly honored in his own country. Certain of his chamber works, especially the string quartets, have long been widely performed; less so, the orchestral works. But in recent years those too, though still uncompromisingly modernist, have been taken up around the country, championed above all by Pierre Boulez, Daniel Barenboim and James Levine.
 On Friday Mr. Carter's only opera, ''What Next?,'' had its New York stage premiere, beginning a run of performances that ends on Tuesday, his 99th birthday. 
 Looking younger every year, and more creative than ever, Mr. Carter is a genial, mild-mannered and unassuming man, extraordinarily cultivated, with a deep interest in art and literature as well as the entire history of music. Perhaps the most striking aspects of his character are a self-confidence and a lack of pretension, a rare combination. Even in the last few years his style has continued to develop, in a series of works that seem to become ever more immediately approachable without renouncing the individuality of his style.
 I first met Elliott Carter in 1956 at a concert of the International Society for Contemporary Music, held at what used to be called Carnegie Recital Hall (now Weill Recital Hall). Or rather, we met after the concert. One generally went to the society's concerts to see friends; only a small amount of the music played there was attractive, since most contemporary music, like most of the music of any other period of history, is of little interest. On this occasion, if I remember correctly, one work was a single note on a solo violin to be sustained for 1 hour 20 minutes (but the performance was abbreviated to 40 minutes).
 I knew several composers, and afterward we all went out to the Carnegie Tavern, now long gone but then on the corner of Seventh Avenue and 56th Street. Aaron Copland, Milton Babbitt, Arthur Berger and others were there, and I found myself sitting next to Elliott, whom I had never met but whose Piano Sonata I was then working on. I needed a grand and substantial American piece for a tour of Germany sponsored by the United States Information Service, which was trying to prove to Europeans how cultured Americans were. Elliott's sonata was the only avant-garde American work for piano after Ives that exploited the sound of the full-size concert piano with panache and even Romantic brilliance, and I was delighted with it, so I was pleased to meet the composer. 
 Copland, in an ebullient mood as he grandly paid for everybody's sandwich and beer, was due to appear on a late-night television talk show. Elliott said he had never been to a live television show, nor had I, so we both went to be in the audience and watch Copland discuss baseball, to show he was a regular guy and not just an intellectual classical musician. A few days later I was invited to dinner by Elliott's wife, Helen Carter. Elliott must have told her that I was presentable. 
 In 1961 Elliott invited me to play the solo piano in the premiere of the Double Concerto for harpsichord and piano at the Metropolitan Museum. Along with the First String Quartet and the Variations for Orchestra, this was Elliott's most ambitious work to date, calling for 2 orchestras of 6 musicians each, and 4 percussionists with 11 instruments each. It is a work of dazzling and original rhythm and sonority, with sound patterns that make arabesques in space and with a dramatic form that intricately opposes and combines different rhythmic worlds. (At one sensational moment the harpsichordist and all the other musicians gradually make an immense ritardando to a very slow tempo while the pianist speeds up to the point at which all the notes become a resonant blur.) 
 This work became immediately famous, partly because of Stravinsky's comment that at last we had an American masterpiece. But it was essentially a logical development of Elliott's musical thought that had started many years before, with the Sonata for Cello and Piano. Its first movement opens with the piano ticking away staccato in an absolutely regular metronomic beat while the cello has a rhapsodic and eloquent long melody that seems to exist in a rhythmic world of its own. The attempt to escape from a mechanical, simplistic and one-dimensional sense of time has been the most radical characteristic of Elliott's technique, together with the way he has tried to derive and shape the melodic material directly from the sonority of the different instruments. 
 By this time his style was largely his own. Unlike most of his contemporaries he never tried to compose in the 12-tone system, finding it absurdly constraining, although a copy of Schoenberg's Opus 25 Piano Pieces that he bought as a teenager on a trip to Vienna with his father was what stimulated his interest in music.
 He received encouragement from Charles Ives, and like many other American composers of the late 1920s and '30s, he was firmly in the Stravinsky Neo-Classical camp and studied in France with Nadia Boulanger. In the late 1940s he freed himself from this stylistic dependence, although his individuality had already been apparent for some time.
 Later influences on his work even include Mozart and Schumann. When I remarked to him on the originality of some virtuoso figuration in the Piano Concerto, Elliott just said, ''Oh, that's like one of the Chopin etudes.'' So it is, but it sounds like Carter. As T. S. Eliot remarked, minor artists imitate, major artists steal. Of course they make what they steal their own.
 Elliott was born in New York in 1908. His father, a wealthy importer of lace, disapproved of Elliott's choice of music as a profession and gave him no encouragement. Through much of his life his main support came from his wife, Helen, a brilliant woman who had been a sculptor and who was adored and feared by her many friends and admirers. She arranged everything firmly so that Elliott had the time and the peace of mind to work. They were happily and closely united for half a century until her death in 2003. 
 Even before a series of notable successes and his growing reputation had made Elliott's life much easier, he and Helen were extraordinarily generous in helping musicians. Elliott has been especially interested in the practical aspects of performing music since the 1940s, when he worked with and composed for George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein in what would eventually become the New York City Ballet. Above all Elliott has always been concerned to explore the capacities of each instrument and its special character, and many aspects of his work are inspired by this study. 
 Between the Cello Sonata and the Double Concerto, Elliott had made a breakthrough in his career with the lengthy String Quartet No. 1. Here, for the first time, as he has said, he allowed himself to write just the music that appealed to him, with no thought of audience or performer. Paradoxically the quartet quickly became his most popular work and was soon in the repertory of many string quartets. Pierre Boulez has remarked that he once thought that string quartet form was irretrievably old-fashioned but that Elliott's quartets had convinced him that something new and original could still be accomplished in it. More than any other composer Elliott made the string quartet into a dialogue and an adventure among four equal virtuosos. 
 For some time one of the attractions of Elliott's music may actually have been its difficulty: the challenge presented by his sense of time, which yields not cross-rhythms but cross-tempos, actions that seem to exist independently yet combine to create new syntheses. It is astonishing how many pianists, for example, have wanted to record as well as perform a difficult long work like ''Night Fantasies,'' and how many quartets keep the string quartets as an essential part of their repertory.
 But over the years this difficulty has largely dissipated. The music has become much easier to play, to listen to and to understand as it has entered into the general musical experience. Some of the works of composers he influenced now seem much more complex than his. Certain unreconstructed hard-core modernists are actually taken aback by the traditional eloquence that often appears in his work; one critic deplored Elliott's use of the classical score marking ''espressivo.''
 Such moments of lyricism are remarkable in ''What Next?,'' the one-act opera from 1998 now at the Miller Theater. It is clear that alongside all the innovative aspects of his technique, Elliott has never wanted to renounce the unashamed eloquence of the music of the past, which retains an essential role in his work. But there is also a certain reticence, an evasion of any final grandiloquence. None of his works, not even those with the grandest proportions, end with an emphatic bang; the last phrase is always the still, small voice. 
 Perhaps the most striking development in Elliott's style in the last three decades is the series of song cycles for solo voice and small chamber group. ''A Mirror on Which to Dwell,'' a setting of Elizabeth Bishop poems from 1975, was followed by ''Syringa,'' settings of John Ashbery, in 1978, and ''In Sleep, in Thunder,'' settings of Robert Lowell, in 1981. Most delicate and exquisite of all is the Italian cycle of 1998 on poems by Eugenio Montale, Salvatore Quasimodo and Giuseppe Ungaretti, ''Tempo e Tempi.'' 
 The creativity of recent decades has been extraordinary. Concertos for cello, for piano and for oboe register a new consideration of the sonority of each instrument; the power of invention appears to have become more immediate. And there is a series of imaginative short solo pieces and duos written for friends. In many of the latest productions, the most complex effects of his middle period reappear with a new economy and an easier conviction. So many composers develop a late style when they are about 50, but Elliott had to wait for his 80s to achieve his. 
 Yet those of us who are sure that his work is the finest and most moving musical inspiration of our time wonder what novel turns will be found in the new projects he continues to take up. What, indeed, is next?

HEADLINE: Teenagers and Cars: A Deadly Mix

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY

DATELINE: WESTON, Conn. 

 BODY:
 I AM the sort of desperately loving mother who serves her 17-year-old son death with his breakfast. The newspaper articles await him at the kitchen table, curled like inky scorpions beside the sweet quotidian offerings of pancakes and blueberry muffins. Here's a bit of the menu from just the last nine months in tristate-area headlines: ''Death of Girl, 16, Staggers Her School.'' ''Speed Cited in Fatal After School Crash.'' ''Head On Collision in Connecticut Kills Four Teenagers.'' ''Teen on Life Support After Crash.'' 
 I read these stories first, sipping coffee at 6 a.m. And as dawn blazes through the kitchen windows, I imagine the parents of those lost children awakening to the hideous wreckage of their lives. I can't help it. Such grim conjuring is a natural aftereffect of childbirth. The joy of a firstborn's arrival is followed by the stealthy creep of a deep-seated parental dread that the novelist John Irving dubbed the Undertoad. Here in the suburbs, that storied bosom of safe child-rearing, the Undertoad lurks most ominously behind a lightly piped request: ''Mom, can I have the car keys?'' 
 Of course, young immortals don't think so darkly. Our son, Sam, has had his driver's license for over a year now. He ferries himself and his 15-year-old sister to school, and these days, he often grabs breakfast in the cafeteria. He says he has had enough of my grisly side dishes. ''Half the kids I know get the same articles from their parents, over and over again,'' he says. ''I get it.''
 But does he? Do any of them see the very real peril? And as adults, don't we know enough -- and do enough -- to save them from themselves? Clearly not, according to national death and injury statistics that have shown virtually no improvement over the last decade. Each year, nearly 6,000 American teenagers die in car accidents involving teenage drivers, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; more than 300,000 are injured. The cost, in property damage and health care expenses, is $14 billion. The economic fallout will come as no surprise to anyone who has had to insure a male driver under 21. 
 Driving in the digital age has presented added worries. The cellphone owned by the 17-year-old girl who crossed the median into an oncoming tractor-trailer in one of this year's most horrific teenage accidents was found to be texting just before impact. It is not known which of the five girls who died in the fiery collision near Rochester was using it. 
 In this too-much-information age, there is also a hospitable new arena for auto braggadocio. I stumbled onto it last winter, when I showed Sam a photo of his classmate's crashed car that had been posted on a local news Web site. In short order, the boy involved, who was unhurt, had downloaded and displayed the picture on his Facebook page with a swaggering caption along the lines of ''SuperDude Walked Away From This.'' Where I saw terror, dude saw a trophy. 
 ''Nobody would want to see the crash photos I've collected,'' said Ralph Miro, Trauma/E.M.S. coordinator for Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. In 24 years as a paramedic, he has assisted at the worst roadside carnage. The relentlessness of the slaughter and grief compelled him in 1998 to start a statewide driver education program aimed at high school students called the Hard Truth. Presented with the help of volunteers from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Mr. Miro's road show, with its graphic accident scene and emergency-room slides and heart-rending testimony from victims and offenders, is heavily booked all over Connecticut -- especially during prom season. 
 Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who sometimes attends the sessions, told me earlier this year that he has seen students faint, weep and run from the auditorium. Mr. Miro says his program has reached more than 18,000 teenagers. How effective a deterrent it might be is still open to question: ''I keep waiting for the numbers to get better,'' he said. ''And every time I check, I'm stunned that they won't budge. Especially crashes involving D.U.I. They're still drinking and driving and dying.'' 
 Why can't we fix this? Graduated-licensing laws that restrict teenage driving in terms of curfews and passengers permitted now have a proven track record in keeping 16-year-old drivers safer. Almost all states now have such laws, yet only 60 percent of parents polled in a national survey by the Allstate Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Allstate Insurance, said they were aware of them. This is bad news indeed, since parents must be the laws' chief enforcers in terms of how late their children drive, and with whom.
 Virtually all parents polled believe that teenagers learn safe driving by example. Yet anecdotal evidence here in Fairfield County is hardly encouraging. I know of parents who were hosts at an under-age beer pong party, making a show of collecting car keys -- yet still encouraging drinking by 16-year-olds. Driving home from a travel basketball game, I watched one team dad floor his sports car on the Merritt Parkway -- with three gleeful eighth-grade boys in the car.
 ''In general, we've found that parents are not modeling good behavior,'' said Susan Duchak, program manager for Drive It Right, a national driver-safety initiative for teenagers sponsored by the Allstate Foundation. ''There's been plenty of research identifying risky behavior by teen drivers. What we need to focus on now are the attitudes -- teen and parental -- that let it happen.''
 Perhaps we adults are simply in denial. Barely a third of parents polled say they believe teenagers are good drivers. But 88 percent trust their own teenagers to drive safely; 55 percent say that if their children got into an accident, it would be someone else's fault. 
 ''Not my kid.'' I took comfort in that smug assumption too, especially as I heard and read of the growing roster of teenagers' auto mishaps in our small town: rollovers, skids, cars plowed into ditches, trees and woods. But not my kid, who fought, pouted, pleaded, then accepted his parents' rigid adherence to license restrictions. 
 Then Sam was ticketed for driving past midnight on an evening when his father and I were out. Finding the police officer's name on the $102 ticket, I called to thank him, for surely a lesson had been learned. But after the requisite grounding, two speeding tickets followed. The speed wasn't excessive; there was no alcohol involved. But the penalty, administered over the seemingly endless summer, seemed draconian to a high school senior with a new girlfriend and places to go: no driving for three months except straight to work or school. I am still not sure who suffered most.
 Attitude adjustment on both sides seemed like a good idea. As I booked the driver-retraining class mandated for an under-age driver with two moving violations -- this one run by the National Safety Council in cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles -- I did some home schooling of my own.
 The most comprehensive portrait of teenage driving behavior is a 2002 report by Allan F. Williams, for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, called ''Teenage Drivers: Patterns of Risk.'' Reading it can have the insomniac effect of a Stephen King novel. A few highlights: 
 The most dangerous time for your child is not while he or she is learning to drive, but in the first few months after getting a license. The accident rate is highest during the first month of licensed driving. 
 The risk of a fatal crash for a 16-year-old driver is three times as great at night as during the day. Driver error is by far the leading cause of fatal crashes, followed by speeding and alcohol. 
 Accident rates peak just before and after school hours. The study says, ''On a per-trip basis, students were about 44 times more likely to be killed in a vehicle with a teen driver than while riding on a school bus.'' Girls and boys at 16 get into nearly an equal number of accidents, but crash risk leaps exponentially with passengers; three or more riders quadruple the risk over driving alone. For male and female drivers, the highest-risk situations are with boys on board.
 I called a woman who has documented an intimate and harrowing view of boys and girls driving badly, Jennifer Boyd, a Hartford filmmaker. In May 2005, parents nationwide gasped at the terrifying cinema verite portrait of teenage drivers in her documentary ''Teens Behind the Wheel,'' on PBS. The film followed young drivers with two cameras mounted in the car, one trained on its occupants, the other out at the road ahead. Despite knowing they were being filmed, the teenagers sped, drove into poles, rolled through stop signs and tore around corners. 
 Ms. Boyd found herself with an unexpected dilemma. ''Eight out of the 10 kids we followed crashed,'' she said. ''I watched footage week after week, convinced this one boy was going to kill himself or someone else. Much of the time he had two or three passengers. I struggled for a week and said to myself, 'There's something more important here.' ''
 She literally stepped into the picture; on camera, Ms. Boyd shows the boy his footage. His mother is clearly distressed; his father seems unconcerned, offering a ''boys will be boys'' sort of dismissal. Parental attitudes so intrigued Ms. Boyd that she is now filming a sequel that adults may find even harder to watch. ''New studies are finding that kids are driving like their parents,'' she said. ''We're looking into just how influential that is.'' She is working with families and researchers at the University of Massachusetts, and the resulting documentary will be broadcast in May on Connecticut Public Television.
 Ralph Miro felt that he had to make a video version of the Hard Truth to keep up with demand from worried parents and school administrators. In schools, he uses still photos of accidents and aftermaths. And he finds it effective to personalize trauma. When he introduces offenders to high school audiences, it goes like this: ''Nick killed his brother.'' Or ''Robin killed her closest friend.'' And for Michael Poveromo, now 31: ''Mike killed two boys he'd known since fifth grade.''
 The accident took place in Ridgefield, Conn., on June 1, 1995, when Mr. Poveromo was 19. He served two and a half years in prison. On his release, working with MADD and the Hard Truth was mandated community service, but 13 years later, he still does it whenever he can fit it around his work as an account representative for a legal research company. He agrees with Mr. Miro, who says, ''I want kids to understand that killing someone does bring a life sentence.'' 
 Mr. Poveromo and his friend Chris had each had six beers when two other friends piled into the back of his car. I asked him to recount the accident as he does for teenage audiences. 
 ''I had been drinking to that middle stage, when you're fueled with overconfidence,'' he said. ''I can almost feel it sometimes, the way that I just nailed down on the gas when we left my friend's driveway. I was driving like an idiot. I turned around to talk to the guys in back. That's all it took, that split second. I turned back to the road, and I realized my car was veering right. I cut the wheel, but since I was going so fast, it just caused the back to slide. The car flipped, slid a couple hundred feet on its back and hit a tree. 
 ''I was upside down. I could hear Chris next to me in the front seat screaming, this frantic, panicked screaming. I remember feeling around my body to see if everything was there. I climbed out the passenger window. Chris did, too. I remember trying to do something for Rick and Mike in the back and not being able to do anything. 
 ''An officer and fire engines were there. There were beer cans all over the road, police saying, 'Who's the driver?' I can still feel his hand on my back shoulder, pushing me into the car. My parents had gotten there, and that was the first thing that they saw -- me with my hands cuffed behind my back. They had cut the entire side of my car open and were bringing Mike out on a stretcher. From his head down, he was covered in blood. I remember all that red. Three hours later, my parents came to the police station and told me Rick had died at the scene and Mike had died an hour later at the hospital.''
 Mr. Poveromo made himself go to both wakes and funerals. The families of the dead boys allowed him to go into the wakes alone to speak to his friends in their coffins. ''I told them I was sorry. The whole ordeal was by far the worst part, but it was really just the start of the whole journey. My friends were very supportive. I'm not trying to take away from my culpability. But it could have been any of them. Many a night I wasn't the person driving. It was kind of that culture, the way that we did things.''
 THE culture was this: Fake IDs bought in Times Square, beer easily bought in Danbury, two police stops involving alcohol in the weeks before the accident resulting in one court appearance with the directive to donate $100 to a charity. Mr. Poveromo still blames only himself, but he thinks he could have been stopped. He says he can deal with his remorse only because Michelle Lettieri, a MADD volunteer whose mother was killed by a drunken teenage driver, hauled him into the program while he was still in prison. 
 ''I did it because I needed to,'' he said. ''There would always be positive feedback from the kids. When you're feeling so bad about yourself, it's nice to hear something positive. I don't think I'd be where I am today if it wasn't for Michelle and Ralph. They were lifesavers for me.''
 His own family, he says, has been great. But sometimes he thinks they have been a bit too forgiving. ''There are still some things we disagree on. I think parents are always going to look at their children in the best light possible. There are times when I just want to tell them, Look, there's no one else to blame here.''
 He says he will keep speaking. But he has noticed a reluctance by some school administrators to allow students to ask him questions. He has seen spirited discussion cut too short, too often. ''It's a crapshoot from school to school. Some are really in denial that there's a problem. Especially in Fairfield County.''
 For Sam, the state's penalty for his reckless driving was far less painful than the one we imposed. To avoid license suspension, Sam took a $60, four-hour defensive-driving course one night at a nearby school. His fellow students included one other teenager and six adults. Given the intimate class size, the adults felt free to chide our boy for answering the instructor's questions and asking a few of his own. ''What's with you?'' one asked. ''Why are you talking?'' The most disgruntled was a man Sam described as ''late 50s, expensive suit, a business guy,'' who didn't mind admitting that he was taking the course for the 13th time. He was in a hurry to get it over with.
 Despite such adult exemplars, there was a bit of sobering information from the instructor that made an impression on Sam. If the speed limit is 50 and you're driving 60, your risk of dying doubles. The gain: Driving 10 miles at that speed, you'll save two minutes. For each 10 miles an hour more of speed, the more exponential the risk. Sam's conclusion: ''Not worth it.'' 
 I hope he believes that. As winter extends its chilly grasp, our children will venture down our steep, windy road each morning in the cold and dark aided by four-wheel drive, seat belts, lectures, prayers. We will argue hotly about whether it is too icy to drive. And though I think I will stop setting the breakfast table with highway carnage, I cannot let them leave, ever, without a kiss and a sweet admonition. Whatever the morning's maternal cliche -- be careful, go slowly, pay attention -- Sam's answer is tossed over his shoulder, casual and jaunty as a scarf:
 ''Of course.''

HEADLINE: How to Solve a Subprime Mess? An Iowan Says, Let's Caucus

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
A HALF-DOZEN years before subprime mortgages were on the national agenda, Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, led teams of state officials from around the country in negotiating settlements totaling more than $800 million with two large home lenders that were accused of misleading and overcharging borrowers.
 Now, as the mortgage boom of the last few years unravels, Mr. Miller is leading another multistate campaign to help consumers. This time, he is not threatening major litigation -- at least not yet. Rather, he is trying to stem what most experts say will be a surge of foreclosures by cajoling and pressuring mortgage servicing companies to modify loans before borrowers fall too far behind.
 ''It's not an obvious law-enforcement attitude,'' Mr. Miller, 63, said in early November in his office in Des Moines. ''But we view ourselves as consumer protectors and we see an avalanche of foreclosures sitting out there and you have to learn from experience.'' 
 The preference of Mr. Miller, a Democrat, for prevention over prosecution sets him apart from a newer, younger crop of attorneys general in other states. His counterparts in New York, Ohio and Massachusetts, all of whom are also Democrats, have filed lawsuits or publicly discussed their intention to bring cases against mortgage lenders, investment banks and credit rating agencies.
 The difference between Mr. Miller and his peers highlights the challenges facing policy makers as they decide how to respond to the mortgage crisis. Should they look to mete out punishment, try to stem rising foreclosures or focus on enacting new standards for future lending? 
 Though most government officials, including Mr. Miller, agree that all three approaches should be part of the response, there is less consensus on how aggressively and quickly each should be pursued. The Bush administration has focused mostly on foreclosure prevention and new regulations to check reckless lending in the future. (The Treasury Department and federal bank regulators on Thursday announced plans to freeze introductory rates on some adjustable-rate mortgages for five years.) Federal and state officials have also disagreed about who should take the lead role.
 Mr. Miller acknowledges that his loan modification effort, which is backed by 10 states, may not seem the obvious response from attorneys general, who typically focus on enforcing laws, not making policy. But he asserts that as an advocate for consumers, his group must try to forestall the devastation that foreclosures wreak upon neighborhoods. He cites the farm crisis that swept across Iowa in the 1980s as a strong influence on his thinking. Back then, he helped create and pass a law that required lenders to seek mediation of troubled farm loans before they could foreclose.
 Across the spectrum from Mr. Miller is Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general. Among government officials, he has been one of the most vocal about wanting to bring cases intended to highlight what he considers systemic problems in the mortgage market, like inflated appraisals and a lack of oversight of the secondary market where loans are packaged into securities.
 He recently filed a suit accusing the First American Corporation of overstating property appraisals to please Washington Mutual, a client; both companies deny that. Mr. Cuomo has also demanded that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hire an independent examiner to review loans they bought from Washington Mutual, and he has promised to bring more cases.
 Mr. Cuomo, who was the secretary of housing and urban development in the Clinton administration, said he respects and is involved in Mr. Miller's multistate efforts to prevent foreclosures, but believes that the approach is not a sufficient response to the mortgage crisis. 
 ''It's a false choice to say focus on treating the victims or attacking the source of the problems,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a recent interview. ''I will stick to the analogy of a forest fire: Do we put out the fire or do we treat the victim? You do both.'' 
 MR. MILLER says he understands the desire to pursue cases against lenders and others involved in the mortgage business. But he expresses some skepticism that a case could be built, for instance, against credit rating agencies, which have successfully fended off lawsuits in the past by arguing that the First Amendment protects their ratings. Other players whom officials have suggested should be investigated include investment banks that packaged subprime loans and sold bonds backed by mortgages. But federal law makes it hard to sue players in the secondary market for mortgages.
 ''If others develop some good theories, I would consider joining them,'' Mr. Miller said of his fellow attorneys general.
 The meltdown in the mortgage market has much in common with the farm crisis of the 1980s, he said. Then, as now, rapidly rising real estate prices and excessive borrowing were followed by a sharp slowdown. Many farmers who had expanded aggressively to take advantage of high crop prices and surging food exports were ruined when demand slackened and prices fell back.
 At the time, Mr. Miller pushed for a state law prohibiting lenders from foreclosing on farms without first seeking mediation. The Iowa Mediation Service, started in 1985, operated on the principle that even if farmers could not pay the full amount they owed, they often could pay something. In many cases, banks were happy to get that smaller amount instead of taking ownership of depreciating farmland.
 Micheal Thompson, executive director of the service, said that during the farm crisis, it settled 21,000 cases to the satisfaction of both parties; other borrowers had to walk away from 12,000 farms. 
 In September, Mr. Miller hired the mediation service to set up a toll-free phone line for homeowners in Iowa, which has the nation's seventh-highest subprime foreclosure rate, at 9.4 percent. (Ohio is No. 1, at 12.8 percent.)
 The Iowa service has received 4,100 calls and is working on about 520 mortgage cases. The service is close to settling 100 of those cases, Mr. Thompson said.
 Kathleen Keest, a senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending who once worked for Mr. Miller, said his responses to both the farm crisis and the current mortgage mess reflected his deep-seated pragmatism. ''Tom is one of the world's nice guys,'' she said. He takes the position of ''let's see if we can fix things; if we can fix it cooperatively, let's do it that way and move on,'' she added.
 MR. MILLER, an only child, grew up in Dubuque, a city of about 60,000 in northeastern Iowa. His father was a county assessor and his mother a nurse. After working as a Legal Aid lawyer and in private practice, Mr. Miller was elected attorney general in 1978. After an unsuccessful run for governor in 1990, he ran for attorney general again in 1994 and has not sought higher office since. He has spent all but 4 of the last 29 years in his current job.
 In part because of his long tenure, Mr. Miller wields considerable political clout in the state and the Democratic Party, where his endorsement can help swing some votes in the Iowa caucuses, which are on Jan. 3. This year he is the Iowa co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.
 In person, Mr. Miller is more ministerial than prosecutorial. He almost always maintains an even-tempered tone, even as he discusses lending practices that he says he considers abhorrent.
 Friends and associates say Mr. Miller's low-key approach should not be mistaken for weakness. They note his work leading several big cases, including those against major tobacco companies and Microsoft. 
 Though he does not appear inclined to sue mortgage companies at the moment, defense lawyers and other legal experts say that could change quickly if the industry does not cooperate with him on loan modification efforts.
 ''If that is not successful, I would expect there would be enforcement,'' said Andrew L. Sandler, a partner at Skadden, Arps who works on consumer financial services cases.
 And despite his Midwestern pragmatism and laid-back sensibility, Mr. Miller sees a big role for himself and his office on the national stage. In the 1980s he realized that to have an impact on the forces affecting farmers, an important constituency for any Iowa politician, he would have to become involved in issues being decided far from Des Moines, said James E. Tierney, director of the national state attorneys general program at Columbia Law School in New York and a former attorney general of Maine.
 ''He believes that the best interest of Iowa will not be effected only in the four corners of Iowa,'' Mr. Tierney said. 
 Mr. Miller was criticized in Iowa and elsewhere for his involvement in the Microsoft and tobacco cases; the critics said these cases ventured far afield into areas where his state did not seem to have a big stake.
 Those cases also put him at odds with federal officials, a tension that is present in the mortgage area, too. Mr. Miller and other attorneys general have battled with federal policy makers over how closely lenders should be monitored, with the states arguing for more supervision.
 And the two sides have argued in court over states' jurisdiction over banks and their subsidiaries; federal officials have prevailed on many of these disagreements.
 The two cases that made Mr. Miller one of the nation's top authorities on subprime lending came earlier this decade, when a large group of states sued Household International, now part of the British banking giant HSBC, and then the Ameriquest Mortgage Company. 
 In those cases, a group of attorneys general and bank regulators brought lawsuits based on consumer complaints and what they called evidence of deceptive practices. The Household case was settled in 2002, and the company agreed to pay $484 million, much of it to compensate borrowers. The company also agreed to limit its fees to 5 percent of the loan amount.
 In 2006, a large group of states reached a $325 million settlement with Ameriquest, which was then one of the biggest subprime lenders. The agreement required the company to provide better disclosures of loan terms, to charge customers with similar credit histories the same interest rates, to improve how it conducts appraisals and to make other changes in its lending. Neither Household nor Ameriquest admitted to any wrongdoing.
 THE cases were broadly seen as victories for consumers, but some consumer advocates have called them hollow victories, in part because subprime lending grew rapidly after they were settled and more homes are now in foreclosure. 
 The Ameriquest settlement was successful at improving lending practices at the company's retail branch network but did not apply to the Argent Mortgage Company, an Ameriquest affiliate that operated through mortgage brokers. (Roland E. Arnall, who became the American ambassador to the Netherlands last year, owned both companies. Citigroup recently acquired Argent, and Ameriquest's retail lending unit was closed.)
 Calvin Bradford, a housing researcher and consumer advocate in Williamsburg, Va., says he is ambivalent about the results of the Ameriquest and Household cases. He said he appreciates the effort Mr. Miller and other attorneys general put into the cases at a time when most regulators were not paying attention to subprime lending. But, he says, they should have anticipated that the industry would start doing business through brokers. Mortgage brokers are lightly regulated, mostly at the state level. Over the last decade, officials have often discussed regulating brokers more closely but have made few changes. 
 ''The A.G.'s were busy settling these cases, but you didn't see a lot of foresight,'' Mr. Bradford said.
 He points to mortgage default rates that show that while relatively few Ameriquest loans made in 2006 encountered problems, mortgages made by Argent, a wholesale lender, were increasingly shaky. Defaults on loans made last year by Argent are nearly twice what they are at Ameriquest, according to data from Moody's Investors Service. 
 Mr. Miller and others involved in the two cases argue that they did see the shift but did not have enough time before the industry imploded to build a case against other lenders that did business through brokers. 
 Chuck Cross, a vice president for mortgage regulatory policy at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and a former banking regulator for the state of Washington, recalled that Mr. Miller was often the voice of reason when states fought among themselves on the best course of action in the Household and Ameriquest cases. Some states argued for a quick settlement; others pushed the group to take the cases to court.
 ''At times we were in greater fights with each other than the companies,'' he said. ''Tom landed in the middle: leave the company intact, change its practices and put hundreds of millions of dollars back into consumers' pockets.''

HEADLINE: Artistically, Light Years Ahead

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
THE way people talk about the art bubble, as some fragile thing about to pop, you would think it was made of money. But though there is plenty of green around, as this weekend's enormous Art Basel Miami Beach juggernaut clearly proves, the artisphere is forged of sterner stuff than junk bonds. It is so much about connections -- aesthetic, intellectual and, above all, social -- that the real art bubble is more like a rarefied world under glass, where you can look at, buy, talk about and live with art, all while breathing some exclusive art fumes.
 This may sound like a stretch. But to the avant-garde artist Mariko Mori, the art bubble has even more dimensions. With her endearingly shaky grasp on English and her all-white space-age clothes, Ms. Mori has merged the worlds of performance, sculpture, photography and science to create a compellingly futuristic vision that has influenced design as much as art. 
 For one of her major projects, ''Body Capsule,'' begun in 1996, she photographed herself lying inside a clear, oblong plexiglass bubble in sites like the Pyramids, the Ginza and Times Square.
 Snow White from space? Kind of, but no. 
 ''That was about creating a transcendent area of time and space,'' said Ms. Mori, who was signing copies of a new book, ''Oneness,'' (Hatje Cantz) at the Miami fair last week. ''My recent work is about supernovas and the dying of stars.''
 Even her lucky rabbit's foot has an extraterrestrial pizazz: a jagged, three-inch shard of moldavite.
 A rough-textured pine-green natural glass, moldavite resembles nothing so much as the mythical Kryptonite. It is a kind of tektite, formed by the heat wave of a meteorite striking earth, then cooled as terrestrial material hurtles through the atmosphere to land dozens or hundreds of miles away. 
 Moldavites, specifically, are tektites created when a meteor crashed into what is now western Bavaria 14 million years ago. Most often found in Bohemia in the Czech Republic, they have been used there as a local gemstone for centuries.
 They are not, as is frequently stated, from outer space. And surprisingly, Ms. Mori prefers it that way. A onetime collector of meteorites, she actually prefers her moldavite's (and her own) earthly origins.
 Again, the simple reason comes down to connections. Though her pieces like ''Body Capsule'' suggest a disconnectedness you could almost measure in light years, she insists the opposite is true. ''Through the process of making work, with different scientists, engineers, fabricators, I get more connected,'' she explained -- sort of.
 She gets a similar feeling from the gem, which she clutches before flights or public speaking. ''I like the idea of the impact and the crystallization,'' she said. 
 Having a record of the event makes it seem both more magical and more real than having the meteorite itself. ''It reminds me of the scale of life itself -- of the chance of me being here, of us being beings,'' she said. ''The idea of crystallization is almost equal to that.''
 She bought the moldavite from a rare-minerals dealer, and for a while she wore it proudly around her neck, like an amulet. But she soon found that, though it is not terribly valuable, she preferred to tuck it into a white leather Hermes key fob.
 ''I hide it,'' she said. ''It's better not to be exposed so much.''
 Even earthlings need to disconnect sometimes.

HEADLINE: The 'R' Word Doesn't Have to Be So Scary

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS fears over the credit crisis and housing correction have mounted, a growing chorus of economists has been talking up the probability of a recession next year. 
 For investors, there are few things as scary as the ''R'' word. That's because, historically, recessions have often wreaked havoc on stock portfolios. Since 1945, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has tumbled nearly 26 percent, on average, in the periods leading up to and during recessions. Worse, equity investors have had few places to hide during these downturns, as virtually every sector of the market has lost ground, on average, during the last 11 recessions, according to S.& P.
 But if you're a buy-and-hold investor with a balanced portfolio consisting of stocks for growth and fixed-income securities for ballast, ''you don't need a place to hide,'' said Mike Scarborough, president of the Scarborough Group, an investment advisory firm based in Annapolis, Md., that works with 401(k) plan participants. 
 Indeed, investors are encouraged to establish a long-term mix of stocks and bonds and cash in the first place -- and to maintain it over time -- largely to keep their portfolios on an even keel no matter which way the market winds are blowing.
 And history shows that a balanced asset-allocation strategy can provide that stability. Consider the last recession, which lasted from March to November of 2001, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. 
 During that period, a portfolio mirroring the S.& P. 500 index would have lost 7.2 percent of its value. But had you invested in a balanced way, with 60 percent of your money in S.& P. 500 stocks, 30 percent in domestic bonds and 10 percent in cash, you would have lost 2 percentage points less. That's according to an analysis run by the investment management firm T. Rowe Price.
 This balanced portfolio would have benefited from its stable fixed-income investments, which rose in value as interest rates fell during that time. 
 Bonds won't always bolster your portfolio, though. During the 16-month-long recession from November 1973 to March 1975, it was cash that really shone. During that recession, which coincided with the 1973-74 bear market, equities lost nearly 18 percent of their value. But as 30-day Treasury bills, a proxy for cash, generated double-digit gains, a 60-30-10 portfolio would have fallen only 8.4 percent during this stretch.
 Of course, this raises a question: If you really fear recession, why not go entirely to bonds and cash? The simple answer is that there are major risks associated with trying to time the market. Mr. Scarborough says it's impossible to know whether a recession is on the way. But, he added: ''Let's say a recession is coming and you go to cash. Great. Even assuming you got that call right, now tell me when you think is the right time to get back in?''
 Even if a recession is imminent, there's no guarantee how any asset class will perform during the downturn. For instance, during the recession from July 1990 to March 1991, the S.& P. 500 actually gained 7.6 percent. But because of the stellar performance of bonds, a balanced 60-30-10 portfolio actually gained slightly more, 7.7 percent. 
 To be sure, the reason to maintain a diversified portfolio is not to outperform the market, but to prevent you from panicking during a short-term crisis in equities, said James A. Shambo, a financial planner in Colorado Springs. And that's what recessions have been in recent decades: extremely brief episodes.
 Since 1945, the average recession has lasted only 10 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. You have to go back to the Great Depression to find an economic downturn that lasted longer than 16 months. So if a recession is at hand, ''there's a good chance that this is really only a temporary concern,'' Mr. Shambo said.
 Unfortunately, many investors are likely to panic in the event of a recession because they haven't taken the time to establish an asset allocation plan, financial planners say. Even worse, those who have settled on an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds and cash aren't safeguarding their strategy by periodically rebalancing their assets.
 How do we know this? Every year, Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit research firm, studies the behavior of the nation's 401(k) participants. In 2006, only 17 percent of 401(k) investors made even a single trade. Yet to rebalance your portfolio, you have to sell some winning assets or buy some losing ones (or at least some that have been relatively unsuccessful). 
 If you don't rebalance every year, assets that have been outperforming will become a bigger and bigger part of your portfolio, said Pamela M. Hess, Hewitt's director of retirement research. And that means you may be overexposed to equities -- in particular, specific types of shares like emerging-market stocks -- just as the economy is slowing. 
 Ms. Hess says the simplest way to establish and maintain an asset allocation strategy is to invest in a so-called target date retirement fund. These all-in-one portfolios invest in a mix of stocks, bonds and cash that are considered appropriate for someone your age or with your time horizon. 
 Better still, these professionally managed mutual funds also reset your mix periodically, which means you don't have to worry about rebalancing.
 IF you don't want to cede control of your portfolio to a single manager, there may be another choice. Today, 42 percent of 401(k) plans offer an automatic rebalancing, resetting your mix of stocks, bonds and cash once a year. 
 Relatively few investors are using this tool, and last year, about 15 percent of those who were using it dropped it. 
 ''The truth is, the bulk of people aren't really doing anything when it comes to asset allocation and rebalancing,'' Ms. Hess said. That's unfortunate, she said, because at the end of the day, a diversified asset allocation strategy will ensure that your portfolio isn't entirely exposed to stocks just when they're most vulnerable.

HEADLINE: Mugged in Maplewood

BYLINE: By MARTY LIPP. 
Marty Lipp is the communications director at the Harlem Children's Zone, a nonprofit community-based organization.

DATELINE: Maplewood 

 BODY:
 ON a recent Friday night this fall, while a number of my neighbors were watching Jodie Foster blow away bad guys at the Maplewood Cinema, I was a few blocks away in this middle-class New Jersey suburb, getting mugged.
 Mugged? When I told people in the days after, it almost seemed retro, as if I had decided to put on A Flock of Seagulls album or go to a roller disco. 
 But from my work at a children's social-service agency in Harlem, I know that street violence is down, not out; it's still an unforgettable presence for many. And now I had a broken nose, swollen jaw, aching ribs and two black eyes qualifying me to join the ranks of the victims of violence. 
 But Maplewood? It's a town that my wife and I chose four years ago as an alternative to expensive, space-restricted city living, one that is racially if not economically diverse, about as cosmopolitan and progressive as a suburb gets. But violence? That was a part of city life I assumed I had left behind.
 As I walked up Oakland Road at about 8:15 that night, I expected the same thing I experienced every night on my walk home for the past four years: nothing. Having had a few minor hassles in Harlem, I am wary of my surroundings there, but on my 20-minute walk from the New Jersey Transit station, I am usually just in my head, reviewing the day, maybe trying to remind myself to enjoy the greenery. The most concern I ever had was late one night when I found myself sharing the sidewalk with a large, waddling skunk.
 Suddenly, four teenagers jumped me from behind. I got the wind knocked out of me when I hit the ground, landing on my loaded backpack. Then the four boys kicked and punched me. They told me to stay on the ground, one punching me square in the face when I reflexively tried to lift my head. 
 ''Your wallet,'' one barked, and I handed it over. One of them pulled out some bills, then dropped the wallet on my midsection. As quickly as they came, they were gone. 
 The police and emergency workers were on the scene almost immediately and were great, though the police officers were unable to find the teenagers. Soon, I was sitting on a plastic chair in the St. Barnabas emergency room, trying to watch television without my glasses, my clothes and the towel held to my face splattered with blood, sitting among people with less-obvious medical needs.
 ''In Maplewood?'' asked each E.R. staffer when I related what had happened to me. In subsequent days, it was a reaction I heard repeatedly.
 Was the attack some kind of gang initiation? The police officers and my Harlem colleagues tended to not think so, since I was still alive and no one had slipped a knife in my side. But it did seem to be some kind of rite of passage, teenagers proving to themselves and each other that they're tough. Why else attack first and then ask for money? The violence seemed recreational; the money incidental, maybe blown on some pizza after the attack, maybe on some pot and booze to share together with some nervous laughter as their adrenaline subsided. Maybe they even caught the late showing of ''The Brave One.''
 Unlike Jodie Foster on the big screen, I haven't dreamed of revenge. The next day, I woke up to a nice house and caring family. I replaced the $60 in my wallet by punching a few keys at an A.T.M. -- never before did it seem so easy. I have resumed my daily walk home, with a nagging sense that maybe I need to find an alternative. 
 What would I say to the teenagers who mugged me? You may have felt great as you ran down Oakland Road and escaped into the night, but you're going down a dead end. Look around you and look ahead. That path leads to prison, an early grave or a life of desperation that will grind you down. You can still turn yourself around.
 What would I say to my neighbors? Well, some better lighting on Oakland Road would be great. But more important, we need to remember that top-shelf home-security systems are not enough. We need to light a path for young people. If we don't, the brilliance of this American dream that we like to think we are living will always be dappled by darkness.

HEADLINE: Industrial Evolution

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN M. FRIEDMAN. 
Benjamin M. Friedman is an economics professor at Harvard. His most recent book is ''The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.''

 BODY:
A FAREWELL TO ALMS 
 A Brief Economic History of the World. 
 By Gregory Clark. 
 Illustrated. 420 pp. Princeton University Press. $29.95. 
 Every story has to begin somewhere. Do we think technological progress was responsible for the Industrial Revolution and the astonishing increase in living standards in some countries but not others since then? Fine, but what brought about the new technology? Maybe social and political institutions -- democracy, tolerance, the rule of law -- played a role in when and where living standards increased. But where did they come from?
 After decades of banishment to the realm of sociology and other such disciplines, the idea that a society's ''culture'' matters has recently reappeared in economics. David Landes, an economic historian and a living national treasure if there ever was one, began this movement nearly 10 years ago when he looked in part to culture to explain ''why some are so rich and some so poor'' (the subtitle of his classic overview of world history). 
 But why not go one step further: If culture is responsible, where does it come from? Why do some countries have an economically helpful culture while others don't? And, since no society got very far in economic terms before the Industrial Revolution, what caused the culture of the recently successful ones to change? 
 In ''A Farewell to Alms,'' Gregory Clark, an economic historian at the University of California, Davis, suggests an intriguing, even startling answer: natural selection. Focusing on England, where the Industrial Revolution began, Clark argues that persistently different rates of childbearing and survival, across differently situated families, changed human nature in ways that finally allowed human beings to escape from the Malthusian trap in which they had been locked since the dawn of settled agriculture, 10,000 years before. Specifically, the families that propagated themselves were the rich, while those that died out were the poor. Over time, the ''survival of the richest'' propagated within the population the traits that had allowed these people to be more economically successful in the first place: rational thought, frugality, a capacity for hard work -- in short the familiar list of Calvinist, bourgeois virtues. The greater prevalence of those traits in turn made possible the Industrial Revolution and all that it has brought. (A lacuna in the argument is that Clark never says just how prevalent this Darwinian process made the traits he has in mind. Would an increase from, say 0.05 percent of the population to 0.50 percent have mattered much?)
 Clark's book is delightfully written, offering a profusion of detail on such seeming arcana as technology in Polynesia and Tasmania before contact with the West, 
 Sharia-consistent banking practices in the Ottoman Empire and bathing habits (actually, the lack thereof) in 17th-century England. But Clark's eye is fixed steadily on the idea he's pushing; the details are fascinating, but they are there because they help make his central argument. Clark is also marvelously adept at drawing out the relevance of many facets of his historical inquiry for present-day concerns. For example: ''We think of the Industrial Revolution as practically synonymous with mechanization, with the replacement of human labor by machine labor. Why in high-income economies is there still a robust demand for unskilled labor? Why do unskilled immigrants with little command of English still walk across the deserts of the U.S. Southwest to get to the major urban labor markets to reap enormous rewards for their labor, even as undocumented workers?''
 The heart of Clark's analysis consists of a detailed examination of births, deaths, income and wealth in England between 1250 and 1800, as evidenced primarily by wills. Although the records are scant, he finds that on average richer people were more likely to marry than poorer people, they married at earlier ages, they lived longer once they were married, they bore more children per year of marriage, and their children were more likely to survive and to bear children themselves. The result was centuries of downward mobility, in which the offspring of richer families continually moved into the lower rungs of society. Along the way, their behavioral traits and attitudes became ever more dominant.
 Clark's hypothesis is interesting for at least two reasons. First, it provides an internal mechanism to explain the Industrial Revolution. No deus ex machina, like James Watt's improving the steam engine, or the Whigs' overthrow of James II leading to England's Glorious Revolution, is necessary. Given the conditions at work in England nearly a millennium ago, changes naturally occurred that made an industrial revolution probable, if not inevitable.
 Second, Darwinian evolution is usually seen as a process that works over very long periods of time, with consequences for humans that we can observe only by looking far into the past. By contrast, Clark's explanation for the Industrial Revolution is a change in ''our very nature -- our desires, our aspirations, our interactions'' -- that occurred within recorded history, indeed within the last half-dozen centuries. His idea also stands in contrast to the entire orientation of Enlightenment thinking, including Adam Smith's, toward accepting human nature as it is and asking what social institutions would allow humankind with that nature to flourish (as Rousseau put it, ''men as they are and laws as they should be'').
 One frustrating aspect of Clark's argument is that while he insists on the ''biological basis'' of the mechanism by which the survival of the richest fostered new human attributes and insists on the Darwinian nature of this process, he repeatedly shies away from saying whether the changes he has in mind are actually genetic. ''Just as people were shaping economies,'' he writes in a typical formulation, ''the economy of the preindustrial era was shaping people, at least culturally and perhaps also genetically'' (emphasis added). Nor does he introduce any evidence, of the kind that normally lies at the core of such debates, that traits like the capacity for hard work are heritable in the sense in which biologists use the term.
 The issue here is not merely a matter of too often writing ''perhaps'' or ''maybe.'' If the traits to which Clark assigns primary importance in bringing about the Industrial Revolution are acquired traits, rather than inherited ones, there are many non-Darwinian mechanisms by which a society can impart them, ranging from schools and churches to legal institutions and informal social practices. But if the traits on which his story hinges are genetic, his account of differential childbearing and survival is necessarily central. (Experts on medieval demography may also raise questions about Clark's reliance on wills, rather than parish records of births and deaths, but that is a different issue.)
 Another troubling aspect of Clark's book is the tension between his portrayal of the Industrial Revolution as a gradual development, as it would have to have been if it were the consequence of an evolutionary process -- ''the suddenness of the Industrial Revolution in England was more appearance than reality,'' he claims -- and his emphasis in early chapters on the iron grip of the Malthusian economy from which the Industrial Revolution finally allowed humanity to break free. Clark is thorough in explaining the perverse mechanics of the Malthusian world, in which food production and therefore population are strictly limited, together with the perverse implications that follow. (Catastrophes like the Black Death or failed harvests make people -- those who survived, that is -- better off by reducing the numbers competing for limited resources; improvements like sanitation or new medicines, or even charity, make everyone miserable.) And he repeatedly insists that this was the world in which humans, everywhere, lived for eons: ''Living standards in 1800, even in England,'' he writes, ''were likely no higher than for our ancestors of the African savannah.'' After this prelude, however, discovering that the Industrial Revolution is consistent with a Darwinian explanation because it occurred so gradually comes as something of a surprise.
 Clark's hypothesis also raises a troubling question about the future, albeit one he doesn't mention. If the key to economic progress in the past was the survival of the richest, what is in store now that the richest no longer outbreed everyone else? As he notes in passing, in most high-
 income countries today family income bears no systematic relation to the number of children produced. Further, the populations of some rich countries in Europe are shrinking, apart from immigration, and the United Nations Population Division projects that 97 to 98 percent of the entire increase in the world's population between now and 2050 will be in the developing world.
 Right or wrong, or perhaps somewhere in between, Clark's is about as stimulating an account of world economic history as one is likely to find. Let's hope that the human traits to which he attributes economic progress are acquired, not genetic, and that the countries that grow in population over the next 50 years turn out to be good at imparting them. Alternatively, we can simply hope he's wrong.

HEADLINE: The 7th Annual Year in Ideas

 BODY:
EDIBLE COCKTAIL, THE Dave Arnold, the head of culinary technology at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan, is by training not a chef but a sculptor. He worked with metals and machinery as an art student and once battled a fire-breathing dragon. (It was a modified air blower that spit flaming kerosene; he wore a welding jacket and carried a lance.) 
 These days Arnold's fits of ingenuity, though tame in comparison, are no less creative. Consider a recent offering from his kitchen laboratory: The edible cocktail.
 The premise is simple: Make a ''pickle'' with alcohol instead of salt and brine. The execution is more complicated. Arnold cuts peeled cucumbers into spears and puts them in a Mason jar filled with an 8-to-1 mixture of gin and vermouth. He also adds a touch of simple syrup to counteract the cucumbers' inherent bitterness. The Mason jar is then placed into a vacuum machine, which removes the air, collapsing the cucumbers' air pockets. This is a process similar to that used in sous-vide cooking, in which food is vacuum-sealed in a pouch and heated. Thanks to the Mason jar, the cucumbers keep their consistency. (If they were sealed in the usual plastic bag, they would lose their crunchiness.) 
 When the vacuum seal is broken, the martini mixture rushes in to fill the spaces in the cucumber where the air used to be. The resulting spears have the smooth, crisp texture of pickles. Arnold calls this kind of cucumber a ''flash pickle,'' as the changes in texture and flavor that can take days to produce with salt and brine take about two minutes in the vacuum machine. Each spear has roughly the same amount of alcohol as a standard martini. To serve, he sprinkles the spears with celery seed, grated lime zest and flaky Maldon sea salt. JON FASMAN
 ELECTRIC HOCKEY SKATE, THE [17] When Tory Weber, a hockey enthusiast from Calgary, went to fetch the paper one frigid day in 1985, the soles of his warm running shoes melted the ice on his steps, sending him tumbling backward. He wondered, ''What if I could get this reduced-friction scenario going in the right direction?'' Later, while working at a lumberyard, he began devoting free time to the idea of a heated ice-skate blade that would yield a better glide with less effort. The skate he devised finally goes on sale this month.
 Weber was still ''poor as a church mouse'' when, in 2001, he read about the development of a battery small enough to fit inside the molded plastic that holds a hockey skate's blade. He and a partner, Jeremy Furzer, began running tests and soon found that heated blades, which melt more ice and thus glide on a slightly thicker layer of water, can produce 50 to 75 percent less resistance to motion. ''I thought, Gee whiz, if we had a 5 or 10 percent difference we'd be in good shape,'' Weber says. 
 When they made their pitch to large skate manufacturers, the companies liked the idea but said to come back when it was fully commercialized. That happened again and again. Their fortunes improved in 2004, when Wayne Gretzky [18] signed on as an investor and endorser. Already, several unidentified N.H.L. players are using Thermablades during games as part of a league-approved trial. EVAN HUGHES
 FACES DECIDE ELECTIONS Here's something to keep in mind as election time approaches: Study the politicians. Not their dossiers or their domestic policies, but their faces. Because according to new research by Anthony Little, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, faces may decide elections. 
 During the last United States presidential election, Little created two computer-generated composite faces that reflected the differences between George W. Bush and John Kerry (but were unrecognizable as them): Kerry's face is longer and narrower; Bush's jaw is wider, his brow lower. Little and several collaborators surveyed people online and on the streets of Liverpool. The Bush face rated more ''masculine'' and ''dominant,'' while the Kerry face was more ''forgiving'' and ''likable.'' Though the Kerry face was ranked most ''intelligent,'' most participants said they'd choose the Bush face to run their country. ''The percentages were similar to how people actually voted in the election,'' Little says.
 People were then asked whom they'd elect during a time of war versus a time of peace: Kerry won the most ''face votes'' during peacetime, Bush during wartime.
 Of course, faces don't sway everyone. ''Die-hard Republicans or Democrats will vote for whoever's leading their party,'' Little says. But uncommitted voters are another story: ''Those are the voters more likely to be swayed by visual appearance,'' he says. ''They're also the ones who really swing elections.''
 How reliable are predictions of character based on facial interpretations? Not very. Earlier this year, Little published a paper describing ''personality inventories'' he'd taken of 191 people that determined whether they were extroverts or introverts. He then created two composite faces, blending the most extroverted subjects' faces into one and the most introverted subjects' faces into the other. He asked other people to rank those composite faces as extroverted or introverted. Their judgments were right only a bit more than half of the time. ''That's not terribly good,'' Little says. ''It's only slightly better than chance.''
 What does all this mean for this year's Democratic candidates? Hillary Clinton and John Edwards -- like Bush -- have faces rounder than Kerry's, while Barack Obama's is more Kerry-like: long, slender, with a similarly high brow. Does that mean Clinton and Edwards are more likely to win, since we're at war, while Obama would likely win during peacetime? Little isn't sure. ''Sex and race do make the predictions more complicated,'' he says. REBECCA SKLOOT
 FAKE TILT-SHIFT PHOTOGRAPHY Tilt-shift photography may be destined to become a visual cliche. But for the moment, this playful technique -- which can make shots of cityscapes, train stations and loading docks appear to be photos of obsessively detailed scale models -- is flourishing on photo-sharing sites like Flickr. This year it even inspired the sincerest form of flattery: fakery.
 Tilt-shift lenses permit an unusual degree of control over a picture's depth of field, allowing for more variation in what is in focus and what is not. In recent years, Olivo Barbieri and a handful of other adventurous art photographers found a novel application for the lenses. By radically skewing the gradient of focus in a landscape image, the photographer can make us feel disoriented, as if we're looking close-up at a miniature. Barbieri's aerial shots of Las Vegas make you wonder, What kind of person would bother to construct a perfect replica of the Luxor casino? No kind, of course, and that's the point.
 Making real tilt-shift pictures requires expensive photo equipment. But that has not deterred the multitudes who this year submitted their photos to Flickr's Tilt-Shift Miniature Fakes pool. These are conventional digital photographs that have been manipulated in Photoshop to mimic Barbieri's focal tricks [19]. There's a forlorn municipal golf course, an Ikea parking lot, an Auburn-L.S.U. football game -- all cast in the same tiny unreality.
 In principle, it's not hard to make a fake: essentially, pick an area in a photo that you want to sharpen, then blur the rest. (Unnatural color saturation, one helpful fake-tilt-shift tutorial offers, ''makes it look more as if it's built from polystyrene and lichen.'') In practice, it's harder. ''Mini Portsmouth'' may have started out as just another charming quayside snapshot, but somebody spent an hour or two getting the level of Gaussian blur perfect enough to make you wonder, if only for a second, whether it was a model.

 FISH-FLAVORED FISH [20] As stocks of ocean-caught fish dwindle in the face of overfishing and environmental changes, farmed fish has flooded the market, helping to meet our growing appetite for seafood. But one sector of the seafood industry has remained elusive. Fast-food restaurants, which serve hundreds of millions of deep-fried-fish sandwiches every year, have always chosen wild species over farmed ones, because the flavor is better. 
 But now even these piscean purists may start buying from the farm. This spring, after 10 months of testing, the aquaculture company HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries created what it calls ''sea-flavored'' tilapia, the first farmed fish manipulated to taste like a wild fish. ''It met 10 out of our 10 taste parameters,'' says HQ's president and C.E.O., Norbert Sporns. The company, which is negotiating distribution deals with several fast-food chains, employs good old-fashioned food-processing technology to imitate the industry standard. It uses flavoring compounds to replicate the mild taste of Alaska pollock, a northern Pacific whitefish that holds a near-monopoly over products like fish sticks, imitation crabmeat and frozen fish fillets. HQ has even found a way to replicate the mushy texture of cooked pollock.
 Can imitation pollock help conserve the real thing? Finding an alternative whitefish, ecologists say, could curb market demand for wild pollock if rising temperatures in the Bering Sea cause their numbers to decline. In other words, the trend in farming seafood could help the wild species endure another trend: global warming. CHARLIE FOSTER
 GOD EFFECT, THE Some anthropologists argue that the idea of God first arose in larger societies, for the purpose of curbing selfishness and promoting cooperation. Outside a tightly knit group, the reasoning goes, nobody can keep an eye on everyone's behavior, so these cultures invented a supernatural agent who could. But does thinking of an omniscient God actually promote altruism? The University of British Columbia psychologist Ara Norenzayan wanted to find out. 
 In a pair of studies published in Psychological Science, Norenzayan and his student Azim F. Shariff had participants play the so-called ''dictator game,'' a common way of measuring generosity toward strangers. The game is simple: you're offered 10 $1 coins and told to take as many as you want and leave the rest for the player in the other room (who is, unbeknown to you, a research confederate). The fair split, of course, is 50-50, but most anonymous ''dictators'' play selfishly, leaving little or nothing for the other player. 
 In the control group of Norenzayan's study, the vast majority of participants kept everything or nearly everything -- whether or not they said they were religious. ''Religious leaders always complain that people don't internalize religion, and they're right,'' Norenzayan observes. 
 But is there a way to induce generosity? In the experimental condition, the researchers prompted thoughts of God using a well-established ''priming'' technique: participants, who again included both theists and atheists, first had to unscramble sentences containing words such as God, divine and sacred. That way, going into the dictator game, players had God on their minds without being consciously aware of it. Sure enough, the ''God prime'' worked like a charm, leading to fairer splits. Without the God prime, only 12 percent of the participants split the money evenly, but when primed with the religious words, 52 percent did [21]. 
 When news of these findings made headlines, some atheists were appalled by the implication that altruism depends heavily on religion. Apparently, they hadn't heard the whole story. In a second study, the researchers had participants unscramble sentences containing words like civic, contract and police -- meant to evoke secular moral institutions. This prime also increased generosity. And unlike the religious prime, it did so consistently for both believers and nonbelievers. Until he conducts further research, Norenzayan can only speculate about the significance: ''We need that common denominator that works for everyone.'' MARINA KRAKOVSKY
 HANDSHAKE SEX APPEAL Gordon Gallup, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Albany, has a suggestion for women going on first dates: Bring a handgrip dynamometer. It's a small, purse-size device they can use to measure their date's grip strength. Why? Gallup's new research suggests that handgrip strength in men is directly connected with reproductive fitness.
 People with high grip-strength scores are usually healthier than those with weak grips. ''They live longer and recover faster from injury,'' Gallup says. ''They have reduced disability, higher bone density and greater fat-free body mass.'' And in a study published this year, Gallup and his son Andrew -- at the time an undergraduate psychology major -- found that males with high grip-strength scores reported being more aggressive and dominant and had more masculine body types (broader shoulders, narrower hips). They also had ''increased sexual opportunities,'' which resulted in an increased number of sexual partners, and younger ages of first sexual encounter. (For women, handgrip may be more about sexual protection than prowess: Gallup has found that women's hand strength increases when they're most fertile, a trait he says may have evolved to prevent forced impregnation by unwanted mates.)
 A logical response to the news that handgrip relates to sexual fitness would be to buy hand-exercising equipment. But that won't get you far. Grip strength, Gallup says, is largely genetic -- certain genes increase testosterone levels, which increase muscle mass. Evolutionarily speaking, its genetic basis may relate to the fact that our primate ancestors traveled by swinging through trees. ''Clearly, grip strength is important under those conditions,'' Gallup says. ''I mean, if you lose your grip on one of those branches, you're at risk of falling. And falling out of the canopy does not bode well for your future genetic stability.''
 In general, Gallup says, what people find attractive are traits that signal the ability to pass along genes to future generations. So female primates evolved an attraction for mates less likely to fall from trees. It's also possible that males with strong hands were better hunters and protectors.
 Gallup's research leads to another question: Knowing all this, does he worry about his handshake, which he has presumably passed on to his son? No, he says: ''It's pretty substantial.'' He measured it. REBECCA SKLOOT
 HEIGHT TAX, THE Should we tax tall workers at a higher rate than their shorter peers? The answer -- yes -- ''follows inexorably'' from reigning academic theories of taxation, argues Greg Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard (and former chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers), in a working paper first circulated in April. 
 Optimal-tax theory is an area of economics that deals with such questions as whether the I.R.S. should treat capital gains and wages the same. Its larger aim is to design ways to raise money for public use without distorting economic choices. A key insight in the field is that an optimal taxer seeks to avoid penalizing effort. Therefore, any moneymaking quality that can be clearly set apart from effort is of special interest.
 Height is a prime example, according to Mankiw and his graduate student Matthew Weinzierl, because of its surprisingly strong correlation with income. According to one study they cite, the typical 6-foot American earned $5,525 more than a 5-foot-5-inch worker, after correcting for sex, age and weight. One possible explanation for the height-income correlation is that height breeds self-esteem from the teenage years onward; another is that tall people were, on average, better nourished as infants and so tote around a few extra I.Q. points in their craniums. In either case, their money bonus does not derive from their own effort, so taxing it would cause no economic distortions. Using optimal-taxation formulas, Mankiw and Weinzierl crunch the numbers and come up with a ''tall tax'' amounting to 7 percent of a tall person's income. Short people would receive a 13 percent rebate.
 Do Mankiw and Weinzierl actually endorse such a system? Far from it. Rather, they argue, the proposed tax clarifies our thinking about taxation in general. They say that height is a ''justly acquired endowment'': it is not unfairly wrested from anyone else, so the state has no right to seize its fruits. By the same logic, they imply (though they do not state outright) that the government has no right to force someone with the ''justly acquired endowment'' of entrepreneurial genius to pay a higher tax rate. 
 Peter Diamond, an economist at M.I.T., says the paper's basic mistake is the notion ''that if you can draw a silly inference from an approach, then that discredits a model.'' He comments: ''I think there is probably no model that passes that test.'' CHRISTOPHER SHEA

HEADLINE: It's a Stretch: Suzuki, a Small-Car Specialist, Enters the Big Leagues

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI

 BODY:
TALK about being in the right place at the right time. Suzuki, known for motorcycles and little cars with great mileage that the Japanese love, had a surge in auto sales in the United States last year.
 Gas prices jumped and Al Gore made a movie. Suddenly Suzuki got America's attention.
 The company sold 101,000 vehicles in the United States in 2006, up an impressive 23 percent from a year earlier. It was the first time Suzuki's sales here had climbed into six figures. 
 The charge was led by the Forenza, Reno and SX4, which can hit 31 miles a gallon. Suzuki didn't really have to do a thing.
 Actually, that is unkind. The company did do something. It took the hyphen out of the XL-7. 
 The new XL7 seems out of place in Suzuki's thrifty lineup, because it's no high-mileage king; its economy rating is 15 miles a gallon in town and 22 on the highway under the revised 2008 guidelines. While the company calls the XL7 a midsize crossover, that label is misleading. The largest vehicle Suzuki has ever made, it is almost a foot longer than the truck-based XL-7 it replaced. The new car-based XL7 is about as midsize as Texas.
 Americans have been increasingly turning to crossovers, looking for sedanlike handling and performance, without having to sacrifice what they loved about S.U.V.'s in the first place. The XL7 gives you that experience, along with an optional third-row seat and a long warranty. It's a nice package.
 I spent two weeks with a 2007 XL7 and treated it like my minivan. I hauled the kids. I went to Costco. I raced a Corvette. (Just kidding.)
 As more automakers abandon the minivan, large families are looking for other ways to carry the gang. Although third-row seats are often hard to get into and uncomfortable once you do, they are a nice option for families like mine that need the third row only temporarily when a child is home from college. 
 While based on the Chevrolet Equinox, most of the XL7 is all Suzuki, and that's both good and bad. The plastic of the interior trim gives the wagon a cheap feel; the middle row seats can't be scooted forward; and entry to the third row -- pull, push, pull again, lift and shove -- is annoying (unlike the lovely one-motion entry into the third row of the Mazda CX-9).
 But the third row is relatively spacious, and once you're done with all that tugging, easy to climb into. The Suzuki-built 3.6-liter V-6, rated at 252 horsepower, is a nice upgrade from the 2.7-liter V-6 in the old hyphenated version. The new XL7 I tested was responsive, and the engine, coupled with the five-speed automatic transmission, gave me power immediately when I needed it.
 The version I had was the Limited, with the third seat, all-wheel drive and navigation system, which cost $29,549 for 2008. Antilock brakes, electronic stability control and front and side curtain air bags are all standard.
 With its unibody construction, the XL7 feels rather like a big sedan. It took curves with ease, although the body lean while taking a nasty curve on a highway off-ramp made me feel like a passenger on the Poseidon before its big moment. That was more my fault than the car's, but the ride was not as refined as the Toyota RAV4. At times, the XL7 felt like the truck it looks like.
 Of course, the real test is a trip to the warehouse club. The cargo area is a tight 14 cubic feet with the third row up, but fold the rearmost seat down into the floor and capacity grows to almost 50 cubic feet (or 95 feet if the second row is folded, too). I did a Costco run, bought a month's worth of supplies and had enough room to shop for my mother and sister.
 That reminds me. My mother is a great Italian cook, and while I was visiting her lasagna, I took the XL7 to Home Depot to pick up a screen door for her. It easily slid into the Suzuki, although that's not the point I'm trying to make. The point is, Suzuki has only about 500 dealerships in the United States (the big automakers have thousands), so they're not on every corner. The closest dealership to me in my state, Connecticut, is a half-hour away. The good news is that this dealer is near my mom's house, so I'd get dinner every time I visited the service department. Not a bad deal.
 But I'm not sure that the XL7 is. It's a comfortable, competent crossover with a gee-whiz 100,000-mile, seven-year powertrain warranty. But with the optional third-row seat and all-wheel drive, which are the reasons you buy a vehicle like this, an XL7 costs almost $27,000. That jumps to about $30,000 for a fully loaded Limited model. 
 At those prices, or just a bit more, I could buy many of Suzuki's more established third-row competitors, especially the smoother, although smaller, RAV4 or the terrific CX-9, without having to drive almost 30 miles to have the oil changed.
 Nearer to $20,000, an adequately equipped XL7 would be an attractive, economical choice. Otherwise, it wouldn't be my choice, even with the home cooking. 
 INSIDE TRACK: A nice try, but no lasagna.

HEADLINE: A Shore Thing

BYLINE: By WENDY WILLIAMS. 
Wendy Williams is the co-author of ''Cape Wind: Money, Celebrity, Class, Politics and the Battle for America's Energy Future on Nantucket Sound.''

DATELINE: Mashpee, Mass. 

 BODY:
 THIS fall, a new-energy project six years in the making was scrapped because of high construction costs. Partly financed by the Long Island Power Authority, the 40-turbine offshore wind project proposed for three miles off Jones Beach would have produced, at full capacity, about 140 megawatts. It would have cost nearly $1 billion to build. That's pretty expensive.
 The public utility had agreed to sign a long-term contract with the project's private developer, the Florida-based FPL Energy. The contract would have carried an escalating-cost provision, which would have been paid by customers who have no choice from whom they get their electricity. This would have helped guarantee financial security for FPL by passing on the risk to the public, which could well have been committed to a per-kilowatt-hour price that could have escalated over the years to become perhaps double that of coal-powered electricity. That's a big commitment. 
 Officials rightly decided that signing up its roughly 1.1 million customers to such a risky deal was unwise. It's one thing to ask the public to voluntarily pay for innovative energy technologies, and quite another to force them to ensure very high profits for a private entity. 
 Meanwhile, on Cape Cod, there's another offshore wind project also six years in the making. This 468-megawatt project, which could cost as much as $1.7 billion to build and is proposed entirely by a private developer without any such public guarantees, has weathered an onslaught of political storms. Nevertheless, Cape Wind Associates and its parent company Energy Management just keep on going. By now, the company has invested about $30 million of its own private capital in support of its idea, letting the public know that it believes in its idea, in its economic plan and in its technology. 
 What makes the two offshore wind projects, superficially similar, in fact so different? 
 On the most basic level, the issue boils down to location. Wind turbines and their support structures are not off-the-shelf products. Engineers must design them to meet the specific stresses expected. Offshore wind turbines must be able to withstand the worst storms and highest wave heights expected over a century. 
 At the Jones Beach site, chosen by the public utility and not by the private developer, the extreme wave heights required costly installation. The Cape Wind project avoids this design burden because it is nestled in the Nantucket Sound, protected by Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket to the south and Cape Cod to the north. Thus, installation costs are substantially lower. Megawatt for megawatt, the LIPA project would have been from two to three times as expensive.
 Why did the private entity rather than the public utility choose the technically better site? The utility's choice was based partly on political expediency. Safer and cheaper sites exist on Long Island but LIPA officials feared opposition from wealthy and well-connected property owners. 
 On Cape Cod, because Cape Wind investors are spending their own money, developers settled on the more commercially viable site from the outset. They chose technical excellence rather than political expediency. 
 Another important difference between the Long Island and the Cape Cod endeavors is the context within which both projects would have operated. 
 Massachusetts no longer has a traditional public utility like LIPA. Instead, customers choose among various private companies to get their power. This means that the developer -- and not customers -- will be absorbing the risk of a project that, while interesting and perhaps even commendable, involves the use of technology that isn't tried and true.
 Experts say that Cape Wind's power will probably lower rather than raise New England customers' monthly bills, even though the power it produces will most likely be more expensive on a per-kilowatt-hour basis than more conventional sources. This may seem counterintuitive, but it's actually a case of simple market competition. 
 Electric power in New England comes from about 350 privately owned generating plants spread throughout the six-state regional grid. Much of this power is sold on a competitive spot market. The more independent power producers, the lower the ultimate cost of that power. 
 Critics complain that Cape Wind investors will make huge profits through an array of tax advantages. That may be true. But the innovative project will be built at no financial risk to the public. If the project fails, customers won't have to bail the developer out. And if the electricity is too expensive, they won't sign up. 
 This public-versus-private power debate has raged for years. Recently, many commentators have been speaking about a return to the old utility system, often citing the Enron-style fiascos of the last few years. But in the case of developing new technology, private entrepreneurship enjoys important advantages. We need risk-takers, and private power offers an opportunity for innovation.
 The Long Island project forced an unfair burden on a public that lacks freedom of choice. Perhaps next time Long Island should look to private risk-taking entities like Cape Wind.

HEADLINE: China to Order Banks to Raise Cash Reserves

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
China said today that for the 10th time this year, it would order banks to raise the amount of cash they set aside, in order to curb inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. 
 The Central Bank said that it had ordered banks to increase their reserve ratios by a full percentage point, to 14.5 percent, in an effort to tighten the supply of money available for loans. It was the largest single reserve ratio move in four years.
 Economists said the move showed that Beijing was growing increasingly worried about growing inflationary pressure and the threat of a severe economic downturn before next summer, when Beijing is set to play host to the Olympic Games.
 This year, the economy has grown as much as 12 percent as the country piled up another year of record trade surpluses with the rest of the world, particularly the European Union and the United States.
 China is under mounting pressure to raise the value of its currency, which some economists say may help ease those trade gaps and better balance the global economy. But China's leaders have largely resisted that pressure, saying the country has already allowed its currency to gradually appreciate, up about 10 percent since 2005.
 On Wednesday, the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., is scheduled to begin a series of high-level economic talks in Beijing with China's leaders. He is expected to press for further currency appreciation and more assurances on food and product safety following a year of high-profile recalls of toys, seafood, toothpaste and other products.
 But China seems increasingly worried about its domestic economy, with fears that soaring food prices, rising wages and a possible crash of the ballooning stock market could spoil more than two decades of stellar economic growth.
 In recent weeks, Chinese stocks have dropped more than 15 percent, but they stabilized last week and regained some ground. 
 Over the past few years, Chinese stock prices have risen over 300 percent and initial public offerings have created more than 100 new billionaires, at least on paper.
 In a report issued on Saturday, Hong Liang, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said the larger than usual hike in the reserve requirement ratio should strengthen the credibility of the Central Bank but could also hurt share prices.
 The government also said this week that it would offer oil subsidies to some industries to cope with higher fuel prices, and Beijing has even offered insurance to some pig farmers to help increase pork supplies amid soaring prices and the toughest inflationary pressure in a decade.

HEADLINE: Rumors Of This Play Were Not Exaggerated

BYLINE: By JESSE GREEN

 BODY:
SHELLEY FISHER FISHKIN opened a file drawer at the University of California's Bancroft Library in Berkeley, where the largest collection of Mark Twain's papers is archived. She was researching a project on racial themes in his work, and was not thrilled to find the drawer crammed with Twain plays she had not yet read and didn't care to. 
 Those she already knew were dreary at best. ''Colonel Sellers,'' though a huge hit in New York in 1874, was pilloried by reviewers as ''a wretched thing'' and ''excessively thin.'' The Bret Harte collaboration ''Ah Sin'' was even worse: a cringe-inducing ethnic comedy and, unpardonably, a flop. Twain told its opening-night audience in 1877 that the play had improved each time the producer trimmed it, and that ''it would have been one of the very best plays in the world if his strength had held out so that he could cut the whole of it.'' 
 Still, Dr. Fishkin, who is a professor of English and the director of American studies at Stanford, decided (as she later put it) to eat her scholarly spinach and plow through the mess. The materials were filed chronologically, so it took a while before she got to a late comedy called ''Is He Dead?'' It was not exactly a discovery; the title had turned up in the occasional academic note or reference. But the play itself had never been performed or published or even, to judge from the condition of the manuscript, much perused.
 And so, on a winter day in late 2001, Dr. Fishkin, expecting another fizzle from the period generally seen by scholars as the grim denouement of Twain's brilliant life and career, instead found herself laughing out loud at the library tables.
 ''I hadn't had that much fun reading a manuscript in a long time,'' she recalled recently. ''And I'd never been as surprised. It was a whole, finished play. He had even managed, and this was not necessarily his strong suit, a plot, with memorable characters and hilarious scenes. I thought it held great promise.'' And she wasn't the only one. In a letter dated Feb. 5, 1898, Twain wrote that his wife found the new comedy ''very bully.''
 Bully or not, ''Is He Dead?'' went unproduced in Twain's time and turned out to be, despite its merits, unproducible as written in ours. That a comedy of the same name has finally reached Broadway, opening Sunday at the Lyceum in a version adapted by the playwright David Ives and directed by Michael Blakemore, is nearly as unlikely as the plot, in which a great but impoverished painter, based on Jean-Francois Millet and played by Norbert Leo Butz, fakes his own death in hopes of spurring sales of his work. He succeeds, but finds himself trapped in the postmortem identity he assumes as his own widowed sister.
 When he wrote ''Is He Dead?'' -- partly based on an earlier short story -- Twain could almost have meant the title as a question about himself. Recently bankrupted by bad investments and in deep mourning over the death of his favorite daughter in 1896, he had moved to Vienna, where a great man could live cheaply. There, gradually emerging from debt and buoyed by the excellent theater he was seeing and translating, he was drawn back to the genre that had once made him buckets of money. (Dr. Fishkin pointed out that ''Colonel Sellers'' at one point brought Twain more annual income than all his books combined.) The theater offered him a chance to give the past a better ending and have it unspool nightly. Onstage, represented by his version of Millet, he could triumph over creditors, boobs, agents, snobs and even, in a way, over death itself. 
 Given his circumstances at the time it's not surprising that Twain chose to dramatize the theme of how art is valued during and after an artist's life. What is stranger is how uncannily that theme ended up foreshadowing the play's fate, even if ''Is He Dead?'' is not a work on par with the immensely famous Millet paintings (''The Gleaners,'' ''The Angelus'') that Twain dared to incorporate in it. Or perhaps that theme is even more beguiling because of the play's shortcomings. Are the lesser works of a genius correctable? Is an interesting artifact of an earlier age, however flawed, best retooled for public consumption or left to the dusty file drawer of academic curiosity? 
 In the world of classical music and opera, these are pet subjects for tournaments of aesthetic one-upmanship. Litterateurs similarly thrive on arguments over posthumous sequels and the authenticity of edited work. But in the theater such questions get asked less often, as the economics of answering them can be prohibitive. 
 Only the very best of older plays are still regularly performed, and these survive, even thrive on, reinvention. Versions of ''Hamlet'' set in Newark or on Mars do not confuse our understanding of Shakespeare. And newer works are scrupulously protected from interfering adapters (at least until a movie is made) by living authors or their agents wielding the stick of copyright laws.
 But as Twain left it, ''Is He Dead?'' fell into a shadowy middle ground: neither new nor great, and yet a bit of both. It was certainly underexploited, a situation that its owners (the University of California for publishing, the Mark Twain Foundation for dramatic production) quickly authorized Dr. Fishkin to address. As she set out to do so by preparing a critical edition of the manuscript (it was published in 2003) and by approaching the theatrical producer Bob Boyett for advice about having it staged, she learned that the play was also, like a potentially rich foundling left on her doorstep, confused and unprotected. Who, if anyone, held the copyright was a very murky matter. 
 By the time Mr. Boyett's lawyers discovered this problem in late 2002, there were only 12 weeks left to correct it: The window on copyrighting unpublished material of the play's vintage would close on Dec. 31 of that year. The owners had to act quickly, not only on their own behalf but also to safeguard any production Mr. Boyett might mount from wildcat copies. Protecting Twain from tampering was not itself an issue; everyone understood that the play would in fact require tampering. 
 Even Twain, who wrote the play in only three weeks, apparently understood that. At various points in his notes and in the text itself he seems to throw up his hands and say, ''Do whatever you like to make this work.'' 
 For Mr. Boyett that meant hiring Mr. Ives, who had worked on Mr. Boyett's 2002 production of ''Dance of the Vampires'' but couldn't, the producer said, be blamed for that disaster. More relevant was Mr. Ives's work adapting musical librettos for the Encores! series of older and less-performed American musicals. That job (he has done 19 so far) sometimes requires little except trimming; other times he must substantially rewrite creaky, jokeless or incoherent texts. 
 ''He's the expert,'' Mr. Boyett said. ''He can take a classic and, without losing the intentions of the original author, make it work for today.
 Why ''Is He Dead?'' hadn't worked in 1898 was a delicate question. Dr. Fishkin offered various explanations: a distracting fire in the theatrical warehouse of Twain's London agent, Bram Stoker; potential producers' unwillingness to test the public's interest in antic cross-dressing after the international juggernaut of Brandon Thomas's 1892 farce, ''Charley's Aunt''; even the Spanish-American War, which fanned Americans' nativist feelings and made a play set in France unfashionable. 
 But at 62, Twain was still one of the world's most famous authors; surely his reputation could have overcome such concerns. The explanation left politely unspoken in rejections he received was that the play as it stood was lumpy and only intermittently funny. Mr. Ives ticked off the problems: a terribly slow start, a main character who doesn't really take charge until the middle, interesting secondary characters Twain seems to forget partway through, an ending that trails off instead of ''bumping up'' as it ought to. 
 ''It has a great idea,'' Mr. Ives allowed. ''In movie terms, 'La Boheme' meets 'Tootsie.' But even at first reading I thought it really does need help. The construction is like a shack that is not very well buttressed; at the slightest touch pieces of it would fall off. 
 ''Which is not surprising, because Twain had little practice with dramatic construction. Novelists can roam more widely, but dramatists must have everything fused by a strong central action. Comedy especially. Tragedy can be baggier. 'King Lear' as a comedy would be hopeless. As a tragedy, it's pretty good.'' 
 In the short plays that made his reputation Mr. Ives, 57, comes across as a ruthless comic engineer; his premises (a monkey actually tries to type ''Hamlet''; a surfer dude explains ''Moby-Dick'') contain every ingredient necessary to the finished concoctions. Even in ''New Jerusalem,'' a somewhat less giddy play about the trial of Spinoza that opens at Classic Stage Company in January, there's no filler, no paddling around in search of a joke or lost theme. Every ending ''bumps up,'' as does every sentence Mr. Ives speaks in person. Very tall and tapered, with a plume of silver hair, he even looks like an exclamation point.
 So when Mr. Boyett decided to proceed, Mr. Ives was unspooked by the assignment. ''I know I've delighted people in my time,'' he said, ''so what the hell? Don't forget that writers are just guys like you, and that they're all trying to make something good. Twain understood that. I think if he had pulled 'Is He Dead?' out of the drawer, he would have slapped himself on the forehead and said, 'What was I thinking?,' then revised it and put it onstage. He knew that theater is a totally expedient art.
 ''Plus, he's dead.''
 Mr. Ives began in the fall of 2005 by reading Dr. Fishkin's redaction of the manuscript and cutting everything he could. This was not just to find the play's bones, preparatory to rearranging them. Although Mr. Boyett had given no specific instructions, Mr. Ives knew that his job also involved making the unwieldy play, which would eventually be capitalized at about $2.5 million, less budget busting. ''Everything a producer says, even if it's just 'Hello,' means 'Let's make this economically viable,''' Mr. Ives said. After a few swipes of the blue pencil, three acts were reduced to two; 24 separate roles, not counting extras, were pruned to 16 and assigned to a cast of 11.
 Mr. Ives enjoyed the cutting. ''Michelangelo used to look at a block of marble and see the David,'' he said. ''I look at the David and see the David statuette.'' 
 But there was more to it than putting the play on a diet. Though Mr. Ives tried ''to keep every comma and semicolon'' he could, much of what occurs between the punctuation seems new, even when it isn't. Characters that Twain all but abandoned are deployed in a new subplot that parallels the cross-dressing theme of the main plot. Act I now has, in theater parlance, a curtain: a cliffhanging turn of events to draw audiences back after intermission. A climactic offstage scene formerly described at tiresome length is now enacted onstage. And line by line the jokes, both precious and paste, have been polished if not completely reset.
 Such changes sometimes led Mr. Ives headlong into the conflict between academic standards of textual fidelity and theatrical standards of -- well, there are no theatrical standards except ''Don't bore me.'' Dr. Fishkin ruled out the idea of punching up the play's possibly depressing title (Mr. Ives briefly considered ''I Am My Own Sister'') and changing the main character from Millet to Monet. Though Monet and his paintings might be more recognizable to audiences today, Mr. Ives came to feel that Twain's affinity for the unpretentious chronicler of ordinary people was too powerful to violate. In any case, such core matters seemed beyond his brief: ''This is not a play by David Ives adapted from Mark Twain,'' he said, ''but the other way around.'' 
 Dr. Fishkin, who said she greatly admired the adaptation, kept an eye on much smaller issues as well. She sent the production team e-mail messages questioning individual words and phrases, especially locutions that Twain's characters, as she understood them, would not have used or could not have known. 
 ''Scalawag,'' she explained, was a word ''that didn't come into the language until after the Civil War'' -- Twain sets the play ''before 1848.'' ''Also, by the time he writes this play, the scalawags were on the right side as far as Twain was concerned, and so he wouldn't have used the word as an insult.'' References to ''Mickey B. Angelo'' and jokes about Impressionists were similarly flagged and debated. 
 Though neither Mr. Ives nor Dr. Fishkin said so directly, it's hard not to feel that the tension of the entire enterprise -- can one really rewrite Mark Twain? -- got played out most in these minor exchanges. Dr. Fishkin, who has what Mr. Boyett called ''a small consideration'' in the play's profits, approached Mr. Ives's interventions with a practical shrug. ''Twain wanted this to be successful, and I share that,'' she said. ''He also wanted it to be his, and I share that too.'' And when asked if Dr. Fishkin's academic input was useful, Mr. Ives eventually said, ''She's not a playwright, nor was Twain, is my answer.''
 Eventually they compromised. As of Nov. 29, when performances resumed after the stagehands' strike that almost killed ''Is He Dead?'' again, ''scalawag'' was gone. ''Mickey B. Angelo'' remained (but without the B), and the flagged but still extant Impressionist jokes were getting laughs. 
 For Mr. Ives, and possibly for Twain, that was justification enough.

HEADLINE: On the Crest Of a Food Wave

BYLINE: By LOUISE KRAMER. 
E-mail: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LOU ELROSE, a retired police officer with a passion for barbecue, is suddenly a hot commodity. 
 In the past year, Mr. Elrose, who has won barbecue competitions, has gone from selling pulled pork and slow-cooked brisket from a food cart in Ozone Park, Queens, to a job as deputy pit master at Hill Country, a new barbecue restaurant in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
 After only three months, Mr. Elrose, 55, was recruited for another job, as head pit master at Wildwood Barbecue, a restaurant set to open in March a few blocks south of Hill Country. With this new post, Mr. Elrose is commanding his highest salary yet -- approaching six figures, he said. He is also eligible for a stock purchase plan. 
 ''Anybody who has anything to do with the meat will be reporting to me,'' he said. 
 It is a good time to be a barbecue expert in New York. The city has long been stuffed with Italian, French and Japanese restaurants, but barbecue spots were in short supply for many years. Now the landscape has changed. 
 Tim Zagat, co-founder of the Zagat Survey restaurant guides, estimates that there are about 20 notable barbecue restaurants in New York, up from just a few five years ago. 
 The 2008 Zagat Guide to New York City restaurants, published in October, notes six new spots, including Hill Country, which specializes in Texas-style barbecue; Southern Hospitality, on the Upper East Side, with the pop star Justin Timberlake as a co-owner; and Fette Sau (''fat pig'' in German) in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
 The trend is prompting demand for well-trained cooks. ''Most people think that with barbecue you throw it into a smoker and 16 hours later you have wonderful food,'' Mr. Zagat said. ''A really good pit master has to be a talented person and technically has to be fairly sophisticated.'' 
 Pit masters create recipes (including those for secret spice rubs for their brisket and ribs), order and butcher meat and preside over pits in the restaurants. While a pit conjures an image of a hole in the ground, in this case it is actually an oven, sometimes burning mild fruitwood like apple or cherry, or other hardwoods. 
 Some pit masters, including Mr. Elrose, earn their stripes as serious hobbyists who have smokers at home and who travel the thriving national circuit of cooking competitions. Others are classically trained chefs, like Kenny Callaghan, executive chef of Blue Smoke, which was opened in 2002 by the restaurateur Danny Meyer.
 Meat experts aren't the only people in demand in city restaurants. Despite the troubled housing market and recession fears, employment at full-service restaurants in New York City reached a record 98,600 last year and is on track to exceed that this year, said Jim Brown, labor market analyst for the New York State DepartmentricaLabor. 
 At the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., job postings are plentiful, said Wendy Higgins, assistant director for career development and employer services. ''It is a very good market,'' she said. The school has not had specific requests to fill pit master jobs, she said.
 Mr. Brown said there was some concern that the financial industry's slowdown would start to affect restaurants. But he said foreign tourists enjoying favorable exchange rates were likely to fill seats vacated by locals. Moreover, the city's growing population is adding more diners to the mix, he said.
 ''Employment growth has been quite strong, and skilled staff, especially as you move up the ladder to the higher-end restaurants, has been in short supply for a while,'' Mr. Brown said. ''For most restaurants, the only way you're going to get an experienced worker is to lure them from someplace else. We don't track it in hard numbers, but there certainly has been a pickup in poaching.''
 THE creator of Wildwood Barbecue, Stephen Hanson, founder and president of B.R. Guest Restaurants, a New York company with 16 restaurants, acknowledges poaching talent. 
 ''Poaching is just part of New York,'' he said. ''Everybody always takes the interview.'' He said demand has pushed up salaries for pit masters by 50 percent during the last two years.
 Mr. Hanson hopes to open five Wildwoods by the end of next year, including locations in Las Vegas and Arizona. All will need pit masters, who will report to him.
 Before joining the Police Department, Mr. Elrose worked for Landi's Pork Store in Brooklyn and owned a deli. He often cooks for his wife and three children.
 Some retired police officers contemplate fishing trips, but Mr. Elrose, known as Big Lou, is expecting a busy second act. ''Working for Steve Hanson is like being attached to a rocket,'' he said. ''Every time I see him he says, 'Lou, you don't know how big this is going to be.' Maybe I don't, but I'm on for the ride.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 16, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Home Front column last Sunday, about increasing demand for barbecue pit masters, referred incorrectly to the supervisor of new pit masters at several planned Wildwood Barbecue locations. He is Lou Elrose, recently hired as head pit master at the planned Wildwood in Manhattan -- not Stephen Hanson, founder of B.R. Guest restaurants, which owns Wildwood.

HEADLINE: Fatal Distraction

BYLINE: Reviews by MARILYN STASIO

 BODY:
Invisible. Impassive. Impervious to the vagaries of the job. Whatever qualities you might expect to find in a spy, Miles Flint, the unlucky MI5 operative in Ian Rankin's WATCHMAN (Little, Brown, $24.99), has them -- and that suffering hothead Inspector John Rebus does not. Both characters were created more or less at the same time, some 20 years ago, but Rankin remained loyal to only one of them. While Rebus went on to become the conscience of an enduring series of police procedurals set in Edinburgh, the coolly analytical Flint was ditched after his first assignment. 
 Now, was that fair? Maybe not, if you happen to like dull but honorable Graham Greene-like spies who find themselves struggling to maintain their equilibrium in a society imploding from violent civil unrest. At the opening of ''Watchman'' (published in Britain in 1988 but only now in the United States), London is reeling from a series of I.R.A. bombings. As a midlevel drone in the Watcher Service, MI5's surveillance and report unit, Flint assumes he's well out of that soul-wrenching conflict. But marital woes cause him to botch the watch on an Arab assassin who slips away to kill an Israeli agent. After a few more blunders, Flint is packed off to Belfast on what could be a suicide mission.
 Despite the uncharacteristic cinematic style -- all jump cuts, tight frames and compressed action -- the novel has plenty of Rankin-worthy touches. Like Edinburgh, Northern Ireland carries its political battle scars with dignity, and both Yeats and the Rolling Stones are invoked to convey the social chaos rumbling beneath the surface of the plot. While Flint is more a fingernail-biter than an obsessive brooder like Rebus, he has a cynical worldview and a sense of humor that reveals itself in a quirky hobby: he studies beetles, amusing himself by attributing their properties to the people he knows. (Tellingly, he classifies himself as the prosaic museum beetle.) But with the robust exception of an I.R.A. terrorist named Collins, the secondary characters barely live up to their flashy beetle qualities, and perhaps because of the ''siege mentality'' that has cast its pall over London, the locale can't compare with the defiantly brawling Edinburgh that will probably always be Rankin's greatest inspiration.
 With so many American novelists grasping for terrorist plot angles to make the crimes on their turf seem less parochial, it's a relief to turn to a bona fide regionalist like Henry Kisor, who writes with compassion and humor about the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a place that's cash-poor but rich in character. Deputy Steve Martinez, a Lakota Indian who plays the broad-shouldered lawman in this enjoyable series, is reluctantly campaigning for sheriff in CACHE OF CORPSES (Forge/Tom Doherty, $24.95) when a bizarre conspiracy, hatched on the Internet, leads to the dumping of headless embalmed corpses in his wilderness territory. Especially troublesome is that someone local has to be in on this macabre scavenger hunt.
 Kisor develops the mystery with expertise while working the political race for some nice laughs. But he really hooks us with his whimsy-free descriptions of life -- from wedding dances and town-hall debates to the dead-end future seen in the eyes of a high-school dropout -- in this beautiful but economically depressed region.
 Long fascinated by Tibet, Eliot Pattison has been writing about its monks in a rigorously researched series of novels set in distant parts of that region of modern-day China. Guiding the action is a formidable Chinese detective, Shan Tao Yun, who served as a special investigator for the government before being exiled to a Tibetan labor camp when he proved inconveniently incorruptible. The religious life isn't a particularly serene one in PRAYER OF THE DRAGON (Soho, $24), which takes Shan and the Tibetan lamas who have been sheltering him in their monastery to the mountain village of Drango. Two strangers have been killed on the sacred peak known as the Sleeping Dragon, and the villagers are bent on applying harsh local justice to a third man, whom they blame for the sacrilege. Shan's delicate job is to sift though the superstitions for whatever truths lie buried in these ancient mountains -- a task whose political and cultural complexity seems all the more daunting in this majestic but perhaps unfathomable setting.
 Steve Berry -- no mandarin stylist, he -- writes big, blubbery potboilers. But as he proves once again in THE VENETIAN BETRAYAL (Ballantine, $25.95), he has a genuine feel for the factual gaps that give history its tantalizing air of the unknown. The lost tomb of Alexander the Great, who had conquered much of the known world when he died at 32, is one of these fabulous enigmas. Berry has a fanciful gimmick for putting this prize within the grasp of some modern-day treasure hunters. And for a while there's fun to be had in watching Irina Zovastina, the supreme minister of the sinister Central Asian Federation, and Enrico Vincenti, the leader of a Venetian-based cabal called the Council of 10, as they claw their way to their goal. But in his zealous pursuit of pumped-up thrills, Berry sacrifices the credibility of his characters and their quest. As one helium-inflated villain observes of another: ''Zovastina is quite the showgirl. I assume she'll make a spectacle of things.'' Actually, it's the author who turns this great unsolved mystery into a silly game.

HEADLINE: NATO Says It's Prepared to Keep the Peace in Kosovo

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: SKENDERAJ, Kosovo, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
NATO commanders in Kosovo say they are ready to shut down any violence in the wake of the province's expected secession from Serbia. The scorched frescoes and shattered roof tiles at the Serbian Orthodox monastery of St. Joanikije testify to how difficult that task might be.
 It was less than four years ago that the drowning deaths of three Albanian boys set off rioting against Serbs that ended with 19 people dead and more than 30 churches and monasteries across Kosovo destroyed or damaged. Attackers burned St. Joanikije at Devic, just outside Skenderaj, despite the presence of NATO peacekeepers.
 On Monday, mediators will officially report what has been clear for some time: they have reached a dead end in their negotiations with Serbia and Kosovo. Then the United Nations Security Council will meet to discuss the matter, and Kosovo's leaders will decide on the timing of the province's declaration of independence from Serbia. 
 During these weeks, a tense calm is expected to reign unless a few troublemakers on either side stir things up, especially in isolated ethnic enclaves and religious sites like the monastery. 
 For all the dry diplomatic language of resolutions and declarations, it is bloodshed that people most fear. In the worst-case situation, trouble begins in Kosovo and spreads like a contagion among the overlapping ethnic groups and across the fresh and often permeable borders in the former Yugoslavia.
 NATO has about 16,500 troops on the ground, slightly fewer than it had during the riots in March 2004. And the endgame in Kosovo's drive for independence comes as a distracted and overstretched American military, which still has a contingent in Kosovo, is fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 ''The risk is that rock-throwing kids will turn into knife-wielding kids, someone will get killed and it will escalate,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, a former American ambassador to the United Nations and the man who brokered the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 to end the war in Bosnia. ''The history of Kosovo is so strong on the capacity of small incidents to spiral out of control that I believe it's better to worry too much than to worry too little.'' 
 Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since NATO intervened in 1999 to end the violence that claimed as many as 10,000 ethnic Albanians. Many Serbs fled in the revenge killings that followed. Only around 100,000 remain, out of a population of two million that is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
 But population figures and historical significance are different things here. Serbs consider Kosovo to be the heartland of their culture, and the province is home to their most sacred sites. 
 It is the German national flag and the Bavarian state flag that fly over the small encampment of NATO soldiers guarding the St. Joanikije monastery, now half rebuilt. The troops from Bavaria are mountain specialists, wearing distinctive gray caps with pins of the edelweiss flower on the side. 
 Germany has a longstanding contingent in the south of Kosovo. This battalion is one of several reserve forces that NATO can call in within one to two weeks in the event of trouble. Technically they are only in Kosovo for regular training, but the timing was apt, overlapping with a recent election and the negotiating deadline. 
 For now, the German soldiers are under the command of NATO's French-led northern task force and have been fortifying the defenses at the monastery. Bright, new barbed wire is spooled up and down the hills surrounding the monastery. The Germans say that after the 2004 drownings, ethnic Albanians with homemade firebombs climbed around French defenders guarding the front gates from a mob to set the complex ablaze. 
 Officers say they have learned the lessons of 2004 and are ready. ''The French had only the option to open fire or to retreat,'' said Capt. Andre Zuehlsdorf, commander of the company of German soldiers that includes the platoon now stationed at St. Joanikije. In contrast, his soldiers have tear gas grenades and riot gear, and the training to use them.
 ''I have seen much of the training, and I would not like to try to get past these guys,'' said Col. Niels Tonning, the Danish deputy commander of the multinational task force responsible for the area.
 Perhaps most important, troops will not have to wait for orders from the NATO Joint Force Command in Naples, Italy. ''The decision to use tear gas will not be made in Naples; it will be made in Mitrovica,'' Colonel Tonning said, referring to a city in Kosovo that is divided into ethnic enclaves by the Ibar River.
 A concrete wall separates another Serbian enclave, Babin Most, from the main road, to guard against drive-by shootings. Babin Most, an impoverished village of about 1,000 people, is a short drive north of the capital, Pristina, which is almost entirely populated by ethnic Albanians now. Local residents at Zlatibor, a meeting point that is part general store, part cafe and part bar, say that ethnic tensions have diminished of late and that Serbs can visit Albanian businesses without fear and are treated well.
 But the military presence remains necessary. ''If there are no big powers there would be war here,'' said Zlatibor Bojkovic, the proprietor. 
 A Serbian man at Zlatibor who declined to give his name said: ''The Albanians could eat us for lunch if they wanted to. Their only interest is in the independence of Kosovo.''
 Nonetheless, conversations with ethnic Albanians typically revolve around daily concerns that have little to do with independence, starting with the weak economy and high unemployment, problems that Kosovars say they hope will be alleviated with independence. 
 Erman Seydiaj, owner of the Mini Bar cafe in Skenderaj, said the many patrons on a recent afternoon did not equal booming business. Often only one person in a group at a table had bought a coffee, but the entire group might stay for an hour. ''It's really hard,'' he said. ''The people just don't have much money.''
 Mr. Seydiaj, who lived in Germany for 10 years before returning to Kosovo, was chatting in German with a pair of military police officers from the NATO detachment. They dropped by regularly during patrols in Skenderaj. One of the changes in emphasis since the unrest in 2004 is a greater focus on human intelligence, officers said, or keeping an ear to the ground.
 The village is in the area where the independence movement was born. Across from the Mini Bar is a statue of the Kosovo Liberation Army leader, Adem Jashari, who was killed in 1998. It is a short drive to his grave, piled high with hundreds of flowers left by visitors. It is becoming something of a shrine to independence.
 And then it is about five minutes by car to the Serbian monastery, where by legend St. Joanikije brought forth fresh water from stones through prayer. Mother Anastacia, the mother superior of the six nuns remaining there, said that during the 2004 rampage, icons were thrown into the well and the monastery's two bells disappeared. 
 ''This monastery was always offering a comfort of healing, not only for Christians but for Muslims as well,'' Mother Anastacia said. 
 ''We would stay here in any case,'' she said, ''but we believe for a long period that we cannot live here without any military presence.''
 The northern task force is committed to protecting the site. But unless trouble flares up, the German battalion that has guarded it for the past two weeks will probably be home from its rotation in time for Christmas, before independence is declared.

HEADLINE: Paving Over History

BYLINE: By MARA FARRELL. 
Mara Farrell is the co-founder of Fishkill Historical Focus, a historic preservation group.

DATELINE: Fishkill 

 BODY:
 IT'S a beautiful thing to have a Revolutionary War site like the Fishkill Encampment and Supply Depot, a nationally registered landmark, in your town. But when the military camp -- where thousands of George Washington's troops were stationed to keep the British from moving past New York City and capturing the Hudson River -- is also home to the heavily trafficked Route 9 corridor, pleading for its survival can sometimes feel like a never-ending battle. 
 You see, the problem is that in recent years, Route 9 has become a giant strip mall with big-box stores, gas stations and motels. In its wake, grand and historic Hudson Valley landmarks like the Rapalje House and Van der Voort estate, where Samuel Loudon printed the first edition of the New York State Constitution, have been razed, forests have been sheared and ancient stone walls turned into gray dust. The biggest growth stems from Fishkill and goes all the way up to Poughkeepsie. 
 A passer-by would hardly notice the Fishkill Encampment and Supply Depot. Aside from the Van Wyck Homestead, which served as a headquarters, there is no trace of the depot's remains. And yet archaeological and scholarly research has revealed that the camp was a one-of-a-kind military city. 
 Constructed in 1776 under General Washington's orders and modeled after Roman encampments, the complex hummed like a beehive for seven years, steadfast in service and defense for the northern armies. General Washington acknowledged he couldn't have defeated the British without it. Indeed, in terms of historic significance, Valley Forge is nothing compared to the Fishkill Encampment and Supply Depot. 
 Stretching over more than 70 acres on both sides of Route 9 in Fishkill and hemmed in by Interstate 84, much of the site is now home to the Dutchess Mall, built in the early 1970s, and a Hess gasoline station, built in the 1990s. Historians believe that hundreds, if not thousands, of Continental Army soldiers who died from war wounds, hypothermia and smallpox are buried in the area. 
 And now the bulldozers will soon be tearing up one of the site's last pieces of undisturbed land, an eight-acre lot opposite the Dutchess Mall and next to the Van Wyck Homestead, to build more restaurants and shops.
 The Fishkill Supply Depot deserves an 11th-hour savior, and the first step is for the Town of Fishkill to recognize its role as protector of this national treasure. 
 The way the regulatory process works is that unless state or federal agencies are involved in a development project, decision-making remains in the hands of local government. And to be fair to local leaders, when commercial development interests are strong, it's a daunting task to buck the trend. But giving in to a short gust of economic profit ultimately turns up a small prize.
 It's true that managing a hefty legacy like the depot can be a tall order. But once a town becomes acutely aware of this primary role, alliances on a state and federal level can be quickly forged. In Fishkill's case, land trusts and military historians are also waiting in the wings to assist. Fishkill just has to take the first step. 
 The distressing result of losing a landmark like the depot is irrevocable damage to the historic fabric of New York State and a huge loss to a sustainable tourist industry. Certainly the current town administration doesn't want to be remembered for wiping out a Revolutionary War site. 
 With negotiation, conviction, imagination and sentiment, new construction can be channeled to places that are more suitable and less valuable. The Fishkill Supply Depot should not be viewed as prime commercial real estate owned by developers because it belongs to all Americans. Indeed, what the town should do instead is build upon its historic landmark and create a major tourist destination. 
 So much of the Revolutionary War was fought in New York. We must protect this plot of land for now and future generations, because we owe it to ourselves and to the young patriots who gave us the priceless gift of freedom. 
 The Fishkill Supply Depot and Encampment is a unique and finite resource. Because of it, Fishkill lays claim to a legacy that many American towns dream of -- a direct link to our founders and an integral role in the defeat of the British. Now that's something to stand up for.

Where Boys Grow Up to Be Jihadis
 Andrea Elliott's article (Nov. 25) on why (and where) boys become jihadis provides an excellent, nuanced account of the conditions they grow up in. Nevertheless, the basic cause is still obscure. Her analysis reminds me of a phrase: ''the revolution of rising expectations.''
 It's not poverty or ideology as such, but the feeling that one's dreams of a better life in the future (and those of one's friends) have been unfairly cut short that causes people to rebel. The modern world holds out great promise, but when that promise is betrayed, then suffering in silence is sometimes not enough, and resistance appears the only option.

 Hanna Rosin's article (Nov. 25) reveals much about the current state of ''young earth'' creation science.
 Rosin profiles the prominent young-earther Kurt Wise, who like me received his Ph.D. from Harvard under Stephen Jay Gould in the 1980s. Wise's credentials follow him wherever he goes, from creationist conferences to book jackets. They are the ultimate ticket to the scientific legitimacy that creationists so desperately seek.
 Wise now claims that he suffers within creationism for his attempts to drag it in a more rigorous scientific direction. Yet he admits that if all the evidence in the universe turned against creationism, he would not change his views, because that is what the word of God seems to indicate. This isn't science; it's bad theater and shows a complete disregard for the intellectual integrity that is essential for the functioning of modern science.
 The problem with the ''elite'' creationists Rosin describes is not what they think or say; it's their dishonesty. When they are playing scientist, they are acting as if they believe their data, believe the scientific interpretation. They are acting like real scientists who subject their data and conclusions to peer review. But they don't. If a scientist can lie about what he believes, then he can lie about his data, or the results of his experiments, or he can pick and choose which results to report. Eventually this won't be just about fossils and evolution; it will be about medicine, or agriculture, or nuclear energy, or bioterrorism, and everyone will wonder why.

 The amount of time misspent by people of some intellectual ability trying to reconcile Scripture with reality is incomprehensible to me. If, as Marcus Ross says, ''the Bible is a true and accurate record of the earth,'' and if Kurt Wise ''cut out every verse of the Bible he'd have to reject to believe in evolution,'' they would run into a confusing mass of contradictions in the first two books of Genesis. In Genesis 1, vegetation is created on Day 3, with the sun, moon and stars on Day 4. Birds and fish are created on Day 5, with animals made in the first half of Day 6. In Genesis 2, the sun, moon and stars are already there, and vegetation comes later. Adam is created before any animals in Genesis 2, but after them in Genesis 1. Talk about cognitive dissonance.

 The Bears Among Us
 Thanks to Darcy Frey for his article on bears (Nov. 25). Wonderful, and keep up the good work.
 MARILYN WILSON
 Valley, Wash.
 It's refreshing to see that at least some members of our species understand that when it comes to issues of human versus animal conflicts, there is a better, more intelligent and more compassionate way of resolving the conflict than resorting to violence and killing.
 MONICA BALL

 When I camped regularly in the high country of Yosemite, we had to find ways to protect our food without annoying or hurting the bears. Small amounts of ammonia in little cups under the source of the food smell worked every time. If a bear comes nosing around, the cup is knocked over, and the strong smell repels him. 
 Some things are important for people in bear country to know, though:
 Always look up into trees before getting between them and a possible mama bear. Her cubs may be up there, and she's going to take action.
 Underestimating the intelligence and dexterity of the animal is usually where ''bear proofing'' fails. If the average human can use the can/door/latch easily, so can a motivated bear.

 Dr. Drug Rep
 I found myself uncomfortable with Daniel Carlat's justification for accepting the job with Wyeth (Nov. 25). Every physician in this country is familiar with the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry to influence our prescribing patterns. It starts with medical school, with attractive sales representatives (usually women) stationed outside of lecture halls and cafeterias (only recently have medical schools and hospitals restricted the access of these salespeople).
 It continues during our training, with free meals and other enticements. And it culminates when we enter practice, with unscheduled sales calls, often extending the waits of patients while doctors eat and gab with salespeople, whose commissions are determined by how many prescriptions for their product are written in their territories.
 Recently, I was asked to complete a survey in which I was asked to name some ''leaders'' in my area in various specialties. This information would, no doubt, be used to entice them into delivering lectures on behalf of Big Pharma.

 On each visit to the doctor, I must sign a form indicating that I know my rights to privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. My personal record of treatment is supposed to be protected by federal law. What I did not know, until I read your article, is that the written prescriptions I fill at my pharmacy may be ''data-mined'' by pharmaceutical companies for marketing purposes. Are there other under-the-table practices consumers should know about?
 FRANCIS W. RODGERS
 Rensselaer, N.Y.
 Even without Dr. Carlat's delayed recognition of the positive spin Wyeth clearly expected him to put on its product, why did it take a year for him to realize that he was being paid and pampered to sell a product? How could he seemingly miss the obvious: that his M.D. and credentials provided for Wyeth a patina of legitimacy that its drug reps couldn't muster independently? Why did it take him so long (while he amassed $30,000) to see that his position was morally corrupt?
 The ''lessons'' that he reputedly learned are not new or unique. I'm proud to work in a medical practice where pharmaceutical representatives are not permitted.

 Your article eloquently described the ethical dilemma presented by drug-promotion lunches. But there is another issue: Cost. These junkets and payments to doctors for their ''talks'' cost money for the drug companies. Add to this the cost of the ads on TV (I counted six during a recent night's news program). There are substantial savings that could be passed on to consumers if these practices were ended. I appreciate modern drugs and medicine, but so much of the cost has nothing to do with reasonable profit or money for research. It's gone from a business to a racket. Let's get back to basics. 
 OLIVIA KOPPELL
 New York
 As a psychiatrist who has ridden this financial gravy train for many years myself, I can tell you that there is some truth to Carlat's story. But most drug companies have made changes that eliminate much of the sleaze factor. The rare times I have been put on the spot to ''sell'' a drug to other M.D.'s or bend the truth, I, like most speakers, refuse. When done right, these forums give us a chance to meet one another, debate research and exchange ideas.

 The Fish
 As soon as I read the first stanza, I knew I was in the territory of the whimsical, tender poet Billy Collins (Food, Nov. 25). Thank you for including this inspired gem of a poem as an introduction to your fish recipes. Though I may never try the recipes, I will never tire of revisiting Billy Collins in that Pittsburgh restaurant.

 The Perils of Petrocracy
 In her Nov. 4 article, Tina Rosenberg relies on what I consider to be highly partisan sources. The result is a misleading picture of Venezuela and its oil industry.
 She argues that the Chavez government's takeover of the country's oil industry resulted in ''economic failure despite a boom in oil prices.'' Venezuela's Central Bank reports that, since 2003, real G.D.P. has grown by 76 percent. It is more than hyperbole to call this ''economic failure.'' The Venezuelan government says economic expansion under Chavez created 1.9 million new jobs, and it has accumulated enough reserves to pay off its entire foreign debt.
 Rosenberg says that there is so far ''no sign'' of statistical gains in health and education from the government's social programs. According to government data, the number of doctors went from 1,600 to more than 19,000 under Chavez. Thousands of clinics have been created, and more than 40 percent of the country is getting subsidized food.
 Rosenberg misinterprets slowed output performance of the national oil company as technical incompetence when in fact it results from deliberate policy to adhere to OPEC quotas.
 Taking control of its previously nationalized oil industry (Pdvsa) has therefore been a success for Venezuela by any economic or social measure.

 Questions for Michael Eisner
 Was it coincidence that led you to run an interview with Michael Eisner in the middle of a writers' strike (Deborah Solomon, Nov. 18)? Let's review. In the 1980s Eisner and his cronies, the ''suits,'' told the Hollywood creative community that its participation in revenue from a ''new'' medium, videotape, was to be minuscule until the medium demonstrated profitability, at which point all would be revisited. After 20 years the VHS tape and its muscular nephew, the DVD, have proved profitable indeed, providing the bulk of revenue for most movies and a tasty ancillary market for many TV shows. Need I point out that nothing was ever renegotiated?
 Now Eisner uses identical language to forecast the murky financial future of the ''new'' digital download media and closes by speaking cryptically of a forthcoming project because ''we'' haven't written it yet. As part of the ''we'' that do all the writing, let me state it plainly: we intend to, and should, share in the fortune that will inevitably flow out of these new media from ''our'' projects.

 Sweeping the Clouds Away
 I'm writing in response to Virginia Heffernan's article, where I learned that DVDs of early ''Sesame Street'' episodes contain the warning: ''intended for grown-ups'' (The Medium, Nov. 18). If I hadn't read it in The Times, I would have thought it was a joke.
 I'm young enough to have enjoyed the early episodes as a child but old enough to remember the criticism hurled at ''Sesame Street'' in the early years, when critics complained that the show made learning seem ''too fun.'' Without the catchy tunes and colorful Muppets, kids might not have the intrinsic motivation to learn. Now the pendulum has swung the other way. Critics claim that the early ''Sesame Street'' was too gritty. ''Monsterpiece Theater'' promotes smoking. Cookie Monster promotes childhood obesity. Oscar the Grouch is a bad role model because he's depressed all the time. 
 The lesson that ''sometimes things don't go the way we want them to'' isn't going to kill anyone. Sometimes a grouch is just a grouch.

 High-Def at High Noon
 Martin Scorsese is right: If you haven't seen ''The Searchers'' in VistaVision on a giant screen, then you haven't seen it at all (The Medium, Nov. 11). Ten years ago, while visiting Jackson Hole, Wyoming, my husband and I, with two friends, got to see the film in the town's historic local theater. We knew this was a rare opportunity to step out of the West (as tourist resort) and see Ford's film the way he intended. The brutal force of John Wayne's performance, in bas-relief against Monument Valley, took my breath away. 
 Thanks to Virginia Heffernan for getting Scorsese's message out in her ''Points of Entry'' recommendations. I'm hopeful it will spur future screenings of this and other VistaVision classics so that more people, especially future filmmakers, can see for themselves.

 Mind of a Rock
 Panpsychism is scientific illiteracy cloaked in false reasoning and ill-informed speculation. Has Jim Holt (Nov. 18) heard of evolution? An inescapable result of evolution is that complexity arises spontaneously from simple systems.
 The laws of thermodynamics, which govern much of our daily experience, arise from the aggregate behavior of a very large number of unconscious particles. For example, our everyday perception of time arises from a large aggregate of time-independent particles. The laws of thermodynamics are in no way inherent in the constituent particles that make up our world.
 Consciousness is most likely an ''unexpected'' consequence of the high complexity of our brains, a result of the aggregate behavior of billions and billions of neurons and synapses and the many complex states the brain can occupy.
 It may seem that attributing consciousness to a molecule is an ''easy'' solution to an otherwise daunting problem. But it is actually replacing a daunting problem with a far more daunting problem. How is science to discover this molecular ''consciousness''? How will we know it when we see it? How does each molecule's consciousness interact coherently with each other molecule's consciousness to form a coherent conscious mind? On and on the questions go.

SELF-RIGHTING OBJECT, THE The Gomboc is a roundish piece of clear synthetic material with gently peaked, organic curves. It looks like a piece of modern art. But if you tip it over, something unusual happens: it rights itself.
 It leans off to one side, rocks to and fro as if gathering strength and then, presto, tips itself back into a ''standing'' position as if by magic. It doesn't have a hidden counterweight inside that helps it perform this trick, like an inflatable punching-bag doll that uses ballast to bob upright after you whack it. No, the Gomboc is something new: the world's first self-righting object.
 The Gomboc is a result of a long mathematical quest. In 1995, the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold mused that it would be possible to create a ''mono-monostatic'' object -- a three-dimensional thingy that purely by dint of its geometry had only one possible way to balance upright. 
 The challenge intrigued two scientists -- Gabor Domokos and Peter Varkonyi, both of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. They spent a few years doing the math, and it seemed as if a mono-monostatic object could, in fact, exist. They began looking to see if they could find a naturally occurring example; at one point, Domokos was so obsessed that he spent hours testing 2,000 pebbles on a beach to see if they could right themselves. (None could.) 
 After several more years of scratching their heads, they finally hit upon a shape that looked promising. They designed it on a computer, and when it came back from the manufacturer, they nervously tipped it over, wondering if all their work would be for naught. Nope: the Gomboc performed perfectly [43]. ''It's a very nice mathematical problem because you can hold the proof in your hands -- and it's quite beautiful,'' Varkonyi says.
 Yet the scientists now say that Mother Nature may have beaten them in the race after all. They have noticed that the Gomboc closely resembles the shell of a tortoise or a beetle, creatures whose round-shelled backs help them right themselves when flipped over. ''We discovered it with mathematics,'' Domokos notes, ''but evolution got there first.'' CLIVE THOMPSON
 SMOG-EATING CEMENT This year a new weapon against smog was introduced in the United States: cement. Called TX Active, it was developed by the Italian company Italcementi. Enrico Borgarello, Italcementi's head of research and development, says the product can literally ''kill'' pollution.
 The cement's chemical composition is enhanced with titanium dioxide, which under the right conditions can neutralize some harmful pollutants. When exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light, the titanium dioxide is ''activated,'' Borgarello says, and pollutants that come in contact with the surface of the cement are oxidized. Hazardous nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, for example, are transformed into harmless nitrates or sulfates, which simply rinse off the building with rainwater. This also keeps it especially clean.
 Italcementi developed the cement for the architect Richard Meier, who wanted a very white material for his Jubilee Church in Rome. Titanium dioxide, commonly used to make paints bright white, was added to the standard cement's mix. It was only later that Italcementi realized that TX Active had pollution-busting properties. For instance, in Bergamo, where Italcementi is based, a stretch of road downtown was coated with a layer of TX Active. Borgarello says that residents reported better-smelling air within 4.5 square miles. The company says their research shows that if 15 percent of the surface area of Milan were covered in TX Active, air pollution would be reduced by 50 percent.
 Thomas Cahill, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Davis, is skeptical of the full extent of the company's claims. He cautions that the ''benefits, while they might be real in limited cases, are not a 'cure' for pollution.''
 Borgarello says that he envisions TX Active as an agent of change for air quality -- and for cement's reputation as an uninspired, antienvironmental material. ''You destroy the green, and you put a building in with cement,'' he says. ''Now we put this material in, and we are contributing to quality of life.'' lia miller
 STARCH MADE US HUMAN [44] Traditionally, when scientists spared a thought for our hunting and gathering forebears, they focused on the hunters and the meat they brought in. But it may be that it was our ancestors' less glamorous ability to gather, eat and digest roots, bulbs and tubers -- the wild versions of what became carrots, onions and potatoes -- that increased the size of our brains and made the hunt and the territorial expansion that came with it possible. 
 In a paper published in September in Nature Genetics, George Perry, a graduate student at Arizona State University, Nathaniel Dominy, an anthropology professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their colleagues demonstrate something significant: unlike our fellow primates, modern humans have many copies of a gene that makes a protein in our saliva that is crucial for breaking down starch into glucose. Our brains run on glucose. DNA and saliva samples taken from populations all over the world -- from locals in Arizona and Japan to the Hadza, hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, and the Yakut, Siberian animal herders and fishermen -- showed that if you have more copies of the gene amylase 1, you have more of the protein. Groups like the Japanese, who eat diets high in starches, have on average a higher number of copies of the gene. ''In human evolution, starch may have played a particularly important role,'' Perry says. After all, if you possessed the ability to efficiently convert starch into the glucose that fuels your brain, ''you'd have a big advantage nutritionally,'' Dominy says. 
 Perry and Dominy were eating pizza (appropriate food for thought in this case) when they decided to look into why ''humans have so damn much'' of the starch-specific protein in their saliva. Initially, Dominy says, ''our ancestors weren't grazers, but they weren't meat eaters either.'' The Hadza, who eat a little meat but rely mainly on digging up and roasting tough underground storage roots and tubers, may be a modern example of the kind of foraging group Perry and Dominy envision in our evolutionary past. 
 ''We view starch as a transitional food,'' Dominy adds, helping us get from fruit to meat but also important in its own right. What abundant, ubiquitous resource was out there in the environment? ''Fruits just don't do it,'' Dominy says. ''For one thing, they're seasonal. Meats are hard to get, and we didn't have tools or spears yet. So we think that the shift to eating corms, bulbs and tubers gave our ancestors enough sugar resources to develop a large brain.'' AARON RETICA
 SUING GOD It sounds like a kooky law-school exercise. Your life has been upended by a horrible tragedy, one of those ''acts of God'' listed in the clause in your insurance policy denying coverage. Why can't you take a higher power to court and make it pay through the nose? The hypothetical became real on Sept. 14 when State Senator Ernie Chambers sued God in Douglas County District Court in Omaha.
 The lawsuit blames God for a passel of alliterative ills, including ''fearsome floods, egregious earthquakes, horrendous hurricanes, terrifying tornadoes, pestilential plagues'' and ''ferocious famines.'' 
 The complaint [45] anticipates law students' objections. Jurisdiction is obvious ''by virtue of the fact that Defendant, being Omnipresent, is personally present in Douglas County.'' The suit asks to waive the requirement for personally serving notice, noting that it would be futile to ''nail a notice to the front door'' of the various ''religious denominations, persuasions, cults and the like'' who claim to speak for God.
 Chambers filed the suit to make a point about frivolous lawsuits, which, oddly, he supports. A court administrator, Doug Johnson, agrees that the suit is frivolous. ''This case doesn't really have legs,'' he says. JEFF STRYKER
 TELLTALE FOOD WRAPPING The usual way to tell if raw meat has gone bad is to see if it has turned purple-gray and smells sour. Fortunately, a more exact method is on the horizon: a piece of paper that changes color on contact with bacteria [46] and thus immediately signals whether your ground chuck is tartare worthy or will be dangerous if it's not well done. The active ingredient in the paper is a special biological agent that can spot -- and, in some cases, even block or destroy -- pathogens present in food, water or air.
 This paper is still under development, but its makers, a consortium of Canadian universities and companies known as the Sentinel Bioactive Paper Network, gave a demonstration in May and already envision numerous applications: food wrapping that exposes E. coli and salmonella, swabs that reveal pesticides on produce, bacteria-trapping filters for air-conditioners. These would be no small contribution to human health: An estimated 76 million food-related illnesses occur in the United States and water-borne diseases kill more than three million people worldwide every year.
 Using paper to impede germs may be nothing new. But ''hospital masks are dumb barriers,'' says Robert Pelton, Sentinel's scientific director and a professor of chemical engineering at McMaster University in Ontario. ''It'd be nice if they had a little intelligence and could tell health care workers if they're being exposed to something dangerous'' like SARS.
 Pelton says that one day tell-all paper sticks will be as prevalent in supermarket packaging as bar codes are today. A lot of work remains to be done to ensure that the detectors will be able to pick up traces of bad bacteria without reacting to benign ones and to withstand extended storage in nonlab environments. In the meantime, however, Sentinel has already found a simple and cheap way to embed biological detectors into paper: it's called inkjet printing. stephanie giry
 24/7 ALIBI, THE [47] Nine months after 9/11, Hasan Elahi, an art professor at Rutgers University, was detained at the Detroit airport after the F.B.I. received a bogus tip that he had stockpiled explosives in a storage locker. Six months of interrogations and nine polygraph tests later, the F.B.I. let him go. (The F.B.I. declined to comment.) But Elahi wasn't ready to let go of the F.B.I. In a sly swipe at the surveillance system that botched his case, Elahi has self-consciously, if a bit ostentatiously, surrendered his privacy via a personal Web site. He has an alibi now -- a perpetual one.
 The project -- part performance art, part post-trauma therapy -- began as a practical matter. After his release, Elahi, who travels frequently as part of his job, contacted the F.B.I., letting it know his plans in advance. After a few months of this, he had an idea. ''Why not share this information with everyone?'' he remembers thinking. He began posting logs of his phone calls and pictures of his whereabouts. Up went his banking statements. He took to revealing the coordinates of his exact location on his Web site in real time. He snaps time-stamped digital images and uploads them.
 What emerges is ''quite boring,'' he admits: pictures of toilets [48], half-eaten meals and countless other mundane details. Though his project may sound radical, Elahi is merely living an exaggerated version of a life we all live now. Our cellphones serve as de facto tracking devices, sending data on our whereabouts to our service providers; our digital cameras stamp the photos we snap with a date and time; and surveillance cameras in public places capture our comings and goings. (It is information that can come in handy, as the indicted Duke lacrosse players, who used such data as alibis in their rape cases, discovered this year.) Most of us have a 24/7 alibi -- whether we realize it or not. STEPHEN MIHM
 TWO-BIRDS-WITH-ONE-STONE RESISTANCE [49] To kill two birds with one stone -- what could be better? Taking the train instead of driving a car, for example, gets you to where you're going and lets you read the paper. But it turns out that if you have just one goal in mind, chances are you'll actually be less inclined to take a path that also happens to serve other goals. Foolishly, you'll resist the more advantageous approach.
 In a clever experiment published this year, psychologists had students fill out a survey using a ballpoint pen that could also serve as a laser pointer. They then had half the students evaluate the pen's laser-pointer function, thus making this group more aware of the pen's dual purpose. Later, the researchers -- led by Ayelet Fishbach of the University of Chicago -- had all the participants go into another room and complete a short form, next to which sat two pens: a laser-pointer pen and an ordinary office pen. Of the participants who had not been primed about the dual purpose, a little more than half used the laser-pointer pen. But among people who had been primed, fewer than 17 percent picked it.
 Surprisingly, being mindful of an object's dual purpose made the students reluctant to use it. ''Once you associate the pen with another function, that same pen doesn't come to mind as easily when it comes to writing,'' Fishbach explains.
 What happens, the researchers showed through other studies, is that connecting one tool or method to multiple goals weakens the mental association between that means and any one goal. Take jogging, for instance. Participants in one study were informed that jogging both strengthens muscles and increases the body's level of oxygen. But after the researchers subliminally reinforced the participants' association between jogging and one of those goals -- strengthening muscles -- participants irrationally deemed jogging less effective for boosting oxygen.
 You should prefer a stone that kills an extra bird you didn't have in mind. ''But you won't,'' Fishbach says. marina krakovsky
 UNADAPTED THEATRICAL ADAPTATION, THE [50] Why are stage adaptations of great novels almost always so disappointing? The problem, according to one popular theory, is that in shrinking the text down to size, erasing scenes and conflating characters, versions of ''Jane Eyre'' or (God help us) ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' sacrifice some of the classic book's essential virtues: the language, the rhythm of the sentences, the distinctive poetry of the author. This year, John Collins, the cerebral leader of the experimental New York theater company Elevator Repair Service, offered a radical solution: adapt without adapting.
 Collins mounted a production of ''The Great Gatsby'' without cutting a single word. ''Gatz,'' which refers to Jay Gatsby's original name, is the most faithful version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's book ever produced. The more-than-six-hour-long drama begins silently in a dismal contemporary office in which white-collar employees go through the motions of their seemingly ordinary days. But when one character has trouble with his computer, he picks up a well-worn paperback copy of ''Gatsby'' and starts to read aloud. Before long, this office drone evolves rather seamlessly into Nick Carraway, the narrator of the book, and his fellow employees morph into Jazz Age denizens of high society New York, re-enacting the book's famously flamboyant parties while interjecting lines of dialogue.
 Despite the low-tech production and lack of period details, the show does not seem like a stunt, although it is at least partly inspired by the anticomedian Andy Kaufman's stand-up routine in which he read ''Gatsby'' until everyone left. What emerges, in fact, is a rather earnest love letter to the book that also makes a convincing argument for the dramatic power of the written word. Over the past year, ''Gatz'' toured the United States and Europe to glowing reviews. Next up for Collins is an even more daunting challenge: his production of ''The Sound and the Fury'' opens at the New York Theater Workshop in the spring. JASON ZINOMAN
 VEGANSEXUALITY [51] Forget homo-, bi- or even metro-: the latest prefix in sexuality is vegan-, as in ''vegansexual.'' In a study released in May, Annie Potts, a researcher at the University of Canterbury and a director of the New Zealand Centre for Human-Animal Studies, surveyed 157 vegans and vegetarians (120 of them women) on the topic of cruelty-free living. The questions ranged from attitudes about eating meat to keeping pets to wearing possum fur to, yes, ''cruelty-free sex'' -- that is, ''rejecting meat eaters as intimate partners.''
 Some of the survey respondents volunteered their reluctance to kiss meat eaters. ''I couldn't think of kissing lips that allow dead animal pieces to pass between them,'' a 49-year-old vegan woman from Auckland said. For some, the resistance is the squeamishness factor. ''Nonvegetarian bodies smell different to me,'' a 41-year-old Christchurch vegan woman said. ''They are, after all, literally sustained through carcasses -- the murdered flesh of others.'' For some, it is a question of finding a like-minded life partner. An Auckland ovo-vegetarian had tried a relationship with a carnivore, but reported that despite the sexual attraction, the gulf in ''shared values and moral codes'' was just too wide.
 Potts, who coined the term vegansexuality, says the ''negative response of omnivores'' to her study has surprised her. Even some fellow animal lovers question the wisdom of vegansexuality. A blog for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals noted that sleeping with only fellow vegans means forgoing the opportunity to turn carnivores into vegans by the most powerful recruiting tool available -- sex.
 PETA's founder and president, Ingrid Newkirk, agrees that vegans smell fresher. (''There's science to prove it,'' she says.) But Newkirk is all about the recruiting, even if it means one convert at a time. ''When my staff members come to me and say: 'Guess what? My boyfriend, now he's a vegan,' I say, half-jokingly: 'Well, it is time to ditch him and get another. You've done your work; move on.' '' JEFF STRYKER
 WAVE ENERGY For decades, researchers have tried to tap the clean energy of ocean waves. Unfortunately, storms and seawater have wreaked havoc on their delicate turbines. But now there's a solution on the horizon: buoys that generate energy with nothing more than a souped-up rubber band.
 The concept derives from the discovery a little over a decade ago of so-called dielectric elastomers, stretchy plastics that react to and generate electricity. When electricity runs through an elastomer, the elastomer compresses and contracts, much the way a muscle does [52]. It didn't take long for researchers at SRI International, a nonprofit organization based in Menlo Park, Calif., to realize that the process would work in reverse: stress and relax the elastomer, and it will generate electricity. One early application of the idea involved harnessing the energy in the compression of an elastomer shoe heel. The shoe device that SRI built -- financed by Darpa -- generated enough juice from walking to recharge the batteries on, say, a cellphone.
 But shoe generators won't curtail our dependence on foreign oil; wave generators that make use of elastomers, on the other hand, might. SRI's idea is as elegant as it is simple. Imagine a cable of elastomer with one end tied to the ocean bottom and the other attached to a buoy on the surface. When the buoy rides up a crest of the wave, it stretches the elastomer. When it sinks into a trough, it contracts and then generates a pulse of electricity. Hoping to power a buoy's light bulb, SRI tried out a version of the idea in the waters off St. Petersburg, Fla., this past summer. While the energy output was a paltry five watts, the firm hopes to scale up. Better yet, the simplicity of the design will in theory make buoy generators cheaper and more durable than other technologies that harness the wind and the waves. Moreover, the buoys could be anchored just beneath the water, where they won't obstruct beachcombers' views of the ocean. ''You wouldn't see anything,'' promises Ron Pelrine, an SRI scientist.

HEADLINE: China Shrinks

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Few people noticed, but China got smaller the other day. According to new estimates, the colossal Chinese economy that has been making marketers salivate and giving others an inferiority complex may be roughly 40 percent smaller than previously thought: worth $6 trillion rather than $10 trillion. That means it lost a chunk roughly the size of Japan's output. 
 What happened was a large statistical glitch. When comparing the size of economies, economists mostly avoid using the standard currency exchange rates seen in bank windows. These fluctuate too much, driven by housing woes, trade deficits or presidential popularity. Economists prefer to use what is known as ''purchasing power parity'' -- or P.P.P. -- a rate that adjusts for price differences between countries.
 Take a 40 yuan serving of noodles at an eatery in Beijing. If the same dish cost $4 at a comparable restaurant in New York, the noodle P.P.P. would be 10 yuan to the dollar. Calculated using a large basket of goods and services, this ratio allows for a more consistent comparison of economies. 
 The problem is that the World Bank's measure of China's rate, everybody's benchmark, had been based on a 1980s survey of Chinese prices. This year, the World Bank did its own survey to update the measure. While the bank has not published it yet, Albert Keidel of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace extrapolated the figure from another set of exchange rates published by the Asian Development Bank. 
 It turns out that things in China are more expensive. It's as though we discovered that the real price of the noodles in Beijing was 50 yuan, yielding a P.P.P. of 12.5 yuan to the dollar rather than 10. That means the Chinese are relatively poorer and China's economy is smaller than everybody thought.
 This is not a mere technicality. Suddenly the number of Chinese who live below the World Bank's poverty line of a dollar a day jumped from about 100 million to 300 million, roughly the size of the United States population. And if you thought China's energy consumption was dismally inefficient, consider that it still uses the same amount of energy to produce 40 percent less stuff. The reassessment does not just involve China. India is also likely to be downsized. And, by the way, global growth has very likely been slower than we thought.
 I don't think China's leaders have said anything about the recalibration. But they should be pretty pleased. China has been known to enjoy throwing its weight around, but being big also exacts a cost. If a country is that wealthy, others can demand that it start pulling its weight and play more by the international rules. If China is less wealthy, and less a rival, maybe some members of the United States Congress will not press it so hard to revalue its exchange rate. Using the earlier estimate, China's economy was due to surpass the $13 trillion American economy in about five years. At $6 trillion, it may look somewhat less scary.

HEADLINE: The Future? It's Stewart Airport

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
NOW that the Port Authority has assumed control of Stewart International Airport in New Windsor with plans to upgrade and expand it, real estate agents in Orange County are anticipating a rush of new development that they believe is sure to follow.
 ''It's the moment we've been waiting and hoping for,'' said John A. D'Ambrosio, president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce. ''This is a very big deal for us.'' 
 In November, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spent $78.5 million to acquire a 93-year lease on the airport, which is about 60 miles north of New York City. At the same time, the New York State Department of Transportation completed a $55 million road project to alleviate area congestion and improve access to Stewart. The authority has proposed spending $500 million over the next 10 years to upgrade the airport.
 ''More than just a shot in the arm, this is a heart transplant for Orange County,'' said Paul Adler, executive director of Prudential Rand Commercial Services, a real estate company. Anticipating back in 1999 that the county was ripe for new development, the company opened its first office there, followed by another six in ensuing years.
 The 816-square-mile county is one of the fastest-growing in New York, with a population that grew by 11 percent, to 341,367, in the 1990's, according to census figures. The 2006 estimate, 376,392, is a 10 percent climb since 2000.
 The airport has long been considered underused, with just a handful of carriers offering a limited number of routes. The authority plans to attract more carriers, offer expanded routes, upgrade a parking lot, improve the interior of the terminal and increase capacity for cargo transport, among other things, said Pasquale DiFulco, a Port Authority spokesman. JetBlue and AirTran already offer flights from Stewart, and Skybus said last month that it would also begin offering service.
 Commercial real estate brokers like Richard J. Smith, a principal at R. J. Smith Realty, Real Estate Solutions, which has offices in Pine Bush and Goshen, predicted that that the Port Authority's infusion of cash would spur new commercial development in Orange County. As cargo-carrying capacities grow at the airport, Mr. Smith said, the area will become a magnet for light industry and distribution centers.
 In expectation of the Port Authority's acquisition of the lease on Nov. 1, Mr. Smith said, several new business parks near the airport, totaling more than three million square feet, have been planned. ''Some of this might have happened without Stewart because of Orange County's central location in the state,'' he said, ''but an upgraded airport adds a whole other dimension.''
 New Windsor is near Interstates 84 and 87 and about 20 miles east of Route 17, which is being converted to I-86. 
 Part of the state Department of Transportation's recent road project includes the newly built interchange of Interstate 84 and New York Route 747 (formerly known as Drury Lane). The project also includes a 1.25-mile-long connector road, to be called Stewart Boulevard, from Route 747 to the airport.
 Interstate 87 runs north-south on the eastern side of Orange county, and I-84 runs east-west through the center. This provides for the development of a strong warehouse and distribution network, Mr. Smith explained.
 The vigorous population growth in Orange in recent decades is a result of a migration of buyers overwhelmed by housing costs in markets like Bergen County, N.J., and Westchester County, N.Y., said Richard Lease, senior broker with John J. Lease Realtors in Newburgh. ''By comparison, house prices and property taxes are a bargain here,'' he said.
 Public transportation has made the area more accessible, too. He noted that rail service had increased between Grand Central Terminal and Beacon, which is across the Hudson River over the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, coupled with ferry service from the Newburgh waterfront to Beacon. 
 In addition, a growing community of artists and actors, among them Robert De Niro, have been settling north of Orange in Ulster County, in communities like Gardiner and New Paltz. Meanwhile, Sullivan County, northwest of Orange, is growing as a second-home market and resort center.
 But the Port Authority is not relying solely on the local population and commercial base to keep Stewart busy. In his first address to the Legislature last January, Gov. Eliot Spitzer promoted a plan to foster economic development in the Hudson Valley that includes replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge and turning Stewart Airport into ''the fourth major airport'' downstate. 
 Anthony R. Coscia, the Port Authority's chairman, has said the acquisition of Stewart is expected to solve a problem troubling to officials for almost 50 years: where to reroute some of the travelers and cargo that are increasingly overwhelming operations at Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports. 
 According to Port Authority studies, of the 108 million people using the three major airports each year, 11 million live closer to Stewart. Mr. DiFulco, the spokesman, said the authority did not expect to attract all of those passengers, but added, ''We still believe Stewart can be a great regional airport.'' 
 Stewart, which is owned by the State of New York, covers 2,400 acres and has two parallel runways, with the longer capable of handling most commercial jets currently in service, Mr. DiFulco said. In 2006, according to the Port Authority, the airport handled 300,000 passengers, and it is expected to handle more than 900,000 this year, a result of increased service by JetBlue and AirTran. By comparison, La Guardia, which has only 680 acres, handled about 26 million passengers last year. 
 But cries of opposition are emanating from some quarters -- in particular from a grass-roots group called Ulsterites Fight Overflight Noise. 
 Maureen Radl, a resident of Cragsmoor in Ulster, about 25 miles northwest of Stewart Airport but in its flight paths, is the chairwoman of the group. She and a coalition of 10 civic groups have written to officials expressing concern about the airport. Ms. Radl says she and others have persuaded the Port Authority to form a panel so citizens' concerns can be factored in.
 ''We're worried about keeping it regional here,'' she said. ''We wouldn't want to lose the specialness of this area.''

HEADLINE: Reshaping the Debate on Raising Taxes

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University. E-mail: rhfrank@nytimes.com

 BODY:
POWERFUL anti-tax rhetoric has made legislators at every level of government afraid to talk publicly about a need to raise taxes. The constituents of the few who dare speak are typically bombarded with attack ads that go something like this: ''It's your money, but your esteemed senator thinks the bureaucrats in Washington know how to spend it more wisely than you do.'' 
 Because of our inability to talk sensibly about taxes, the United States has been sliding toward second-class status in the world economy. Our national debt, for example, has increased by more than $3 trillion since 2002. Once the world's largest creditor nation, we are now its largest debtor. We are currently borrowing more than $800 billion a year from the Chinese, Japanese, South Koreans and others -- loans that will have to be repaid in full with interest. These imbalances have sent the dollar plummeting. 
 The situation is set to become worse. On the current trajectory, the national debt will rise an additional $5 trillion over the next decade. The retirement of baby boomers will require additional revenue to cover growing deficits in the Social Security and Medicare programs. 
 And though an emerging consensus in favor of universal health coverage may mean better care for more people for less money over all, such coverage will also require higher taxes. Additional revenue is also needed to make up for the deferred maintenance that has placed many of our roads and bridges in dangerous disrepair.
 Anti-tax crusaders say that these problems can be solved by just cutting wasteful spending. To be sure, Congress could help keep spending in check by adopting a strict pay-as-you-go standard for all new legislation. But most existing government programs have powerful constituencies, and programs that lack such strong defenders are not always the most suitable candidates for cuts. Salient examples from recent experience include scientific research, infrastructure maintenance and security investments like cargo-container inspection and lockdown of loosely guarded nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union.
 In short, realistic proposals for solving our budget problems must include higher revenue. But unless political leaders can develop strategies for dealing with the powerful anti-tax rhetoric that has sunk similar proposals in the past, the impasse will continue.
 One strategy would be to inform voters that the ''it's your money'' argument is incoherent. Taken to its logical conclusion, it implies that it is illegitimate for the government to collect taxes. But if that were true, there could be no government and no army, in which case, the United States would have long ago been conquered by another country. Then we'd be paying compulsory taxes to that country's government. 
 In the real world, governments not only maintain armies, they also provide a variety of public goods and services that would be impractical for private citizens to provide for themselves. Every government, including our own, has always levied taxes of some sort to pay for these goods and services. 
 So it's strongly in our interest to talk about what services the government should provide and how to raise the revenue to pay for them. Politicians need to explain this clearly to their constituents. The argument is simple and would fit easily into a 30-second campaign spot. 
 Anti-tax crusaders sometimes brand proposals to make the tax structure more progressive as class warfare based on envy. This tactic has also been rhetorically effective, but, like the ''it's your money'' slogan, it stifles an important conversation to everyone's detriment. 
 Progressive taxation is not about envy. Top earners have captured the big share of all income and wealth gains during the last three decades. They're where the money is. If we're to pay for public services they and others want, they must carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden. 
 Anti-tax crusaders often bristle at taxes whose aim is not just to raise revenue but also to alter behavior. They label such efforts ''social engineering.'' But as even Adam Smith recognized, behaviors that are attractive to individuals are often harmful to society as a whole. 
 Activities that give off greenhouse gases, for example, are misleadingly attractive to individuals because their costs fall largely on others. Carbon taxes are the remedy of choice. When individual and social incentives diverge sharply, tax remedies of this sort are the least intrusive way to restore balance. 
 Nowhere have the carefully constructed slogans of anti-tax crusaders been more been powerful than in the case of the estate tax, which they like to call the ''death tax.'' Although voters in the bottom fifth of the income distribution are more likely to be struck by lightning than to leave an estate large enough to set off this tax, two-thirds of them support its repeal. This is bamboozlement of the highest order. 
 FORTUNATELY, there is clear evidence that reframing the discussion often has a big impact on the way voters think about tax policy. In the spring of 2005, for example, I asked the Survey Research Institute at Cornell University to conduct two telephone surveys to investigate public attitudes about the Bush administration's proposal to eliminate the estate tax. 
 In the first survey, respondents were simply asked whether they favored the proposal. Almost 75 percent said they did. In the second, respondents were first told that lost revenue from eliminating the estate tax would necessitate some combination of raising other taxes, borrowing more money from abroad and further cutbacks in government services. This time, almost 80 percent of respondents favored keeping the estate tax. 
 Given the effectiveness of anti-tax rhetoric, presidential candidates are understandably reluctant to tell voters what must be done to put the fiscal house in order. But voters are smarter than many cynics think, and they may be especially receptive to fresh points of view at this stage in the political cycle. The anti-tax rhetoric of recent decades is at the root of many of our current problems. Candidates with the courage to confront it head on may not only contribute to our economic recovery, but may also win additional votes.

HEADLINE: REITs Are Down, But for How Long?

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
THE enduring rally in real estate investment trusts finally ended this year as turbulence in the credit markets rattled the confidence of commercial investors and effectively halted the frenetic pace of REIT privatizations. 
 Now the question on some people's minds is whether the downturn means that a lingering bear market is looming. 
 For more than seven years -- from November 1999 through January 2007 -- REIT shares soared in value, providing giddy investors with average annualized returns of 23.6 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. (In 2006 alone, REITs climbed by an average of 34.4 percent.)
 But the market is poised to finish 2007 sharply lower. This year through Thursday, the REIT composite index compiled by the trade association had a negative return of 11.39 percent. The index of equity REITs, which own commercial property and constitute the bulk of the market, has fallen 8.63 percent. 
 Meanwhile, losses for mortgage REITs, which originate loans and invest in mortgage-backed securities, were a staggering 43.5 percent, on average.
 By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up around 6.4 percent so far in 2007. 
 ''It's been a very ugly year,'' said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a real estate research company in Newport Beach, Calif., echoing the sentiment of many others. ''It's one of the worst performances we've seen in REIT land in a long time.''
 Industry analysts and money managers, though, had been predicting for a while that the REIT market would run out of steam. 
 Fortunes reversed, they say, just as a giant private equity firm, the Blackstone Group, was completing its $36 billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation's largest office landlord. ''That was when the market peaked,'' Mr. Kirby said.
 Indeed, part of the reason for the REIT run-up was the record number of mergers and acquisitions, about half of which involved leveraged-buyout deals by private firms with voracious appetites for commercial property. (As investors tried to predict which REIT companies, or sectors, might be singled out next, share prices surged.)
 Last year, there were 23 announced transactions totaling $106.15 billion, including the assumption of debt, according to SNL Financial, a research company. But so far this year there have been only 18 transactions totaling $68.69 billion, SNL said. Only one deal has been announced since July 25.
 Analysts attribute the falloff to a reluctance among financial institutions to provide loans for buyouts in light of the credit squeeze that swept through the subprime mortgage market as the housing market softened.
 Because REITs themselves typically have only moderate levels of debt, analysts say, they have generally fared well in the credit crisis; the noted exception, of course, has been mortgage REITs. 
 Nonetheless, concern has grown that the credit problems may eventually weaken the economy and therefore hurt demand for commercial space.
 ''Real estate fundamentals are still in pretty good shape by historic standards,'' said Ross L. Smotrich, a senior managing director and REIT analyst at Bear Stearns. ''Occupancy is in the low- to mid-90 percent range across the board by geographic and property types, and there's positive rental rate growth.''
 But even though these business fundamentals are relatively strong, securities prices have dropped. REIT performance, Mr. Kirby noted, ''had been pretty decent at the operating level and poor at the share level.''
 Whether REIT shares stay depressed is open for debate. The last bear market, in which annualized losses averaged 13.18 percent, lingered for 23 months until November 1999, according to the REIT trade association. The one before that lasted 14 months, from August 1989 to October 1990, it said; average annual returns during that market were a negative 20.86 percent.
 ''REITs have been in a bear market pretty much all year,'' said Ralph L. Block, the author of ''Investing in REITs'' (Bloomberg Press, 2006) and the publisher of The Essential REIT, a newsletter. ''I think the key to forecasting what REIT stocks do in 2008 is determining whether the U.S. is going into a recession.'' 
 Paul E. Adornato, a senior REIT analyst at BMO Capital Markets, agreed. ''This is the key uncertainty going into 2008,'' he said, adding that investors ''will be focusing on the macroeconomic issues -- rather than real estate fundamentals -- such as job growth.''
 But Mr. Smotrich says he also thinks that investors must overcome a perception problem. ''I call it a perceptual connection,'' he said. ''They're hearing that real estate is softening, so they think that that must mean all real estate is bad. They don't stop to think that the value of their homes in which they live and the office buildings in which they work are two very separate markets.'' 
 At the same time, REITs ''seem to be lumped in with all financial stocks right now,'' he added, noting that shares of financial services companies have been beaten down because of losses in their mortgage-backed securities businesses.
 Still, Brad Case, the vice president for research and industry information at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, maintains that REITs have a ''low correlation'' with most other stocks and bonds -- in other words, they tend not to move in tandem with them -- and that this makes them good portfolio diversifiers.
 Now may be a good time to buy, he added, citing industrywide data that shows REITs over all trading at a significant discount to asset value. According to Mr. Kirby of Green Street Advisors, the current average discount to net asset value is around 20 percent.
 Mr. Smotrich suggests that investors focus on the larger, so-called blue-chip REITs ''with excellent management, strong balance sheets and good business models.'' They also pay out regular dividends. 
 He particularly favors REITs in the industrial sector -- one of the stronger performers, with an average return of 9.13 percent so far this year -- which invest in warehouses and distribution centers. This sector includes companies like ProLogis Trust and AMB Property. Both are rapidly expanding onto other continents. ''Their global exposure will insulate them to some degree to the economic softness domestically,'' he said.
 Mr. Smotrich is less enthusiastic about the office sector, which has posted losses of 14.52 percent, on average, so far this year, and the apartments sector, which has had negative returns of 18.69 percent. Multifamily housing ''will face some head winds based on the oversupply of single-family homes for sale,'' he said. ''Landlords have less pricing power.'' 
 While Mr. Block agreed, he said he remained bullish on AvalonBay Communities, which develops and manages luxury apartments, mainly on the East and West Coasts and in Illinois. ''The markets in which they own are really not subject to overbuilding,'' he said. 
 On the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Adornato says he likes Sun Communities, which owns and operates manufactured housing communities. (That sector fell 13.15 percent.) ''We think that the single-family credit crisis would cause Americans to downsize,'' he said, ''and manufactured homes represent a much more affordable housing alternative.''
 Meanwhile, Louis W. Taylor, a managing director at Deutsche Bank Securities, says he thinks that health care REITs, which invest in properties like hospitals, medical buildings andnursing homes, are also likely to hold up well during an economic slowdown. (The sector is up 2.94 percent.) He says he likes Healthcare Realty Trust because ''they have a development pipeline not priced into their shares.''
 ''There are fears about the economy,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''But there's not a whole lot of fear about health care demand.''

 BODY:
The Mortgage Mess
 And Goldman Sachs
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Long and Short of It at Goldman Sachs'' (Everybody's Business, Dec. 2), in which Ben Stein muses about a Goldman economist's newsletter that warned of much more fallout from the subprime mess: 
 Mr. Stein argues that Goldman may want to sell economic fear because it is short the mortgage market. But that's like arguing that someone who's bought life insurance wants to die. Investment banks thrive on a robust economy. Any profit Goldman might make by being short the mortgage market in an economic collapse would be tiny relative to its overall loss of business. 
 The column also compares Goldman's mortgage business to Merrill Lynch's former tech stock business, because Merrill sold securities that one of its analysts didn't like. The differences here are that Goldman is selling to institutions, not individuals, and the Goldman economist is openly broadcasting his negative view. 
 Is Mr. Stein really suggesting that Goldman stop selling the thousands of stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities on which its analysts have publicly expressed a negative view? And that they stop selling them to sophisticated financial institutions, when they are simultaneously telling those institutions precisely what their analysts think? 
 Shouldn't Goldman's clients be allowed to reach independent conclusions? Lee Vance
 New York, Dec. 3
 The writer is a former partner at Goldman Sachs.
 To the Editor:
 Ben Stein raises valuable issues -- including the idea that while we must salute the financial and political power of Goldman Sachs, we can't get distracted by the prestige.
 It is clear that Goldman was connected to the problems in the mortgage market and collateralized mortgage obligations. I agree that it is far worse when sellers are simultaneously shorting the stuff they're selling. Steven A. Ludsin

HEADLINE: Teaching Teamwork, But With Real Money

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
TOM ROGERSON has seen his share of families bickering over money -- often because they were utterly unprepared to handle it. 
 ''The first time children make decisions together about significant wealth, it is usually sometime around settling the parents' estate,'' said Mr. Rogerson, the director of family wealth services at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. ''That is a bad time for siblings to learn about making decisions as a group.'' 
 Mr. Rogerson, 51, the father of two girls and two boys, has them off to an early start. Six years ago, when they ranged in age from 5 to 15, he and his wife decided to entrust them with $5,000 each year. The children were to invest the money, which would be used for the family's summer vacation. If the fund prospered, they might ''go to Disney World,'' he said. ''If it stayed flat, we would go around the country and visit family members,'' he added. ''If the investment fell, there was always a camping trip.'' 
 The family's investing adventure has included camping trips as well as less spartan vacations -- and it has given the children some basic education in finance and in teamwork, Mr. Rogerson said. 
 The point of the experience -- learning to work together to make intelligent decisions about money -- is an important one, and not just for wealthy families, several experts said. 
 Ted Beck, president of the National Endowment for Financial Education, for example, said he and his wife have had their children run several garage sales, mainly to teach them to work together in handling money. People with family businesses may want to have their children work in them part time to gain real-world experience. Merely talking about teamwork and money isn't enough, Mr. Beck said. ''Tying the educational moments to an actual event is when it really sinks in,'' he said. ''Otherwise, it is way too theoretical.'' 
 It is important to explain how both stocks and bonds work and to teach the art of working together in an emotionally laden family setting, several experts said. ''We encourage financial literacy for youth to help lay a foundation for them to learn to manage money and ensure financial stability,'' said Jeanette A. Tucker, professor of family economics at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center. ''The teamwork concept helps to strengthen strong families and prevents lots of hurt feelings.'' 
 Such lessons are useful for a family regardless of its financial status, said Joline Godfrey, author of ''Raising Financially Fit Kids.'' 
 ''It does not matter if the families are eking it out or if they are prosperous,'' she said. ''Any teaching that goes on for several years gives a clear message that it takes time to build a financial base.'' She added: ''It is also valuable to be explicit about your values. Otherwise, the kids will adopt the culture of their peers, and that is all about consumption.''
 She described Mr. Rogerson's approach as ''a financial Outward Bound.'' Faced with a challenge, she said, ''they have to try it'' and will pick up valuable lessons along the way.
 Mr. Rogerson turned his kids into investing guinea pigs in 2001 -- a bad year for the domestic stock market, as it turned out. ''The kids knew nothing,'' he recalled. ''They bought stocks like Apple and Hasbro and all these penny stocks at high-tech and toy companies. Their pile went down from $5,000 to $2,000.'' That year, he said, ''we went camping.'' 
 During the second year, the children were so nervous about ''putting Mom and Dad back in a tent again that they eventually put all the money in money market accounts,'' he said. ''They made $50,'' he added. ''That year we drove down to Florida to visit family. 
 ''Since we were six people, we stayed at Holiday Inns along the way. We spent the money on motels, food and entertainment. My father lived in Daytona and my wife's mother lives in Naples. Along the way, the kids made decisions about what kinds of restaurants we could go to.'' 
 BY the third year, the investing bug had bitten, and the children wondered, ''How do we invest so maybe we can do something more fantastic?'' he said. They had stocks that were more conservative: a diversified portfolio that included large-capitalization stocks. They also had fixed-income investments like bonds. The young investors earned $600 on their $5,000 that year, and the family rented a catamaran and went boating near Mystic, Conn. (choosing it over Disney World). ''I would love to tell you they loved it, but it rained all week,'' recalled Mr. Rogerson, who is based in Boston. 
 Mr. Beck said he and his wife, a former banker, were determined to talk to their children about finances at their individual paces, but the couple also wanted them to work together. They settled on garage sales. 
 ''It was interesting to see how they divided up their roles,'' Mr. Beck recalled. At an early sale, one daughter, Katherine, then in junior high school, handled pricing because she had already gone to garage sales with friends; she took a leading role in the project.
 ''What really struck us was that the kids knew each other's strengths better than we did,'' he said. ''They split the $100 that they earned, but they agreed not to split it equally because Katherine had done the most.'' Mr. Beck was quick to add that projects like this one wouldn't necessarily interest all children equally. While his children all participated and cooperated well, he said, only Katherine showed real interest in business. She is now majoring in marketing in college.
 Of course, convincing children to work together when they are young is no guarantee they will do so as adults. The hurdles are far higher, Mr. Rogerson said. Spouses may complicate matters, and insidious rivalries can grow out of envy and mistrust. But he is convinced that early sibling partnerships, as he calls them, can help counteract those tendencies. 
 Like Mr. Beck, Mr. Rogerson said that the effort has helped them discover their own aptitudes. ''We found that one boy showed great leadership and the other one was great with spreadsheets and tracking information,'' he said. ''Each had a different focus.''

HEADLINE: When The Price Isn't Right

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
WHO among us could have imagined that the same forces of financial ambiguity could at once choke the real estate market, Wall Street, network television and Major League Baseball? Yet somehow a rippling crisis of belief in the traditional ways of valuing so many things, from mortgage-backed bonds to a joke written for Jon Stewart, simultaneously grips many areas of American commerce. 
 In the pages of your old college economics textbook, figuring out what something was worth was supposed to be a fairly straightforward calculation. What's the supply of the thing being valued? What's the demand for it? What are similar things selling for? Voila. But in recent months, leaning on that book to understand the ways of modern capitalism seems about as sensible as consulting Homer to find your way around Greece. 
 All of the sudden, figuring out the value of a Florida condo or a television script has become intensely complicated, so much so that a general state of uncertainty seizes many markets. Would-be deal makers are sitting tight and waiting for the murkiness to clear, which has slowed the economy. 
 The global financial system is struggling with tight credit in part because markets are unwilling to buy many of the exotic assets sitting on the books of banks. These assets are linked one way or another to mortgages, their value riding on the ability of homeowners to keep making their payments. With house prices falling and foreclosures increasing, few can be sure what these assets are worth, making the current state of banking something like a poker game in which no one knows how many face cards are in the deck. It adds up to an incentive not to play. 
 ''It's always hard to value things,'' said Donald Brownstein, chief executive of a hedge fund operator, Structured Portfolio Management. ''In some cases, you don't have enough information. In other cases you don't want to know the truth. In this case it's both.'' 
 Economics, in its purest theoretical state, assumes that markets set prices by factoring in a perfect stream of relevant information. That world has never existed, no more than the frictionless environment you encountered in high school physics. These days, it seems farther away than ever. 
 ''In the ideal system, there's a let's-pretend auctioneer who runs around and collects all the chits of the buyers and the sellers,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Decision Economics Inc. ''If they don't match up, the auctioneer keeps running around until the market clears.'' 
 Now, buyers and sellers are effectively boycotting the pretend auctioneer, unwilling to believe what he has to say. 
 The real estate market, jolted by falling prices, is locked up because few can agree on a fair price. Sellers cannot fathom how their homes could be worth so much less than a year ago, when they were still high-fiving their neighbors across the backyard fence. (Those same neighbors may now be inside poring through the foreclosure documents.) Buyers have heard about plummeting prices and are holding out for some of that. The result: stalemate. 
 Other areas of American life are similarly tangled in a confusing swirl of unknowns. There are the striking television and movie screenwriters: Many issues continue to deprive a hungry nation of its nightly ''Colbert Report,'' but one has proved particularly nettlesome -- how to divide electronic rights (not to mention advertising rates) in an age when people watch shows on their iPods, and YouTube competes for attention with CBS. 
 ''New media? It seems impossible to divide it up,'' the comedian Garry Shandling vented recently in an interview with Daily Variety. ''How can you divide up something in an evolutionary stage? When we don't know exactly what's of value, it should be open. It's half gambling.'' 
 Shoppers inclined to surrender thousands of dollars for clothing sold by Gucci and Prada are bewildered by an abundance of similar-looking items with vastly cheaper prices at Zara and H & M, complicating decision making. 
 Confusion assails what was once known as the record industry (which, in this age of MP3 players, sounds a bit like calling Verizon a telegraph operator). The pop artist Prince recently opted to distribute his album via a British tabloid newspaper. The band Radiohead gave its album away on the Internet, inviting fans to hand over whatever they felt would be fair. With every component of the old distribution chain up for reconsideration -- with downloadable music established, and the power of radio vastly diminished -- what are the contours of the next negotiation between artist and label? 
 Consider the mysterious negotiations that have dragged on for weeks between the New York Yankees and their star third baseman, Alex Rodriguez. For many years, the value of any player could be roughly pegged to agreed-upon measures of performance -- so many dollars for a home run or run batted in. Then came a new crop of stat-geeks, chronicled in the Michael Lewis book ''Moneyball.'' They found previously overlooked but supposedly more useful data for assessing value, and the economics shifted, with teams shelling out for less glamorous achievements like a high on-base percentage. 
 The A-Rod contract talks represent a new mode of calculating value that appears to be slowing down the dance. By most accounts, Rodriguez will command something around $30 million a year when the ink is dry. Though he is among the most prodigious hitters in history, that number still makes little sense when confined to what happens on the field, baseball people say. It begins to make sense only when the game is seen as an industry reshaped by technology and globalization.
 A-Rod then provides crucial content for the cable television channel owned by the Yankees, and a means of hawking caps and jerseys on interactive Internet services. Factor in how he may break the all-time home run record wearing Yankee pinstripes, which convey a global brand, and perhaps -- but only perhaps -- does the money make sense. 
 ''A-Rod could be worth trillions if you get enough eyeballs in China to start watching him,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. 
 The point is, there is no ''comparable,'' no previous time to look back to when determining the check that should be cut for Rodriguez. 
 The same can be said for the banks struggling with the real value of their holdings; for homeowners and home buyers, record producers and artists, all staring at the scrim of uncertainty draping so many markets. The economy is waiting for markets to absorb the new possibilities and settle on prices that make enough sense to enough people that buying and selling can start up anew.

HEADLINE: Gates Sees Non-Nuclear Iran as Still a Serious Threat

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Saturday that Iran is a grave threat to regional security even without nuclear weapons, and called on Tehran to account for American intelligence that describes its support for terrorism and instability around the world.
 Just days after Iran claimed political victory after a new American intelligence assessment found that Tehran had frozen its nuclear weapons program, Mr. Gates said Iran could restart those efforts at any time and must come clean about its efforts to build a bomb. 
 In a speech to a conference on regional security here, Mr. Gates dismissed those who suggested that the United States had a double standard on nuclear arms in the Middle East and that a nuclear-armed Israel was the real danger. He said that, unlike Iran, Israel had never threatened to destroy a neighbor.
 Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has made aggressive comments toward Israel, including a call in 2005 for Israel to be ''wiped off the map.''
 Mr. Gates mocked Iran's praise of a new National Intelligence Estimate as a ''watershed'' -- the first time Tehran has accepted the conclusions of American spy agencies. As the audience chuckled, Mr. Gates said Iran's approval of the American intelligence estimate required it to accept other assessments of its behavior.
 ''Since that government now acknowledges the quality of American intelligence assessments,'' Mr. Gates said, ''I assume that it will also embrace as valid American intelligence assessments of its funding and training of militia groups in Iraq, its deployment of lethal weapons and technology to both Iraq and Afghanistan, its ongoing support of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas that have murdered thousands of innocent civilians and its continued research and development of medium-range ballistic missiles that are not particularly cost-effective unless equipped with warheads carrying weapons of mass destruction.''
 The National Intelligence Estimate concluded that Iran had a secret nuclear arms program, but that it halted the effort in 2003. The response from Tehran was to describe the report as America's confession of a mistake.
 The defense secretary has consistently said that diplomatic and economic pressure should be the first choice to halt Iranian nuclear ambitions, and that military action should remain a last resort. His statements are softer than those of President Bush, who as recently as October invoked images of World War III to warn of the Iranian threat.
 But, as would be expected of a former director of central intelligence, Mr. Gates said Iran ''cannot pick and choose'' only the American intelligence it likes.
 He said the estimate ''is explicit that Iran is keeping its options open and could restart its nuclear weapons program at any time -- I would add, if it has not done so already.''
 The speech captured the same tone of calibrated irony that Mr. Gates used in response to a caustic address delivered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to a regional security conference in Munich in February. Yet Mr. Gates was blunt in his assessments of Iranian action to provoke violence and instability around the world.
 ''There can be little doubt that their destabilizing foreign policies are a threat to the interests of the United States, to the interests of every country in the Middle East, and to the interests of all countries within the range of the ballistic missiles Iran is developing,'' he said.
 An Iranian delegation was invited to the conference, but organizers said no officials from Tehran were in attendance.
 In comments to reassure Persian Gulf partners that may fear American isolationism after the Iraq war, Mr. Gates emphasized Washington's commitment to the region, and pressed for an area-wide missile defense system and increased cooperation on local waterways to counter terrorism, piracy, narcotics trafficking and smuggling.
 He encouraged Gulf nations to move beyond bilateral relations with the United States in countering Iran, and offered as fertile areas of cooperation ''shared early warning, cooperative air and missile defense, and maritime security awareness.'' He urged allies to develop regional air and missile defense systems.
 To underscore the importance of the regional dialogue, the American delegation to this year's conference, sponsored by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, included for the first time the defense secretary; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Adm. William J. Fallon, the senior commander of American forces in the Middle East.
 ''The United States remains committed to defending its vital interests and those of its allies in Iraq and in the wider Middle East,'' Mr. Gates said.
 During a lively question-and-answer period, Mr. Gates was pressed on whether the United States had a double standard in organizing the world community to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons but not working to disarm Israel.
 ''Israel is not training terrorists to subvert its neighbors, it has not shipped weapons to a place like Iraq to kill thousands of civilians, it has not threatened to destroy any of its neighbors, it is not trying to destabilize the government of Lebanon,'' Mr. Gates said.

HEADLINE: The 7th Annual Year in Ideas

 BODY:
Airborne Wind Turbines Traditional wind turbines can be unreliable sources of energy because, well, the wind blows where it will. Not the case 1,000 feet up. ''At a thousand feet, there is steady wind anywhere in the world,'' says Mac Brown, chief operating officer of Ottawa-based Magenn Power. 
 To take advantage of this constant breeze, Brown has developed a lighter-than-air wind turbine capable of powering a rural village. ''Picture a spinning Goodyear blimp,'' Brown says. Filled with helium, outfitted with electrical generators and tethered to the ground by a conductive copper cable, the 100-foot-wide Magenn Air Rotor System (MARS) [1] will produce 10 kilowatts of energy anywhere on earth. As the turbine spins around a horizontal axis, the generators convert the mechanical energy of the wind into electrical energy, then send it down for immediate use or battery storage. 
 Planning for the MARS has been under way for a few years, but this fall Magenn got the $5 million it needed to build prototypes from a California investor. In October, the MARS received its U.S. patent. Already, larger models -- ones that might light a skyscraper -- are in the works. Brown says he hopes his floating wind turbines will power off-the-grid villages in the developing world. He says the governments of India and Pakistan have expressed interest.
 At least one argument against wind turbines -- that they slice up birds and bats -- isn't valid, according to Brown. ''This thing is bigger than a house,'' he says. ''A bird can see it and a bat can sense it.'' DAVID GELLES
 Alzheimer's Telephone Screening, The [2] This year, researchers completed work on a 50-question telephone quiz to help them identify Alzheimer's patients long before they exhibit typical symptoms. Such a quiz may soon become part of regular medical care.
 This new tool measures what the researchers call ''cognitive vital signs'' like short-term memory loss, which is the most important early sign of Alzheimer's, and detects declines in everyday abilities like using a telephone, preparing meals or managing finances. The quiz also picks up behavioral warning signs including apathy, irritability and depression. 
 ''If somebody is failing these cognitive tests, they already have the characteristics of the disease,'' says Jeffrey Cummings, director of the Alzheimer Disease Center at U.C.L.A., ''just in a very early and mild form.'' Cummings says the quiz reliably shows when a person crosses the line between normal mental life and the mild cognitive impairment found in early Alzheimer's, but adds that anyone who fails should get a detailed follow-up exam. 
 Cummings and his fellow researchers created the quiz to drastically reduce expensive, face-to-face exams in coming clinical trials of new drugs that may prevent Alzheimer's. Only about 1 in 100 healthy 70-year-olds will develop Alzheimer's during a year of testing, so to get statistically meaningful results, researchers must enroll about 5,000 people with no Alzheimer's symptoms. In Cummings's proposed trials, one group of healthy volunteers would take an experimental drug and the other would get a placebo -- and every six months, they would all take the quiz by phone. ''If people in the placebo group are proceeding to abnormality more quickly than the treatment group,'' Cummings says, ''that suggests first, that they might have Alzheimer's, and second, that we have slowed the disease in the treatment group.'' 
 A welcome second use of the trial: screening. Cummings suggests check-ups beginning at age 55, since the odds of getting Alzheimer's double every five years at that point: 2 percent of 65-year-olds have Alzheimer's, 4 percent of 70-year-olds and so on. By age 85, one in three people have the disease. ''Without a preventive therapy, Alzheimer's will overwhelm the Medicare system,'' Cummings says. ''A test like this should be as common as checking blood pressure.'' RON FEEMSTER
 Ambiguity Promotes Liking [3] Is it true that familiarity breeds contempt? A psychology study published this year concludes that the answer is yes. It seems we are inclined to interpret ambiguous information about someone optimistically, assuming we will get along. We are usually let down, however, when we learn more.
 A team of researchers, led by Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School, looked at online daters' opinions of people they were about to meet for the first time and compared those ratings with another group's post-date impressions. Before the date, based on what little information the daters saw online, most participants rated their prospective dates between a 6 and a 10 on a 10-point scale, with nobody giving a score below a 3. But post-date scores were lower, on average, and lots of people deemed their date a total dud.
 Why? For starters, initial information is open to interpretation. ''And people are so motivated to find somebody they like that they read things into the profiles,'' Norton says. If a man writes that he likes the outdoors, his would-be mate imagines her perfect skiing companion, but when she learns more, she discovers ''the outdoors'' refers to nude beaches. And ''once you see one dissimilarity, everything you learn afterward gets colored by that,'' Norton says.
 The letdown from getting more information isn't true just for romance. In one experiment, the researchers showed college students different numbers of randomly selected traits and asked them to rate how much they'd like the person described. For the most part, the more traits participants saw, the less they said they would like the other person. But another group of students had overwhelmingly said they would like people more after learning more about them.
 We make this mistake, the researchers say, largely because we can all recall cases of more knowledge leading to more liking. ''You forget the people in your third-grade class you didn't like; you remember the people you're still friends with,'' Norton explains. MARINA KRAKOVSKY
 APPENDIX RATIONALE, THE [4] For years, the appendix got no respect. Doctors regarded it as nothing but a source of trouble: It didn't seem to do anything, and it sometimes got infected and required an emergency removal. Plus, nobody ever suffered from not having an appendix. So human biologists assumed that the tiny, worm-shaped organ is vestigial -- a shrunken remainder of some organ our ancestors required. In a word: Useless.
 Now that old theory has been upended. In a December issue of The Journal of Theoretical Biology, a group of scientists announce they have solved the riddle of the appendix. The organ, they claim, is in reality a ''safe house'' for healthful bacteria -- the stuff that makes our digestive system function. When our gut is ravaged by diseases like diarrhea and dysentery, the appendix quietly goes to work repopulating the gut with beneficial bacteria.
 ''In essence,'' says William Parker, a chemist who co-wrote the paper, ''after our system crashes, the appendix reboots it.'' The theory may explain the location of the appendix: Positioned at the beginning of the colon, it often escapes being voided when a sick colon violently empties itself out the bottom.
 If the appendix is indeed crucial, why don't people who have their appendixes removed die? Because in the modern world hygiene and medicine can keep our levels of healthy bacteria adequate. The appendix may have evolved its rebooting function back when our ancestors lived a more vulnerable life -- and an entire village might suffer catastrophic diarrhea. In that situation, each gut had to rely on its own resources to recover after a collapse, so the appendix was crucial.
 Parker admits the argument is ''deductive.'' There's no way to test it other than performing ''some heinous experiment'' -- like going to an isolated tribal village, removing half the population's appendixes and seeing whether that half dies during the next bout of dysentery. Even so, anatomists have been receptive to Parker's theory. CLIVE THOMPSON
 Best Way to Deflect an Asteroid, The In 1908, an asteroid is thought to have entered the earth's atmosphere and exploded over a Siberian forest, leveling some 800 square miles of trees in what is known as the Tunguska Event. If we knew today that another asteroid were on a path to intersect with our planet, what could we do? 
 Massimiliano Vasile, a lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of Glasgow, recently concluded a two-year study comparing nine asteroid-deflection methods, rating them for efficiency, complexity and launch readiness.
 The best method, called ''mirror bees,'' entails sending a group of small satellites equipped with mirrors 30 to 100 feet wide into space to ''swarm'' around an asteroid and trail it, Vasile explains. The mirrors would be tilted to reflect sunlight onto the asteroid, vaporizing one spot and releasing a stream of gases that would slowly move it off course [5]. Vasile says this method is especially appealing because it could be scaled easily: 25 to 5,000 satellites could be used, depending on the size of the rock.
 The losing ideas -- satellites equipped with lasers; detonating a nuclear explosion; pushing the asteroid with a spacecraft, to name a few -- might still have their place. Vasile says improved technologies could make others appealing in the future. (In March, NASA released a report on ''near Earth objects'' that deemed the nuclear-explosion method the most effective.)
 Michael Gaffey, professor of space studies at the University of North Dakota, says the risk of dying from an asteroid strike is about 1 in 2 million. The problem is that the consequences are tremendous; a half-mile-wide asteroid or larger, of which there are more than 700 that come close to Earth's orbit, could have an impact equal to 60 billion tons of TNT. While it is not likely to happen, you still want to be prepared. ''You don't panic, you don't have to run around screaming and waving your hands,'' Gaffey says. ''But you do need to devote resources to it.''

 BIODEGRADABLE COFFINS [6] This July, when Jorgi Wu was laid to rest in central California, she became the first American to be buried in an Ecopod -- a 100 percent biodegradable coffin made of recycled paper. The seedpod-shaped coffin is designed to be planted in the ground, dissolve and replenish the earth with its nutrient-rich contents. Who needs embalming, cement vaults or herbicide-based lawn care?
 Interest in ''green'' burials has been increasing in recent years, and the Ecopod is one of the first coffins to fit the environmentally conscious consumer niche. Originally developed in England, it is sold in the United States by the Portland-based Natural Burial Company. Visitors to the company's showroom will soon be able to see a variety of other biodegradable coffins made of paper, formaldehyde-free plywood, fair-trade-certified bamboo and hand-woven Somerset willow.
 These coffins are the antithesis of the funeral industry's usual rain-forest mahogany and steel caskets, which are held together by formaldehyde-infused glue and hermetically sealed to keep nature out. According to Cynthia Beal, the founder of the Natural Burial Company, this preservation process has turned modern cemeteries into ''parking lots'' for the dead. She says she hopes her products will push the trend toward natural burial parks -- currently there are just a handful in the country.
 While the Ecopod triumphs in simplicity, it does not skimp on style. It is available in multiple colors -- and can be silk-screened with doves, Aztec suns or other designs, and lined with cream or blue feathers, so that customers can choose the Ecopod that best reflects their personalities. Wu chose the forest green model -- with a Celtic cross on top. APRIL DEMBOSKY
 Biofuel Race, The [7] For millennia, civilization's main event, the harvest, has focused our attention upon the fruit of our agricultural efforts -- the kernel, the grain, busheled and bagged. So it's no surprise that the fledgling biofuel industry has been similarly focused: America's favorite biofuels come mostly from corn and from soy. But when food crops are used as fuel, difficulties may follow. The vogue for corn ethanol has driven up the price of corn around the world, putting the poor in jeopardy. (An expert affiliated with the United Nations went so far as to label the production of biofuels derived from food stock ''a crime against humanity.'') Corn ethanol is also astonishingly inefficient: because vast amounts of fossil fuels are required for its manufacture, every 1 unit of energy nets a mere 1.3 units of ethanol. 
 Is there a better way? In 2007, significant steps were taken toward a potentially great second harvest, some of it coming from the byproducts of animals, some of it from municipal waste and garbage but the bulk of it coming from plant biomass, which is really about breaking down cellulose, the key structural component of all plant cell walls and the most abundant of all naturally occurring organic compounds on earth. A recent Department of Energy study found the United States can produce a billion tons of plant biomass annually, yet 400 million years of evolution has made cellulose resistant -- the term of art is ''recalcitrant'' -- to manipulation. Unlocking its complex compounds of sugars, whose potential yield is 4 times that of corn on a gallons-per-acre basis, typically requires an aggressive, four-step thermo-chemical process. Taken together, these steps have been too costly or too energy intensive for cellulosic fuel production to become economically viable. Cracking the conundrum of plant cell walls cheaply has become a Brigadoon-like dream that has been ''5 years away,'' as one wry observer put it, ''for the last 30 years.'' 
 Until now -- at least if you believe Vinod Khosla, one of the best-known venture capitalists in America, who was a founder of Sun Microsystems and an early investor in Google, and who has in recent years invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a dozen different biofuel companies using new and potentially revolutionary techniques. In November, a Khosla-backed firm called Range Fuels broke ground on the first cellulosic ethanol plant in the country. The plant, located in Georgia, employs an efficient process that eliminates two of the four traditional thermo-chemical steps. Range Fuels plans to use timber scraps, wood chips and paper pulp, though it could also use municipal waste and even olive pits, to produce 100 million gallons of fuel a year. 
 Khosla has also supported efforts to utilize the power of bioengineering. The goal here has been to create bacteria that will, in effect, eat cellulose and excrete oil. In February, a Khosla-backed company, LS9, announced its plans to make genetically engineered microbes that do just that. Another company, Verenium, exploits naturally occurring cellulose-eating enzymes in termites and fungus to produce ethanol.
 But can products like these go to market? Yes, according to Khosla, who finances technologies only if he believes they can be ramped up to scale and compete with fossil fuels within five to seven years of their initial deployment -- without government subsidy. ''I believe in technologies that can compete in the marketplace,'' he says. ''Otherwise, it's just toys you're dealing with. Not solutions.'' 
 According to Khosla, within the next two decades, petroleum, which accounts for 40 percent of the current total energy use in the United States, can be entirely replaced by biofuels. That's a half-trillion-dollar market. In a kind of biofuels roulette, Khosla, a man with a big stack of chips, has covered the table with many different bets. One of them seems bound to hit, which would be a Google-like home run for Khosla and would similarly revolutionize life for the rest of us. MARK SVENVOLD
 Braille Tattoo, The [8] In April, while taking a university course on ''body technology,'' a Czech art student named Klara Jirkova had a vision of a ''touchable 'tattoo' for blind people.'' According to her project paper, one way to do it would be to emboss the surface of your arm, say, with a word or message in Braille by having stainless-steel beads surgically implanted under your skin -- thereby creating a body modification meant not just to decorate ''but to be touched and read.''
 Jirkova, who is 24, says ''this was really meant to be used by blind people'' and ''not something that was supposed to become trendy.'' Nevertheless, her proposal sent the trend-spotting sectors of the blogosphere into a tizzy after it went up on the school's Web site in August. Hundreds of blogs posted a Photoshopped image that Jirkova made of a Braille tattoo on a girl's arm, noting that the digitally created protrusions of flesh spelled ''sun.''
 It's not clear, however, whether anybody has actually gotten a Braille implant. Jirkova says she probably won't get one herself (she has no tattoos) but has three friends who want one. ''Implants are a little problematic in the Czech Republic,'' she says. ''It must be a doctor who does it, and it's not so easy to find one who is interested.'' In the United States, subdermal implants -- small subcutaneous horns on the forehead, for instance -- have become more popular as a mode of body modification in recent years, but are still fairly rare.
 Among the blind, there is disagreement about the satisfaction a Braille tattoo might provide. One visually-impaired blogger who goes by Etana wrote that the idea was ''not only sensical but sensual in my book.'' But others point out that only about 10 percent of visually-impaired people read Braille. ''At the level of universal design utopianism, it's fraught with problems,'' says Stephen Kuusisto, the author of ''Eavesdropping: A Memoir of Blindness and Listening,'' who has been blind since birth. ''Having said that, I agree that we should all have the right to touch each other and read a message.'' JOHN GLASSIE

HEADLINE: Show Us the Mortgage Relief

 BODY:
When he announced a new plan to try to stanch the foreclosure crisis, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. said that the officials, lenders and investors involved had been working toward it since August. That start date is a useful benchmark for measuring the plan's inadequacy. 
 Only an estimated 250,000 borrowers, at best, are likely to benefit from the plan's main relief measure -- a five-year freeze on certain adjustable loans' introductory rates. Yet, from mid-2007 to now, some 800,000 homeowners have entered foreclosure. From 2008 through mid-2010, when the last of the potentially eligible loans would otherwise reset to sharply higher payments, there will be an estimated 3.5 million loan defaults. 
 The plan is too little, too late and too voluntary. Mr. Paulson and his boss, President Bush, have left it to the private sector -- the mortgage industry -- to protect the public interest, without any negative consequences if it does not. That is not the way the private sector works. And it is not how government is supposed to work at a time when Americans are facing mass foreclosures that threaten entire communities, financial markets and the wider economy. 
 Many mortgage servicers -- lenders and private companies that collect mortgage payments on behalf of investors -- have been reluctant to modify at-risk loans, even though the alternative is to foreclose on thousands of homeowners. That is because they fear being sued by mortgage investors. For some investors, letting a troubled borrower default would actually be better business, for others not. It all depends on how their particular security is set to pay out.
 The new plan establishes guidelines that lenders can use to determine which troubled borrowers might qualify for a rate freeze. But even lenders that stick to the government-brokered guidelines have no guarantee that they cannot be sued. 
 The criteria for who gets relief and who does not are also a problem. Some are reasonable: borrowers must live in their homes and have a good repayment record on their mortgage loan. Others are far too restrictive: borrowers can be disqualified if they have improved their credit score during the loan's introductory period, a move that is intended to weed out anyone with even the smallest probability of being able to afford a payment that is set to explode, but which could subject homeowners who need help to delays and denials.
 Investors may simply be too self-interested to pull off the aggressive, broad-based loan fixes that Mr. Paulson has said he wants -- and that the nation needs. Rather than standing up to Wall Street, Mr. Paulson is hoping that the interests of investors -- to make money -- will magically align with the interests of homeowners, to keep a roof over their heads. 
 Mr. Paulson should be prepared to choose sides. If the voluntary efforts are not much more successful than expected -- and soon -- he should support the tougher approaches being called for on Capitol Hill. One bill would help shield lenders who modify loans from being sued by investors. Another would allow troubled borrowers to restructure their mortgages under bankruptcy court protection. Both would give the industry a strong motivation to ramp up loan modifications -- or watch the courts take over. If the industry drags its feet, that is exactly what should happen.

TASTE 
 The Story of Britain Through Its Cooking. 
 By Kate Colquhoun. 
 Illustrated. 460 pp. Bloomsbury. $34.95. 
 In an effort to clarify and define the rights and obligations of British citizenship, Prime Minister Gordon Brown recently invited the British public to help its government develop ''a statement of British values'': as a Scot at a time when Scots in England are not as popular as they used to be, reviving the waning idea of an inclusive British identity is useful to him. Many people misread his words and imagined Brown wanted to find values unique to Britain -- ''British values.'' More careful readers noted that what he was looking for was a particularly British expression of the Enlightenment beliefs common to, say, France or the United States, whose catchy slogans (''liberty, equality, fraternity'' and ''land of the free'') he seemed to envy. 
 In a country without a written constitution, national values can be slippery. What are they -- characteristics, aspirations, exemplary models of behavior, laws, traditions? Can food express a national value? In the 18th century, Britain (or at least the English part of it) saw roast beef -- ''the roast beef of old England'' -- as more than a piece of meat with some gravy slopped over the top. It came plain and hot from the oven and the spit, its freshness needing no fancy foreign trickery with spices and casseroles to disguise its age or toughness. Roast beef symbolized honest yeoman strength. As a patriotic symbol, it appeared in cartoons and said boo to the French. Today its equivalent as the national dish is said to be chicken tikka masala, a popular, yellow-sauced invention of Britain's Indian restaurants. Perhaps this is a consoling myth of multiculturalism that would be contested by McDonald's, but again it shows how a nation can use food to boast of its qualities and strengths. 
 In the two centuries between the roast beef and the chicken masala, Britain did very little culinary boasting. The cliche was that it had woeful cooking, the worst in Europe. Foreigners wrote home with details of floury brown soups, overboiled vegetables, watery stews and coffee that, in the words of Kingsley Amis, ''tasted of old coffee pots.'' Why was it, people asked from 1800 until about 1980, that a country so rich in promising raw materials (beef, fish, lamb, game, cream) had the habit of murdering their flavors on the way to the table? The question was aggravated by the divisions created by social class and by the shortages of war. As a child of the 1940s and '50s, this reviewer grew up in Britain when food was still rationed -- butter and cheese until 1954 -- and recalls puzzling over the highly-colored pictures of roast hams studded with pineapple chunks that appeared on the back covers of National Geographic magazine, advertisements that were just as exotic to him as the editorial content about, say, Samoa, that lay inside. By the 1960s, the exotic had become ordinary. Prosperity provided European holidays and different ideas of cooking, and waves of immigration had begun to establish Indian and Chinese restaurants, peppered with a scattering of Italian and Greek, in every British high street. The story is well known, and Kate Colquhoun tells it well in ''Taste.'' But because Colquhoun is a writer of lively detail rather than argument -- you might say her book is too busy stuffing its face, one course after another, to pause for conversation -- the question of why Britain developed such a poor cuisine is never fully addressed.
 All the evidence points to the triad of the Industrial Revolution, empire and free trade. The first drove people from the fields to the factories; the colonies of the second grew what Sidney Mintz has called the tropical ''drug foods'' (including sugar and tea); the cheap imports encouraged by the third drove out the homegrown. None of these phenomena were peculiar to Britain, but no other European country had them in combination so early or to the same extent. Britain's industrial working classes, unmoored from the domestic habits of their rural ancestors and crazed by their factory hours, simply forgot how to cook. As early as 1800, according to Colquhoun, ''the poor in Britain were now subsisting not on the diet that had remained broadly unchanged for centuries, of ale, grain, vegetables and a modicum of fatty meat, but on a vastly less nutritious mix of often adulterated white bread, cheese, tea and sugar.''
 In the course of the next century, the British population grew fourfold. Canning factories were part of the solution to feeding it. ''Tinned meat was generally foul,'' Colquhoun writes, ''but it was cheap and it came in handy for unexpected guests, titivated into soups, stews and rissoles.'' It cost less than half the price of fresh meat and arrived from everywhere. First from Australia as ''coarse-grained, overdone lumps with a wad of fat,'' then from the United States, whose tinned exports to Britain multiplied nearly 1,500 times between 1866 and 1871, and finally from Uruguay and Argentina, whose modern economies were founded largely on shipping tinned and refrigerated beef to London and Liverpool. By 1914, Britain was the world's largest consumer of tinned goods -- a fact that echoes today in the figures for its consumption of ''ready meals,'' which are three times more than the European average. In 1937 George Orwell wrote: ''We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun.'' 
 Orwell wasn't the first (and certainly not the last) anxious inquirer into the British diet. Food scares erupted throughout the 19th century, caused mainly by adulteration, and the physique of the poor spoke eloquently of their undernourishment on jam and margarine. The crisis was reached in the Boer War, when 38 percent of eligible army recruits were found unfit to fight and a government study showed that working-class boys aged 12 were on average five inches shorter than boys of the same age who attended private schools. The parents of these richer boys would have been sitting down to meals at the apex of late Victorian and Edwardian luxury -- meals that stretched far into the night, ice-cold caviar followed by velvety soups, followed by sole and duckling breasts and Chateaubriand steaks and meringues, the courses interspersed with sorbets and finished off with a savory, oysters wrapped in bacon or eggs en cocotte.
 Colquhoun is mindful of these extremities of privilege, though the real delight of her book lies in the abundance of illuminating and curious facts. Alexis Soyer, chef at the Reform Club, designed one of the earliest gas cookers and called it, catchily if you were very well educated, the Phidomageireion, which means ''thrifty kitchen'' in classical Greek. Meanwhile the English passion for gravy led to the belief in an illusory substance called ozmazome, a kind of El Dorado of juicy nourishment thought to lie at the heart of the meat -- a ''befuddled concept'' from which the German chemist Justus von Leibig nevertheless made a great deal of money when he invented beef extract. 
 Social class is never far away in this story. Just before Gordon Brown became prime minister, I had a meal with him in his Scottish home. Homemade lamb stew was followed by shop-bought rhubarb tart, with a glass of supermarket white available, if anyone wanted one, from an already-opened bottle. As befits a politician keen to stress his plain values, the meal was perfectly good and superbly ordinary, the kind of food we had both grown up with (though 40 or 50 years ago, wine would have been unusual). The interesting thing is that we called it ''lunch.'' In my youth, the working-class appellation for the midday meal was dinner. Tea was the evening meal. Lunch (luncheon! How fancy!) existed only in the stories of children's books like ''Wind in the Willows.'' Just as much as the television popularity of the sacred Nigella Lawson or the profane Gordon Ramsay, this change in terminology suggests that in much of Britain middle-class eating habits have triumphed, not a moment too soon.

HEADLINE: As Ice Recedes, Interest Surges

BYLINE: By ETHAN TODRAS-WHITEHILL

 BODY:
FOR those who find that Discovery Channel documentaries and Al Gore's PowerPoint presentations don't adequately capture the phenomenon of global warming, another option is now more readily available: pulling on a fur-lined parka and watching the ice melt in Greenland.
 Highlighted as a focal point of global warming in scientific reports and apocalyptic films like ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' Greenland is beginning to draw attention from tourists who want to see the effects of climate change for themselves. 
 And the accessibility of Greenland for Americans got a boost last summer when Air Greenland started the first nonstop flight between the United States and Greenland, a five-hour flight out of Baltimore (airgreenland.com). In 2008, the airline is scheduling weekly service out of Baltimore/Washington International Airport from late June to early August, with round-trip fares starting at 6,335 Danish kroner, about $1,265 at 5 kroner to the dollar. (Previously, travelers had to fly through Nunavut in northern Canada, Iceland or Denmark.)
 Visitors fly into Kangerlussuaq, the site of a former United States military base. The foot of the polar ice cap there is a popular picnicking spot for tourists, where they stare at a 250-foot wall of ice that, if it melts, has the potential to raise the world's oceans by 24 feet, some researchers have estimated. 
 The most popular destination for Americans is the Ilulissat ice fjord, a 45-minute flight from Kangerlussuaq and the site of the fastest retreating glacier in the Northern Hemisphere. A few years ago, the fjord was 25 miles long, but the melting of the glacier has lengthened the fjord to 31 miles, a change that has made it one of Greenland's most visible examples of climate change. 
 The fjord is full of icebergs, calving from the bordering mountains of ice, and cruises to see the ice crack and fall are popular. Among the cruise lines offering Greenland sailings this summer is Hurtigruten (www.hurtigruten.us), which has an eight-day excursion to Disko Bay, departing from Kangerlussuaq, including a visit to the Eqip Sermia glacier. Prices start at $3,673 a person, including airfare from Baltimore.
 A melting Arctic means that its ecosystem will not last forever, and the threatened wildlife is another draw. Polar bears, which have gotten the most attention as victims of global warming, are rarely sighted, but excursions to see whales -- including the narwhal, with its nine-foot unicorn horn -- and musk oxen are usually successful. These animals are not yet endangered, and tourists can enjoy many of them, including seal and reindeer, in the wild during the day and on their plates at night.
 Perhaps the greatest visual evidence of global warming in Greenland is Warming Island, a hand-shaped island off the east coast discovered in 2005 by an American, Dennis Schmitt. In years past, it was connected to the mainland by ice and presumed to be part of the same mass. A California outfit, Betchart Expeditions (www.betchartexpeditions.com), offers a September voyage to visit the island with Mr. Schmitt, a 12-day boat expedition that starts at $5,745 plus airfare. 
 ''It's the visual symbol of climate change,'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''If global warming needed a poster child, here it is.''
 Global warming, of course, is a delicate topic. Mr. Schmitt has been criticized by many because of the emissions such trips generate, and Greenland is careful not to stress climate change too strongly in its marketing. 
 ''We don't want catastrophe tourism, like 'Come see it before it's too late,' '' said Jesper Kunuk Egede, a spokesman for the Greenland Group, which promotes tourism in Greenland. 
 But Mr. Schmitt thinks that's precisely part of the appeal.
 ''People sense the Arctic is going to change,'' he said. ''There is something in human nature that likes to watch things die, a morbid curiosity of human beings. And I think there's a touch of that.'' 
 Other Great Disappearing Acts 
 Greenland is not the only travel destination experiencing the mixed blessings of climate change. Warmer temperatures and melting ice have begun to transform some once-inaccessible places into tourist hot spots, while also threatening the very features that are attracting those visitors. 
 In Montana, Glacier National Park has long been considered a gem of the park system, but scientists estimate that the ice might not last past 2030. Only 27 glaciers of well over 100 remain in the park, and the National Environmental Trust recently held a contest to suggest a name for the park in the event the ice disappears. The winner: Lost Glacier.
 Fly into Kalispell, Mont., and stay at Many Glacier Hotel for its fantastic views (www.nationalparkreservations.com), and be sure to traverse the Going-to-the-Sun Road (weather permitting).
 Over the last couple of years, Alaska has been getting its fair share of visitors seeking out global warming's effects. In Kenai Fjords National Park, the rangers have been given extra training to address the climate-change questions that visitors now regularly ask. The park's aptly named Exit Glacier has signs up showing the glacier's retreat, including 1,000 feet in the last 10 years. Most visitors get to Kenai Fjords as part of an Inside Passage cruise or by car from Anchorage or nearby Seward.
 Svalbard, an archipelago several hundred miles north of Scandinavia and part of Norway, has seen its tourists double in the last 10 years thanks to summers of suddenly passable seas and 24-hour sunshine. Spitsbergen, the most popular island, now has tourism as the second largest piece of its economy after coal mining, and has been called the Tenerife of the North. 
 Discover the World (www.discovertheworld.co.uk) offers 11-day or longer cruises out of Scotland. Norwegian Airlines (www.norwegian.no) has flights from Oslo to Svalbard, reinstated in 2008, with round-trip prices starting at about 200 euros, about $300 at $1.50 to the euro.

HEADLINE: The Republicans Find Their Obama

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
COULD 2008 actually end up being a showdown between the author of ''The Audacity of Hope'' and the new Man from Hope, Ark.? 
 It sounds preposterous, but Washington's shock over Mike Huckabee's sudden rise in the polls -- he ''came from nowhere,'' Robert Novak huffed last week -- makes you wonder. Having failed to anticipate so much else, including the Barack Obama polling surge of days earlier, the press pack has proved an unreliable guide to election 2008. What the Beltway calls unthinkable today keeps turning out to be front-page news tomorrow. 
 The prevailing Huckabee narrative maintains that he's benefiting strictly from the loyalty of the religious right. Evangelical Christians are belatedly rallying around one of their own, a Baptist preacher, rather than settling for a Mormon who until recently supported abortion rights or a thrice-married New Yorker who still does. But that doesn't explain Mr. Huckabee's abrupt ascent to first place in some polling nationwide, where Christian conservatives account for a far smaller slice of the Republican pie than in Iowa. Indeed, this theory doesn't entirely explain Mr. Huckabee's steep rise in Iowa, where Mitt Romney has outspent him 20 to 1, a financial advantage that Mr. Romney leveraged to crush him in the state's straw poll just four months ago. 
 What really may be going on here is a mirror image of the phenomenon that has upended Hillary Clinton's ''inevitability'' among Democrats. Like Senator Obama, Mr. Huckabee is the youngest in his party's field. (At 52, he's also younger than every Democratic contender except Mr. Obama, who is 46.) Both men have a history of speaking across party and racial lines. Both men possess that rarest of commodities in American public life: wit. Most important, both men aspire (not always successfully) to avoid the hyper-partisanship of the Clinton-Bush era. 
 Though their views on issues are often antithetical, Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Obama may be united in catching the wave of an emerging zeitgeist that is larger than either party's ideology. An exhausted and disillusioned public may be ready for a replay of the New Frontier pitch of 1960. That pitch won't come from Mr. Romney, a glib salesman who seems a dead ringer for Don Draper, a Madison Avenue ad man of no known core convictions who works on the Nixon campaign in the TV series, ''Mad Men.'' Mr. Romney's effort to channel J.F.K. last week, in which he mentioned the word Mormon exactly once, was hardly a profile in courage.
 The fact to remember about Mr. Huckabee's polling spike is that it occurred just after the G.O.P. YouTube debate on CNN, where Mr. Romney and Rudy Giuliani vied to spray the most spittle at illegal immigrants. Congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado, the fringe candidate whose most recent ads accuse the invading hordes of ''pushing drugs, raping kids, destroying lives,'' accurately accused his opponents of trying to ''out-Tancredo Tancredo.'' 
 Next to this mean-spiritedness, Mr. Huckabee's tone leapt off the screen. Attacked by Mr. Romney for supporting an Arkansas program aiding the children of illegal immigrants, he replied, ''In all due respect, we're a better country than to punish children for what their parents did.'' It was a winning moment, politically as well as morally. And a no-brainer at that. Given that Mr. Tancredo polls at 4 percent among Iowan Republicans and zero nationally, it's hard to see why Rudy-Romney thought it was smart to try to out-Tancredo Tancredo. 
 Mr. Huckabee's humane stand wasn't an election-year flip-flop. As governor, he decried a bill denying health services to illegal immigrants as ''race-baiting'' even though its legislator sponsor was a fellow Baptist preacher. Mr. Huckabee's record on race in general (and in attracting African-American votes) is dramatically at odds with much of his party. Only last year Republicans brought us both ''macaca'' and a television ad portraying the black Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, Harold Ford Jr., as a potential despoiler of white women.
 Unlike Rudy-Romney, Mr. Huckabee showed up for the PBS presidential debate held at the historically black Morgan State University in September. Afterward, he met Cornel West, an Obama supporter who deeply disagrees with Mr. Huckabee about abortion and much else. I asked Dr. West for his take last week. After effusively praising Mr. Huckabee as unique among the G.O.P. contenders, Dr. West said: ''I told him, 'You are for real.' Black voters in Arkansas aren't stupid. They know he's sincere about fighting racism and poverty.''
 Though Mr. Romney's hastily scheduled speech last week has been greeted by Washington as an essential antidote to the religious bigotry that's supposedly doing him in, this entire issue may be a red herring. Mr. Romney's Mormonism has hardly been a secret until now, and Mr. Huckabee's eagerness to milk his status as a certified ''Christian leader'' has been equally transparent from the campaign's start. Was there really a rising tide of anti-Mormon sentiment in Iowa over the past month, or is Mr. Romney just playing victim?
 The real reason for Mr. Huckabee's ascendance may be that his message is simply more uplifting -- and, in the ethical rather than theological sense, more Christian -- than that of rivals whose main calling cards of fear, torture and nativism have become more strident with every debate. The fresh-faced politics of joy may be trumping the five-o'clock-shadow of Nixonian gloom and paranoia favored by the entire G.O.P. field with the sometime exception of John McCain. 
 On the same day of Mr. Romney's speech, twonew polls found Mr. Huckabee with a substantial lead over him and Mr. Giuliani in South Carolina, a stunning reversal from a month ago. Don't be surprised if a desperate Mitt, who has ''accidentally'' referred to Mr. Obama as ''Osama,'' does desperate things. South Carolina's 2000 Republican primary was a jamboree of race-baiting that included a whispering campaign branding Senator McCain as the father of an illegitimate black child. The local political operative who worked for George W. Bush in that race and engineered the infamous Bush visit to Bob Jones University is now in Mr. Romney's employ.
 Mr. Huckabee may well be doomed in the long term. He has little money or organization. He's so ignorant of foreign affairs that he hadn't heard of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran a day after its release. His sometimes wacky economic populism riles his party's most important constituency, Wall Street. And who knows how many other Arkansas scandals will be disinterred along with the paroled serial rapist who popped out last week? That Mr. Huckabee has gotten as far as he has shows just how in sync his benign style is with the cultural moment. 
 To understand why he can't be completely dismissed, consider last month's Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll. Peter Hart, the Democratic half of the bipartisan team that conducts the survey, told me in an interview last week that an overwhelming majority of voters of both parties not only want change but also regard ''reducing the partisan fighting in government'' as high on their agenda. To his surprise, Mr. Hart found that there's even a majority (59 percent) seeking a president who would help America in ''regaining respect around the world.'' 
 This climate, of course, favors the Democrats, especially if the Republicans choose a candidate who brands them as the party of rage and fear -- and even more especially if their Tancredo-ism drives a large Hispanic turnout for the national Democratic ticket inFlorida, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. But a Democratic victory is not guaranteed. The huge spread in the Journal-NBC poll between an unnamed Democrat and Republican in the presidential race -- 50 to 35 percent -- shrank to a 1 percent lead when Mrs. Clinton was pitted against Mr. Giuliani.
 Mr. Obama's campaign, though hardly the long shot of Mr. Huckabee's, could also fall short. But the Clinton camp's panic over his rise in the Iowa polls shows that he's on the right tactical track. The more polarizing and negative a candidate turns in style, the more that candidate risks playing Nixon to Mr. Obama's Kennedy. That Mrs. Clinton's minions would attack Mr. Obama for unseemly ambition because he wrote a kindergarten report called ''I Want to Become President'' -- and then snidely belittle the press for falling for ''a joke'' once this gambit backfired -- is Rudy-Romneyesque in its vituperative folly.
 Experience, like nastiness, may also prove a dead end in the year ahead. In 1960, the experience card was played by all comers against the young upstart senator from Massachusetts. In Iowa, L.B.J. went so far as to tell voters that they should vote for ''a man with a little gray in his hair.'' But experience, Kennedy would memorably counter, ''is like taillights on a boat which illuminate where we have been when we should be focusing on where we should be going.'' 
 The most experienced candidate in 2008 is not Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Giuliani or Mr. Romney in any case. It's Mr. McCain, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd and Bill Richardson who have the longest resumes. Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Obama, meanwhile, are both betting that this is another crossroads, like 1960, when Americans are hungry for a leader who will refocus the nation on the path ahead.

HEADLINE: A Break on 'Jumbo Loans'

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
PROSPECTIVE borrowers in the New York area who are likely to be in the market for a mortgage that is close to the ''jumbo loan'' category have received a break from Washington. 
 Late last month, the federal government held steady at $417,000 the so-called conforming loan limit -- the line above which mortgages become jumbo loans, and typically carry higher rates. 
 The limit, which is annually adjusted, usually moves in lock step with average home prices across the country, at least when prices are rising. There was some speculation earlier this year that the government could drop the conforming loan limit because house prices have been dropping.
 The national average home price in October, for instance, was $295,573. That was $10,685 lower than a year earlier -- a 3.5 percent drop. 
 While not falling quite as sharply, parts of the New York area have registered declines. For instance, the median sale price of a home in Nassau and Suffolk Counties was 1.4 percent lower in the third quarter of this year than in the second quarter, according to a report late last month by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. 
 But some towns have fared far worse. According to First American LoanPerformance, a San Francisco-based mortgage industry consultancy, home prices on Centerport in Suffolk County were 8.6 percent lower in September 2007 than a year earlier.
 Thanks to those drops -- and the fact that the conforming loan limit was held steady -- home buyers have somewhat better odds of seeking mortgages that are below the jumbo loan threshold. Jumbo loans typically carry interest rates about one percentage point higher than conventional loans.
 Late last month, for instance, borrowers could find a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 5.875 percent on a loan of $417,000. For a jumbo loan of $418,000 from the same lender, the rate would rise to 7 percent, said Marc Schwaber, president of Preferred Empire Mortgage, a Manhattan-based brokerage. The monthly principal and interest payment for the jumbo loan would be $2,780.96, compared with $2,466.71 for the conventional loan. Over five years, the jumbo loan would cost $18,855 more.
 ''Because of the drop in housing prices,'' Mr. Schwaber said, ''many more people are going to qualify for less expensive conventional loans.'' 
 Mr. Schwaber says borrowers who seek conventional mortgages also have an easier time qualifying for a loan because federal law requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy conventional loans from lenders. Knowing there is a secondary market for their loans, lenders can offer more generous terms.
 Practically speaking, Mr. Schwaber said, borrowers with good credit can often qualify for a conventional loan with a down payment of 5 percent, and borrow extra money to cover two months of principal, interest, taxes and insurance. Borrowers seeking jumbo loans must typically offer significantly higher down payments, and have reserves to cover several months of principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
 Borrowers in the tristate area suffer under the yoke of jumbo loans far more than those in many other states, said First American LoanPerformance.
 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were among the six states with the highest percentages of jumbo loans. New York was the highest in the area, at 9.6 percent. California led the nation, with more than 25 percent of its mortgages in the jumbo category.

HEADLINE: OIL-RICH NATIONS USE MORE ENERY, CUTTING EXPORTS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Reporting was contributed by Wayne Arnold from Singapore; Nazila Fathi from Tehran; Jens Erik Gould from Caracas, Venezuela; Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow; Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City; and Jad Mouawad from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

 BODY:
The economies of many big oil-exporting countries are growing so fast that their need for energy within their borders is crimping how much they can sell abroad, adding new strains to the global oil market.
 Experts say the sharp growth, if it continues, means several of the world's most important suppliers may need to start importing oil within a decade to power all the new cars, houses and businesses they are buying and creating with their oil wealth.
Indonesia has already made this flip. By some projections, the same thing could happen within five years to Mexico, the No. 2 source of foreign oil for the United States, and soon after that to Iran, the world's fourth-largest exporter. In some cases, the governments of these countries subsidize gasoline heavily for their citizens, selling it for as little as 7 cents a gallon, a practice that industry experts say fosters wasteful habits.
 ''It is a very serious threat that a lot of major exporters that we count on today for international oil supply are no longer going to be net exporters any more in 5 to 10 years,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil analyst at Rice University. 
 Rising internal demand may offset 40 percent of the increase in Saudi oil production between now and 2010, while more than half the projected decline in Iranian exports will be caused by internal consumption, said a recent report by CIBC World Markets.
 The report said ''soaring internal rates of oil consumption'' in Russia, in Mexico and in member states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce crude exports as much as 2.5 million barrels a day by the end of the decade.
 That is about 3 percent of global oil demand. It may not sound high, but experts say demand for oil is so inflexible, and the world has so little spare production capacity, that even small shortfalls can raise prices. In 2002, when a labor strike in Venezuela took 3 percent of global production off line, oil prices spiked 26 percent within weeks.
 The trend, though increasingly important, does not necessarily mean there will be oil shortages. More likely, experts say, it will mean big market shifts, with the number of exporting countries shrinking and unconventional sources like Canadian tar sands becoming more important, especially for the United States. And there is likely to be more pressure to open areas now closed to oil production.
 Greater political stability and increased drilling in some important oil states, notably Iraq, Iran and Venezuela, could help offset the rising demand from other oil exporters.
 ''Ten years from now, world capacity to produce oil could be 20 percent higher than today,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''But a lot will depend on how the geopolitics work out.''
 Growth in demand among oil exporters is one aspect of a larger issue, breakneck economic growth in parts of the developing world. China and India are expected to account for much of the increase in global oil demand in the next 20 years. But Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency in Paris, rated consumption growth among oil exporters as the second-biggest threat to meeting the world's oil needs.
 ''It's a big problem, and growing all the time,'' Mr. Birol said.
 Internal oil consumption by the five biggest oil exporters -- Saudi Arabia, Russia, Norway, Iran and the United Arab Emirates -- grew 5.9 percent in 2006 over 2005, according to government data. Exports declined more than 3 percent. By contrast, oil demand is essentially flat in the United States.
 CIBC's demand projections suggest that for many oil countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya, internal oil demand will double in a decade.
 Factors contributing to the trend include increased industrialization, higher government spending and increasing personal consumption. According to a World Bank report, economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa has doubled since the 1990s, and Russia has done even better.
 Oil money is giving many countries the means to invest in their own economic development, and robust global growth is creating markets for their goods -- including plastics, chemicals and fuels refined from oil.
 To be sure, many oil-exporting states have a long way to go before they achieve Western living standards. The global oil market is still dominated by traditional consumers, particularly the United States, which uses nearly a quarter of the world's oil.
 Perhaps surprisingly, though, some producing countries have surpassed the United States in oil consumption per person. They include Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
 Particularly in oil-producing countries with large populations, like Indonesia, Russia and Mexico, a rapid rise in car ownership is a big factor driving consumption increases. Russian farmers are replacing horses and carts with gas-guzzling four-wheel-drive vehicles, while urban consumers are snapping up BMWs even before they learn to drive.
 ''Most of the producing countries have young populations entering the driving age and can more readily afford to buy cars because the price of fuel is low,'' said Charles McPherson, an oil expert at the International Monetary Fund. ''It's certainly pulling product off the international markets.''
 Some oil-exporting countries use price controls and subsidies to ensure cheap fuel for their people. These programs are politically popular, even though experts say they contribute to wasteful energy use.
 Kuwaitis, for instance, often leave their air conditioning -- powered by electricity generated from natural gas or oil-derived fuels -- running for weeks while on vacation, said an official at the World Bank. Sportsmen of the United Arab Emirates ski indoors on manufactured snow and play golf on lush courses that require desalinated water produced with fuels refined from oil.
 Saudis, Iranians and Iraqis pay 30 to 50 cents a gallon for gasoline. Venezuelans pay 7 cents, and demand is projected to rise as much as 10 percent this year. Auto sales have tripled in four years. ''Where cheap oil is viewed as a national human right, you've virtually got runaway demand,'' said Chris B. Newton, an executive of the Indonesian Petroleum Association in Jakarta.
 Indonesia flipped from exporting oil to importing it three years ago because of sagging production in depleted fields and rising demand. Iran, Algeria and Malaysia are vulnerable in the next decade. Most oil experts view Mexico as the next country likely to flip, in as little as five years.
 Rapidly falling production in Mexico's aging Cantarell oil field is part of the problem. Also significant, though, is the rising number of cars on Mexican roads. They have nearly doubled, to almost 16 million, in the last decade, and gasoline consumption is growing 5 percent a year.
 In Mexico City the other day, a bricklayer named Jaime Guerrero arrived at a local Chevrolet dealership. His extended family cried ''bravo!'' as he signed the papers for his first car.
 ''To have a new car in my name is a dream transformed into reality,'' said Mr. Guerrero, 26. He and his family piled in and weaved through the chaotic traffic of the capital, hunting for a priest to douse the car with holy water.
 ''I don't worry about the climate or shortages of oil in the world,'' Mr. Guerrero said. ''I just worry if gasoline prices go up.''

BYLINE: Compiled by DENNY LEE

 BODY:
1 LAOS
 Vietnam and Cambodia are so 2007. Now, Laos is shaping up to be Indochina's next hot spot. Ancient sites like the Wat Phou temple complex and the capital city of Vientiane are drawing culture seekers. Luxury teak houseboats are cruising down the Mekong. And global nomads are heading to Luang Prabang to sample the Laotian tasting menu at 3 Nagas (www.3nagas.com) or hang out by the infinity pool at the seriously upscale Residence Phou Vao (www.residencephouvao.com).
2 LISBON
 Bargain-seeking tourists have long flocked to Lisbon, typically among the most affordable of European cities. But now the Portuguese capital is also emerging as a cultural force. The new Berardo Collection Museum (www.berardocollection.com), in the historic Belem district, boasts a major trove of modern and contemporary art. Designer hotels like Fontana Park (www.fontanaparkhotel.com) and Jeronimos 8 (www.almeidahotels.com) are attracting style-savvy travelers. And the Design and Fashion Museum, scheduled to open in late 2008, will go a long way toward cementing the city's avant-garde status. 
 3 TUNISIA
 Tunisia is undergoing a Morocco-like luxury makeover. A new wave of stylish boutique hotels, often in historic town houses, has cropped up alongside this North African country's white-sand beaches and age-old medinas, drawing increasing numbers of well-heeled travelers. The Villa Didon (www.villadidon.com) in Carthage, for one, has a restaurant originally run by Alain Ducasse. Indeed, TripAdvisor ranks Jerba, a resort island off Tunisia's southern coast, as the No. 1 emerging spot in 2008.
 4. MAURITIUS
 Flying to the sugar-white shores of Mauritius is about to get easier. Virgin Atlantic just began nonstop flights from London to this tiny coral-ringed island off the coast of Madagascar, and it also recently became a hub port for Indian Ocean excursions by the Italy-based Costa Cruises. Meanwhile, new hotels are opening up, including a Four Seasons resort, Anahita Mauritius (www.anahitamauritius.com), that features four restaurants, three beaches and an ayurveda spa.
 5. MID-BEACH, MIAMI
 Move over South Beach. The iconic Eden Roc Resort (www.edenrocresort.com) and Fontainebleau Miami Beach (www.fontainebleau.com) -- faded glitterati hangouts designed by Morris Lapidus -- will reopen in 2008 after multimillion-dollar renovations, returning Mid-Beach to its former glory. Future neighbors include Gansevoort South, a W Hotel and a Mid-Beach outpost of the members-only Soho House. 
 6. SOUTH BEACH, MIAMI
 Not to be outdone, South Beach will also welcome a red carpet of designer hotels: the Angler's Boutique Resort (www.theanglersresort.com) by Gianni Versace's former decorator Wallace Tutt; the Tides South Beach (www.tidessouthbeach.com), revamped by the design star Kelly Wearstler; and the Mondrian South Beach (www.mondriansouthbeach.com) by the Dutch design superstar Marcel Wanders. Meanwhile, Nicky Hilton's much-hyped dreams of running a hotel has ended up in bankruptcy court -- and the auction block. 
 7. MALDIVES
 The 2004 tsunami, a fragile ecology and a recent bombing have done little to dampen a hotel boom in this island-nation of about 1,192 coral islets in the Indian Ocean. Among the high-end hotels expected to open next year is a Regent Hotels & Resorts (www.regenthotels.com) with 50 villas, many set over the water, allowing guests to observe the rich marine life while still lying in bed. 
 8. DEATH VALLEY
 It's too early to predict, but recent heavy rains have some flower bloggers already speculating about a dazzling spring bloom in Death Valley next year. Death Valley is home to more than 1,000 species of wildflower, and in that special spring after a wet fall and winter, the brown desert landscape is carpeted with Technicolor fields of blossoms. 
 9. COURCHEVEL
 The ultra-exclusive French skiing village of Courchevel may be overrun by Russian billionaires these days, but that has only fueled the resort's consumption of Cristal jeroboams and high-ticket hotels. The sumptuous Hotel de Charme Les Airelles (www.airelles.fr) reopens this month following a $31 million renovation, and, late next year, Le Padisha ups the ante with rustic-chic apartments starting at 1.3 million euros, or $1.95 million at $1.50 to the euro.
 10. LIBYA
 It's on and off (and on again) for Libya. Four years after the United States government lifted a ban on American travel, this socialist North African nation is going green. The eldest son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the leader of Libya, is developing a carbon-neutral resort along the country's pristine Mediterranean coastline, home to stellar Greek and Roman ruins and endangered seals. Luxury hotels and golf courses are planned, as well as a new airport in Tripoli. But red tape remains. Tour operators have canceled trips because of visa holdups, and last month planeloads of European tourists were turned away under an odd rule that requires foreign passports to be translated into Arabic. 
 11. HVAR
 As Croatia's Dalmatian Coast has become a new Riviera, Hvar has become its St.-Tropez: a tiny village that fills with yachts and international partyers over the summer. While the waterfront Carpe Diem (www.carpe-diem-hvar.com) remains the island's night-life center, narrow stone alleys are lined with chic cocktail lounges and hotel terraces, including the rooftop pool at the new Adriana hotel, Croatia's first Leading Small Hotels of the World member (www.suncanihvar.com/adriana).
 12. PUERTO VALLARTA
 Maybe it is the lasting memory of the gay icon Elizabeth Taylor's scandalous affair with Richard Burton during his filming of ''Night of the Iguana'' in the early 60's, but Puerto Vallarta is becoming gayer by the year and is now poised to overtake Acapulco as Mexico's leading gay beach. There are now some dozen gay-friendly hotels (www.gayguidevallarta.com/Lodging/gay.html) and a glut of bars and clubs clustered along the aptly named Zona Romantica. 
 13. SYLT
 With a nickname like the ''Hamptons of Germany,'' it's only a matter of time before jet-setters discover the North Sea island of Sylt. Known for its nudist beaches, reed-thatched houses and designer stores, the T-shaped island has long been popular with German celebrities, particularly television stars and sports figures. But now getting there is a simple hop from London and a dozen other European cities, thanks to the low-cost carrier Air Berlin.
 14. PRAGUE
 The verdict is in. The Next Prague is ... Prague. Stag parties have moved on, bohemians have left for cheaper rents, and youth hostels are being squeezed by luxe hotels. Joining a new Mandarin Oriental next year is the Augustine, converted from a monastery and other buildings into a Rocco Forte hotel (prague.roccofortecollection.com), and the just-refurbished Hilton Prague Old Town (www.prague-oldtown.hilton.com), with a buzzing restaurant opened by Gordon Ramsay. 
 15. QUITO
 If you've been to Quito, Ecuador, there's a good chance you were heading to the Galapagos. But Quito, the colonial capital perched 9,200 feet up in the Andes, is no longer just a whistle stop. The city's crumbling historic center, one of Latin America's least altered, has been reborn after a seven-year, $200 million renovation. And a crop of upscale hotels has arrived, including a JW Marriott (www.marriott.com), making Quito a glorious new center in the so-called Middle of the World. 
 16. LIVERPOOL
 There's more to Liverpool than just the Beatles. Next year, this industrial city celebrates its 800th birthday (and its designation as European Capital of Culture), as it trots out everything and everyone, from Turner Prize artists to young emerging bands like the Zutons. But make no mistake: The headliner is Paul McCartney, who is returning to play the ''Liverpool Sound'' concert at Anfield Stadium on June 1 (www.liverpool08.com). 
 17. MUNICH
 Wi-Fi beer gardens, lederhosen-wearing hipsters, hybrid Mercedes-Benz taxis. No wonder Monocle magazine recently named Munich the world's most livable city. The Bavarian capital might get shortchanged when compared with Berlin in terms of liberalism and creativity, but Munich has a robust economy that stimulates high fashion, cutting-edge cuisine and cushy living -- not to mention a new Jewish Museum (www.juedisches-museum.muenchen.de), 79 years in the making, and a posh new hotel in the heart of the city, the Charles, from hotelier Rocco Forte (www.charleshotel.de).
 18. IRAN
 What Axis of Evil? Upscale tour operators are tiptoeing into Iran next year, offering trips that explore the ancient country's Persian treasures and olive-green desert plains. Next spring, the luxury cruise liner Silversea will make stops in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas on its Dubai to Dubai cruise. And California-based Distant Horizons (www.distant-horizons.com) is organizing two 18-day trips that start in Tehran and then weave through the once-forbidden countryside, including stops in Shiraz and Isfahan. Prices start at $5,390 per person.
 19. TUSCANY
 All those rolling fields of green. The cypress-lined fairways. It's surprising that there aren't more golf links in Tuscany. For better or worse, a new course has just opened for guests at the Terme di Saturnia resort (www.termedisaturnia.it ) in southern Tuscany. The nine-hole course covers 247 acres surrounded by wheat, sunflowers, oats and olive groves -- that is, until the next nine holes go in. 
 20. ANGUILLA
 Just when you thought the Caribbean island of Anguilla couldn't get any fancier, the Kor Hotel Group is opening the Viceroy Anguilla -- the latest offshoot of its Viceroy brand (www.viceroyanguilla.com) -- in the spring. The hotel will have 172 luxury accommodations, a 15,000-square-foot spa and beach clubs set along 3,200 feet of private waterfront. 
 21. BOGOTA
 Bogota might be remembered for its death squads and gang violence, but this Colombian megalopolis -- the fourth-largest city in South America -- is cleaning up its act and drawing tourists with its cultural diversity and colonial charms. A new Hilton hotel is being built, and three U.S.-based airlines -- JetBlue, US Airways and Spirit Airlines -- recently applied for the chance to offer direct flights into Bogota. 
 22. PLAYA BLANCA, PANAMA
 Playa Blanca is about to hit the tabloids. Nikki Beach, the tres chic beach club in South Beach and St.-Tropez, is opening a gated resort in the once-quiet fishing village on the Pacific coast of Panama (www.nikkibeachpanama.com). The developers are already calling it the ''sexiest project in Panama.'' Less fabulous families need not worry. Superclubs (www.superclubs.com), the all-inclusive resort, is also dipping its toes into Playa Blanca with the 300-room Breezes Panama, scheduled to open in 2009.
 23. ALEXANDRIA
 The former home of Cleopatra is rising. Alexandria was among the ancient world's greatest cities, but it had fallen into oblivion. Now a string of new monuments is bringing the so-called Pearl of the Mediterranean back. A gleaming $200 million library, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (www.bibalex.org), resurrects the ancient library in steel and glass. A new Four Seasons (www.fourseasons.com/alexandria) stands in the stately Stan Stefano plaza. And throughout town, the city pulses with new shops and upscale cafes.
 24. MAZATLAN
 A faded spring-break haven on Mexico's Pacific coast, Mazatlan has been drawing American retirees and second-home buyers to its less-crowded beaches and cheap real estate. Few tourists show up, partly because there are few hotels. That's changing. A half-dozen resorts are now in the works, including Diamond Beach, a $1.2 billion development with high-rise hotels, a golf course and condominiums.
 25. ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia's upscale progress marches on. After the arrival of eco-hedonistic resorts like Jade Mountain and Discovery at Marigot Bay (which just launched a solar-powered ferry), big-name resorts with $1,000 rooms are on the way. Scheduled to open next year are the Residences at Ritz-Carlton (www.theresidencesstlucia.com), the Westin's Le Paradis (www.leparadisstlucia.com) and the RockResorts' the Landings St. Lucia (www.thelandingsstlucia.com). There's even a private jet terminal in the works. 
 26. OSLO
 In addition to being one of the world's most expensive cities , Oslo is burnishing its reputation as a design and architecture center. Next April, the futuristic National Opera House (www.operaen.no) will open at the head of the Oslofjord, sheathed in white marble. It will be joined by two new design hotels: Thon Hotel Gyldenlove (www.thonhotels.com ) and Grims Grenka Hotel (www.grimsgrenka.no). 
 27. BUENOS AIRES
 Marketed as the first five-star gay hotel in Latin America (but also ''heterofriendly''), the new Axel Hotel Buenos Aires (www.axelhotels.com) confirmed what many gay travelers already knew: the Argentine capital is becoming South America's next party capital. Situated in the bohemian-chic neighborhood of San Telmo, the 48-room hotel features Eames furnishings, a gymnasium and a poolside bar. 
 28. RIMINI, ITALY
 Rimini's nine-mile stretch of sand along the Adriatic Coast once attracted holiday crowds. But the birthplace of Fellini has been reborn as Italy's bling party capital, drawing style-conscious Romans to its raging club scene, cool boites and designer hotels, most notably the new DuoMo hotel (www.duomohotel.com) designed by Ron Arad. 
 29. MALAWI
 Blame Madonna. Safarigoers tended to overlook Malawi, but that has changed since she began her effort to adopt a 1-year-old boy from this tiny African country that lies within the Great Rift Valley. Next July, the luxury lodge Pumulani (www.pumulani.com) is set to open 10 villas on spectacular Lake Malawi, home to rare cichlids and pied kingfishers. 
 30. ROATAN
 The sleepy Honduran island of Roatan, known for scuba diving and fishing, is waking up with big plans, with both Royal Caribbean and Carnival building new cruise terminals there, and the Westin Resort & Spa Roatan scheduled to open in mid-2008. 
 31. MOZAMBIQUE
 Since gaining independence in 1975, Mozambique has moved from a war-torn society to one of Africa's economic success stories. Now its 1,500 miles of pristine coastline is being fashioned into a ''fair trade'' tourist destination. High-end lodges with low-environmental impact are being built along the Bazaruto Archipelago, home to endangered sea cows, staghorn coral and mangrove forests. Farther north, the Guludo Beach Lodge (www.guludo.com) offers nine luxurious tented bandas along the beach, with proceeds going back to the local village.
 32. KUWAIT CITY
 Yes, there's a war next door. But that's not preventing Kuwait City, a bustling metropolis on the Persian Gulf, from welcoming new air service (direct United flights from Dulles Airport near Washington start this month), playing host to international boat shows, or opening a slate of opulent hotels. The most talked-about is the Hotel Missoni, the first of several for the fashion house. Designed by the Italian architect Matteo Thun, it is to open next year.
 33. VERBIER
 The Swiss ski village of Verbier will get decidedly more upper class when the Lodge (www.thelodge.virgin.com), the newest addition to Richard Branson's globe-trotting playgrounds, opens at the Alpine resort next month. The nine-bedroom chalet features a mini-ice rink, indoor pool and 24-hour driver -- all for as little as $:35,250 a week, well over $70,000. 
 34. LOMBOK
 Lombok, a low-key Indonesian island east of Bali, is coming out of the shadows. With Bali oversaturated with villas and designer restaurants, tourists are hopping on short flights to find less-crowded beaches, a bigger volcano and better surfing. It's also cheaper -- not that visitors are slumming it. There's already an Oberoi (www.oberoilombok.com), and other high-end hotels are on the way. 
 35. NORTHWEST PASSAGE
 Notwithstanding last month's sinking of an Antarctic cruise ship, climate tourism is heating up. And few places are warming up faster than the Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route over Canada. Adventure Life Voyages (www.alvoyages.com), for one, is already booking cruises for its Northwest Passage tour next August, with prices from $4,600 a person. 
 36. EASTER ISLAND
 Remote Easter Island, famous for its enigmatic Moai statues, is getting its first luxury resort: Explora en Rapa Nui (www.explora.com). The 30-room resort combines futuristic pod-like design with natural materials like native volcanic rock and Chilean rauli wood, and offers seamless views of the middle of the Pacific Ocean. A three-night stay for two people starts at $3,588. 
 37. VIRGIN GORDA
 Virgin Gorda, one of the lesser-known British Virgin Islands, is raising its profile. The Aquamare (www.villaaquamare.com) is set to open in March with three villas measuring 8,000 square feet, with in-villa spa treatments, observation decks and weekly rates starting at $12,500. 
 38. NAMIBIA
 In the 17 years since Namibia gained independence from South Africa, this desert country on the West African coast carved out an early eco-tourist niche, with government-run campsites like Namutoni (www.nwr.com.na) in the Etosha National Park. Now the country is going eco-deluxe. (Might it have something to do with Brangelina?) Many lodges have just been refurbished with stylish decor and matching rates. And the private sector is following suit; Kempinski Hotels is planning five luxury hotels to open in the next few years. 
 39. SAN FRANCISCO
 When the California Academy of Sciences (www.calacademy.org) opens next fall in Golden Gate Park, it won't just be a stunning architectural addition to San Francisco. The $500 million building, designed by the Pritzker Prize winner Renzo Piano, will feature a 2.5-acre living roof covered with native plants and aims to be the greenest museum in the world.
 40. DETROIT
 Historically crime-ridden Detroit may not spring to mind as a hot tourist spot, but don't tell that to the city's bullish hoteliers. Newcomers include the MGM Grand Detroit (www.mgmgranddetroit.com), the MotorCity Casino Hotel (www.motorcitycasino.com) in an old Wonder Bread factory and the historic Book Cadillac Hotel, being transformed into a Westin (www.westinbookcadillac.com). Plus, the Detroit Institute of Arts (www.dia.org) just reopened after a $158 million renovation. 
 41. ITACARE, BRAZIL
 It ended up on several ''it'' lists before a single guest arrived. But the Warapuru (www.warapuru.com), a lavish eco-resort, is expected to finally open next year. Designed by the London-based Anouska Hempel, the resort has brought attention to Itacare, an under-the-radar beach town on Brazil's north coast that draws celebrities and the elite of Rio de Janeiro. 
 42. KILIMANJARO
 Time may be running out to see the most famous snows of American literature. The ice-capped peak of Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is melting at an alarming rate. Within several decades, scientists predict, the glaciers will have completely disappeared. Expect more adventure seekers to tackle the climb next year: One outfitter, International Mountain Guides (www.mountainguides.com), has seven trips scheduled for 2008. (Prices run $4,975 for the full two-week itinerary and $3,600 for the climb-only portion.) 
 43. ALGERIA
 A nearly decade-long civil war made Algeria off limits to travelers. Now that the war has subsided (though a United States travel warning, citing terrorist attacks, remains) travelers are trickling back to this ancient land of oasis towns and cart-wide streets. Lonely Planet just published its first guide to Algeria. And tour organizers like Row International (www.rowinternational.com) are taking adventure seekers through the meandering alleyways of the Casbah and on camelback into the Sahara. 
 44. SAN DIEGO
 Wildfires this fall didn't prevent the opening of the much-anticipated Hard Rock Hotel San Diego (www.hardrockhotelsd.com), a 420-room resort in the trendy Gaslamp quarter. The 12-story hotel includes a Nobu restaurant, two Rande Gerber bars, a spa and a Pinkberry frozen yogurt shop -- all under one roof. Greasing the wheels is Virgin America, which is starting service between San Diego and San Francisco in February. 
 45. MALAGA
 The southern coast of Spain is not just about high-rise hotels and water-gulping golf courses. Next June, Delta Air Lines plans to inaugurate nonstop service to the Andalusian port city of Malaga -- a major cultural center, with its impressive array of museums and monuments, including an 11th-century Moorish fortress. Delta will fly from Kennedy Airport to Malaga's international airport, named after the city's favorite son Pablo Picasso. 
 46. PUERTO PLATA
 Puerto Plata, the rowdy beach resort on the Dominican Republic's north coast, is about to get rowdier. Maxim, the racy men's magazine, is opening a 108-bungalow resort on Cofresi Beach, near the Las Vegas-style Ocean World Marina and Casino. Expect the drinking to start onboard JetBlue, which is offering nonstop flights between Kennedy Airport and Puerto Plata next month. 
 47. LONDON
 King's Cross in London was once on the wrong side of tracks. But the district's fortunes are changing, thanks to the trans-Chunnel Eurostar, which moved its terminal last month from Waterloo to the reconstructed St. Pancras station. A Gagosian Gallery is there, along with cool bars and supertrendy restaurants like Acorn House (www.acornhouserestaurant.com), which has local foodies in a tizzy. Next up? A Renaissance Hotel with a ballroom. 
 48. VIETNAM
 Three decades after the fall of Saigon, the city (now known as Ho Chi Minh City) has become an unlikely stop on the global golf circuit. In the past decade, old courses like the Dalat Palace Golf Club have been spruced up, and newer ones, like the Ocean Dunes Golf Club in nearby Phan Thiet, on the South China Sea, and designed by Nick Faldo, have raised the bar. Still to come: the Montgomerie Links, just off China Beach, and the first Vietnam course designed by Colin Montgomerie.
 49. ESSAOUIRA
 As Marrakesh gets more touristy, well-heeled Europeans are heading to the Moroccan port city of Essaouira, not only to trek through its ancient streets and windsurf on its beaches, but also to party. The Gnaoua and World Music Festival (www.festival-gnaoua.net), held every June for the past 10 years, now draws 250,000 fans for five days of music, art and budding friendships -- a kind of Burning Man of Morocco. 
 50. LAS VEGAS
 In case you missed those big gold letters, Donald T-R-U-M-P is coming to the Las Vegas Strip. The 64-story, 1,282-room Trump International Hotel and Towers Las Vegas (www.trumplv.com) is opening next spring, becoming, its Web site promises, the ''most striking building on the Las Vegas Skyline.'' If you're merely looking for ''unparalleled luxury, sophistication, and contemporary chic,'' then head to the new Palazzo Las Vegas ( www.palazzolasvegas.com), a 3,000-room sister to the Venetian, with restaurants by Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse and Charlie Trotter, as well as a Barneys New York. 
 51. BAROSSA VALLEY, AUSTRALIA
 The world's love affair with shiraz is bringing wine spectators to Australia's Barossa Valley. The hilly region is home to some of the world's oldest shiraz vines, some dating back to the 1840s. And if the more than 60 wineries aren't enough, Barossa also offers an artisanal cheese trail, and nearby Adelaide is a foodie destination in its own right.
 52. TOKAJ, HUNGARY
 Backpacking wine tours? The Hungarian wine region of Tokaj is regaining its reputation for quality whites, especially wheat-colored dessert wines made from furmint grapes. The region's winemaking was reborn after the fall of Communism. The Grof Degenfeld, housed in an old castle, even has a plush hotel that offers two-day packages starting at 191 euros, or $283 at $1.50 to the euro (www.hotelgrofdegenfeld.hu). 
 53. NEW YORK
 The lights are back on Broadway. And the strike settlement couldn't have come soon enough for several well-publicized productions scheduled to open before the May 7 deadline for the 2007-08 Tony Awards. Among the more highly awaited shows are three revivals: A 40th-anniversary production of ''The Homecoming,'' Harold Pinter's play about a dysfunctional family (as if there were any other kind), starring Ian McShane; ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' the William Inge chestnut, featuring the Emmy Award-winning actress S. Epatha Merkerson; and an inventive take on ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' Stephen Sondheim's Pulitzer Prize winner, which comes to New York via London and the Menier Chocolate Factory theater company. And for lovers of street theater, the action downtown in the meatpacking district continues to heat up with the arrival of the Standard New York hotel.

HEADLINE: As Orthodox Population Grows, So Do Tensions

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, N.J. 

 BODY:
A fault line runs through Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in Lakewood, dividing the black families that have lived here for years, many in run-down apartment complexes at one end of the street, from their new neighbors, the Orthodox Jewish families who mostly occupy a row of two-story houses on the other side. 
 The black families are slowly leaving this street, and the Orthodox Jewish families are moving in. Their lives barely intersect, though it is barely half a mile from one end of the drive to the other. 
 Motti Schwartz, a 26-year-old student at a large yeshiva here, rents an apartment on King Drive. 
 ''You come into a neighborhood that's not really yours,'' he said. ''I think there's probably a lot of animosity.''
 Ronald Daye, who is black, lived in one of the apartment complexes but recently moved to another town. ''There's jealousy because they stick together,'' he said, referring to the Orthodox Jews. ''We all want our own schools. This town has too many people, and there will be problems.'' 
 The problems, many people say, are already here. Black residents charge that new housing is being built only for Orthodox Jews, who, they say, are pushing black residents out and taking over the town. Members of the Jewish community say such accusations sometimes cloak anti-Semitic sentiments. 
 The tension has played out in a series of violent episodes over the last two years that have laid bare the strains in this town of 73,000 near the Jersey Shore.
 In 2006, a black teenager and an Orthodox Jewish teacher got into a fight in an alley behind a synagogue, and the teacher's trial on assault charges still divides the town into angry camps. In October, another Jewish teacher was beaten with a bat by a black man with a history of mental illness. Last month, there was another beating: a 14-year-old Orthodox Jewish boy was attacked by what he described as a gang of black and white teenagers. The attackers, the boy said, used the word ''Jew.'' 
 Lakewood reported 41 bias crimes to state authorities in 2005 and 26 in 2006, more than any other town in Ocean County. But officials say that this, in part, reflects Lakewood's greater diversity, and no one believes that the relations between Lakewood's black and Jewish residents have sunk to the depths that contributed to the 1991 riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. 
 Still, interviews with people living in the town suggest that black and Jewish relations are, for the most part, locked in a deep misunderstanding because of cultural differences, economic disparities, or complaints by some members of each group about unequal treatment by the town's authorities.
 ''This is a divided town,'' said Steve Sanders, who raked leaves on a recent afternoon at the home of his boss, an Orthodox Jew. Mr. Sanders, who is white, said he moved to Lakewood a year ago. Now, he said, he is considering moving to Freehold, N.J.
 ''It's not segregated there,'' he said.
 There is a familiar ring to Lakewood's story: One group arrives, another leaves, and in the upheaval, sparks fly. But town officials say that the changes here have been so rapid that they are struggling to keep up.
 The town's population has almost doubled since 1990 -- the 2006 census put the population at 73,000 but town officials say that figure is low -- and much of that growth has been in the insular, strictly Orthodox Jewish community, which has increased to an estimated 40,000 people, up from about 18,000 in 1995. Thousands of Hispanic immigrants have also moved to Lakewood in the last five years, township officials said. 
 Many Orthodox Jews have been drawn to Lakewood by the prestige of the town's yeshiva, Beth Medrash Govoha, one of the largest rabbinical colleges in the world. The yeshiva was founded in 1943 by a Polish-born rabbi, Aaron Kotler. In 1962, when Rabbi Kotler died, the school had 250 students. It now has about 5,000.
 The wider yeshiva community includes more than a hundred temples, and about 50 schools.
 Large homes are sprouting everywhere. One development, called West Gate, will have room for 900 families when it is completed, along with its own shopping mall with businesses including Sinai Dental and Kosher West, a supermarket.
 The Jewish community has also vigorously participated in local politics. Last year, Meir Lichtenstein became the town's first Orthodox mayor. The majority of the school board members are Orthodox Jews. 
 Lakewood was a once a popular resort town, a winter retreat for wealthy New Yorkers on the edge of the Pine Barrens, and later, home to dozens of poultry farms. Many Jewish residents said they were drawn by the town's bucolic character.
 ''The air is so good here,'' said Orly Helwani, standing in the hallway of her house on King Drive. ''There was too much action in Brooklyn.'' 
 Some black residents say that the growing Orthodox population is displacing other groups. But town officials, including some black leaders, say the complaints ring hollow: Many long-term residents are selling their homes to developers or Orthodox families, often at a substantial profit. Black residents -- who made up about 13 percent of the population in 2000, and about 9 percent now -- are leaving every year and moving to other towns in Ocean County or to the South, leaders of the community say. 
 Last year, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the owner of a Lakewood apartment complex, charging discrimination against black and Hispanic tenants in favor of Jewish ones. The case is still pending. 
 And the increasing presence of Orthodox Jews in leadership positions -- a point of pride for the Jewish community -- is resented by some black residents.
 ''People don't think the town is being run fairly,'' said the Rev. Thomas E. Simpson Sr., the pastor at the Intercessory Tabernacle Ministries, a black church.
 There have been fights about the administration of the school system. Orthodox Jewish students attend private schools, but are eligible for millions of dollars of public money for busing, according to the town's current mayor, Ray Coles. Black residents have complained that decisions about public schools attended largely by black and Hispanic students are made by a school board where 5 of the 9 members are Orthodox Jews. 
 Warren A. Sherard, the head of the local N.A.A.C.P. branch, said he had tried to get black residents more invested in the politics of the town. 
 ''I went to churches and told people, 'We need to vote in school board elections,' '' he said. ''I know people want to throw stones, but everyone's got to vote.'' 
 Similar resentment festers among the Orthodox Jews: In interviews, some said housing inspectors were overzealous in citing violations in Orthodox homes, and others accused the police of singling out Jews at times for minor infractions.
 Rabbi Moshe Zev Weisberg, who runs a local social service agency and is a member of the Vaad, a council of Orthodox leaders, said members of his community were especially hurt by talk of Jews taking over Lakewood.
 The recent episodes of violence have left scars on both sides. 
 Some black residents say it was unfair that the Jewish teacher's fight with the black teenager, Jamarr Dickerson, was not officially termed a bias crime. While finding the teacher, Elchonon Zimmerman, not guilty of assault, a judge scolded him for singling out the teenager because he was black.
 The two incidents involving attacks on Jews -- the beating of Rabbi Mordechai Moskowitz, and the assault on a Jewish teenager, who has not been identified by officials -- have reverberated in Jewish homes. ''The beatingof Rabbi Moskowitz was talked about at each and every dinner table,'' said one Jewish resident.
 Rabbi Weisberg, Mr. Sherard and town officials say they are working to help everyone get along, and, they say, they have already made great strides in nurturing tolerance. 
 At a monthly ''dialogue'' meeting, for example, representatives of the black, Orthodox Jewish and Hispanic communities try to work out problems. Orthodox Jewish voters helped elect a black school board member. Rabbi Moskowitz has been visiting Jewish schools and talking to students about improving relations with the black community. And the town has given its blessing to a nighttime civilian car patrol, to be staffed by blacks, Jews and Hispanics. 
 ''These might just be the growing pains of every town,'' Rabbi Weisberg said. ''What bothers me is when each community retreats to itself, and there is a siege mentality. The goal is to be fully integrated.''

HEADLINE: Showdown in Arizona, Where Mariachis and Minutemen Collide

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
 Want to see America unraveling? Come here, to Thomas Road and 35th Street, to M. D. Pruitt's furniture store. Come on Saturday morning and stand near the eight delivery trucks barricading the parking lot, like the wall of an urban Alamo.
 For the last seven weeks, a sidewalk protest here by Latino immigrants has blossomed into a feverish reality show, attracting Minutemen, mariachis, children dancing in Mexican folk costumes, white racists, United Nations observers, Phoenix police officers and Maricopa County sheriff's deputies. 
 The weekly confrontation -- strident and stalemated -- perfectly mimics the national debate. But it's a sideshow to something even uglier: what happens when immigration's complexities are handed to local law enforcers sympathetic to the fury of one side.
 Thomas Road has lots of Latino day laborers, or jornaleros, who hustle for work near Home Depot. A few months ago, the Phoenix police shooed them away. They dispersed to streets nearby, angering local businesses. One of the biggest, Pruitt's, hired off-duty city police officers to keep jornaleros at bay. The city put a stop to that, so Pruitt's turned to the county sheriff, Joe Arpaio.
 Sheriff Joe, as he is known, needed no prodding: hunting undocumented immigrants is his specialty. He has arrested hundreds under a state antismuggling law (for smuggling themselves) and has had 160 officers deputized as federal immigration agents. They have made more than 50 arrests near Pruitt's since the protests began. 
 They'll pull a car over for a traffic infraction, then check everyone's papers. They say they act on reasonable suspicion only -- if they see a shirt or shoes like those worn south of the border or hear Spanish. They say it isn't profiling.
 There is no doubt whose side Sheriff Joe is on. He has officers on Pruitt's payroll, guarding the lot on protest days. Last week, he issued a news release demanding that the demonstrators stop hurting Pruitt's and vowing to crank up the pressure until they went away. It was a naked attempt to stifle dissent and help a business ally. 
 People here are used to that from Sheriff Joe. He describes himself as ''America's meanest sheriff'' and has recently been basking in the love of nativists like the Minuteman Chris Simcox and radio host Terry Anderson, who gushed over him at a roast in Sun City West this month.
 If Arizona begins punishing companies that hire illegal workers under a state law that takes effect Jan. 1 -- a lawsuit to block it was thrown out Friday -- it will fall to counties to do the purge. In Maricopa, that means Sheriff Joe.
 The protests at Pruitt's are the only real opposition he has faced. Their leader is Salvador Reza, a stocky American of Mexican and Apache ancestry, an Air Force veteran who has spent years organizing jornaleros and small-business owners here. 
 Mr. Reza says he can't understand why America accepts global flows of companies, money and jobs but not workers. Why faith in market forces seems to have been eclipsed by fear of immigrants. Or why the country cannot set up legal channels to let jornaleros come and go and not be hassled. ''They actually are people with a work ethic that would make the Puritans proud,'' he said.
 Pruitt's owner, Roger Sensing, says he needs armed officers to protect customers from jornaleros. Mr. Reza calls that ridiculous, and one informed noncombatant, the Rev. Craig Geiger, pastor of a Lutheran church across the street, agrees. He told me he had never seen a laborer enter Pruitt's lot. He also said his Latino congregation did not drive to church anymore. Documented or not, they fear Sheriff Joe. They walk.
 Pastor Geiger leaves the neighborhood on Saturdays, because it gets deafening. When I was there, a trio singing Mexican ballads strolled through the crush. A Minuteman with a bullhorn followed them. ''Monkeys coming through!'' he shouted. His side rushed up to drown the music out: ''Born in the U.S.A.! Born in the U.S.A.! K.K.K.! Viva la Migra! January First!'' 
 The restrictionists see Jan. 1 as the dawn of a new era, when the Mexicans disappear and everything gets pure and legal again. It is uncertain whether Arizona's economy will survive the exodus. ''Unfortunately, they'll probably wake up when they bankrupt the state,'' Mr. Reza told me.

HEADLINE: Expansion of Javits Center May Shrink to a Renovation

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer declared in a speech eight months ago that he would build a ''thoroughbred'' of a convention center in New York City and scrap the $1.8 billion plan he had inherited to expand the black-glass Javits Convention Center on the West Side.
 Since then, state officials -- struggling with escalating costs, competing demands and limited land -- have had to shrink their ambitions, devising a series of alternative plans that provide a far more modest expansion than envisioned three years ago. 
 Now, in the latest blow to the governor's ambitions, the city's hotel association is balking at requests to triple the hotel tax earmarked for the expansion. That could force state and city officials to abandon plans for an expansion and settle instead for simply renovating the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 Last Tuesday, the hotel association, which had sought to expand the Javits Center since it opened in 1986, wrote a letter to state and city officials saying that under no circumstances would its members agree to a penny more than the $1.50-a-night room tax the state started collecting in 2005. State and city officials had suggested raising the tax to $4.50 per night to pay for the increasingly expensive expansion.
 If government officials cannot stay within the original budget, the association said, they should just fix the leaky roof on the convention center, install a new air-conditioning system and put on a new facade. Forget about the additional space for exhibits or meeting rooms.
 ''The hotel association has decided that the project has become much too expensive, and any further contributions from the hotel industry would, in our judgment, be counterproductive,'' said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City. ''The association would rather that the money already budgeted be used to repair and renovate the existing center.''
 Trade show operators and producers have also criticized some of the proposals drawn up recently by state and city officials. 
 When the price tag for one plan soared beyond $3 billion this summer, some producers said it could not be justified. They recommended that officials renovate the Javits Center and consider building a new convention center at Sunnyside Yards in Queens.
 ''To add marginal square footage and spend $3 billion or $4 billion seems like a prohibitive solution,'' said John F. O'Connell Jr., chief operating officer of Freeman, a general contractor that moves many of the trade shows in and out of the Javits Center.
 Officials said that they were still reviewing five smaller alternatives with varying amounts of meeting and exhibit space, with price tags ranging from $1.7 billion to $2.7 billion, and that they hoped to wrap up their review in January.
 Patrick J. Foye, a co-chairman of the state agency overseeing the expansion project, the Empire State Development Corporation, declined to comment on the hotel association's letter, saying he did not want to negotiate through the newspapers. 
 The expansion of the Javits Center, which stretches along 11th Avenue from 34th to 38th Street, was approved by the Legislature in 2004. 
 The state and city agreed to provide $350 million each, while the hotel industry agreed to the room tax, which enabled the state to raise $645 million in a bond offering.
 Manhattan hotels have enjoyed record occupancy and rising room rates in the past five years. One major hotel operator said trade shows accounted for no more than 6 or 8 percent of annual revenues at West Side hotels, and so there is less interest in a very expensive expansion partly financed through a hotel tax.
 The original $1.8 billion expansion plan was developed by Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and Charles A. Gargano, who was Gov. George Pataki's top economic development official. But it came under fire from trade show producers and their contractors as unworkable.
 In March, Governor Spitzer issued his pledge to come up with a bigger and better plan than the previous one -- which state officials say had a true cost closer to $3 billion.
 In the meantime, the review dragged on, with an estimated $35 million spent on consultants and architectural plans over the past year. The hotel association said $109 million had already been spent on the project. 
 At the same time, the constantly rising price of construction materials has driven costs up by an estimated $17 million a month.
 State and city officials are also dealing with competing demands for space. The hotel industry favors additional meeting rooms to attract trade shows that bring visitors to New York, who book hotel rooms. Javits customers like the Auto Show want more exhibit space for consumer shows that attract more local residents. 
 State officials say they could raise $1.5 billion more for the plans now under consideration -- all of which are smaller than the original -- by doubling the hotel tax for the expansion while the state and the city increase their investment by $250 million each.

HEADLINE: Philharmonic Agrees to Play In North Korea

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Adding a cultural wrinkle to the diplomatic engagement between the United States and North Korea, the New York Philharmonic plans to visit Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in February, taking the legacy of Beethoven, Bach and Bernstein to one of the world's most isolated nations.
 The trip, at the invitation of North Korea, will be the first significant cultural visit by Americans to that country, and it comes as the United States is offering the possibility of warmer ties with a country that President Bush once consigned to the ''axis of evil.'' 
 ''We haven't even had Ping-Pong diplomacy with these people,'' said Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, the Bush administration's main diplomat for negotiations with North Korea and the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
 Just last week Mr. Bush sent a letter to Kim Jong-il, North Korea's leader, suggesting that ties would improve if North Korea fully disclosed all nuclear programs and got rid of its nuclear weapons. Conservatives have criticized the Bush administration for engaging with North Korea when it has violated nuclear promises, and in the face of recent intelligence indicating its possible assistance to Syria in beginning work on a reactor. 
 State Department officials said the orchestra's invitation from North Korea and its acceptance represented a potential opening in that Communist nation's relationship with the outside world, and a softening of its unrelenting anti-United States propaganda.
 ''It would signal that North Korea is beginning to come out of its shell, which everyone understands is a long-term process,'' Mr. Hill said. ''It does represent a shift in how they view us, and it's the sort of shift that can be helpful as we go forward in nuclear weapons negotiations.''
 The Philharmonic's trip, which has generated some controversy among orchestra musicians and commentators, will follow a venerable line of groundbreaking orchestra tours that have played a role in diplomacy, the most famous one, perhaps, taking place in 1973, when the Philadelphia Orchestra traveled to China soon after President Nixon's historic visit and amid what came to be known as Ping-Pong diplomacy. In 1956 the Boston Symphony was the first major American orchestra to travel to the Soviet Union. The New York Philharmonic, under Leonard Bernstein, went three years later. 
 Of the Philharmonic's excursion, Mr. Hill said, ''I hope it will be looked back upon as an event that helped bring that country back into the world.''
 The Philharmonic, led by its music director, Lorin Maazel, has been considering the visit since an invitation arrived by fax in August. It was a typed letter from the North Korean culture ministry, in English, accompanied by a cover letter from a private individual in California who said he was acting as an intermediary. The orchestra had the invitation authenticated by the State Department, which has provided advice and help in negotiating the terms of the visit. Mr. Hill said that he did not know how the invitation had come about. But its timing was significant, after a series of breakthroughs in a decade-long effort to have North Korea halt its nuclear program.
 In February North Korea agreed to shut down its main reactor in exchange for economic aid and other inducements. The reactor was switched off in July, a month before the invitation. And in September the Bush administration said that North Korea had agreed to disable its main nuclear fuel plant and give an accounting of its nuclear facilities, fuel and weapons by the end of the year. Progress toward the Philharmonic's visit accelerated when orchestra executives and a State Department official visited Pyongyang in October.
 The final major logistical pieces of the concert fell into place late last week, after a visit to Seoul, the capital of South Korea, by Zarin Mehta, the orchestra's president. The Philharmonic's spokesman, Eric Latzky, confirmed that the trip was on, but he declined to discuss details publicly until a news conference at Avery Fisher Hall tomorrow, when it is to be formally announced.
 Mr. Hill, who was in Pyongyang last week delivering Mr. Bush's letter and inspecting nuclear facilities, said he planned to attend the news conference. He has spoken privately to the orchestra members. Even more surprising, the Philharmonic said that Pak Kil-yon, North Korea's representative to the United Nations, would also attend, a rare public appearance by a North Korean diplomat. Mr. Hill said he believed that the conditions sought by the Philharmonic had been met. They included the presence of foreign journalists; a nationwide broadcast to ensure that not just a small elite would hear the concert; acoustical adjustments to the East Pyongyang Grand Theater; an assurance that the eight Philharmonic members of Korean origin would not encounter difficulties; and that the orchestra could play ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''
 Once the orchestra members had given their approval, the major stumbling block became transportation. The orchestra, staff members and journalists are expected to number about 250. A plane that can also carry the many large instruments had to be found. Asiana Airlines, a South Korean carrier, offered such a plane, provided that financing could be secured, said Evans Revere, a former senior United States diplomat who is president of the Korea Society, which helped plan the visit.
 MBC, one of three main broadcasters in South Korea, offered to pay for the charter in exchange for the rights to broadcast an extra concert by the Philharmonic in Seoul on its return from Pyongyang, Mr. Revere said. 
 ''The balance that's being achieved here is pretty nifty,'' he said. ''It's a nice message being sent to the peninsula that the premier American orchestra is performing in both capitals within hours of each other.''
 One of the remaining loose ends is the procurement of climate-controlled trucks to transport instruments to and from the airport. One possibility is arranging for South Korean trucks to be driven across the border. The North Korean government can be unpredictable, and there is always the possibility that the visit could be derailed.
 The concert is planned for Feb. 26 at the end of a previously planned tour in China. The orchestra is expected to stay in Pyongyang for two nights, with some teaching and a ceremonial dinner thrown in.
 Some questions have been raised about the appropriateness of visiting a country run by one of the world's most repressive governments. North Korea's policies have been blamed in part for the famine-related starvation of perhaps two million people and it confines hundreds of thousands of people in labor camps.
 If the orchestra goes to Pyongyang, ''it will be doing little more than participating in a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime,'' Terry Teachout, an arts critic and blogger, wrote on the online opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal in late October.
 Richard V. Allen, a national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, and Chuck Downs -- both board members of the United States Committee for Human Rights in North Korea -- made a similar point on Oct. 28 on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. ''It would be a mistake to hand Kim Jong-il a propaganda coup,'' they wrote. 
 Mr. Hill acknowledged that ''in a very theoretical way'' any kind of opening lends legitimacy to the North Korean government. ''But not opening up has not had any positive effect in bringing North Korea out of its shell,'' he said.
 Mr. Latzky declined to discuss the concert program, but orchestra officials have said from the beginning that it would probably include American music.

HEADLINE: Paying for Free Web Information

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
NEWSPAPER publishers and other content producers have a complicated relationship with giant search engines like Google and Yahoo. They simultaneously try to curry favor with these sites, hiring people known as optimizers with magical incantations to make articles show up high on the results pages and drive traffic, all the while grumbling that maybe, perhaps, it isn't fair for the search engines to make copies of their material -- so that it can be searched or appear on aggregation sites like Google News -- without compensation. 
 But few are willing to speak as unambiguously as Samuel Zell, the real estate developer who intends to buy the Tribune Company, did this spring at Stanford University. 
 ''If all of the newspapers in America did not allow Google to steal their content for nothing, what would Google do?'' he asked. ''We have a situation today where effectively the content is being paid for by the newspapers and stolen by Google, et cetera. That can last for a short time, but it can't last forever. I think Google and the boys understand that. We're going to see new deals and new formulas in the media space that reflect the reality of cost benefit.'' 
 He added, according to The Stanford Daily, perhaps by way of apology for his candor: ''But remember, I'm a newspaper man since Monday, and not even that. Give me two weeks to become a genius.''
 Notwithstanding Mr. Zell, who is expected to close his deal this month, an international coalition of publishers recently took what could be described as an aggressively ambiguous step in its relationship with the search engines. Using computer-to-computer code embedded in online material that readers never see, the coalition is proposing that publishers give detailed instructions to search engines about how to catalog and index its content. 
 Under the code, called Automated Content Access Protocol or ACAP, publishers could, for example, instruct search engines about how long an article should remain in a search engine's index, or which search engines would be allowed to index it at all, says Larry Kilman, of the Paris-based World Association of Newspapers, an early backer. 
 Putting a time limit on how long articles are kept, or cached, he said, can ensure that only the most recent, and therefore most accurate, information is accessed, while also allowing publishers to know that material it sells as part of an archive won't be floating around free.
 ACAP was created with the backing of large publishing groups, and went live last month after nearly a year of testing. The Associated Press recently signed up as a participant, and The Times of London is employing it now, Mark Bide, the project's coordinator, wrote in an e-mail message from London.
 Srinandan Kasi, the general counsel at The Associated Press, stressed that for his organization ACAP was about ''access, not about restriction.'' 
 ''Digital expression for anyone in the content economy will stand to benefit for efficiency on a scale that we cannot transact humanly,'' he said. ''The difference is the content economy is vast, multilingual, time sensitive. How do you create a common vocabulary?'' 
 The crucial step for ACAP, everyone agrees, is to get the big search engines to play along. Despite the use of words like ''comply'' and ''permissions,'' ACAP would have no coercive power over the search engines. Yet right now, the search engines are holding back. 
 A Yahoo spokeswoman, Kathryn Kelly, said in an e-mail: ''While Yahoo respects the efforts of ACAP we have not thoroughly evaluated the initiative and are not members or committed to it.'' Google didn't respond to a request for comment, but a spokeswoman was paraphrased by The A.P. as saying Google needed to evaluate the plan.
 The problem for the publishers is that the big search engines are largely happy with the access they have right now. The current system relies on robots.txt, a more-than-decade-old convention that Web sites can use to block automated spiders -- computer applications that crawl the Internet indexing Web pages.
 But robots.txt is an all-or-nothing proposition. And publishers are in need of a hybrid solution to the fundamental challenge that has come as content has migrated online. Enter ACAP.
 It proposes a half-way measure to answer the baffling question that has played out in various media outlets, say, when newspapers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal decide whether to charge readers for content online; or when the music industry and the television networks decide whether to join established sites like YouTube or iTunes, or control the content themselves; or when publishers decide whether to participate in programs by Google and Amazon that allow books' contents to be searched by allowing copies to be made. 
 Is greater visibility more important than control, or is it the other way around?
 Part of the problem, no doubt, is that in a cut-and-paste online world, control is hard to enforce. Even the robots.txt instructions are not binding, but have gained acceptance over time.
 The law has largely been silent on how much copying is fair use by search engines; but in any event, how could the law speak with one voice across the globe? (There have been lawsuits filed on the issue, and Google has reached a settlement with Agence France-Presse and other news producers allowing it to use their content on Google News.)
 So it is a contest between two large industries -- the distributor (search engines) or the producer (publishers). If ACAP became too restrictive, presumably the search engines could leave the material alone to wallow in its obscurity. 
 Yet by not trying to assert some control, publishers would be acknowledging that they have an uninvited business partner.
 If ACAP is intended to be a ''a cudgel to force search engines to change their business models,'' writes Jonathan Zittrain, an Internet law expert at Oxford University, it ''won't be successful.'' Rather, he writes, ''if it takes off at all, it will likely be only with a few of its more basic features. That may well be enough for the content publishers.''

HEADLINE: Henry Paulson's Priorities

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
By Bush administration standards, Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, is a good guy. He isn't conspicuously incompetent; and he isn't trying to mislead us into war, justify torture or protect corrupt contractors.
 But Mr. Paulson's actions reflect the priorities of the administration he serves. And that, ultimately, is what's wrong with the mortgage relief plan he unveiled last week.
 The plan is, as a Times editorial put it yesterday, ''too little, too late and too voluntary.'' But from the administration's point of view these failings aren't bugs, they're features. 
 In fact, there's a growing consensus among financial observers that the Paulson plan isn't mainly intended to achieve real results. The point is, instead, to create the appearance of action, thereby undercutting political support for actual attempts to help families in trouble.
 In particular, the Paulson plan is probably an attempt to take the wind out of Barney Frank's sails. Mr. Frank, the Democratic chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has sponsored legislation that would give judges in bankruptcy cases the ability to rewrite mortgage loan terms. But ''Bankers Hope Bush Subprime Plan Will Scuttle House Bill,'' as a headline in CongressDaily put it.
 As Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard bankruptcy expert, puts it, ''The administration's subprime mortgage plan is the bank lobby's dream.'' Given the Bush record, that should come as no surprise.
 There are, in fact, three distinct concerns associated with the rising tide of foreclosures in America.
 One is financial stability: as banks and other institutions take huge losses on their mortgage-related investments, the financial system as a whole is getting wobbly.
 Another is human suffering: hundreds of thousands, and probably millions, of American families will lose their homes.
 Finally, there's injustice: the subprime boom involved predatory lending -- high-interest loans foisted on borrowers who qualified for lower rates -- on an epic scale. The Wall Street Journal found that more than 55 percent of subprime loans made at the height of the housing bubble ''went to people with credit scores high enough to often qualify for conventional loans with far better terms.'' 
 And in a declining housing market, these victims are stuck, unable to refinance.
 So there are three problems. But Mr. Paulson's plan -- or, to use its official name, the Hope Now Alliance plan -- is entirely focused on reducing investor losses. Any minor relief it might provide to troubled borrowers is clearly incidental. And it is does nothing for the victims of predatory lending.
 The plan sets voluntary guidelines under which some, but only some, borrowers whose mortgage payments are set to rise may get temporary relief. 
 This is supposed to help investors, because foreclosing on a house is expensive: there are big legal fees, and the house normally sells for less than the value of the mortgage. ''Foreclosure is to no one's benefit,'' said Mr. Paulson in a White House interactive forum. ''I've heard estimates that mortgage investors lose 40 to 50 percent on their investment if it goes into foreclosure.''
 But won't the borrowers gain, too? Not if the planners can help it. Relief is restricted to borrowers whose mortgage debt is at least 97 percent of the house's value -- which means that in many, perhaps most, cases those who get debt relief will be borrowers who owe more than their house is worth. These people would be nearly as well off in financial terms if they simply walked away. 
 And what about people with good credit who were misled into bad mortgage deals, who should have been steered to loans with better terms? They get nothing: the Paulson plan specifically excludes borrowers with good credit scores. In fact, the plan actually provides an incentive for some people to miss debt payments, because that would make them look like bad credit risks and eligible for relief.
 Now, Mr. Paulson's attempt to help investors, while doing little or nothing for distressed and defrauded borrowers, might make sense if his plan would reduce investor losses enough to seriously improve the overall financial situation. 
 But only a small fraction of subprime borrowers will qualify for relief, and many of these borrowers will eventually face foreclosure anyway. So the plan is unlikely to reduce overall mortgage-related losses by more than a few percent, at most -- not enough to make any real difference to financial stability. Indeed, interest-rate spreads that have been signaling a crisis of confidence in the financial system didn't narrow at all when the plan was announced.
 Still, you might say that the Paulson plan is better than nothing. But the relevant alternative isn't nothing; it's a plan that -- like Barney Frank's proposal -- would actually help working families. And that's what the administration is trying to avoid.

HEADLINE: Obama's American Idea

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
I asked Senator Barack Obama if he's tough enough for a dangerous world. Sometimes the Democratic candidate treads so carefully, and looks so vulnerable to a gust of wind, that the question of whether his legal mind can get lethal arises.
 ''Yes, I'm tough enough,'' he responded during a half-hour conversation. ''What I've always found is people who talk about how tough they are aren't the tough ones. I'm less interested in beating my chest and rattling my saber and more in making decisions that build a safer and more secure world.'' 
 Obama, speaking less than a month before the Iowa caucus on Jan. 3, continued: ''We can and should lead the world, but we have to apply wisdom and judgment. Part of our capacity to lead is linked to our capacity to show restraint.''
 That was striking: an enduring belief in U.S. leadership coupled with a commitment to, as he also put it, acting ''with a sense of humility.'' Skepticism about the American idea and American global stewardship has grown fast during the Bush years.
 There are many reasons: the failures in Iraq; the abyss between U.S. principle and practice (Abu Ghraib); the rise of other nations (China); startling displays of American incoherence (Iran); economic vulnerability (the dollar as declining store of value); and general resentments stirred by any near hegemonic power.
 All this has led some to conclude that the world would be better off if America slunk home. As Joyce Carol Oates wrote in The Atlantic: ''How heartily sick the world has grown, in the first seven years of the 21st century, of the American idea!'' It has become a ''cruel joke.'' 
 If a global survey were taken, that might prove to be a minority opinion, but I doubt it.
 Still, Obama stands by the universality of the American proposition: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness under a constitutional government of limited powers. ''I believe in American exceptionalism,'' he told me, but not one based on ''our military prowess or our economic dominance.''
 Rather, he insisted, ''our exceptionalism must be based on our Constitution, our principles, our values and our ideals. We are at our best when we are speaking in a voice that captures the aspirations of people across the globe.''
 It is dangerous, of course, to speak of being exceptional; people tend to resent it. If the United States said its ambition was to be normal, few would object. But Obama is right to retain a belief in America's capacity to inspire; it remains unique. And I still see no credible stabilizing alternative to the far-flung American garrisons that act as the offsetting power to old rivalries in Asia and Europe.
 Pax Americana, being neither perfect nor peaceful, is not popular. Only its absence would convince its detractors of its worth.
 Obama's main Democratic rivals, Senator Hillary Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, have joined him in calling for a shift from fear, militarism and unilateralism toward interaction, including with enemies. But Obama's global engagement seems visceral in unusual ways.
 ''If, as president, I travel to a poor country to talk to leaders there, they will know I have a grandmother in a small village in Africa without running water, devastated by malaria and AIDS,'' he said. ''What that allows me to do is talk honestly not only about our need to help them, but about poor countries' obligation to help themselves. There are cousins of mine in Kenya who can't get a job without paying an exorbitant bribe to some midlevel functionary. I can talk about that.''
 Referring to the time he spent in Indonesia, Obama said: ''I have lived in the most populous Muslim country in the world, had relatives who practiced Islam. I am a Christian, but I can say I understand your worldview, although I may not agree with how Islam has evolved. I can speak forcefully about the need for Muslim countries to reconcile themselves to modernity in ways they have failed to do.'' 
 Al Qaeda attacked the West in Kenya, Bali and New York. Obama's father was Kenyan. The senator was schooled partly in Indonesia. He attended college in New York. The parallels are strange. They can also be a source of the toughness married to intuition for which he still seeks complete expression.
 Nowhere in American history has the gulf between ideals and sordid practice been greater than on questions of race. It is precisely the gulf between high principle -- not least habeas corpus -- and unprincipled actions that has done the most damage to America's image in recent years. Once again, Obama appears to bridge and reconcile.
 ''We can't entirely remake the world,'' he told me. ''What we can do is lead by example.''

HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students research and create a timeline that illustrates how attitudes towards gay and lesbian issues have changed over the last thirty years. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students research and create a timeline that illustrates how attitudes toward gay and lesbian issues have changed over the last 30 years.
Author(s):
Sarah Kavanagh, The New York Times Learning Network
Andrea Brothman, Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance: one hour.
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Consider changes in attitudes toward gay and lesbian issues by taking a short true-false quiz.
2. Explore the recent split in the Episcopal Church over differences in the treatment of homosexuality by reading and discussing the article "Episcopal Diocese Votes to Secede."
3. Work in groups to research one area of gay and lesbian history from the past 30 years.
4. Create a timeline of gay and lesbian history over the last 30 years.
Resources and Materials:
- pens/pencils.
- paper.
- classroom board.
- computers with Internet access.
- glue or tape.
- poster board or butcher paper to create a timeline.
- copies of the article "Episcopal Diocese Votes to Secede," at (one per student).
Activities and Procedures:
*Note to teacher: This lesson focuses on a sensitive topic, so you may wish to spend a few minutes establishing guidelines for a respectful and open dialogue in the classroom with students. GLSEN, the Gay/Lesbian/Straight Education Network, provides helpful tips about how to address gay and lesbian issues in the classroom online at www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/all/news/record/193.html.
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Upon entering class, have students take the following quiz (provided in a handout without the correct answers):
- True or False: According to all religions, it is, and always has been, wrong or sinful to be homosexual. (Correct answer: False. According to religioustolerance.org, some wings of some religions, like Reform Judaism and the United Church of Christ, accept homosexuality. Other religions, like Buddhism, include no explicit teachings about homosexuality.)
- True or False: The first gay character on American television appeared in 1965. (Correct answer: False. Infrequent discussions of gay issues and inclusion of gay characters began in the 1970s; in the 1980s there were some gay characters, mostly minor, on television; and in the 1990s a handful of gay characters in major roles appeared. In 1997, when the character played by Ellen DeGeneres on her show, "Ellen," came out as a lesbian, she was the first openly gay lead character in commercial prime-time television in the United States.)
- True or False: The American Psychological Association has listed homosexuality as a "mental illness." (Correct answer: True. In 1973, the association removed homosexuality from the list.)
- True or False: The first same-sex couple to be legally wed in the United States were married in 2004. (Correct answer: True.)
- True or False: In 2003, a school tried to ban all school clubs so that it could avoid recognizing a Gay-Straight Alliance. (Correct answer: True, but a court forced the school to reinstate all clubs.)
Once students have finished the quiz, go over the answers as a class. Ask students: Do any of the answers to this quiz surprise you? Why or why not? How do you think attitudes toward gay, lesbian and bisexual people have changed over the last 30 years? Do you think these attitudes will continue to change in the next few decades? Why or why not? Can you think of any recent news events that have involved gay issues?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Episcopal Diocese Votes to Secede" (), focusing on the following questions:
a. Why did the Diocese of San Joaquin vote to cut ties with the Episcopal Church?
b. What started the fissures in the Episcopal Church in 2003?
c. What are the concerns of the Episcopal traditionalists?
d. What does Bishop Johan David Schofield mean when he says that "since on this view the Bible is the word of fallible men rather than of the infallible God, leaving it behind is no great loss"?
e. What does it mean that "people can depart [from the Church], but they must leave their property"? Why might this view make it difficult for some churches or dioceses to split with the Episcopal Church?
f. Do any of the people quoted in this article ever mention any words relating to homosexuality? Why do you think this might be?
g. How has the Diocese of San Joaquin been different from the rest of the Episcopal Church, even before the split?
h. What does Lana Butler, a lay leader at the Hanford Church, mean by "Scriptural authority"? Do you think that this debate is about Scriptural authority? Why or why not?
i. What are some of the possible consequences of this split with the Episcopal Church?
j. What does the Rev. Keith Axberg mean when he says that the different parts of the Episcopal Church "have blinders on to one another"? Do you agree? Why or why not.
k. Can you think of other arenas besides religion where similar debates are happening? How does this debate compare to the debates about homosexuality in other areas of American life?
3. Let your students know that they are going to be exploring how attitudes toward gay and lesbian people have changed in the last 20 to 30 years. Split the class into five groups and assign each group a different research area. Let each group know that its job will be to create a timeline that illustrates how attitudes toward gay and lesbian issues have changed over time within their assigned area.
Depending on your students' skills and your school's level of Internet access, this timeline can be created on paper or online at www.circavie.com, www.teach-nology.com/web_tools/materials/timelines/, www.readwritethink.org/materials/timeline/index.html or another online timeline creation tool.
The task is to find information about attitudes and practices in various time periods toward gays and lesbians, to figure out how such ideas, behaviors, policies, etc., have changed over time. Reading articles from the last 20 to 30 years that illustrate how attitudes toward gay and lesbian issues have changed in the recent past will be helpful. Provide every group with a handout containing the following information to guide their research.
OVERALL GUIDING QUESTIONS FOR ALL GROUPS:
Use these questions to evaluate whether or not the sources you find will be useful to you and your group.
After reading the headline, date and first paragraph of this article, do I:
- understand what this article is about?
- know that the focus of the article is on gay and lesbian issues and my group's specific topic?
- know that this article was written in the 1980s, 1990s or 2000s?
- think that the topic of the article is historically, culturally, socially, medically or otherwise significant?
RESEARCH SITES FOR ALL GROUPS:
In addition to the "other sites" listed in each group's section on this handout, all groups should use the following sites:
- the New York Times Archive online ().
- the Times Topics entry for homosexuality (, which includes an engine for searching through thousands of articles on the topic).

Once groups have collected information on their topic, have them distribute the materials evenly among members. Each student should answer the following questions about the assigned materials:
- Answer the questions "Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How?" to sum up the focus, time frame and other pertinent information.
- Are there several sides to the issue presented in this article? What are they?
- What view (negative, positive, both, neutral) of gay and lesbian people or issues is expressed?
Along with these analyses, groups will be responsible for writing descriptions of important events in gay and lesbian history as they relate to their assigned topic. Each group should have at least three of these event descriptions per decade. Before class is over, make sure that groups assign each member to be responsible for several of these descriptions.
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students create the part(s) of their group's timeline that relate(s) to the material that they read and the event descriptions that they have been assigned by their group. If groups are creating their timeline online, students will do this work on the online timeline maker that your class is using. For groups working on paper, each student should create his or her section(s) of the timeline on pieces of paper that will be taped or glued to the larger timeline in a later class.
Each section of the timeline should include the following information:
- A header for the event.
- A brief description or summation of the newsworthy event.
- A relevant visual, such as a photo, sketch or chart.
If the timeline is being created on paper, students will need to put it together during a coming class.
Finally, groups should present their sections of the timeline to their classmates, and everyone should have time to look at the entire timeline to get a sense of what happened in each decade overall.
After these presentations, the class should discuss the following questions: How has language relating to gay and lesbian issues changed in the last 20 to 30 years? Do people seem more or less accepting of gay and lesbian people now than they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago? Why? What do you think are the most important things listed on the timeline? Why? Has there been more progress in some areas and less in others? Why do you think that is? Do you think things will continue to change in the next few decades? If so, how? If not, why not?
Further Questions for Discussion:
- Have you noticed changes in attitudes regarding gay and lesbian issues in your own family, school or community? If so, what have you noticed?
- Do you think that gay and lesbian people are portrayed positively, negatively or with neutrality in the popular media?
- Where do you think our country is headed in the next few decades in terms of our attitudes about gay and lesbian issues?
- What is your opinion of the Diocese of San Joaquin's secession from the Episcopal Church?
Evaluation and Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on their initial participation in the quiz, their participation in class and small group discussion, thorough research, finding eight to 10 relevant articles, answering the assigned questions for their one or two articles, creating their part of the timeline including all required components and presenting their group's timeline to the rest of the class.
Vocabulary:
diocese, theological, dissident, fissures, traditionalists, abomination, galling, fracture, secede, inevitably, fallible, emboldened, accession, marginalizing, vacate, reconstitute, loyalist, albeit, consecration, buzzword, fundamentalism, roiling, defrocked, orthodoxy.
Extension Activities:
1. Write letters to the leadership of the Episcopal Church expressing your views on the recent split. How do you think church leadership should respond to the move by the San Joaquin Diocese?
2. Look at the PBS timeline of gay and lesbian history online at . Choose one moment in gay and lesbian history before 1980 and write a research paper reflecting on the causes and effects of this particular event.
3. Research the policies of other religious organizations toward gay and lesbian people. Are they allowed to attend services? Are they allowed to become members? Are they allowed to hold office? Are they allowed to become leaders? Which religious organizations are the most exclusive? Which are the most accepting? Create a poster that illustrates the similarities and differences between religious organizations.
4. Research the news over the last five years about tension in the Episcopal Church. Create a poster that illustrates the different sides of the issue and provides an analysis of the tension and the recent split.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Civics - Research each of the 2008 presidential candidates' positions on gay and lesbian issues and create a campaign chart that compares and contrasts the candidates on this issue. Make sure to connect candidates' positions on gay rights with their positions on religion.
Global History - Research the laws in two countries besides the United States, one that offers more or stronger rights to gay and lesbian citizens and one that offers fewer or weaker rights to this group. Create a comparison chart that illustrates the ways in which these countries differ.
Journalism - Interview administrators, teachers and fellow students about gay and lesbian issues in your school community and write an article for your school paper.
Media Studies - Watch the documentary "Trembling Before G-d," which explores the difficulties faced by homosexual Orthodox Jews.

HEADLINE: A Battle Fought In the Factories

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WEIFANG, China, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
When the aging state-owned Weifang East Steel Pipe factory here in China's northern coastal plains fell into insolvency a few years ago, unpaid workers at first responded by blocking the factory gates and marching angrily on a nearby municipal building. 
 Then, inspired by the spirit of capitalism consuming modern China, more than 50 employees borrowed from banks against their homes to buy the company, install new equipment and produce higher quality steel pipe, much of it for export. The newly privatized factory soon was proudly humming again.
 But today it is in a new crisis, and this time the workers' anger is aimed at the United States, which is set to impose punishing new tariffs on Chinese steel pipe imports early next year, at the behest of struggling American steel makers.
 Hundreds of plant workers have been idled, and more layoffs are in the offing. ''We have followed market principles and been faithful to our American customers,'' said Wu Jingsheng, the Weifang plant's gruff general manager. ''Our workers don't know why they are being treated this way.'' 
 In an atmosphere troubled by disputes like this one, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and other cabinet members are preparing for the next round of a ''strategic economic dialogue'' beginning in Beijing on Wednesday, aimed at easing tensions. But in many cases the two nations seem to be talking past each other, aggravated by American actions like the threatened steel duties or China's reluctance to crack down on unsafe food and toys. 
 At a time of heightened American anxiety over the effects of globalization, the factory here illuminates how esoteric trade disputes, where the facts are often ambiguous, usually boil down to little more than American jobs versus Chinese jobs.
 While the Bush administration charges that China unfairly and illegally subsidizes its exports to undercut American producers, the Chinese deny that subsidies are a factor. They see an unfair assault on China's use of Western business models to modernize, provide jobs and take its rightful place in the world.
 The duties on Chinese steel pipe are part of a flood of litigation that flowed from an earlier decision to sanction Chinese companies. That move was, in part, a response to pressure from Congress, newly controlled by Democrats who are irate over Chinese imports that have led to record trade deficits.
 As the Weifang plant shows, steel is one of the greatest irritants. To meet its construction needs, China has become the world's largest producer and consumer of steel and steel products like pipe. Only since 2001 has it been a net exporter of steel.
 Though exports of steel pipe, used to make everything from scaffolding to sprinkler systems, accounted for less than $1 billion of the $232 billion trade deficit with China in 2006, China has doubled its share of pipe sold in the United States in two years to more than a quarter of the market. In the same period, several American steel pipe factories have shut down, throwing hundreds of people out of work.
 American producers charge that though the Weifang factory is now private, it benefits from past subsidies for land, utilities and other costs, and current subsidies for raw steel. The administration says that China is using subsidies to engulf the world with a ''harmful glut'' of steel.
 ''We're extremely concerned that the Chinese steel industry is not market driven but driven by subsidization,'' said David M. Spooner, assistant secretary of Commerce for import administration.
 In response, China argues that it is not subsidizing steel and that the current surge in exports is only temporary as it shuts down polluting, inefficient factories. 
 ''China's steel industry is not export-oriented,'' Chen Haoran, recently retired chairman of a government-backed trade association, said in a speech in Hong Kong last month. ''It is not imposing and will not impose any threat on the supply-demand balance in the world market.''
 The Chinese are also angry at the administration's increasing reliance on litigation, whether by supporting petitions from American manufacturers for duties on steel pipe and other Chinese goods, or by taking China to court at the World Trade Organization. 
 Administration officials admit that Chinese leaders see the imposition or threat of duties, or litigation at the W.T.O., as an act of bad faith.
 ''They think if you sue them, you've insulted them,'' said an American negotiator, speaking anonymously to be more candid. 
 Indeed, most experts agree that a basic cultural clash over these suits has roiled the relationship. 
 ''The U.S. litigates at lunch, dinner, breakfast and so on,'' said Pascal Lamy, director general of the W.T.O., in a recent interview. ''In China, when you litigate, it means that your relationship is so deteriorated that one side will have to lose face, which is the worst thing you can do to someone in the Chinese culture.''
 American officials, though, say that efforts to challenge China legally have paid off. Last month, the Chinese agreed to terminate a dozen subsidies and tax rebates that the United States had charged were unfairly promoting exports in several sectors.
 The Weifang steel plant illustrates how deeply the resentments of the United States pervade Chinese society. Situated in the flat, windy plains of Shandong province near the Yellow Sea coastline, Weifang once was an agrarian region that is now an industrial center producing chemicals, electronics, textiles and diesel engines. 
 At the steel pipe factory, workers being laid off say they will have to switch to lower-paid jobs selling vegetables, driving motorcycle taxis or in construction. At the plant, their average wage is $4,000 a year.
 A tour of the factory was arranged by William H. Barringer, a Washington lawyer with Vinson & Elkins, which is challenging the steel duties on behalf of the Weifang company and the Chinese government. 
 Mr. Barringer said that of 400,000 tons of pipe that were produced each year at the plant before it cut back, 300,000 were exported, suggesting that, despite Chinese claims, some steel factories are indeed geared toward exports. The only steel pipe now being made here is for the domestic market. 
 Inside a huge empty shed where hundreds of workers until recently welded pipes for American consumers, Sun Wei, a leathery 47-year-old welder, had no work to do except sweep the floors and clean the equipment. He said he had heard only recently that he was to lose his job. 
 ''The responsibility is borne by the U.S. government,'' Mr. Sun said. Steel company officials said that the company cannot make up the difference by selling to Europe, because the European Union is also threatening duties.
 Close by, in another big shed, Guo Qinfen, a 34-year-old production line supervisor, said that even though his workers were making steel pipe for domestic use, they were nervous. ''Everyone is feeling the pressure,'' he said.
 A third of the overall United States trade deficit is with China, mostly a reflection of a shift in the composition of industry around the world and the artificially low value China maintains for its currency. But trade disputes rarely focus on the underlying trends, so China is now the object of nearly a third of the 257 American actions imposing duties on imports from 41 countries.
 China's steel production, projected at 470 million tons this year, is now about 40 percent of the world's output, and greater than the output of the United States, Europe and Japan put together. Most of it is consumed by China itself, but American producers worry that more and more Chinesesteel is going to the United States.
 ''Essentially, we believe we are competing against the Chinese government, not the private sector,'' said Armand Lauzon, chief executive officer of the John Maneely Company, a pipe manufacturer based in Collingswood, N.J., which says it closed 5 of its 16 plants in recent years because of foreign competition. The Chinese are resentful because this is the fourth time that the Bush administration has tried to go after their steel industry. A charge that China was dumping steel below cost in 2001 was rescinded, another action in 2002 was blocked by the W.T.O. and a third was withdrawn in 2004 after the American automobile industry said it wanted to use less expensive imported steel.
 China says it is unfair to blame imports for the loss of steel jobs. Steel employed more than 500,000 American workers in 1970, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Today, roughly the same amount of steel is produced in the United States with only 155,000 workers, largely because of advanced technology.
 The Chinese government says that, with the plan to institute tariffs under two different provisions of the trade laws, the Bush administration is double-counting the subsidies that it claims are being used by China, and could raise tariffs by more than 100 percent.
 Mr. Wu, the general manager, said tariffs that high will doom his plant, and so he enlisted the Chinese government, and the government enlisted American lawyers, to help him fight back. ''We have no one else to rely on,'' Mr. Wu said. ''So we have to fight.''

HEADLINE: Stop Stalling on Judicial Raises

 BODY:
New York was once a national leader in judicial compensation. Now, it ranks 49th among the 50 states when salaries are adjusted for the cost of living, and the last pay increase was in 1999. 
 In judging, as in most lines of work, competitive salaries are important for attracting the best work force. These shamefully low salaries hurt the quality of justice, and they have become a source of frustration and anger for members of New York's bench. State lawmakers, some of whom begin to return to Albany this week, should raise judges' salaries before the year ends.
 Legislators are notoriously reluctant to vote for pay raises in election years, which means further procrastination could well end up freezing judicial pay until 2009. 
 Since the last raise, inflation has seriously eroded the buying power of judicial paychecks. During this same period, salaries for clerks, court officers and other judicial branch employees have increased by more than 30 percent. The 1999 increase brought the salary of State Supreme Court justices to $136,700. The idea was to re-establish parity with federal district court judges. That parity is long gone. Today, federal district court judges earn $165,200, which is also too low when compared with other parts of the legal profession.
 By now, just about everyone in Albany agrees that state judges deserve a raise. But state legislators are holding judicial pay raises hostage while they maneuver for their own salary increases, which in turn are caught up in Albany politics. Pay increases for state legislators should be left to the negotiations with Gov. Eliot Spitzer over campaign finance reform. Judicial pay should not be tied to legislators' pay, or anyone else's.
 The Senate returns to Albany on Thursday, but its agenda remains hazy. The Assembly has no plan, so far, to return. If the Legislature lets this year end without raising judges' salaries, it would be an unwarranted blow against dedicated judges and against the strong, independent judiciary New Yorkers need and deserve.

HEADLINE: Harvard to Aid Students High In Middle Class

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER and ALAN FINDER; Sara Rimer reported from Boston, and Alan Finder from New York.

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Harvard University announced on Monday that it would significantly increase the financial aid it offered to middle-class and upper-middle-class students, seeking to allay concerns that elite colleges are becoming too expensive for even relatively well-off families.
 The move, to go into effect in the next school year, appears to make Harvard's aid to students with household incomes from $120,000 to $180,000 the most generous of any of the country's prestigious private universities. Harvard will generally charge such students 10 percent of their family household income per year, substantially subsidizing the annual cost of more than $45,600. 
 Officials said the policy would cut costs by a third to 50 percent for many students and make the real costs of attending Harvard comparable to those at major state universities.
 They said the initiative would increase financial aid spending by the university to $120 million annually from $98 million. A little more than half of Harvard undergraduates get some form of aid, including many from families earning $120,000 or more. 
 The new aid policy is part of a broader effort by elite universities to ease the financial burden of rising tuition and ward off the perception that they have become unaffordable. Amherst, Williams, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton are among those that have increased aid and substituted grants for loans to some students in recent years. 
 The move also comes as members of Congress, concerned that tuition has outpaced inflation, have been discussing whether universities should be required to spend a minimum amount of what their endowments earn on student aid. Harvard has a $35 billion endowment, the highest of any university.
 Harvard officials said they had been considering the aid change for some time. 
 ''We've all been aware of increasing pressures on the middle class,'' said Harvard's president, Drew Gilpin Faust. ''We hear about this in a number of ways -- housing costs, both parents working, the difficulty of amassing any kinds of savings, just the increasing pressures as middle class lives have become more stressed.''
 Three years ago, under Lawrence H. Summers, the president at the time, Harvard decided that families whose income was less than $40,000 would no longer have to pay for undergraduate education, although students would still have to make some contribution though programs like work-study. It then raised the income level eligible for the waiver to $60,000.
 Harvard's dean of admissions and financial aid, William R. Fitzsimmons, said those changes had increased the number of low-income students by 33 percent in three years. But Harvard officials said they had become increasingly concerned about higher-income families. 
 Many Harvard officials, Dr. Faust said, feared that cost was driving the choices students made about graduate school and careers and that it had created what amounted to a two-class system among Harvard undergraduates. Mr. Fitzsimmons referred to it as ''the upstairs downstairs syndrome.''
 The officials said, for example, that often only the wealthy students can afford to pursue highly valuable but unpaid research opportunities with professors, take unpaid summer internships, study abroad or even spend time with their friends.
 Under the new financial aid rules, the university said, a family making $120,000 would have to pay about $12,000 for a child to attend Harvard College, compared with more than $19,000 under current policies. A family making $180,000 would pay $18,000, down from $30,000. 
 The university also plans to substitute grants for loans in all financial-aid packages and will no longer consider home equity in calculating aid. The change in home equity considerations alone will mean, on average, a reduction of $4,000 a year in cost for those families whose home equity would previously have been a part of the financial aid calculation.
 Harvard officials say they do not want families borrowing against their homes -- or selling their homes -- in order to send their children to the university. ''If you had an oil well in the backyard, you could sell the oil,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons said. ''But you need to live somewhere.''
 Currently, 763 students whose family incomes are between $120,000 and $180,000 receive some financial aid from Harvard, which has a total of 6,600 undergraduates. The new policy will apply to them next year, officials said.
 Only a handful of universities have anything even remotely close to Harvard's financial resources, and it was not clear how many could afford to follow. Yale tersely said in response only that it was planning an announcement next month on expanded financial aid. 
 Still, some university officials said they thought Harvard would have followers.
 ''They are the first; they're not going to be the last,'' said Robert J. Massa, vice president for enrollment at Dickinson College. ''My concern is that we are squeezing middle- and upper-income students out of the picture.'' 
 While Yale, Princeton and Stanford all give aid to students from middle- to upper-middle-class families, Harvard's initiative goes much further. 
 Richard Kahlenberg, who is a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a nonprofit public policy group and has written extensively about income inequality and higher education, called Harvard's new initiative ''a very positive step.''
 ''The bottom line is that you want the best and the brightest from all economic backgrounds to apply to a place like Harvard,'' Mr. Kahlenberg said. ''And to the extent that Harvard can send a message that 'we will make it work for you,' that's important as a political matter. It's important to take care of the middle class because you don't want a backlash against programs for low-income students.''
 While tuition and other college costs have soared over the last decade, many highly selective private universities have been taking actions to help students from low-income and working-class families. 
 Princeton was among the first universities to alter its financial aid formulas to help low-income and middle-income students. In 2001, Princeton made the shift to grants from loans for all students receiving financial aid. It also removed a family's home equity from the calculations, said Robin Moscato, Princeton's director of financial aid. 
 ''We share Harvard's concern about the pressures on middle-income families,'' she said. 
 Just last Saturday, Duke University announced several changes intended to make the college more affordable. It said it would eliminate parental contributions for families making less than $60,000 and give students from families making less than $40,000 grants so they could graduate without loans to repay.
 Yale, Pennsylvania, Columbia and other Ivy League universities have also increased the overall amount of aid they dispense and expanded eligibility. Beginning this semester, Columbia is substituting grants for loans for students from households with incomes below $50,000.
 Both Williams and Amherst announced recently that they would substitute grants for loans as part of their financial-aid packages to reduce debt. And Stanford added $5 million in financial aid this school year for students with family incomes between $60,000 and $135,000.
 Dr. Faust said Harvard's decision to go further was meant to ensure that all income groups had access to higher education. ''Education is the engine that makes American democracy work,'' she said. ''And it has to work, and that means people have to have access.''
 She added, ''At the heart of this is a commitment to redefining the terms of access.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Limit Air Traffic At Kennedy, Officials Say

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and KEN BELSON; Ken Belson contributed reporting from New York and Matthew L. Wald from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
The Transportation Department plans to announce next week that it will impose limits on the number of flights landing and taking off at Kennedy International Airport in an effort to ease congestion and delays, according to officials involved in the deliberations. 
 For passengers, industry experts said, the move could initially result in fewer flights and higher fares but potentially fewer long delays and missed connections. 
 In addition, the experts said that if limits were introduced, they would eventually have to be extended to La Guardia and Newark Liberty International because the caps at Kennedy could lead airlines to shift some flights to those airports.
 ''Will people get hurt? Of course they will,'' said Darryl Jenkins, an aviation consultant who currently teaches at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 
 He added, ''The flying public is the one that always gets hurt in these things.''
 Mary E. Peters, the United States transportation secretary, is expected to give President Bush a list of suggestions next week on how to reduce aerial gridlock in the New York area. The government wants to formulate a plan before the end of the year so the airlines and air traffic controllers can begin preparing for next summer's travel season.
 The congestion and subsequent delays at Kennedy, which send ripples across the country and sometimes overseas, came about after Jan. 1, when Congress tried to increase competition by lifting limits on the number of takeoffs and landings.
 Although the details of the new plan were still being worked out, industry and government officials said that some flights would be redistributed via an auction and that a few new slots would be created as air traffic control technology improves.
 The auction system, which is untested in this country, could result in less competition among more-established airlines and diminish access to the market for smaller airlines trying to introduce new flights. 
 ''Those that dominate will forever dominate,'' said Ed Faberman, the director of the Air Carrier Association of America, which represents smaller airlines.
 Mr. Faberman, whose members include Spirit, ATA and Air Tran, added, ''If you are at Kennedy now and you have only a few flights or you want to get into Kennedy and you're only given a few flights, you won't survive.''
 But the large airlines say that depriving them of any slots to pare down traffic would represent taking their property.
 ''We would oppose any auction process that seizes the existing assets of the airlines that have invested hundreds of millions, if not billions, over the years'' to build terminals and other facilities, said David Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which represents most major airlines. 
 Paul Hudson, the executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, said that auctions would impose greater costs on airlines by forcing them to bid for the right to operate some flights, and that they might pass that cost along to passengers.
 ''You're likely to see a situation like we have with the shuttle,'' Mr. Hudson said, referring to flights between New York, Washington and Boston. ''You have a duopoly, and a very few airlines are basically controlling the system.''
 The Bush administration remains determined to apply what it calls market mechanisms to solve the congestion problem. But winning consensus for an auction system will be hard because of opposition from some airlines and from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates New York's airports.
 ''This suggestion that auctions could be used at the New York airports is lunacy,'' said Robert Mann, president of R. W. Mann & Company, an airline industry consultant. He called it ''reliance on economic and game theory that has no basis in reality, including the actual starting conditions and real world constraints.''
 Despite the objections, the Transportation Department appears intent on allocating scarce landing slots at Kennedy because its earlier preference -- charging airlines more for operations at peak hours -- was dropped as a result of resistance from the Port Authority, which collects landing fees based on the weight of an aircraft.
 ''They are doing whatever they can to divert attention from the capacity problem they haven't fixed,'' said William R. DeCota, the director of the aviation department at the Port Authority. ''You're going to tell an airline they will get some flights, but only at weird times? Or that the rich airlines are going to get them?''
 Mr. DeCota said that if slots were auctioned only at New York-area airports and not in other parts of the country, ''there's going to be a lot of basis for people to stop it'' in court.

HEADLINE: UBS Records a Big Write-Down and Sells a Stake

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JULIA WERDIGIER; Wayne Arnold contributed reporting from Singapore.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
UBS became the latest Western bank to seek a financial lifeline from the cash-rich East on Monday, selling a more than 10 percent stake to investors from Singapore and the Middle East, as it wrote down a further $10 billion in the value of its mortgage-backed assets. 
 Analysts said UBS, the world's largest provider of banking services to the wealthy, could end up being just one in a round of such disclosures, as banks look to close their books for the year. 
 Uncertainty over how widely the bad debt from subprime mortgages has spread -- and which institutions hold how much of it -- has already led to a severe tightening of credit markets, undermining the broader economy. 
 Investors and bankers around the world will be looking to the Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting on Tuesday to see whether the Fed cuts its key interest rate and by how much in an effort to inject liquidity into credit markets, spurring lending and growth. 
 In the UBS deal, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation will invest $9.7 billion and an unnamed Middle Eastern investor will inject $1.8 billion into the bank. 
 Citigroup recently agreed to sell a $7.5 billion stake to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, shoring up its capital base after announcing charges of $8 billion to $11 billion related to bad subprime investments.
 UBS's mammoth write-down comes on top of a $3.7 billion charge in October, making it by far the biggest casualty of the American home-mortgage crisis among banks outside the United States. 
 As financial institutions calculate how much their mortgage-backed assets are worth, and how much value they have lost since the credit squeeze began last summer, such accounting risks driving the market still lower, as bad news follows bad news.
 Determining when the market has hit bottom is fiendishly difficult, since the American housing market, which underpins many of the securities, is also sliding 
 Until now, Europe has not seen a blood-letting like that on Wall Street. But as the banks sort through their books, analysts expect further write-downs. On Monday, the French bank Societe Generale bailed out a failing investment fund by taking on $4.3 billion worth of the fund's assets.
 The emergence of white knights from Asia and the Middle East underscores the growing financial muscle of these investors, much of it fueled by oil money and channeled into vast ''sovereign wealth funds,'' run by or for governments. The Singapore government fund manages more than $100 billion in assets.
 ''It's a measure of how the geopolitical and financial landscape has changed,'' said David Williams, the head of banking research in London at the investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller. 
 For UBS, the hastily arranged deal represents a humbling reversal of fortune. ''Only a year ago,'' Mr. Williams said, ''this was considered one of the most financially sound institutions in the world.'' In a conference call with reporters, UBS's chief executive, Marcel Rohner, warned that the bank would lose money in the fourth quarter and possibly for the entire year. It canceled its cash dividend for 2007, replacing it with stock, and is shrinking both the staff and the risks taken by its investment bank. 
 But Mr. Rohner insisted that the outside investors would reinforce UBS's capital base -- one of the sturdiest in the industry -- whatever eventually happens to the bank's portfolio of subprime-related assets. ''It puts us in a position to absorb any future shocks,'' he said. ''We don't operate from a position of fear.''
 As UBS, Citigroup and other banks have fallen into trouble, there are likely to be further such investments. On Monday, the Qatar Investment Authority, a $60 billion fund, said it saw ''tremendous opportunities'' to invest in American financial-services firms hurt by the credit crunch.
 Public sentiment toward these investors also seems to be softening. Officials in London have been promoting the city recently as a welcome destination for sovereign wealth funds. And Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is a senior member of the banking and finance committees, said last month that Abu Dhabi's investment in Citigroup ''allows what is fundamentally a very strong company to weather a difficult time.''
 UBS, based in Zurich, appears to have bet more aggressively than other European banks on the subprime market. On Monday, it wrote down to zero what it calls a warehouse of collateralized debt obligations -- loans that financial institutions repackage and sell to other banks or investors.
 Even after writing off $10 billion, UBS said it still had subprime exposure of $29 billion, more than half in residential mortgage-backed securities. Analysts said they could not rule out further write-downs, given the deterioration of the American housing market and the fragility of the broader credit market.
 But UBS's announcement appeared calculated to draw a line under the issue. Mr. Rohner said the speculation in the market about the value of the bank's subprime portfolio had become a distraction. Analysts said it threatened to infect UBS's healthy wealth-management business.
 ''This is about UBS trying to get ahead of the game,'' Alan Webborn, a banking analyst at SG Securities in London. said. ''If this were to be dragged out any longer, it would affect other parts of the business.''
 UBS, which dismissed several executives in October, did not announce any new management changes. Mr. Rohner has been in his job since only July. The bank's chairman, Marcel Ospel, who has served since 2001, said he planned to stay and was not under pressure to leave.
 Shares of UBS initially slumped nearly 3 percent, but then recovered and were trading higher in Zurich as shareholders focused on the sale of the stake to the Singapore and Middle East investors.
 The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, known as G.I.C., is the secretive sibling of the city-state's better-known sovereign investment company, Temasek Holdings. It manages a portion of Singapore's foreign exchange reserves, and other public funds.
 Temasek has cut a wide swath, inside and outside Asia. In September, it was invited by Barclays of Britain, along with China Development Bank, to become shareholders, in exchange for a cash infusion that Barclays needed to improve its offer for the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
 G.I.C. has kept a much lower profile, taking mostly small stakes in companies and real-estate projects. 
 ''We have confidence in the long-term growth potential of the bank's businesses, particularly its global wealth management business,'' Tony Tan, G.I.C.'s executive director, said in a statement about UBS on Monday.
 In recent years, Singapore has begun an aggressive effort to court private banks and their clients. At least 40 private banks have offices there, managing assets worth at least $150 billion.
 UBS is among the largest of those, with an estimated 600 bankers. This year, it opened a training facility in the building that Lord Louis Mountbatten once occupied as supreme allied commander in Southeast Asia, after the Japanese surrender of Singapore in 1945.
 UBS gave no details about the Middle Eastern investor, citing the investor's desire for anonymity. Under Swiss law, an investor owning less than a 5 percent stake is not required to disclose the holding. This one will hold 2 percent to 3 percent, a spokesman said.For both investors, analysts said, helping UBS was a rare opportunity. ''For whoever has spare cash, this is a great opportunity to get a stake in a large household name at a very attractive level,'' said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at New Star Global Financials in London.
 But the arrangement also benefits UBS beyond the cash it raises, Mr. de Blonay said. As a wealth manager, the bank increasingly views the Middle East and Asia as its key growth markets. Having strategic shareholders from those regions is a way to market itself to customers there.

HEADLINE: Office-Building Workers Threaten to Strike on New Year's Day

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With the city's office-building market booming year after year, the janitors, doormen and elevator operators who keep those buildings running want their share.
 The union representing 26,000 workers at 1,000 New York City office buildings says these workers may strike on New Year's Day if the sizable wage increases they want in a new contract are denied.
 Negotiations between the two sides have grown more tense, with the union saying that building owners can easily afford to pay significant raises because rents are soaring, while industry officials say it would be foolhardy to grant large raises when the country's economy seems so shaky. 
 The union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, has inserted a big question mark into the bargaining by announcing that it will not tell management negotiators how large a raise it wants until Dec. 27, five days before the contract deadline.
 ''Clearly, money is the issue,'' said Mike Fishman, the union's president. ''We believe the industry is in good shape and has had an incredible three years, while working people are being squeezed out of New York. We need to make sure that our people earn enough money to make it possible to live in the city.''
 Union officials repeatedly cite one fact: Average asking rents for office space in New York have soared 47 percent a square foot over the past three years. 
 For their part, real estate officials repeatedly cite a very different fact: The city's janitors, doormen and other building service workers are the highest paid such workers in the country. They average $40,500 a year in wages and $55,000 a year when the value of health and pension benefits is included.
 ''The union's perspective is that the New York real estate market has done well for the last several years, and they want a piece of the pie,'' said Paul Salvatore, general counsel to the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, which negotiates on behalf of the city's building owners and managers. ''Our response is: 'You have received very fair wages over time. You have consistently beat the cost of living. You have a generous benefits package, and you're not our partners in the buildings.'''
 Mr. Salvatore then cited Wall Street's troubles, the subprime mortgage crisis and the country's economic jitters. ''We have to do what's fiscally responsible for the industry, which could be facing a very stormy, choppy period,'' he said.
 Local 32BJ is planning a rally tomorrow afternoon on Avenue of the Americas between 42nd and 49th Streets, where several thousand union members are expected to vote to authorize a strike.
 Union and management are already making plans for a possible walkout. Last Saturday, Mr. Fishman met with strike captains from each of the 1,000 buildings to plan how to mobilize the workers in the event of a strike. 
 Last Wednesday the Realty Advisory Board sent managers of 1,000 office buildings a detailed manual with advice on how to handle a strike. The manual tells managers, for instance, that they must be sure to pick up the slack if there is a strike, making sure that bathrooms are cleaned, trash baskets emptied and snow removed from sidewalks after a storm.
 ''They did a good job running the buildings during the last strike,'' Mr. Salvatore said.
 In 1996, the janitors and other office-building workers staged a one-month strike that caused tenants to grumble about picket lines outside and delays in shoveling snow. 
 Local 32BJ wants a sizable wage increase in this round of bargaining because in the contract reached three years ago for the office-building workers the union agreed to increases averaging 1.7 percent a year, considerably less than the inflation rate. The union accepted lesser raises because the industry agreed to make an emergency $175 million infusion to keep the union's health plan solvent.
 ''We tell them that a 1 percent increase in our compensation will cost them only about 2 cents a square foot,'' Mr. Fishman said. ''That's hardly anything compared with the increases they've received of more than $20 a square foot in rent since 2004.''
 James F. Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board, said the two sides had agreed to seek a contract of four years, rather than the traditional three years.
 ''Their demand is for a fair and reasonable wage increase, and, oddly enough, that's what we want to do,'' he said. ''The negotiation is determining what that is.''
 Officials in the New York City talks said the negotiations would most likely get in the way of their plans to celebrate New Year's Eve.
 ''Ultimately this will come down to money, and it will come down to money at the last hour,'' Mr. Berg said.

HEADLINE: A Gift That Gives Right Back? The Giving Itself

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE

 BODY:
When my mom died a few years ago, my siblings and I were discussing the many ways life would be different without her. ''No more presents,'' my brother noted.
 My mother was passionate about gifts. As an adult, I often urged her to stop giving presents and spend the money on herself, but she refused. She liked giving gifts too much.
 Gift giving has long been a favorite subject for studies on human behavior, with psychologists, anthropologists, economists and marketers all weighing in. They have found that giving gifts is a surprisingly complex and important part of human interaction, helping to define relationships and strengthen bonds with family and friends. Indeed, psychologists say it is often the giver, rather than the recipient, who reaps the biggest psychological gains from a gift. Frustrated by crowds, traffic and commercialism, people can be tempted at this time of year to opt out of gift giving altogether. A 2005 survey showed that four out of five Americans think the holidays are too materialistic, according to the Center for a New American Dream, which promotes responsible consumption. 
 But while it's reasonable to cut back on spending during the holidays, psychologists say that banning the gift exchange with loved ones is not the best solution. People who refuse to accept or exchange gifts during the holidays, these experts say, may be missing out on an important connection with family and friends.
 ''That doesn't do a service to the relationship,'' said Ellen J. Langer, a Harvardpsychology professor. ''If I don't let you give me a gift, then I'm not encouraging you to think about me and think about things I like. I am preventing you from experiencing the joy of engaging in all those activities. You do people a disservice by not giving them the gift of giving.''
 The social value of giving has been recognized throughout human history. For thousands of years, some native cultures have engaged in the potlatch, a complex ceremony that celebrates extreme giving. Although cultural interpretations vary, often the status of a given family in a clan or village was dictated not by who had the most possessions, but instead by who gave away the most. The more lavish and bankrupting the potlatch, the more prestige gained by the host family.
 Some researchers believe evolutionary forces may have favored gift giving. Men who were the most generous may have had the most reproductive success with women. (Notably, the use of food in exchange for sexual access and grooming has been documented in our closest ape relative, the chimpanzee.) Women who were skilled at giving -- be it extra food or a well-fitted pelt -- helped sustain the family provider as well as her children.
 Margaret Rucker, a consumer psychologist at the University of California, Davis, says men are typically more price-conscious and practical when it comes to the gifts they give and get, while women tend to be more concerned about giving and receiving gifts with emotional significance. 
 Dr. Rucker says she often recounts the story of a man who climbed a tree to retrieve a robin's egg that matched his girlfriend's blue eyes. ''Women say, 'Oh, how romantic,''' she said. ''But men say, 'That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of, and also what about the mama bird?'''
 Gender differences in gift giving seem to emerge early in life. Researchers at Loyola University Chicago studied 3- and 4-year-olds at a day-care center, all of whom had attended the same birthday party. The girls typically went shopping with their mothers and helped select and wrap the gift. Boys, meanwhile, were often unaware of what the gift was. ''They'd say, 'I took a nap while my mom went shopping for it,''' said Mary Ann McGrath, the associate dean of the graduate school of business at Loyola.
 Gift giving is often the most obvious way a partner can show interest, strengthen a bond or even signal that a relationship should end. One colleague of Dr. Rucker's noted that she knew her marriage was over when her husband handed her a gift in a brown grocery bag.
 People who stop giving gifts lose out on important social cues, researchers say. ''Who is on your gift list is telling you who is important in your life,'' Dr. McGrath said. ''It says who is more important and who is less important.''
 But the biggest effect of gift giving may be on ourselves. Giving to others reinforces our feelings for them and makes us feel effective and caring, Dr. Langer said.
 For a glimpse into the psychology of giving, researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University recently studied gift giving by pet owners, finding that it stemmed from a desire to make pets happy and offer gifts that would improve a pet's comfort and care. The research, to be published next year, may seem frivolous, but it also gives insight into the self-serving nature of giving, since pets can't reciprocate, the researchers note.
 ''When you're giving to another person, you have this pressure of reciprocity, but it's not there with a pet,'' said Tracy Ryan, an associate professor of advertising research at Virginia Commonwealth. ''It shows that a lot of the pleasure is in the giving, knowing you've taken care of someone.''

HEADLINE: Iran Is Still a Nuclear Threat, Israel Tells U.S. Military Chief

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made an unusual visit to Israel and got a polite earful on Monday about Israel's gloomy assessment of Iran's nuclear ambitions. 
 Israel thinks that an American intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear weapons program, published in an unclassified version last week, is unduly optimistic and focuses too narrowly on the last stage of weapons development -- fashioning a bomb from highly enriched uranium.
 The National Intelligence Estimate, a consensus of 16 American spy agencies, says with ''high confidence'' that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and with ''moderate confidence'' that the program had not resumed.
 Israeli intelligence estimates say Iran stopped all its nuclear weapons activities for a time in 2003, nervous after the American invasion of Iraq, but then resumed those activities in 2005, accelerating enrichment and ballistic missile development and constructing a 40-megawatt heavy-water reactor in Arak that could produce plutonium.
 Israel believes Iran continues to work, however limited by international pressure and economic and technical difficulties, on all phases of building a nuclear weapon. Iran denies ever having had a nuclear weapons program and says its nuclear program is focused on generating electricity.
 In meetings on Monday with the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, and Israeli intelligence officials, Admiral Mullen and his staff listened to concerns that Iran could produce a nuclear bomb, unless deterred, by the end of 2009 at the earliest or, more likely, sometime in 2010-11.
 The Pentagon, focused on Iraq, is eager for a diplomatic solution with Iran. But the Pentagon has also emphasized that the intelligence estimate ''made it clear that Iran did have a nuclear weapons program and that they are still enriching uranium,'' said Capt. John Kirby, a spokesman for the admiral. 
 Captain Kirby called Monday's discussions ''productive and candid,'' and said they centered on regional challenges ''and the shared recognition that there remains a potential for Iran to develop nuclear weapons and threaten its neighbors.''
 Admiral Mullen, who has been chairman of the Joint Chiefs for only a few months, was making a 24-hour visit to Israel, rare despite close defense ties between the United States and Israel. 
 He was returning from a regional security conference in Bahrain, where the American defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, emphasized that Washington continued to see Iran as a grave threat to regional security. Mr. Gates said Iran had accelerated its efforts to enrich uranium despite United Nations Security Council sanctions and could restart a weapons program at any time.
 Admiral Mullen was a guest of the Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, who held a dinner for him Sunday night.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Anticipation of a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street advanced yesterday as expectations for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and an uptick in pending home sales helped offset concerns about another round of losses related to subprime mortgages. 
 Investors remained upbeat ahead of the Fed's rate-setting meeting today. Policy makers are broadly expected to lower rates, though economists are still split over whether there will be a quarter-point or half-point cut.
 The Dow rose 101.45 points, or 0.74 percent, to 13,727.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.30 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,515.96. The Nasdaq composite index added 12.79 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,718.95. 
 The National Association of Realtors gave Wall Street reason to be optimistic yesterday when it said that its forward-looking index of United States home sales rose in October for the second consecutive month. Though investors still expect the housing market to remain weak well into 2008, the association is forecasting that sales and prices will start recovering modestly next year.
 Yesterday, the Swiss bank UBS said it would write down about $10 billion of subprime mortgage holdings, which could lead to full-year losses. Its American shares, however, rose $1.18, to $51.66 after the bank revealed plans for an $11.5 billion cash infusion from the government of Singapore and an unidentified Middle Eastern investor.
 The UBS announcement came ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the top United States investment banks. Lehman Brothers will release results Thursday. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns are scheduled to report next week.
 After the closing bell, Washington Mutual said it would record a $1.6 billion write-down on its home loan business as it announced plans to discontinue all subprime mortgage lending and eliminate 2,600 positions in the home loan segment. Shares of Washington Mutual closed up 85 cents, at $19.88. The shares fell $1.68, to $18.20 in after-hours trading. 
 McDonald's said that global same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 8.2 percent in November. Shares of McDonald's, one of the 30 Dow components, rose $1.74, to $61.90.
 Shares of another Dow component, Caterpillar, advanced after a Bear Stearns analyst highlighted the company's focus on China, where the construction market is expected to keep surging. Shares of Caterpillar rose $2.38, to $76.58.
 Oil prices were volatile amid end-of-year position-taking and anticipation of the Fed meeting. Light, sweet crude closed down 42 cents, to $87.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by slightly less than two to one on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 2.81 billion shares, compared with 2.88 billion shares on Friday.
 Bond prices fell. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 13/32, to 100 24/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.16 percent, from 4.10 percent late Friday. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Disputed in Iraq, Blackwater Now Splits California Town

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: POTRERO, Calif. 

 BODY:
The scandal in Iraq involving Blackwater, the private security firm, is a world away from this tiny town near the Mexican border. But five members of the community's planning group are expected to lose their posts on Tuesday for approving a Blackwater training camp on an old chicken farm here.
 Results of a mail-in-ballot recall election against the members are scheduled to be announced on Tuesday. Three of the group's nine members have already been removed because Blackwater opponents revealed they had been improperly appointed. 
 Like many Potrero residents, Carl Meyer, 51, a local farmer and environmental activist, never gave much thought to Iraq or private security firms until Blackwater came to town last year. Ever since, he has been opposed to the company's proposal for 800 acres of rifle ranges, dormitories, classrooms and an armory.
 ''Having them here wouldn't be in keeping with our rural character,'' said Mr. Meyer, who has helped organize the recall effort. ''But it's more than that for me. They're not good for our country.''
 A federal grand jury is investigating Blackwater for various events in Iraq including the shooting deaths in September of 17 Iraqi civilians by the company's security guards while driving through Baghdad.
 An unincorporated community of 850 on the southeastern edge of San Diego County, Potrero is a scrubby nexus of military veterans, border guards, ranchers and recluses who live so close to the nightclubs in Tecate, Mexico, that on quiet nights they can hear Nortec music pulsing over the voices of coyotes.
 The controversy about Blackwater has riven the community's social fabric, leading to arguments among longtime neighbors and acquaintances, and at least two anti-Blackwater rallies.
 Gordon Hammers, a retired businessman who is chairman of the Potrero Community Planning Group, is among those facing the recall, which both sides expect to be successful. Mr. Hammers steered Blackwater's proposal into the county's standard environmental review process, with the backing of seven of the board's eight other members.
 When Blackwater first approached the planning group in September 2006, Mr. Hammers said, he had never heard of the company.
 ''Once I found out more about them, I thought: 'I need this like I need a hole in my head,''' Mr. Hammers said. ''But I also thought they would bring jobs.''
 Jan Hedlun, the sole member of the planning group to oppose Blackwater and to avoid a recall threat, said she never expected to be taking on such weighty issues when she volunteered.
 ''I came into this planning group because I wanted to know about a separate proposal to build a few houses near my home,'' Ms. Hedlun said. ''And all of a sudden I'm here tussling with this powerful company. It's just overwhelming.''
 Diane Jacob, who represents Potrero on the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, which will ultimately decide whether the Blackwater campus will be built, declined to comment about the proposal or the recall drive. The planning group's vote sent the proposal to the supervisors, who will act after reviewing an environmental impact report.
 For the better part of the last year, Blackwater has maintained a conspicuous presence in Potrero. Company officials have attended planning group meetings, established a shelter and relief center after wildfires burned down 17 Potrero homes in October -- and have attracted some supporters.
 Sitting at the 94 Cafe, the town's only diner, Andrew Lindsay, 82, and his wife Inez, 74, counted themselves among those supporters. Mr. Lindsay wore a pin with the firm's bear paw logo on his cap.
 ''We need a good little bit of industry and employment out here, it'll be good for the economy,'' said Mr. Lindsay, praising the company's ability to deliver food and propane to residents in the aftermath of wildfires. ''Blackwater is very community-minded.''
 But Mr. Meyer, the farmer, was among the residents who picked up supplies at the fire station after the wildfires. Once he learned that Blackwater had provided the gas tanks, Mr. Meyer said, he tried to return the items or at least pay for them, but a neighbor at the first station who supported Blackwater's relief effort turned him away.
 '''Get out of my face, Carl,''' Mr. Meyer recalled the neighbor saying. '''Nobody likes you around here.'''
 Company officials said the proposed training camp -- in a secluded, mountain-protected site -- is part of an unfolding business strategy to diversify beyond the kind of dangerous, controversial operations that have attracted so much unwelcome attention in Iraq. 
 Each year, according to company figures, more than 25,000 law enforcement officers and military personnel take courses at Blackwater's campus in Moyock, N.C., which is about 30 miles south of Norfolk, Va. Blackwater West, as the facility here would be called, would train law enforcement officials from Western states, said Marty Strong, Blackwater's vice president for communications. The firm recently opened an 80-acre regional training facility in Illinois to serve Midwestern customers.
 The proximity of so many military installations in Southern California, borders, ports, and several of the nation's largest local law enforcement agencies make the area an ideal market for Blackwater, Mr. Strong said.
 ''It seemed like a real logical place to go and build a facility,'' he said.
 Blackwater's new training camps are only one aspect of the company's shifting business strategy. 
 In August, Blackwater and four other contractors landed what could be its biggest job ever, a series of projects that could total $15 billion for the Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office at the Pentagon. The contract calls for unspecified technologies, training, logistics, and procurement services to fight narcotics trafficking and terrorism.
 ''The fact is we use Blackwater to do a lot of our training of counternarcotics police in Afghanistan,'' said Richard J. Douglas, a deputy assistant secretary of defense. ''I have to say that Blackwater has done a very good job.''
 Blackwater is testing an unmanned aerial vehicle, the Polar 400, a remote-controlled dirigible that can be outfitted with various sensors. Unlike traditional drones, the Polar 400 is designed to remain aloft for several days at a time.
 Mr. Strong said that the high-altitude blimp would be ideal for border surveillance operations or drug interdiction. He said the company wanted to win more Homeland Security contracts focused on border security training, and in choosing the location here, just eight miles from the border, Blackwater was banking on an increase in the number of border guards.

HEADLINE: European Automakers Likely to Build Plants in United States

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
The dollar's falling value is making European automakers eager to build more vehicles in the United States, even as American car companies continue to shift production to other, lower-cost countries.
 Fiat, the Italian carmaker, is the latest company to suggest that it may build a plant in the United States. Its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, told Automotive News Europe for an article published Monday that its sports car brand, Alfa Romeo, needs a North American plant to be profitable. Alfa Romeo is returning to the United States next year after a 13-year absence.
 Meanwhile, Volkswagen of Germany is scouting locations for a plant in the eastern United States. It was the first foreign carmaker to open an American factory, in New Stanton, Pa., but closed the factory in 1988. 
 Volkswagen's chief executive, Stefan Jacoby, said during last month's Los Angeles Auto Show that the company would decide by mid-2008 whether to build the factory.
 Fiat and Volkswagen are mass-market European brands, as opposed to BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which operate luxury car factories in the American south. Analysts said the arrival of Volkswagen and Fiat could lead others, like the French companies Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen, to move production to this country as well, if the euro remains strong. 
 ''Currency becomes a critical profitability lever when you're a globalized business,'' said John Hoffecker, managing director of AlixPartners, a consulting and reorganization firm based in Southfield, Mich. ''The way that you keep currency out of it is by having manufacturing facilities around the world. With the U.S. being such a good market to play in, I think you'll see more and more companies put facilities here.''
 Both BMW and Mercedes, which began building vehicles in the United States in the 1990s, are expanding American production in response to the dollar's falling value against the euro. BMW also has hinted that it may someday build engines and transmissions in the United States.
 The euro traded at $1.4712 Monday in New York, slightly below the record high set last month. A slowing American economy has accelerated the dollar's fall against the euro this year.
 The euro's strength makes vehicles produced in Europe significantly more expensive in the United States, forcing carmakers to either cope with smaller profit margins or raise prices. But slowing American auto sales make it difficult for auto companies to charge more, Mr. Hoffecker said.
 ''In the scope of the auto industry, $100 makes a difference,'' he said. ''The change in currency has had thousands -- tens of thousands in some vehicles -- of dollars of difference'' for European companies.
 A recent study by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., conducted before the dollar's latest period of decline, found that autoworkers in Western Europe were earning nearly $10 more an hour than their American counterparts.
 Mr. Marchionne, of Fiat, told Automotive News Europe that the weak dollar and competitive pressure in the American car market would make Alfa Romeo a money-loser for the first three or four years after its reintroduction in the United States.
 ''It was already expensive when the dollar was $1.10 to the euro. Now it is more expensive,'' he was quoted as saying. ''Mid to long term, I have no doubt'' that Fiat will have to build vehicles in North America to sell at a profit in the United States. 
 Volkswagen, which hopes to double its North American sales to at least 800,000 vehicles a year, builds small cars, including the New Beetle, in Puebla, Mexico. One option for Volkswagen would be to expand in Mexico instead of building a plant in the United States.
 Volkswagen has not earned a profit in North America since 2002, losing $800 million last year. In 1978, the company began making the Rabbit compact car and a small pickup truck at its plant in western Pennsylvania, but the facility closed a decade later after sales plunged.
 The weakened dollar is causing Detroit's automakers, which now assemble many of their vehicles in Mexico and elsewhere outside the United States, to reconsider their operations in Canada. Canada's dollar is now worth more than the United States dollar, eliminating some of the savings those carmakers received by importing vehicles from a number of factories in Ontario. 
 G.M. Designs a Smaller Hummer
 General Motors will display a prototype of a scaled-back Hummer sport utility vehicle at next month's Detroit auto show as the automaker tries to stem the brand's declining sales.
 The Hummer HX, shown to reporters yesterday in Warren, Mich., is smaller than the H3, currently the most compact of the line. Hummer sales fell 22 percent through November in the United States as unleaded gasoline prices jumped 33 percent.
 G.M. eliminated the original Hummer, the five-ton H1, which got less than 10 miles a gallon, last year. The company would not comment on whether it planned to go ahead with a production version of the prototype.

HEADLINE: Network For Blacks, With Sense Of Mission

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

DATELINE: SILVER SPRING, Md. 

 BODY:
Fortified by caffeine and good will, the volunteer construction crew at Love Fellowship Tabernacle in Brooklyn worked long hours to transform a dingy storage area into the Kingdom Cafe. The hammering and plastering created a restaurant and gathering spot for young people at this Pentecostal church in the struggling East New York neighborhood. As for the lights and camera, they were there for ''Divine Restoration,'' a TV One program that finds black churches needing a makeover and turns the process into television. 
 TV One, based in this Washington suburb, is the cable channel with that sassy ''I See Black People'' advertising campaign. Devoted to black-themed programming, TV One is four years old next month and poised to make a profit for the first time next year. The only other black network is bigger and older: BET. Now 27 years old it reaches about 85 million households and attracts trend-making, advertising-attractive 18-to-34-year-olds. 
 But executives at the fast-growing TV One, in 42.2 million homes, are betting that there is a hunger among black viewers over 25 for programming aimed at them. At TV One that means no music-video shows or reality series about affluent teenagers or hell dates, all BET fare. Rather, viewers find reruns of shows like ''Martin'' and ''Good Times,'' as well as programs like ''Baisden After Dark,'' a late-night talk-variety series featuring Michael Baisden, known as the Bad Boy of radio, and ''Turn Up the Heat with G. Garvin,'' a cooking show with the black celebrity chef.
 There's also a ''clean'' comedy competition, ''Who's Got Jokes,'' with the comedian Bill Bellamy as host; documentaries on topics ranging from election fraud to the life of Laila Ali, a boxer and Muhammad Ali's daughter; old movies; specials about ''The Color Purple'' and the State of the Black Union, an annual meeting on social and political issues; and ''Sharp Talk With Al Sharpton,'' a talk show set in a Brooklyn barbershop.
 ''Politically, socially and economically what we're doing is important,'' Johnathan Rodgers, TV One's president and chief executive officer, said in a recent interview. ''We are controlling our images and giving black viewers a choice.'' 
 That quest to broaden black images coincides with a period of increased African-American scrutiny of media, including a national conversation about using a common black epithet in entertainment. The fallout from the radio host Don Imus's racist comment about the Rutgers women's basketball team continues even as Mr. Imus (who lost his jobs at CBS and MSNBC), returned to the air on Dec. 3, on Citadel Broadcasting radio stations, including WABC in New York.
 And for the past several Saturdays there have been rallies against Viacom in New York and Washington to protest depictions of blacks in some rap music videos and on MTV, VH1 and BET, channels owned by that company. BET is introducing 16 shows through next year in an effort to answer its critics, freshen its profile and stay competitive. Still, TV One is not itching for a smackdown with BET, Mr. Rodgers said, but wants to meet the needs of viewers with an average age of 35. 
 ''When all we had was BET, they had to be everything to everybody,'' Mr. Rodgers said. ''Why do we, the people who watch the most TV, have only two channels?'' 
 The family-friendly Black Family Channel, a black-owned, Atlanta-based cable channel founded in 1999 as MBC Network, died earlier this year after failing to get wide distribution. Its Web site says it will continue as a broadband network.
 Amy Alexander, a critic who writes widely about race and media, said that black cable networks were necessary because only ''thin slices'' of black life make it to the screen. ''Why aren't there smart, fantastical shows, well produced, that have a strong black presence?'' she asked. If TV One wants to become a must-see brand, she said, it needs some breakout programming. 
 Mr. Rodgers knows that distinctive programming is crucial. ''I have been waiting a long time for this industry to see us the way we see ourselves,'' he said. His lengthy resume includes six years as president of Discovery Networks and a 20-year run at CBS, where his positions included president of the television stations division. Now his team of veterans at TV One feels a historic mission to bring black stories to TV, said Rose Catherine Pinkney, the executive vice president for programming and production. 
 ''Anyone can do a show with black people, but we want to be honest and authentic,'' said Ms. Pinkney, who was most recently senior vice president for comedy development at Paramount Network Television. ''Girlfriends,'' ''New York Undercover,'' ''The X-Files'' and ''South Central'' are among the programs she helped develop at Paramount and elsewhere. 
 As an example of authenticity, Ms. Pinkney cited the setting of Mr. Sharpton's show, a barbershop, which is a kind of black town hall. ''Divine Restoration,'' she said, acknowledges the importance of the black church. A coming family reunion reality series highlights a hugely popular phenomenon among African-Americans. A makeover show and one that peeks behind the scenes at a comedy club, which has as its host Tony Rock, a younger brother of Chris Rock, are on the slate for 2008. 
 Acquired programs like reruns and movies make up 70 percent of TV One's schedule. Ms. Pinkney, well aware of the pressure to knock out a hit, said she tried to produce one new prime-time original each quarter. 
 TV One was started on the holiday celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on Jan. 19, 2004, with about 2.2 million households in 16 markets. It can now be found in 69 of the top 75 African-American markets. Industry analysts say it is well positioned to find advertisers and cable distributors because one of its primary owners is Radio One, the largest radio broadcaster targeting black and urban listeners.
 Radio One airtime is used to promote TV One and brand names like Mr. Baisden, who is host of the nationally syndicated radio program ''Love, Lust and Lies.'' Comcast, the nation's largest cable operator, is the other major investor. 
 Alfred C. Liggins III, the chairman of TV One and the president and chief executive officer of Radio One, said he dreamed up the channel as he watched his friend Bob Johnson create BET. But he concluded that BET was not a fit for everyone, Mr. Liggins said, and he and his investors raised $130 million to start the network, with Radio One putting up $74 million. Comcast came aboard, he said, partly because of Radio One's expertise in urban markets. 
 So far, so good, say media analysts. ''TV One has done an amazing job getting distribution,'' Derek Baine, a senior analyst at the media research firm SNL Kagan, said. ''We have them projected to be in 50 million homes by the end of 2008.''
 The network should make about $70 million in revenue by the end of 2008, after losing money its first four years, Mr. Baine said. 
 ''TV One has a chance because it's a recognizable brand in connection to Radio One,'' said Mark Anthony Neal, director of the Institute for Critical U.S. Studies at Duke University. ''They were able to realize that black folks watch the travel channel and the food channel.'' Still missing, he said, are the black news programs. 
 Mr. Rodgers and Ms. Pinkney said they were well-positioned to make a difference in what people see and how black people are seen.
 '''I have this theory that whatever show we make, however we choose to tell the story, our viewers know it's someone who cares about their lives and their culture,'' Ms. Pinkney said, ''and made it just for them.''

HEADLINE: After 8 Years in Limbo, Frustrated Kosovo Awaits Its Future

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
As the deadline for a negotiated agreement on Kosovo's future expired Monday without a settlement, several thousand protesters took to the streets of this war-ravaged capital, waving Albanian and American flags and chanting, ''Independence now!''
 International mediators from the European Union, Russia and the United States reported to the United Nations on Friday that the negotiations had failed, with Serbia willing to grant Kosovo greater autonomy but vehemently opposed to independence. The provincial government is widely expected to respond by declaring independence. 
 Legally part of Serbia, this territory of two million people has been in limbo since NATO intervened in 1999 to stop a wave of repression by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians. The province, administered for the past eight years by the United Nations, has become a test case for the European Union's ability to speak with one voice and to prevent another civil war in its backyard.
 Even as ethnic Albanians pleaded for independence, the leaders of Kosovo reaffirmed Monday that they would not proceed without the support of the European Union and the United States. Skender Hyseni, a spokesman for Kosovo's Albanian leadership, said the provincial government planned to declare independence sometime before May, with Washington and Brussels recognizing it. 
 ''Kosovo and the people of Kosovo urgently need clarity on their future,'' he said. 
 With national sovereignty still beyond reach, there was tension on the streets of Pristina, where students protested near Parliament to express their frustration. Yllka Bajrami, 20, a student, said she was fed up with a process that appeared to have no end. ''We want an answer from the people who are in charge,'' she said. ''We are all tired of waiting.''
 In the city's cafes, students taking a break from the demonstrations complained that missed deadlines and forgotten promises had become all too familiar for ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population. Many sat reading the best-selling newspaper, Koha Ditore, whose front-page headline read, ''No More Room for Negotiations.''
 Fears are growing here that simmering ethnic resentments could resurface. In the enclaves housing Kosovo's minority Serbs, residents said Monday that they were fearful of a new wave of violence by ethnic Albanians. 
 In the divided city of Mitrovica, in northern Kosovo -- long a flash point for violence between Serbs, who live north of the Ibar River, and Albanians, who live to the south -- French soldiers attached to the NATO peacekeeping force patrolled the bridge between the city's two halves, but allowed pedestrians and joggers to pass. 
 It was here that rioting broke out in March 2004, when Albanian mobs attacked Serbian enclaves across the province, killing 19 people and wounding hundreds of others.
 Yet residents on both sides of the ethnic divide said they were determined to keep the peace. In northern Mitrovica, Ivana Lalic, 24, a Serbian student, said she would stay, regardless of whether Kosovo declared independence. ''This is my home,'' she said. 
 In southern Mitrovica, Mentor Deliya, a 20-year-old ethnic Albanian who immigrated to Finland with his family 15 years ago, came back home on Monday in the hope that he could witness Kosovo's independence firsthand. But Mr. Deliya, who works for Nokia and is studying economics, said he would return to Helsinki ''because Kosovo is too poor and there are no opportunities here.''
 Oliver Ivanovic, a moderate Serbian leader in northern Mitrovica, said that if Kosovo declared its independence, local Serbs would refuse to recognize it. He predicted an exodus from Kosovo.
 In a sign of Belgrade's determination to tighten its authority, he said, Serbia's minister for Kosovo, Slobodan Samardzic, opened a new office in northern Mitrovica on Monday. 
 ''If the Albanians declare independence, Serbs will react and we will cut ourselves off from Kosovo and flee,'' he said. ''It will aggravate ethnic tensions and make everything worse.''
 Still, Mr. Ivanovic chided the Serbian government for its failure in the negotiations with the provincial government and the international community. He said that rather than relying on the support of Russia, Serbia should have worked harder to court the European Union, which remains divided over the province's future. ''The Europeans were divided,'' he said, ''but Putin brought them together.''
 Foreign ministers from the European Union's 27 member governments, meeting Monday in Brussels, appeared to be edging toward consensus on supporting a phased-in, supervised independence for Kosovo.
 Carl Bildt, Sweden's foreign minister, said there was ''virtual unanimity'' among the Europeans, with Cyprus as the most vocal opponent to recognizing Kosovo's independence without a United Nations Security Council resolution. 
 He said most countries would have preferred an endorsement from the Council, ''but if that is not the case, we will have to move forward.''

 From John Tierney's blog, at nytimes.com/tierneylab.
 How can a fisherman make more money? By catching fewer fish. It turns out that profit-seeking fishermen should want to catch even fewer fish than the ''sustainable'' number calculated by biologists, because leaving more fish in the ocean leads to bigger populations that make for easier and more lucrative fishing in the long run. 
 The increased profits also offer a way to deal with the political problems of getting fishermen to forgo immediate profits. A government could compensate fishermen for their short-term losses, and then recoup the money by taxing the extra profits in the future.
 Reply from Carl Safina: When you defend your fishing, your fishing deteriorates; when you defend the fish, your fishing improves. Bluefin tuna is one of the many examples of the former. Striped bass is one of the few examples of the latter. 
 From Philip: Most commercial fishermen would LOVE to have fewer commercial fishermen, and smaller legal catches. Just as long as it's someone else who goes out of business. ... Difficult as it is, it needs to be done.

 Should cats be allowed to roam free outdoors? 
 Scientists estimate that domestic and feral cats kill tens of millions of birds each year (not to mention chipmunks, voles, the occasional rabbit and other critters). The issue attracted passionate comments pro and con after The New York Times Magazine reported on the case of Jim Stevenson, a bird lover who admitted that he shot a feral cat that was stalking endangered piping plovers in Galveston, Tex. The jury deadlocked, and the case was dismissed. 
 Whose side are you on?
 From Bente Lilja Bye: Cats are great and fascinating animals. Birds are beautiful beings. In my view the cats catching birds is just another example of nature's brutality. That's just how it is. The most brutal species of them all, however, are the human beings.
 From Marian B: Don't punish the cats; punish the people who allow them to go outside.
 Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, at nytimes.com/well.
 Healthy eating really does cost more. Calorie for calorie, junk foods cost less than fruits and vegetables. And junk food prices are less likely to rise as a result of inflation. That's what University of Washington researchers found when they compared the prices of 370 foods sold at supermarkets in the Seattle area.
 The survey found that higher-calorie, energy-dense foods are the better bargain for shoppers with limited cash. At the low end, energy-dense munchies cost an average of $1.76 per 1,000 calories; at the high end, low-energy but nutritious foods cost $18.16 per 1,000 calories.
 The findings, reported in the current issue of The Journal of the American Dietetic Association, may help explain why the highest rates of obesity are seen in people in lower-income groups.
 From TML: The idea that it is ''too expensive'' to eat healthy is one of my pet peeves. A pound of lentils costs about 60 cents, and you can get about 10-15 meals out of it. A package of chips or Twinkies isn't going to beat that.

HEADLINE: Large Lender Cutting Dividend and Jobs

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Washington Mutual, one of the country's largest lenders, said yesterday that it would exit the subprime lending business, cut its dividend and eliminate 3,150 jobs.
 The company said it was acting in the face of an ''unprecedented challenge'' in the mortgage and credit market, which it expected to continue through next year. 
 In an effort to regain liquidity in the face of losses and bad loans next year, the company plans to raise $2.5 billion by selling convertible shares. It will reduce its dividend by nearly three-quarters, to 15 cents a share, from 53 cents. 
 The company said the mortgage market was undergoing a fundamental transformation and predicted a prolonged period of reduced lending. It said national mortgage originations would shrink by 40 percent next year, falling to $1.5 trillion, compared with $2.4 trillion this year.
 Washington Mutual, which is based in Seattle, said it would close 190 of its 336 home loan centers and sales offices as well as 9 loan and processing call centers. It will cut 2,600 positions, or 22 percent of its home loan staff, and 550 corporate positions, and will also close its institutional broker-dealer business, called WaMu Capital Corporation.
 The company said it expected to post a loss in the fourth quarter after a $1.6 billion write-down of good will on its home loans unit. It also expects provisions of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for loan losses in the fourth quarter this year, and of $1.8 billion to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2008. 
 The company said that the stock sale and the overhaul of its operations would generate $3.7 billion in equity. 
 The actions are aimed to ''fortify WaMu's strong capital and liquidity position,'' the company's chairman and chief executive, Kerry K. Killinger, said in a statement.
 ''The company believes these actions, together with a significant reduction in noninterest expense, should ensure that it has the financial strength to address difficult conditions in the credit and housing markets in 2008,'' the statement said.
 The company said it would focus on its lending activities through retail banking stores. 
 Fitch Ratings downgraded the firm's long-term rating to A from A with a ''negative outlook.'' The debt rating agency said this signaled ''the continuing uncertainty that surrounds this unusual environment'' and its ultimate effect on Washington Mutual's ability to weather the downturn.
 The company's shares have lost 56 percent since the beginning of the year. Before the announcement yesterday, they rose 4.5 percent, to $19.88. In after-hours trading, its shares fell to $18.20.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Travels to the Old World In Search of New Ideas

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The last time a New York City mayor went to Beijing, nearly 28 years ago, he came back aglow with an idea that proved to be a bust almost as fast as you could say Deng Xiaoping. With the present mayor now making the rounds in China, who knows what we can expect?
 Mayor Edward I. Koch visited Beijing in February 1980 and was bowled over by the sight of tens of thousands of people wheeling along in special bicycle lanes. How wonderful, Mr. Koch said. New York had to have some of those. 
 And so it was done. Six-foot-wide lanes popped up on Manhattan streets, reserved for cyclists and separated from car traffic by concrete-and-asphalt barriers. Within a year or so they were gone, an acknowledged mistake by the mayor.
 Some New Yorkers still argue over who was to blame: cyclists who didn't use the bike paths enough, pushcart vendors who used them too often, pedestrians who stood in them while waiting for traffic lights to change, slobs who dumped trash in them. Take your pick. Wherever the fault lay, the special lanes turned out to be among the worst imports from Asia since Nehru jackets.
 The present mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, is also a fan of bike lanes and has encouraged their development, albeit along lines different from the 1980s model. Presumably, any innovations that Mr. Bloomberg deems worthy of borrowing from China will run in other directions. Let's see what he brings home.
 You can assume he is interested in new ideas. He usually is. One reason for his going to Beijing was to speak yesterday at an American-Chinese conference on innovation. ''Access to information,'' he said in his speech, is ''a fundamental part of innovation,'' requiring that societies ''allow their people the freedom to pursue and express new ideas.''
 His observations may qualify as a veiled swipe at China's shabby record on free expression and other basic rights. If so, the emphasis must be put on ''veiled.'' Even before he flew off to Beijing, Mr. Bloomberg said he would talk with Chinese officials about sensitive matters like human rights only in private. It was not his intention, he said, ''to preach to anybody.''
 There you had another difference from Mayor Koch, and on a topic a lot more important than bicycles. In this sort of situation, someone with more of a Kochian temperament might have been blunter about human rights, unlike so many political and business leaders who tiptoe around China's abuses in fear of paying a price for speaking truth to economic power.
 Here in New York, one group wishing that Mr. Bloomberg were more outspoken was a band of Tibetans who gathered across from the United Nations yesterday to protest China's continued suppression of their occupied country. In case you missed it, yesterday was International Human Rights Day. The Tibetans certainly took notice.
 ''It's a very good thing'' that the mayor went to China, said Sonam Wangdu, a spokesman for the protesters. ''You run away from sin, not the sinner,'' he said.
 ''The only thing,'' Mr. Wangdu said of Mr. Bloomberg, ''is he should talk about the Chinese openly -- what they did wrong, especially on the Tibet issue.''
 Not that he was counting on that kind of public condemnation. ''We don't have oil,'' he said. ''We don't have gold. We only have truth.''
 Bicycles, innovation and rights aside, the mayor's Asian journey breathes fresh life into speculation that, his many denials notwithstanding, he might run for president in 2008 as an independent candidate.
 Later this week he will travel to Bali, Indonesia, to attend an international conference on global warming (flying there in his carbon-emitting private jet plane).
 Officially, he will speak on behalf of a group of big-city mayors. But New York mayors have long articulated their own foreign policies, not always in sync with Washington's. The Bali conference offers Mr. Bloomberg a chance to show how he differs on the environment from the Bush administration and from pretty much all the presidential candidates in the Republican Party, which he abandoned months ago.
 Perhaps he will take in a shadow puppet performance, one of Bali's premier cultural offerings. They can be a magical experience, those puppets: flickering figures behind a screen, typically representing good and evil in struggle. The audience sees only shadows, not the puppets' intricate features.
 Kind of like Mr. Bloomberg's interest in the White House, you might say.

HEADLINE: How to Defuse Iran

BYLINE: By FLYNT LEVERETT and HILLARY MANN LEVERETT. 
Flynt Leverett is a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council and a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Hillary Mann Leverett, a former director for Iran and Persian Gulf affairs at the National Security Council, is the chairman of Stratega, a political-risk consultancy.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 IN the wake of the new National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program, Democrats and others are criticizing President Bush for again having ''hyped'' a nuclear weapons threat. This criticism, while deserved, does not address the critical policy question: What do we do now? 
 Clearly, the United States cannot ignore Iran. Tehran may have suspended the purely weapons-related aspects of its nuclear program, but it continues to master uranium enrichment, with no agreed limits in place. And Iran is well positioned either to facilitate or thwart American objectives in Iraq and across the Middle East. 
 At the same time, the Bush administration's single-minded insistence on increasing international pressure on Iran seems increasingly detached from reality. Even before the intelligence estimate, there was no set of sanctions with any chance of being endorsed by the Security Council (or even the relatively cooperative European Union) that would have given Washington and its allies real strategic leverage over Iranian decision-making. 
 Indeed, as oil prices shoot up, American insistence that Iran's hydrocarbons -- including the world's second-largest proven reserves of conventional crude oil and natural gas -- stay in the ground until America gets an Iranian regime it likes is simply not practical over the long term. 
 The idea of ''engaging'' Iran diplomatically is becoming less politically radioactive than it was early in the Bush years, when any officials who broached it were putting their careers in jeopardy. Given official American-Iranian cooperation over Afghanistan and Al Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks (one of us, Hillary, was involved in those negotiations) and the current sets of talks between American and Iranian officials in Baghdad, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's claim that she is willing to change ''28 years of policy'' and negotiate with Iran is disingenuous. 
 Still, even Democrats who have talked about ''engagement'' have yet to spell out what it would take to engage Iran successfully. Most hide behind a vague incrementalism, epitomized in a recent statement by Hillary Clinton's top national security adviser extolling the candidate's willingness to consider ''carefully calibrated incentives if Iran addresses our concerns.'' 
 Why should any Iranian leader take such rhetoric as a legitimate invitation to the table? Iran has tried tactical cooperation with the United States several times over the past two decades -- including helping to secure the release of hostages from Lebanon in the late 1980s and sending shipments of arms to Bosnian Muslims when the United States was forbidden to do so. 
 Yet each time, Tehran's expectations of reciprocal good will have been dashed by American condemnation of perceived provocations in other arenas, as when Iranian support for objectives in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks was rewarded by President Bush's inclusion of Iran in the ''axis of evil.'' Today, incremental engagement cannot overcome deep distrust between Washington and Tehran -- certainly not rapidly enough to address America's security concerns. 
 From an Iranian perspective, serious engagement would start with American willingness to recognize Tehran's legitimate security and regional interests as part of an overall settlement of our differences. But neither Republicans nor Democrats have been willing to consider such an approach, because of the pursuit of a nuclear weapons option and support for terrorist organizations that Iran employs to defend what it sees as its fundamental security interests. Successful United States-Iran engagement requires cutting through this Gordian knot by undertaking comprehensive diplomacy encompassing the core concerns of both sides. 
 From the American side, any new approach must address Iran's security by clarifying that Washington is not seeking regime change in Tehran, but rather changes in the Iranian government's behavior. (While Secretary Rice has said recently that overthrowing the mullahs is not United States policy, President Bush has pointedly refused to affirm her statements.) To that end, the United States should be prepared to put a few assurances on the table. 
 First, as part of an understanding addressing all issues of concern to the two parties, Washington would promise that it would not use force to change Iran's borders or form of government. (This would be a big shift: before the Bush administration signed on to a European-drafted incentives ''package'' for multilateral negotiations over Iran's nuclear activities last spring, it insisted that all language addressing Iran's security interests be removed.) 
 Next, assuming that American concerns about Iran's nuclear activities, provision of military equipment and training to terrorist organizations, and opposition to a negotiated Arab-Israeli settlement were satisfactorily addressed, Washington would also pledge to end unilateral sanctions against Iran, re-establish diplomatic relations and terminate Tehran's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.
 What would Iran have to concede? It would first have to carry out measures -- negotiated with the United States, other major powers and the International Atomic Energy Agency -- definitively addressing the proliferation risks posed by its nuclear activities. This would include disclosing all information relating to its atomic program, past and present, now being sought by the atomic energy agency, and agreeing to an intrusive inspections regime of any fuel cycle activities on Iranian soil. 
 Tehran would also have to issue a statement supporting a just and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on current United Nations Security Council resolutions. This statement would affirm the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as expressed in the 2002 Security Council resolution, and also the Arab League's commitment to normalized relations with Israel after it has negotiated peace agreements with the Palestinians and Syria. 
 Iran would also have to pledge to stop providing military supplies and training to terrorist organizations and to support the transformation of Hamas and Hezbollah into exclusively political and social-welfare organizations. Iran, in fact, proposed these steps as part of its offer for comprehensive talks that was passed to the Bush administration through Swiss diplomats in 2003. (Today, it's clear that Hezbollah's transformation would need to be linked to reform of Lebanon's so-called democracy to end systematic Shiite under-representation in Parliament.) 
 Even if both sides agreed to such bilateral steps, a lasting rapprochement could be achieved only if Washington and Tehran worked out a more cooperative approach to regional security. The obvious first step would be collaborating on a plan to stabilize Iraq, acting in concert with that country's other neighbors. Without a regional consensus on a post-Baathist political settlement, Tehran will continue its 20-year practice of supporting Iraqi Shiite factions and militias. 
 The goal of such cooperation would be a multilateral body analogous to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Each member nation would commit to abide by international norms regarding respect for other states' sovereignty, the inviolability of borders and the observance of international conventions and United Nations resolutions on conflict resolution, economic relations, human rights, nonproliferation and terrorism.
 Since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei's death in 1989, United States policy toward Iran has not served American interests. Neither continuing to disregard legitimate Iranian interests nor timid incrementalism will improve the situation. In the long run, the real lesson of the new National Intelligence Estimate is that we need a comprehensive overhaul of American policy toward Iran.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds G.O.P. Field Isn't Touching Voters

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE; Marjorie Connelly, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Republican voters across the country appear uninspired by their field of presidential candidates, with a vast majority saying they have not made a final decision about whom to support, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 Not one of the Republican candidates is viewed favorably by even half the Republican electorate, the poll found. And in a sign of the fluidity of the race, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who barely registered in early polls several months ago, is now locked in a tight contest nationally with Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mitt Romney.
 By contrast, Democrats are happier with their field and more settled in their decisions. For all the problems Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton appears to be having holding off her rivals in Iowa and New Hampshire, she remains strong nationally, the poll found. Even after what her aides acknowledge have been two of the roughest months of her candidacy, she is viewed by Democrats as a far more electable presidential nominee than either Senator Barack Obama or John Edwards.
 Not only do substantially more Democratic voters judge her to be ready for the presidency than believe Mr. Obama is prepared for the job, the poll found, but more Democrats also see Mrs. Clinton rather than Mr. Obama as someone who can unite the country. 
 The Republican and Democratic nominating contests, which begin with the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3, are approaching at a time of anxiety and uncertainty. Americans, the poll found, think the economy is bad and getting worse. A vast majority think the country is heading in the wrong direction. More people cite the Iraq war as the most important issue facing the country than cite any other matter, and though 38 percent say the dispatch of extra troops to Iraq this year is working, a majority continue to say that undertaking the war was a mistake.
 The candidates are running against a backdrop of a decidedly negative view of Washington. At 21 percent, the approval rating for this Democratic-led Congress is at a new low, reflecting the defection of independent voters, a potentially worrisome development for Democrats going into next year's Congressional elections. President Bush's approval rating is at 28 percent, one point above the lowest of his tenure.
 The poll confirmed that former President Bill Clinton was an effective campaign weapon for his wife. Forty-four percent of Democratic voters say Mr. Clinton's involvement will make them more likely to support her. In fact, about as many of Mrs. Clinton's backers say they are supporting her because of her husband as say they are supporting her because of her own experience.
 The poll found that just 1 percent said they might be swayed by the involvement of Oprah Winfrey, who has been campaigning for Mr. Obama in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire the last three days, drawing huge crowds and allowing his campaign to identify new supporters.
 The nationwide telephone poll, of 1,028 voters, was taken from last Wednesday through Sunday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Within that group, 266 respondents identified themselves as likely Republican voters, and 417 as likely Democratic voters; the margin of sampling error among the Democrats is five percentage points, and among the Republicans six percentage points.
 More than anything else, the poll underlines sharp differences between the Republican and Democratic electorate in how each views its candidates. Democratic voters, on the whole, see their candidates considerably more favorably than Republicans see theirs.
 Mrs. Clinton is viewed favorably by 68 percent of Democrats, followed by Mr. Obama, viewed favorably by 54 percent. Mr. Edwards is viewed favorably by 36 percent.
 On the Republican side, in contrast, Mr. Giuliani is viewed favorably most frequently, and that is by only 41 percent. Senator John McCain is viewed favorably by 37 percent, and Mr. Romney by 36 percent. Mr. Huckabee is viewed favorably by 30 percent, and 60 percent say they do not know enough about him to offer an opinion, suggesting that he may be vulnerable to the kind of attacks that his opponents have already been mounting against him.
 Seventy-six percent of Republican respondents say they could still change their minds about whom to support, compared with 23 percent who say their decision is firm. Among Democrats, 59 percent say they may change their minds, as against 40 percent who say they have made their decision.
 Libby Bass, 67, a Republican respondent from Woodbine, Ga., said in a follow-up interview that she was weary of hearing the Republicans argue with one another and that she was not ready to make a decision.
 ''They're not telling us what their plans or goals are, they're just mimicking each other,'' Ms. Bass said. ''I'm waiting to see if someone comes up with something that will change my mind.''
 And there is no clear leader in the Republican race: Mr. Giuliani was the choice of 22 percent of respondents, Mr. Huckabee of 21 percent, and Mr. Romney of 16 percent. Mr. McCain and Fred D. Thompson each had 7 percent.
 On the Democratic side, the leader, Mrs. Clinton, had the support of 44 percent of respondents, compared with 27 percent for Mr. Obama and just 11 percent for Mr. Edwards. Each of the other Democratic candidates drew 2 percent or lower.
 A CBS News poll conducted in mid-October -- which offered voters a choice of only Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards -- found Mrs. Clinton with 51 percent, Mr. Obama with 23 percent and Mr. Edwards with 13 percent.
 At this point, national polls have little predictive value about what will occur in Iowa or New Hampshire, much less what will happen in a general election. 
 Recent polls in Iowa suggest that Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards are in a tight race there. And in New Hampshire, whose voters cast their ballots only five days after the Iowa caucuses, polls indicate that Mrs. Clinton's lead over Mr. Obama has dwindled. 
 In the national poll by The Times and CBS News, Republican voters said by 61 percent to 27 percent that they were looking for a presidential candidate who had the right experience rather than one with new ideas. Democrats were far more evenly divided on which of those two qualities was more important.
 Mrs. Clinton has often spoken of a sharp contrast between her experience and Mr. Obama's, while Mr. Obama has presented himself as a candidate who would bring change to Washington. By 56 percent to 34 percent, Mrs. Clinton's backers said experience was more important than new ideas; Mr. Obama's supporters, by 74 percent to 18 percent, said new ideas were more important.
 On the Republican side, 36 percent of Republican voters said Mr. Giuliani, who in the past has supported gay rights and abortion rights, did not share their values, compared with 52 percent who said he did. In a Times/CBS News poll last month in Iowa -- where Mr. Giuliani appears to be struggling, and where voters are clearly more focused on a contest that is fully engaged -- 52 percent said he did not share their values.
 The latest poll found that nationally, Mrs. Clinton continued to enjoy many advantages. By a large margin, she is viewed as most electable: 63 percent of Democratic voters said that of all the Democrats in the race, she would have the best chance in the general election, compared with 14 percent who named Mr. Obama and 10 percent for Mr. Edwards.
 Mr. Obama's argument that Mrs. Clinton would be a divisive figure who could not accomplish anything as president does not appear to be breaking through nationally: 65 percent of Democraticvoters said she would be able to bring the country together; 54 percent said the same of Mr. Obama.
 And in a reflection of what has been Mrs. Clinton's central argument against Mr. Obama, 83 percent of Democratic respondents said she had the experience to serve as president, compared with 41 percent who said the same of Mr. Obama and 36 percent for Mr. Edwards.
 Among Republicans, 43 percent viewed Mr. Giuliani as their most electable candidate, compared with 18 percent for Mr. Romney and 13 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Mr. Giuliani was also viewed more than any of his rivals as a candidate who will say what he believes rather than what he thinks audiences want to hear.
 In a week when Mr. Romney delivered a speech intended to deal with concerns about his religion -- he would be the nation's first Mormon president -- the poll found that little more than half of Republican respondents thought the United States was prepared to elect a Mormon to the Oval Office. That said, it also found that 45 percent were unable to say what Mr. Romney's religion was.

 BODY:
MAXJET HALTS TRADING Holding tickets or planning travel on MaxJet? The airline says it continues to accept bookings and has no plans to change its schedule after temporarily suspending trading in its shares in London on Friday. The two-year-old all business-class carrier is reported to be seeking new financing. Like all airlines, MaxJet is struggling with soaring fuel costs. Based at Washington Dulles International Airport, MaxJet is one of four international discount all business-class discount airlines to start up in the last two years. It flies from New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles to London Stansted Airport. In a note to investors yesterday, Douglas McNeill of Blue Oar Securities in London said MaxJet was in trouble partly because ''punctuality statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest that customer service is well short of the required level.'' Meanwhile, British Air said it planned to start new all premium-class service in May between various European cities and cities in the United States, using 757 aircraft configured with business-class and premium-economy seats only. 
 DAYJET EXPANDS DayJet, an air taxi service, expanded its per-seat, on-demand service yesterday to 28 new destinations across Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi, adding to its five initial departure airports in Boca Raton, Gainesville, Lakeland, Pensacola and Tallahassee, Fla., which started two months ago. BOARDING PASS ON A SCREEN In a test, Continental boarding passes that can be displayed as e-mail messages on cellphone or other personal electronic screens, rather than paper printouts, are being accepted for departures at Houston Intercontinental Terminals B, C and E. The boarding pass bar code must be clearly visible and able to be read by a scanner at the security checkpoint, Continental said. The option to use mobile boarding passes is restricted to passengers on nonstop domestic flights.
ET CETERA Silverjet, the discount all business-class airline that flies between Newark and London, started a corporate loyalty program: one free flight for every 10 bought by a company. ... Kimpton Hotels reported a 30 percent increase this year in visitors from Britain. ... A new 800-number service provides flight status and gate information for 141 domestic and international airlines. It is 1-800-Flights. A brief advertisement plays before flight information is provided. ... JetBlue added four Turner Broadcasting System channels and the Big Ten Network to its in-seat DirecTV programming. ... The San Jose Fairmont hotel installed two big plasma screens in the lobby showing arrivals and departure times at San Jose International Airport. ... Star Alliance plans to open a lounge for premium passengers next spring at Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Losing Weight In the Gulf

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Manama, Bahrain 

 BODY:
 Growing up in Minnesota, one of my favorite things was going to the state fair each summer and watching the guy who would guess your weight within 5 pounds. If you fooled him, you won a stuffed animal. 
 Out here on the Persian Gulf, where small countries learn quickly how to survive large predators, they've developed a similar skill: They can calculate a country's power within 5 pounds, just by looking at it. If they're wrong, they end up as a stuffed animal. 
 Right now, the Arab Gulf states are all sizing up America, their protector, and are wondering just how much Uncle Sam weighs in the standoff with Iran -- and whether it will be enough to keep Iran at bay. 
 I've been at a security conference in the tiny Gulf state of Bahrain, attended by defense officials and analysts from all over the world, and all the buzz has been about the latest U.S. National Intelligence Estimate on Iran. It has left every Arab and European expert I've spoken to baffled -- not in its conclusions, but by why those conclusions were framed in a way that is sure to reduce America's leverage to negotiate with Tehran.
 The Gulf Arabs feel like they have this neighbor who has been a drug dealer for 18 years. Recently, this neighbor has been very visibly growing poppies for heroin in his backyard in violation of the law. He's also been buying bigger and better trucks to deliver drugs. You can see them parked in his driveway. 
 In the past year, though, because of increased police patrols and all the neighbors threatening to do something, this suspicious character has shut down the laboratory in his basement to convert poppies into heroin. In the wake of that, the police declared that he is no longer a drug dealer.
 ''But wait,'' say the Gulf Arabs, ''he's still growing poppies. He was using them for heroin right up to 2003. Now he says he's in the flower business. He's not in the flower business. He's dealing drugs. And he's still expanding the truck fleet to deliver them. How can you say he's no longer a drug dealer?'' 
 Sorry, say the police. We have a very technical, legal definition of drug-dealing, and your neighbor no longer fits it.
 That's basically what has happened between the U.S. and Iran -- just substitute enriched uranium for poppies. Now, Bush officials are trying to tell everyone: ''No, no, Iran is still dangerous. You have to keep the coalition together to get Tehran to stop enriching uranium.'' But in a world where everyone is looking for an excuse to do business with Iran, not to sanction it, we've lost leverage. Everyone in the neighborhood can smell it -- and it worries them. 
 Said Gary Samore, director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Clinton administration expert on proliferation: ''The U.S. N.I.E., by leading with the statement that Iran has halted its nuclear weapons program, has left the misleading impression that the danger has passed.''
 It has not passed, he noted, because Iran is still enriching uranium in violation of U.N. proliferation rules to which Iran had agreed (and testing long-range delivery missiles). Yes, it is still enriching below weapons grade. Iran says this is to fuel nuclear reactors to generate electricity -- but it has no such reactors. And to get that uranium enriched to weapons grade, all it has to do is keep running it through its centrifuges. 
 ''That is the hardest part of building a nuclear weapon, and Iran is still doing it,'' said Mr. Samore. ''Our ability to get strong international sanctions to halt that was already weak,'' but by declaring definitively that Iran's weapons program had been halted, the N.I.E. ''has given the Russians and Chinese a good excuse to make sanctions even weaker.''
 As I have said before, I'd rather see Iran go nuclear, and contain it, than have the Bush team start another Middle East war over this issue. But I'd much prefer a negotiated end to Iran's enrichment. Right now there is a silly debate: Should we negotiate with Iran ''conditionally'' or ''unconditionally'' on this issue. Wrong question. The right question is should we enter such negotiations with or without leverage.
 If we sit down with the Iranians without the leverage of a global coalition ready to impose tighter and tighter economic sanctions -- should Iran not halt enrichment -- we'll end up holding a stuffed animal. The peculiar (obtuse?) way the N.I.E. on Iran was framed has deprived all who favor a negotiated settlement of leverage.
 ''It was the C.I.A. doing its job of collecting intelligence really well and presenting it really badly,'' said Mr. Samore. 
 Now we have to depend on -- Oh, my God! -- President Bush to persuade the world to read the whole N.I.E. and see it in a balanced perspective. As I've also said before: Some things are true even if George Bush believes them, but good luck getting anyone to buy that anymore.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stand On Quotas Deadlocks Climate Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and PETER GELLING; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
 -- As a United Nations conference on global warming here entered its final stretch, the United States and the European Union remained deadlocked on Tuesday on whether countries should commit now to specific emissions reductions in an agreement that may not be finalized for two more years. 
 Over the weekend, officials from the United Nations, backed by the European Union and many developing countries, offered a draft plan for talks over the next two years, including a statement that dangerous warming can be avoided only if industrialized countries cut emissions by 2020 to levels 25 to 40 percent below those of 1990. 
 But on Tuesday the United States remained firmly opposed to such language. 
 This year's studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that centuries of warming, rising seas and species extinctions would probably result unless there were sharp curbs in climate-warming emissions within a few decades. 
 ''Logic requires that we listen to the science,'' said Stavros Dimas, the European Union's environment commissioner. ''I would expect others to follow that logic.'' 
 The Bush administration opposes including hard targets at this stage in the talks. Other countries, including Japan and Canada, are beginning to side with the United States on the need for any new climate agreements to include meaningful steps by fast-growing countries like China and India. And calls for concrete limits have consistently been refused by those nations. 
 ''We don't think it's prudent or reasonable to start off with some set of numbers,'' Harlan Watson, the United States' chief negotiator on climate change, said here on Monday, in the last public statement from the American delegation. ''That's what the negotiations are going to be for.'' 
 The meeting in Bali is part of negotiations over ways to invigorate a faltering 1992 treaty, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to replace the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 addendum that requires three dozen industrialized countries to cut emissions below 1990 levels by 2012. That agreement is also in trouble, with many adherents failing to stay on track toward achieving cuts. 
 The dispute over targets reflects the growing cleavage between the Bush administration and many other developed countries represented here that say numerical targets are necessary to add urgency and structure to future negotiations. 
 ''The situation is so desperately serious that any delay could push us past the tipping point, beyond which the ecological, financial and human costs would increase dramatically,'' said Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general. 
 Countries have a choice between a comprehensive agreement or ''oblivion,'' he said. 
 The main purpose of the two-week meeting, which runs through Friday, is to establish a plan for negotiating a global agreement to address the warming of the planet. Delegates from 190 countries are taking part. 
 There appears to be consensus that 2009 will be chosen as the deadline for the talks, but many disagreements remain over such issues as whether cuts in emissions should be mandatory or whether China, which has passed the United States as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, should be obligated to make cuts similar to those of developed countries. 
 Delegates say that if they fail to overcome American resistance to specific cuts at this meeting, they may prevail after President Bush leaves office in 2009. 
 In the meantime, the Bush administration is moving ahead with parallel talks over new ''aspirational,'' nonbinding goals for limiting climate dangers. Representatives from the world's largest countries, in economic terms, have agreed to meet in Hawaii in late January under that separate process.

HEADLINE: White House Is Confident Of Broad Support on Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and THOM SHANKER; Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, Nazila Fathi from Tehran, and Steven Erlanger from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A week after American intelligence agencies reported that Iran halted work on a covert nuclear weapons program in 2003, the Bush administration expressed confidence on Tuesday that it had rallied international support to intensify diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran's government.
 On a day that Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, called last week's assessment ''a step forward,'' President Bush responded by demanding that Iran disclose its weapons program to international inspectors and end its continuing uranium-enrichment program. Iran has denied it ever had a military program, and has insisted that it is enriching uranium for civilian energy use. 
 ''We believe Iran had a secret military weapons program,'' Mr. Bush said at the White House. ''And Iran must explain to the world why they had a program.''
 After a week of conflicting statements, senior administration officials now increasingly express chagrin that last week's National Intelligence Estimate, a document representing the consensus views of 16 intelligence agencies, incorrectly focused on the suspension of a secret weapons program and not on the accelerated effort to enrich uranium. That undercut the administration's main rationale for confronting Iran, and left the administration seeking to regain the diplomatic initiative for continued sanctions. 
 Acknowledging this, administration officials said that a United Nations vote on new sanctions, originally scheduled for this month, would most likely be deferred until next year.
 The chief American official in talks on Iran's nuclear program, Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns, conferred by telephone on Tuesday with his counterparts from the four other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany to discuss a third resolution that would tighten sanctions on Iran's government.
 The new sanctions, one official said, could include economic strictures and a ban on foreign travel by senior Iranian officials involved in the nuclear program or suspected of supporting terrorism. Such sanctions would be somewhat similar to those the United States unilaterally imposed on the Quds division of Iran's Republican Guard Corps, although apparently they would not go nearly as far.
 The State Department's spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that the conference call would be followed soon by another ''with an eye toward, in the next several weeks, in the coming weeks, having a final Security Council resolution that can be voted on.'' 
 Mr. McCormack added, ''And what is very interesting about this is that we're not talking about whether or not there's going to be a resolution, but we're talking about what are the elements to a new Security Council resolution.''
 Since the release of a declassified version of the assessment last week, the administration has scrambled to salvage a policy that sought a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear ambitions while preserving the option of military strikes, or at least the appearance of such an option.
 At the Pentagon, civilian officials and military commanders have been reserved in their prescriptions, warning that force should be a last resort.
 In interviews since the assessment was released, those officials said it undermined the efforts to restrain Iran diplomatically, raising the prospect of Iranian defiance and thus possibly worsening the standoff. 
 They expressed concern that a public perception was taking root that Iran had somehow been exonerated by the new assessment, a view Iran's president has embraced. 
 ''If the Americans take two or three more steps, issues between the two countries would be resolved,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a news conference in Iran's capital, Tehran. He went on to say that those steps could consist of dropping the sanctions imposed by the first two rounds of Security Council resolutions.
 The White House has made it clear that it would discuss lifting sanctions only if Iran suspended its enrichment program, which it has refused to do. At a briefing, Dana Perino, Mr. Bush's press secretary, called Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks ''fanciful thinking.'' 
 Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, expressed support for Mr. Bush's efforts. At a conference of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, he said Iran continued ''to attain two vital components to create nuclear weapons: the development of a sophisticated electrical system and ballistic missiles, while at the same time producing enriched uranium.''
 He added that Iran did not need ''to act with frenzied haste to create enriched uranium -- unless it wants to develop nuclear weapons.'' 
 Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, visiting Bahrain on Saturday, described the assessment as being ''explicit that Iran is keeping its options open and could restart its nuclear weapons program at any time -- I would add, if it has not done so already.''
 An administration official said that the new assessment was making its way through the government bureaucracies of Britain, France, Russia and China and predicted that it would ultimately bolster the case for more pressure on Iran. 
 President Bush spoke to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Hu Jintao of China last week to explain the new intelligence findings, based, officials have said, on intercepted notes and conversations among Iranian nuclear officials. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush again pressed his argument that Iran's dissembling in its declarations with the International Atomic Energy Agency meant it could not be trusted to have a civilian program to enrich uranium. 
 ''Iran is dangerous,'' he said, ''and they'll be even more dangerous if they learn how to enrich uranium.''

HEADLINE: Suspicions in U.S. That China Has Put Ban on Hollywood Films

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Beijing.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China has stopped granting permission for American films to be shown in its theaters in an apparent trade dispute with the United States, according to several Hollywood executives and United States government officials.
 The Chinese government has not announced any ban, but American movies are no longer being approved for release early next year, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 The Chinese action, these officials said, might be in retaliation for the decision by the United States last April to file an intellectual property rights case with the World Trade Organization. The filing was meant to pressure China to enforce more strictly its intellectual property rights laws against the pirating of American movies and to give American companies greater access to the Chinese market. 
 United States government officials said they had raised the issue of the ban or suspension of film approvals at high-level economic talks held in Beijing on Tuesday, but the officials did not say how China responded.
 According to the officials, Chinese leaders expressed strong displeasure with the decision to file the intellectual property rights case this year.
 The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, which regulates China's film industry, declined to comment. A spokeswoman at the agency's Beijing office said by telephone that any ban would have been publicly announced.
 But Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, said he was concerned about reports from Hollywood that American films were not being approved for showing in China.
 ''There are strong indications that there is at least a stoppage of American films, that the approval process has been closed,'' Mr. Glickman said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ''I don't have any confirmation that they have taken action. But if they have in fact established an official or unofficial block on our films that would be a strong step backwards.''
 China already limits the number of foreign films shown here to about 20 a year. Hollywood has been pressing for greater access to Chinese theaters. Films shown here must also pass Chinese censors and are often edited heavily.
 China may also be moving to protect its own film industry. Foreign films -- mostly from the United States -- typically account for nearly half of China's box-office revenues, which topped $350 million in 2006.
 But Hollywood gets only a tiny slice of those revenues. In fact, China's box office is meager when the global box office of more than $40 billion is considered.
 Still, Hollywood film studios say they believe that China will eventually be an important market. This year, the Hollywood movie ''Transformers'' was the top film at the Chinese box office.
 December is generally set aside for Chinese films, so there are few American films now being shown in China.
 Hollywood executives said they were worried about talking about any ban, which they say has been rumored in China for more than a month.
 In recent weeks, American movie industry officials say they have tried to submit films for approval for showing early next year and the films were either not accepted by regulators or the requests were ignored or delayed.
 ''It's not that they aren't approving, you're just not hearing anything from them,'' one Hollywood executive said.
 Officials working for three of the biggest studios operating here, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Warner Brothers and Walt Disney, all declined to comment. 
 The trade dispute over movies is just one among many now playing out between China and the United States, involving things like currency reform, food safety and China's booming trade surplus.
 Among the worries in China is that the United States and the European Union may be moving toward protectionist measures to ease trade deficits.
 Intellectual property rights are also a leading area of dispute. Last April, the office of the United States trade representative filed a case against China with the W.T.O. concerning intellectual copyrights and market access. It covers authors and producers of books, music and movies. 
 The largest and most prominent of those goods are American movies, which are popular in theaters in China but also available on counterfeit DVDs in most large cities, particularly those films that have never been released in China.
 This year, after the United States filed its intellectual property rights case, Chinese officials complained that the move would not help cooperation between the countries.
 Wang Ziqiang, a spokesman for China's National Copyright Administration, said he did not deny that intellectual property rights infringement and piracy occurred in the Chinese market, ''but that doesn't mean the United States is founded to file complaints against China in the W.T.O.''

HEADLINE: Betting That a Suburb Wants a Taste of the City

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

DATELINE: NAPERVILLE, Ill. 

 BODY:
One of the Chicago area's richest men, John P. Calamos Sr. of Calamos Investments, is making an ambitious attempt to gain a foothold in the world of commercial real estate by building a 1.2-million-square-foot development in this western suburb of Chicago.
 The project, a modernistic steel and glass complex called City Gate Centre, will ultimately include three office buildings, a hotel, retail space and a performing arts center, at a total cost of $350 million.
 Designed by Dirk Lohan of Lohan Anderson, one of the most prominent architecture firms in Chicago, City Gate has the feel of a downtown development, though Naperville is known mainly as a desirable residential address. 
 ''The concept is to bring a little bit of the city to the suburbs,'' said Mr. Calamos, who made his fortune in the 1980s and '90s by pioneering the market for convertible bonds, then an overlooked type of corporate security . His family is listed at No. 261 on the annual Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $1.9 billion.
 But there is a glaring problem in his shift into real estate: tenants -- or, more accurately, a lack of them. 
 In a move that has baffled many, Mr. Calamos built the first phase of City Gate -- a 200,000-square-foot office building, a 140-room luxury hotel, 56,000 square feet of retail space and a parking deck -- without a single committed tenant. 
 ''We wanted to get the project going,'' he said. ''It was kind of a stake in the ground for us. It showed our confidence.'' 
 The wisdom of this approach is being debated in local real estate circles.
 ''I think the architecture will be a big selling point,'' said Jeff Samaras, executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, which is assisting Mr. Calamos in leasing the project. ''To create this kind of urban feel in the suburban market is pretty unique. There are always companies who are interested in relocating to the most state-of-the-art building, and that's what Calamos has built.'' 
 Other brokers, however, are less convinced, particularly about the nonoffice portions of the project. ''They're betwixt and between,'' said Bruce A. Kaplan, president of the Northern Realty Group in Chicago. ''They're not in one of the established retail zones, and the population density in and around the project is fairly limited. The size of the project is just not big enough to create a critical mass.''
 Another potential problem is the high commercial vacancy levels in the area. Naperville is part of a larger real estate submarket known as the east-west research corridor, which stretches for about 10 miles along Interstate 88. The submarket has about 34 million square feet of office space.
 The overall Class A vacancy rate is about 21 percent in the western sector of the corridor, which includes City Gate. Net annual rents in the area average $15 to $21 a square foot.
 According to Mr. Samaras, City Gate, which is asking $19.50 a square foot, is ''a long way from the cheapest product.'' But he noted that new construction in downtown Chicago runs about $29 to $33 a square foot.
 Mr. Calamos's development career in Naperville, where he also lives, began in 2003 when he commissioned new headquarters for his firm at Interstate 88 and Route 59. 
 The 180,000-square-foot steel and glass building was designed by Mr. Lohan, whose noted commissions include highly praised additions to such downtown landmarks as the John G. Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium. 
 ''I had never commissioned a building before, and it was truly a learning experience,'' said Mr. Calamos, who started off wanting to be an architect and, in fact, is a trustee of the Illinois Institute of Technology, one of Chicago's leading architecture schools. He described the finished structure as ''art you can live in.'' 
 In 2005, the firm moved in. There are now more than 400 employees working there.
 Shortly thereafter, Mr. Calamos acquired a second parcel of land to the north of his new building and asked Mr. Lohan for ideas on how to develop it. The result is City Gate Centre. 
 ''It's a new asset class for us,'' Mr. Calamos said. ''I think commercial real estate looks like a good investment. Hopefully, this will be successful, and we'll be able to leverage the expertise we gain here and do some further developing.''
 Mr. Lohan said: ''We wanted as many uses as possible. The thought is that people will walk the streets, eat at sidewalk cafes, go to the hotel and theater'' in the retail segment of the project.
 While the project sits alone in a big field, the long-term vision, he said, was that it would provide a little bit of urban life in the suburbs.
 Daniel J. Slack, president of Calamos Real Estate, the company that Mr. Calamos created to develop the project, said, ''The whole idea is to set up a dynamic urban oasis in terms of verve and excitement.'' 
 On the plus side, the project should benefit from Naperville's emergence as a leading corporate hub in the western suburbs.
 The town, about 30 miles west of downtown Chicago, is within easy driving distance of two national laboratories: Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., and Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Ill. In the 1970s and '80s, high-tech companies like British Petroleum and Bell Labs built large, campuslike projects in the area. 
 The city is also well known as a desirable place to live. In 2006, Naperville -- population, 150,000 -- was No. 2 on Money magazine's annual list of the best places to live in the United States. The advantages include low crime and taxes, good schools and easy access to recreational opportunities. 
 ''Back in the 1980s, if you talked about quality of life, companies didn't want to hear about it,'' said Christine D. Jeffries, president of the Naperville Development Partnership, a nonprofit group that acts as a liaison between the city and the business community. ''Today, however, the H.R. department is front and center on the site selection team. That has worked to our advantage in terms of attracting new development.''
 Two recent corporate arrivals are OfficeMax and TransGuard Insurance; both relocated their headquarters to Naperville in the last two years. ''At the end of the day, what drives Naperville is that it's a good place for families to live and work,'' said Matthew Broad, executive vice president of OfficeMax, which moved to Naperville from suburban Cleveland. 
 Larry Writt, senior vice president of TransGuard, said, ''We're in the knowledge business, and there's a very high-quality work force out here.''
 All of this gives Mr. Calamos hope for the ultimate success of his project.
 He admits, however, that the learning curve has been steep. ''It's a lot different than running an investment firm,'' he said. ''When I buy a stock, it either goes up or down, and I'm either happy or disappointed. But with real estate, you have to be patient. It's going to take a few years for it all to come together.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Square Feet pages of Business Day last Wednesday about an ambitious commercial real estate project being built west of Chicago referred incorrectly to a company that was among those that built campuslike projects in the area in the 1970s and '80s. It was Amoco -- not British Petroleum, which Amoco merged with in the late '90s, ultimately to become BP.

HEADLINE: Text of the Fed Statement

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent.
 Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time. 
 Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
 Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting.
 In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4.75 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Planning to Delay Accounting Rules for Small Companies for Another Year

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to delay for another year the requirement that small companies report on the state of their internal financial controls, the agency's chairman, Christopher Cox, is expected to tell lawmakers on Wednesday. 
 In testimony prepared for a hearing of the House Small Business Committee, Mr. Cox said that he would propose delaying the rules until 2009 and that the decision on whether to require compliance would then be based in part on a study of costs to be conducted by the commission's economists.
 ''More than five years since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was signed into law, there are roughly 5,000 firms in the smaller public companies category that still aren't required to provide an auditor's report on their internal controls, as required by Section 404(b),'' Mr. Cox said, according to a copy of his prepared testimony provided by a Congressional staff member.
 The exempt companies generally have market capitalizations less than $75 million and represent a small percentage of the total market value of American companies, but they include a majority of all traded companies.
 The rule requiring that companies review internal controls and have them audited, provoked loud complaints about costs when it was initially put in place. The commission responded by granting repeated delays, and by revising the rules. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board published a new standard for auditors aimed at lowering costs.
 Under the new rules, smaller companies were supposed to begin having audits for fiscal years ending after Dec. 15, 2008. But many complained that they still did not want to do it and sought more delays. Mr. Cox said he could support a delay for one more year.
 He said the S.E.C. staff would study the costs and benefits of the new standard by sending a survey to companies and conducting more detailed interviews with some companies.
 Mr. Cox said that he expected the study to be completed no earlier than next June and that he wanted to see the results before making a final decision.
 The decision was praised by Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of New York, the chairwoman of the committee. ''This postponement is long overdue,'' she said, adding that forcing small companies to comply in 2008 ''would have had a detrimental effect on our economy.''
 The commission ''should use this time to garner the information necessary to ensure that the implementation of SOX 404(b) does not stifle innovation and entrepreneurship,'' she said, referring to the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley act that would impose the accounting requirement.
 In the past, Mr. Cox said that all companies would have to comply, although he did not say when. But he did not repeat that statement in his prepared testimony, instead saying that the commission would consider the results of the new study.
 If the full commission approves a delay, as seems likely, that would mean that a new president will be in office before most American companies are required to obey a law that was passed overwhelmingly during the second year of President Bush's first term.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 15, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about plans by the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay requiring small companies to adhere to some auditing requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act left the incorrect impression that the S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, was leaving the door open for an indefinite stay of the requirements. As the article noted, testimony prepared for Mr. Cox to deliver to a Congressional panel did not explicitly say that he wanted the commission to require small companies to obey the law after the delay. His testimony, however, did include a reference to a time ''when, eventually, smaller public companies do come into full compliance'' with the law.

HEADLINE: The Dream Is Dead

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 The man crowned by Tommy Franks as ''the dumbest [expletive] guy on the planet'' just made the dumbest [expletive] speech on the planet.
 Doug Feith, the former Rummy gofer who drove the neocon plan to get us into Iraq, and then dawdled without a plan as Iraq crashed into chaos, was the headliner at a reunion meeting of the wooly-headed hawks Monday night at the American Enterprise Institute.
 The room was packed as the former No. 3 at the Pentagon, previewing his upcoming book, ''War and Decision,'' conceded that the case could be made that ''mistakes were made.'' His former boss, Paul Wolfowitz, and the former Pentagon adviser Richard Perle sat supportively in the front row. 
 But he wasn't self-flagellating. He was simply trying to put an egghead gloss on his Humpty Dumpty mishegoss. 
 ''At the end of the day, here we are, and as of now there's a reasonable chance that the country is going to remain united,'' he said. Not quite the original boast of democracy cascading through the Middle East.
 Feith also inanely noted that his personal view was that his de-Baathification policy -- which created a huge, angry pool of unemployed men that fueled the insurgency -- ''was not basically a big error. It's been criticized very severely. I think there actually was a lot of good thought that went into the de-Baathification policy.'' It just spiralled out of hand, he said. Mistakes were made.
 He thinks everything would have been fine if America had not lingered so long in Iraq. If only Paul Bremer and the generals had just turned Iraq over to the slippery con man Feith wanted to put in charge, Ahmad Chalabi. 
 Asked about getting tough with Iran and Syria, Feith offered this incandescent insight: ''As we all know, the president said he's The Decider. That actually is quite a profound point. The president is The Decider and the main thing he decides about is risk.''
 He noted that in battles through American history, ''the military fights better over time.'' This from a guy who sent our military into Iraq without the right armor, the right force numbers or the right counterinsurgency training.
 ''A strategic alliance of the ousted Baathists and foreign jihadists was something that our intelligence community did not anticipate,'' he said, continuing to spread the blame.
 But the intelligence community didn't miss it. The neocons tried to scrub out that sort of analysis, knowing it would make the war harder to sell.
 Classified reports prepared for President Bush in January 2003 by the National Intelligence Council warned that rogue elements of Saddam's government could hook up with existing terrorist groups to wage guerrilla warfare.
 In ''Fiasco,'' Tom Ricks wrote that Feith's Pentagon office was dubbed the ''black hole'' of policy by generals watching him drop the ball.
 ''People working for Feith complained that he would spend hours tweaking their memos, carefully mulling minor points of grammar,'' Ricks wrote. ''A Joint Staff officer recalled angrily that at one point troops sat on a runway for hours, waiting to leave the United States on a mission, while he quibbled about commas in the deployment order.'' 
 Jay Garner, America's first viceroy in Iraq, deemed him ''incredibly dangerous'' and said his ''electrons aren't connected.'' 
 Feith's disdain for diplomacy and his credo that weakness invites aggression were shaped, Ricks reported, by personal history: ''Like Wolfowitz, Feith came from a family devastated by the Holocaust. His father lost both parents, three brothers, and four sisters to the Nazis.''
 Feith told Jeffrey Goldberg in The New Yorker that ''My family got wiped out by Hitler, and ... all this stuff about working things out -- well, talking to Hitler to resolve the problem didn't make any sense to me. The kind of people who put bumper stickers on their car that declare that 'War is not the answer,' are they making a serious comment? What's the answer to Pearl Harbor? What's the answer to the Holocaust?''
 What's the answer to bin Laden? According to Feith, it was an attack on an unrelated dictator. He oversaw the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group, whose mission was to amp up links between Saddam and Al Qaeda.
 It defies reason, but there are still some who think the chuckleheads who orchestrated the Iraq misadventure have wisdom to impart.
 The Pentagon neocons dumped Condi Rice out of the loop. Yet, according to Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Condi has now offered Wolfie a job. It wasn't enough that he trashed Iraq and the World Bank. (He's still larking around town with Shaha, the sweetheart he gave the sweetheart deal to.) 
 Condi wants Wolfie to advise her on nuclear proliferation and W.M.D. as part of a State Department panel that has access to highly classified intelligence.
 Once you've helped distort W.M.D. intelligence to trick the country into war, shouldn't you be banned for life from ever having another top-level government post concerning W.M.D.?

HEADLINE: Veto of Energy Measure Is Raised as a Possibility

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House has raised last-minute concerns over regulation of automobile emissions and fuel economy that aides said Tuesday could lead to a presidential veto of the energy bill now before Congress.
 The bill, which passed the House and is pending in the Senate, requires automakers to meet a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, but does not specify which government agency should enforce the new rule. 
 Primary regulation of mileage standards has historically fallen to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department. But vehicle tailpipe emissions are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, and a Supreme Court ruling this year affirmed the E.P.A.'s authority to regulate emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from passenger vehicles, which basically would mean regulating their fuel use. 
 The White House, echoing a position taken by auto manufacturers and a coalition of industry groups, is asking that the energy legislation be changed to specify the highway safety administration as the primary enforcer of fuel efficiency standards, with the E.P.A. in only an advisory role. Democratic leaders in Congress have rejected that position as a ''nonstarter'' and indicated their intent to move the bill with the current language intact.
 On Tuesday, senators and their staff members were negotiating other provisions of the House-passed bill. It appeared that a measure to require utilities to produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources would be dropped and a $21 billion tax package included in the House bill would be scaled down, although it was not clear by how much. A Senate vote on the bill could come as early as Thursday, aides said.
 Allan B. Hubbard, the director of the White House National Economic Council, wrote to Congressional leaders last week to warn that President Bush had strong reservations about some elements of the energy bill, including the mileage provision, known as the corporate average fuel economy rule, or CAFE. He said the bill the House passed ''creates substantial amounts of regulatory uncertainty and confusion'' over which agency would have the authority to enforce the new mileage rules.
 In a follow-up statement, the White House said, ''The bill needs to clarify one agency as the sole entity, after consultation with other affected agencies, to be responsible for a single national regulatory standard for both fuel economy and tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.''
 A senior White House policy adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity because confidential discussions with Congress are continuing, said the administration's concern was that Congress would specify a 35 m.p.g. standard that would later be overtaken by aggressive new rule-making by the E.P.A. as it seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the Democratic presidential candidates have called for even stricter mileage mandates, and California and 14 other states have petitioned the E.P.A. for permission to impose stringent carbon dioxide emissions limits on cars and trucks. 
 ''What we are saying is that we'd like to have D.O.T. and E.P.A. consult on both vehicle economy and greenhouse gases and set a standard and that should be it,'' the White House official said. ''Not that should be it until something or someone else comes along.''
 The primary way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide is to reduce the amount of carbon-based fuel consumed per mile -- in other words, to improve a vehicle's fuel economy. Burning ethanol and other renewable fuels also cuts the carbon content of emissions, and the bill before Congress calls for a huge increase in production of ethanol and other biofuels.
 The White House and many polluting industries consider this a critical battle because similar conflicts are likely to arise as the nation tries to slow and then reverse the production of the greenhouse gases that scientists blame for the warming of the planet. Late last week, representatives of a variety of industries, including petrochemicals, mining, refineries, manufacturers and paper products, also wrote to Congressional leaders asking them to settle the regulatory uncertainty in the auto mileage bill. They said greenhouse gases from manufacturers would be regulated by the Energy Department, the Commerce Department, the E.P.A. and other agencies, ''but current law provides little guidance on how they are to coordinate their responsibilities.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on a Rate Cut Considered A Disappointment to Fed Watchers

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
In the last couple of weeks, Wall Street grew hopeful that the Federal Reserve was poised to ease the tight credit market with an aggressive intervention. Tuesday, investors reacted as if policy makers had trampled on those expectations.
 Stocks fell sharply and investors rushed to the safety of Treasuries after the Fed announced that it had made only a quarter-point cut in the rate that financial firms pay to borrow from the central bank. There was also disappointment that policy makers did not take the opportunity to suggest they would be more aggressive in dealing with problems in the financial system.
 ''The Fed talked about inflation and it talked about growth, but what the market was looking for is centuries old -- keeping the financial market running smoothly,'' said Jerry Webman, chief economist and senior investment officer of OppenheimerFunds. ''That's where the disappointment lies.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 38.31 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,477.65, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 294.26 points, or 2.1 percent, to 13,432.77. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 66.60 points, or 2.5 percent, to 2,652.35. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 3.97 percent from 4.16 Monday.
 Citing slowing growth and ''strains in financial markets,'' the Fed cut its target rate for overnight lending between banks to 4.25 percent, from 4.5 percent, and its discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks, to 4.75 percent. 
 Many investors were hoping for a half-point cut in the discount rate, which would have made it cheaper for banks and other financial firms to borrow directly from the central bank. Market specialists say that would have eased the strain in the money markets, where banks have become increasingly reluctant to lend to one another, especially as the year comes to an end, when banks have a greater need for cash.
 One indication of the pain is the difference between the three-month London inter-bank offered rate, which tracks the rate at which banks are lending to each other, and the yield on comparable Treasury bills. Since late October, that difference has grown to 2.2 percentage points, from 0.95 points. Earlier, when credit was much easier, the difference was as little as 0.18 points.
 ''Liquidity is always challenged as you go into year end, but particularly this year,'' said Robert V. Gahagan, director for taxable investments at American Century Investments, a mutual fund firm. ''And the Fed didn't seem to take that into account.''
 Mr. Gahagan noted that aside from Treasuries, which are considered a safe haven, most debt investments fell after the Fed cut rates. Investors were stunned, in part because recent comments by Fed officials, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had suggested that central bankers would be more aggressive.
 Other market specialists say they are not sure the Fed can be very effective in easing the credit crisis, even if it were to cut rates further. These specialists assert that banks are reluctant to lend because they are not as sure about the quality of the collateral they are lending against as they were earlier in the year. They are also keeping more capital on their books because their investments in mortgage-related securities have lost value.
 ''It's that old saying that you can't push a string,'' said Len Blum, a partner at Westwood Capital, a boutique investment bank in New York. ''You can't make banks lend.''
 In the stock market, investors appeared to be concerned that the pullback in lending would increase borrowing costs for companies. Coupled with slowing consumer spending, that could hurt corporate earnings. ''As it becomes tougher to get capital from savers to investors,'' Mr. Webman said, ''everyone's earnings are likely suffer.''
 Not surprisingly, financial stocks took the biggest hit. The financial sector of the S.& P. 500 was down nearly 5 percent and accounted for more than 36 percent of the drop in the index. Washington Mutual, the thrift that on Monday said it was getting out of subprime mortgage lending and cutting its dividend, was down more than 12 percent.
 The sell-off is a sharp turn for the market, which had rallied in the last two weeks. The S.& P. 500 was up 7.7 percent from Nov. 26 to Monday. The index is still up about 4.2 percent for the year. The Dow is up 7.8 percent, and the Nasdaq is up 9.8 percent.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's auctions of four-week Treasury bills and five-day cash management:

HEADLINE: The Capital Of Slumping Home Sales

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Just south of Los Angeles, there is a small city called Paramount where houses have all but stopped selling.
 It's a city of bungalows and manicured lawns, far enough from downtown to have long been affordable to working-class families. But as home prices rose ever higher in other parts of Southern California, Paramount became all the more attractive -- and prices eventually soared there as well. By last year, the typical house sold for almost $500,000, up from $200,000 in early 2003.
 Many of those sales depended on adjustable-rate mortgages with tantalizingly low initial payments, and now that those mortgages are much harder to get, there aren't many buyers willing and able to pay $500,000. Yet sellers in Paramount haven't adjusted to the new reality by cutting their prices very much. Instead, the real estate market has frozen. 
 On Sunday, Luis Perez and his wife, Hilda, held their fourth open house since putting their apricot-colored stucco home on the market in August. They have reduced the price once, by about 5 percent. They still haven't received a single offer. 
 Since the summer, only about three homes a week -- including houses and condominiums -- have sold in Paramount. In the third quarter of this year, only 30 homes changed hands, down from 134 in the third quarter of last year. 
 That 78 percent drop is bigger than the decline in any other ZIP code in the country, according to an analysis that a research firm called DataQuick Information Systems did for me. The biggest declines can generally be found in moderate-income towns on the outskirts of major metropolitan areas, where adjustable-rate mortgages had become the norm. (In more affluent areas across the Northeast and California, the declines haven't been so big.)
 In parts of Florida, Arizona and Nevada, home sales have fallen more than 60 percent over the last year. In several ZIP codes in California's Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, the decline is greater than 70 percent. 
 But no other place can match Paramount, the capital of the great home sales bust of 2007.
 This year has been filled with predictions that the bottom of the real estate cycle was oh so close. In January, Donald L. Kohn, the vice chairman of the Fed, said that housing starts ''may be not very far from their trough.'' They have since fallen an additional 21 percent and are well below where they were for most of the 1970s. In recent weeks, some Wall Street analysts hopefully guessed that the mortgage-related credit crunch was entering its final phase. Instead, the giant bank UBS, in need of cash, sold nearly 10 percent of itself to the Singapore government this week.
 But the standoff between buyers and sellers in Paramount helps explain why we're still a long way from the bottom of the cycle. No matter how big a mortgage rescue plan the federal government puts together, no matter how much further the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the worst housing slump on record is going to continue into 2008 and probably beyond. The slump can't end until home prices come back in line with economic reality. 
 For decades, real estate values rose at roughly the same pace as incomes. Whenever prices got a little ahead of incomes, as they did in the late 1980s, they would quickly settle back down again. The recent boom was different: in just six years -- from 2000 to 2006, even as incomes were growing slowly -- the average home nearly doubled in price.
 Now that housing has lost its speculative luster and mortgages are harder to get, homes sales are plummeting, down more than 30 percent over the last two years. And as Thomas Lawler, a real estate analyst based in northern Virginia, says, ''Sales numbers tend to be a great leading indicator of prices.'' But it hasn't happened yet.
 Nationally, home prices have fallen only 5 percent from their peak early last year, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller Composite Home Price Index, the most accurate of the well-known measures. Instead of selling at reduced prices, sellers are holding out, hoping that the good times will somehow return. Paramount is simply an extreme example of the phenomenon.
 ''We got to a point in this area where the values far exceeded the capability of the median family,'' said Gary Endo, a real estate agent with Duke & Associates in Paramount. ''So people created a loan to bridge that gap. All they did was create a problem.''
 Mr. Endo added: ''We're going through that transition where sellers can't accept that prices are falling. They're still caught up in this idea that their property is worth more than it is. It's just strange.''
 Some homeowners will do just fine by remaining in their homes. Maria Angel, another real estate agent, said she thought Paramount's sales decline had been so large partly because the city attracts first-time home buyers who often decide to put down roots. If they can't get the price they want, they're happy to stay in their home. (Best piece of Paramount trivia: it's where Zamboni ice-cleaning machines were invented and are still made.)
 But other residents are refusing to sell for a grimmer reason: they're facing a spike in their monthly mortgage payments, and their homes may not be valuable enough to pay off their loans. Mr. Perez, who is 43 and works as a machine operator, bought his house for $380,000 six years ago. He later refinanced his mortgage and took out a home-equity loan. As a result, the interest rate on his new mortgage reset in October, causing the monthly payment to jump $1,300, to $3,900. 
 If he can't sell the house for something close to the asking price of $549,900, he expects the bank will take it from him. ''The truth is, I don't think my house will sell,'' Mr. Perez said in Spanish, to my colleague, Ana Facio Contreras. ''If in four months I've had no offers, I don't see how I'll get an offer now that it's more difficult to sell.''
 There are no perfect solutions at this point. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has decided to err on the side of caution, gently nudging banks to alter the terms of a small fraction of mortgages headed toward default. Democrats in Congress are pushing for a bigger rescue plan, one that puts more responsibility on the lenders that marketed all those ridiculous mortgages. The Democratic plan is clearly more humane than Mr. Paulson's, but it would also end up subsidizing some wildly irrational home purchases and borrowing choices.
 Either way, the real estate bust will not be over until prices have fallen significantly more than they have so far. That could happen quickly -- starting with a 10 or 15 percent nationwide drop next year -- or over many years, as inflation eats away at home values. 
 Mr. Perez, for one, thinks sanity will return sooner, if not soon enough. ''I assure you that in two years things are going to change,'' he said. ''But that doesn't help me now.''

HEADLINE: Credit Crisis Prompts Fed To Roll Back Rates Again

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark short-term interest rate Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.25 percent, and suggested that it would lower rates again if the credit crisis continued to damage not just housing, but the rest of the economy as well.
 The stock market dropped sharply after the Fed's midafternoon announcement, prompting Fed officials, in an unusual move, to put out word that they might take other steps before the end of year to inject money into the banking system. 
 Meeting in Washington, policy makers also cut the discount rate, which is what banks pay to borrow directly from the Fed. The quarter-point cut, to 4.75 percent, was less than Wall Street had been counting on, and that helped set off a selling spree that sent the Dow Jones industrial average plunging 294 points, or 2.14 percent. 
 ''The Fed's policy makers seem reluctant to say what everyone seems to know: that the risk to economic growth is the predominant concern today,'' said Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis-based forecasting firm.
 After the negative market reaction, Fed officials said they were actively looking at ''creative'' ways to help thaw credit markets well ahead of their next meeting, scheduled for two days in late January. 
 While the Fed has rarely changed interest rates between meetings in recent years, it did alter the discount rate after an emergency session this summer and has, at other times, changed the rules for borrowing outside of its scheduled meetings.
 Since the credit crisis erupted in August, the Fed has shaved a full percentage point from the federal funds rate, which is what banks pay to borrow from each other overnight. Rates on car loans, mortgages and consumer credit often rise and fall with that rate, and the hope is that with lower borrowing costs, lending will pick up again and spending will rise, preventing the economy from sliding into a recession.
 The bottleneck is the credit squeeze -- the reluctance of banks and other financial institutions to lend because of fear that they will not be repaid, given the defaults and foreclosures spreading in the mortgage market. 
 ''Consumers can get credit, but it is harder now and more costly than it should be,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
 Mr. Zandi and others were particularly critical of the Fed for not cutting the discount rate by at least half a percentage point and extending the loans to 90 days instead of the present 30 days. Banks often fund their operations by borrowing for 90 days at the London interbank rate, which is now just over 5 percent. Allowing banks to borrow at a significantly lower rate from the Fed's discount window, and for longer terms, economists said, would send a clear signal to financial institutions to encourage more activity.
 ''Maybe they weren't sure that a bigger discount rate cut would be effective,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, trying to interpret why the Fed passed up what he described as a golden opportunity to help ease the credit crisis. 
 In their statement after the meeting, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues, sidestepped a trap they had fallen into the last time they gathered, on Oct. 31. 
 At that meeting, they said the risk of a rising inflation rate was roughly equal to the risk that the economy would slow. That statement left the impression that the Fed's policy makers were done with their rate cuts. One Fed governor, Randall Kroszner, even declared on Nov. 16 that ''the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year.''
 But the economy weakened during November, various indicators suggested, and big financial institutions announced new multibillion-dollar write-downs on their portfolios of subprime mortgages. Mr. Bernanke finally signaled, in a speech on Nov. 29, that the Fed would cut rates again, after all, at Tuesday's meeting.
 This time, in their statement, the Fed policy makers left themselves much more flexibility, avoiding any mention of the comparative risks of either higher inflation or slower growth. 
 The Fed's statement found that core inflation had diminished, although there were upward pressures from ''elevated energy and commodity prices.'' As for the economy, growth was slowing, the statement said, ''reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending.''
 Adding to the concern over economic deterioration, the one dissenting vote, among the 10 votes cast, came from Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. He wanted to lower the federal funds rate by half a percentage point, not a quarter. 
 Housing is by far the weakest sector in the economy. Home sales are down and prices have fallen not just on the East and West Coasts, as they did in previous slumps, but in every region.
 Consumer spending has been less than robust in the opening weeks of the holiday shopping season, although well above the recession levels in the first two years of the decade.
 Corporate profits, which held up well through most of the decade, are now showing signs of retreat, and some economists say that capital spending on new machines and equipment might also be weakening. Job growth has clearly slowed in the last two years, but not drastically.
 Employers added 127,000 jobs a month, on average, over the past year, down from 186,000 in the previous 12 months, despite the tight credit markets. And the unemployment rate has remained below 5 percent. During the summer quarter, according to the Commerce Department, real economic activity advanced at a 4.9 percent annual rate. 
 But most economists expect the economy to slow sharply, with some predicting little if any growth in the last three months of the year, raising the possibility that the economy could falter even more into 2008, perhaps precipitating a recession.
 ''The financial headwinds facing the economy,'' said Richard Berner, co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, ''are going to last for a while.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Forces Move Into Southern Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Israeli troops accompanied by about a dozen tanks moved into southern Gaza on Tuesday, a day before Israelis and Palestinians were due to hold their first talks on a comprehensive peace following the American-led conference in Annapolis, Md. 
 The Israelis went as far as two miles into Hamas-run Gaza, near the towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah, and engaged Palestinian gunmen along the border, according to Palestinian residents and spokesmen for the Israeli Army. 
 At least six Palestinians were killed. Three of them, from Islamic Jihad, died when a tank shell struck the house they were using for cover; three more, from the Popular Resistance Committees, died from missiles fired by Israeli planes and helicopters.
 Twelve Palestinians were wounded, local medics said, three of them critically and five seriously. Four Israeli soldiers were ''very lightly injured,'' an Israeli Army spokesman said, when their Merkava tank was hit by an antitank missile. The soldiers were evacuated and the tank was set on fire, but the Israeli Army said it would continue to operate. 
 Other antitank missiles were fired but they missed, the army said. A squad of gunmen approaching the Israelis was hit from the air, the spokesman said.
 The Israeli Army said the operation was a routine effort to disrupt rocket and mortar assaults on army bases and the Israeli-controlled Sufa crossing into Gaza, similar to regular raids into Gaza over the past six months. Some 10 tanks and armored vehicles were taking part, the army said. Palestinians said the number of tanks and armored vehicles was closer to 30.
 Israeli soldiers detained scores of residents for initial questioning, Palestinians said. Normally, those detained are released, but a few are brought to Israel for further questioning about Hamas, Islamic Jihad and militant activity.
 Earlier on Tuesday, two more Palestinian fighters were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza, operations aimed at those trying to fire rockets or mortar rounds toward Israel. And another Palestinian died in Nablus, in the West Bank, while handling a bomb; three others were wounded as Israeli forces there arrested as many as a dozen Palestinians.
 On Wednesday, in Jerusalem, the so-called ''steering committee'' for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks will meet for the first time since the Annapolis conference, where the two sides agreed to try to reach a final peace treaty by the end of 2008 while working in parallel to put into effect the first stage of the dormant 2003 ''road map'' peace plan.
 The meeting on Wednesday will be organizational, each sides said, to set up a framework and discuss agendas and subcommittees for the major issues involved in any peace settlement -- issues ranging from the status of Jerusalem and the rights of refugees to the nature of a new Palestinian state, including air rights and military capacity.
 While Hamas runs Gaza, which Israel and the West are trying to isolate, the talks will be held with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, and his appointees, who are based in Ramallah.
 A Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, said of Tuesday's incursions, ''They believe that such operations will harm the resistance and weaken it, but they are mistaken.''
 Mr. Abbas and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, will continue to hold roughly biweekly meetings to guide the negotiating teams, which are led by Ahmed Qurei, a former Palestinian prime minister, and the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni. The Israelis say little work has been done on either side to organize the negotiations.
 Work on the first stage of the ''road map'' plan has also been minimal, and will take time. Under the plan, a staged peace plan written by the United States and supported by the West but never put into practice, the Palestinians are obligated to begin to crack down on gunmen and terrorism and stop incitement against Israel, while Israel is obligated to dismantle illegal outposts in the occupied West Bank, stop settlement activity and pull back from parts of the West Bank. 
 Next week, in Paris, countries will discuss aid to Mr. Abbas and his allies to help them build functioning state institutions in the West Bank. The Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, an economist appointed by Mr. Abbas, will ask donors at the Paris conference, scheduled for Dec. 17, to provide about $5.5 billion in aid over three years, at least 70 percent of it in budget support to help allow for needed financial reforms.
 Mr. Olmert has said that any final agreement with Mr. Abbas will not be put into effect until the first stage of the peace plan has been completed, as judged by the United States, and Gaza has returned to the control of Mr. Abbas.

PERSON: Thomas P. Whitney 

HEADLINE: Thomas P. Whitney, Solzhenitsyn Translator, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Thomas P. Whitney, a former diplomat and writer on Russian affairs who was best known for translating the work of the dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn into English, died on Dec. 2 in Manhattan. He was 90.
 Mr. Whitney's family confirmed the death. A longtime resident of Washington, Conn., he had lived in Manhattan in recent years.
 Mr. Whitney translated two of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's major books: ''The First Circle'' (Harper & Row, 1968), a novel of life in Stalin's prison camps; and ''The Gulag Archipelago,'' a 660-page historical expose of the Soviet terror system, published by Harper & Row in 1974. Both works, like nearly everything else Mr. Solzhenitsyn wrote in those years, had been banned in the Soviet Union and were smuggled out for translation. 
 Mr. Solzhenitsyn, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970, could not accept it until 1974, when he was forcibly deported to the West. His Nobel address, also smuggled out, was published in book form by Harper & Row in 1972, in Mr. Whitney's translation. (A competing translation, by F. D. Reeve, was issued the same year by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.)
 Mr. Whitney also wrote a memoir, ''Russia in My Life'' (Reynal, 1962), which chronicled the nine years he spent there at the end of the Stalin regime. In recent years he donated significant collections of Russian art and manuscripts to his alma mater, Amherst College, and established a Russian studies center there.
 Thomas Porter Whitney was born on Jan. 26, 1917, in Toledo, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's degree in history from Amherst in 1937 and a master's in Russian history from Columbia in 1940. During World War II, he was an analyst in Washington with the Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 From 1944 to 1947, Mr. Whitney was an attache and chief of the economic section in the United States embassy in Moscow. In 1947, he joined The Associated Press as a correspondent there, later becoming the Moscow bureau chief.
 During this period, Mr. Whitney, whose first marriage, to Tryphena Gray, had ended in divorce, married Yulya Zapolskaya, a Russian composer and singer of popular songs. She was allowed to return with him to the United States only in 1953, after Stalin's death, when she was finally granted an exit visa. From 1953 to 1959, Mr. Whitney worked in New York as a foreign editor for The Associated Press.
 Ms. Zapolskaya, who was known in her married life as Julia Whitney, died in 1965. Mr. Whitney's later marriages, to Judith Forrestel and Marguerite Carusone, ended in divorce.
 Mr. Whitney is survived by two children from his marriage to Ms. Gray, John Whitney of Great Falls, Va., and Louise Christofferson of Eugene, Ore.; a daughter from his marriage to Ms. Forrestel, Julie Whitney of Roxbury, Conn.; a sister, Mary McKenny of Toledo; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
 In 1991, Mr. Whitney endowed the Amherst Center for Russian Culture, to which he donated his vast library of Russian books, periodicals and other printed matter. (His collection includes manuscripts and correspondence by some of the most eminent literary figures to emerge from the Soviet Union, among them Ilya Ehrenburg, Vladimir Nabokov and Marina Tsvetayeva.) In 2001, he gave the college more than 400 pieces of late-19th- and 20th-century Russian art, including works by Alexander Rodchenko, Natalia Goncharova, Leon Bakst and Marc Chagall. 
 Mr. Whitney's other translations include volumes of Russian folk tales and the novel ''Forever Flowing,'' by Vasily Grossman (Harper & Row, 1972). In the late 1960s and afterward, he bred thoroughbred horses and ran a small string of independent bookstores in Connecticut.
 During the years Mr. Whitney was translating Mr. Solzhenitsyn, the two were never able to meet. They finally had the opportunity during the 18 years Mr. Solzhenitsyn lived in Vermont before he returned to Russia in 1994. On one occasion, Mr. Whitney took Mr. Solzhenitsyn to Saratoga Racetrack.
 ''He likes to be a very private person, and he was afraid he might be recognized,'' Mr. Whitney told Thoroughbred Times in 1991.
 Fortunately, Mr. Whitney added, ''The only person who recognized him was a Skidmore professor.''

 BODY:
SAVOIARDO--Maurizio, M.D., January 20, 1921 to December 10, 2007. Into heaven enters a peaceful, patient and gentle man.

HEADLINE: Wary of Protests, Exxon Plans Natural Gas Terminal in the Atlantic

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil said Tuesday that it would like to build a $1 billion floating terminal for liquefied natural gas about 20 miles off the coast of New Jersey, a move meant to deflect safety and environmental concerns about proximity to populated areas.
 The company plans to anchor a boatlike structure in the Atlantic Ocean to process natural gas imported by cargo ships from faraway suppliers in the Middle East, Europe and Africa. 
 The terminal, if approved, would connect through an underwater pipeline to an existing network that feeds New York and New Jersey, two of the top consumer markets in North America.
 Exxon's project is the latest of several dozen gas terminals that have been proposed in recent years in the United States. Energy specialists say more natural gas supplies will be needed to meet the growth in consumption and to make up for an expected drop in imports from Canada. 
 In many cases, energy companies have faced stiff opposition in finding sites for large new terminals. This has become one of the thorniest energy issues, especially since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, raised security concerns about cargo ships carrying liquefied gas near big cities. 
 Still, companies are slowly moving forward with their plans. Since 2002, federal and state authorities have approved 18 new liquefied gas terminals around the country, including 4 offshore, though most analysts do not expect all of them to be built.
 While most of the projects are planned along the Gulf Coast, the northeastern corner of the country is attracting attention because of its reliance on natural gas and its large populations. Two terminals to be built off Massachusetts gained approval last year. For Exxon, going so far offshore is an effort to duck the vociferous opposition that has dogged projects on both coasts. Its project, called BlueOcean Energy, would be able to supply 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, about 2 percent of the nation's gas consumption -- and enough to meet the needs of five million residential customers. 
 Exxon's project is the third offshore terminal proposed for the greater New York region in recent years. 
 One proposal, to build a gas terminal in the middle of Long Island Sound, has aroused concern since its announcement in 2004 because of the impact it might have on fishing and boating; it is strongly opposed by shore communities and politicians. 
 That opposition could intensify in coming months as the project, which is known as Broadwater and is a joint venture by Royal Dutch Shell and TransCanada, is expected to receive notice about federal and state permits.
 Another company, the Atlantic Sea Island Group, plans to build a terminal for liquefied natural gas on an artificial island about 14 miles south of Long Island, a project called Safe Harbor Energy.
 Opponents of natural gas terminals have cited the potential for leaks, fires, explosions or terrorist bombings. The industry has generally argued that the terminals are secure and accidents are rare, but it has also started looking for ways to build them as far as possible from population centers.
 Exxon said its plant anchored off New Jersey, about 30 miles south of Long Island, would not be visible from shore and would stay clear of shipping lanes and recreational areas. 
 ''We have tried to learn from our past experiences and that of the industry in general,'' said Ron P. Billings, Exxon's vice president for global liquefied natural gas.
 The company said it would soon start the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approval from state and federal agencies, as well as the Coast Guard. Because of the complex regulatory procedure, the plant is not expected to begin processing until the middle of the next decade.
 Natural gas shipped by tanker from abroad in a supercold liquid form accounts for about 3 percent of domestic consumption, but the government estimates that share could rise to 17 percent by 2030. At terminals like those proposed near New York, liquefied natural gas is processed into the gas form, which is used to heat homes, power electric plants and fuel many industrial activities. Natural gas accounts for about a quarter of the nation's energy supplies. 
 Imports of liquefied natural gas are expected to jump 35 percent this year compared with last. But the growth is likely to slow next year because of delays with new terminals, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. 
 ''So far no one has been able to crack the nut of getting infrastructure sited in the Northeast, and that's why you have all these proposals to go offshore and avoid heavily populated areas,'' said Mariano Gurfinkel, a project manager at the Center for Energy Economics at the University of Texas.
 Exxon's new project would receive two cargo ships a week. The gas would be carried by underwater pipeline that would come ashore at Raritan Bay in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Immigration Moves to Front and Center of G.O.P. Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and PAUL VITELLO; Paul Vitello reported from Council Bluffs, Iowa. Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mike Huckabee wrote a book this year in which he lamented the ''seething anger'' surrounding the immigration debate, advocated giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship and concluded that in the debate ''some of the rage is fueled by prejudice.''
 But on Tuesday Mr. Huckabee welcomed the endorsement in Iowa of Jim Gilchrist, the founder of the Minuteman Project, who has sent volunteers to the Mexican border to report illegal immigrants and who has been quoted in news accounts as warning that Congress could set off an ''insurrection'' if it offered amnesty to them. 
 It was the latest example of Mr. Huckabee's shift toward a harder line on immigration, which has emerged as a hot-button issue in the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. 
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll found that 8 percent of Republican primary voters named immigration or illegal immigrants as the most important problem facing the country -- just behind the war, and tied with the economy.
 Others are changing their tone, too. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who once said as mayor of New York that he welcomed hard-working illegal immigrants to the city, was quoted Tuesday in an excerpt from a new book as saying that he would have liked to deport all of the city's illegal immigrants but had been forced to bow to reality.
 In Iowa, Mr. Gilchrist praised Mr. Huckabee's plan ''to solve this illegal alien invasion problem.''
 The endorsement came the same day that one of Mr. Huckabee's rivals, Mitt Romney, began a negative advertising campaign focusing on some of the moderate immigration positions that Mr. Huckabee had embraced in the past, including his support for a proposal to give in-state tuition rates to the children of illegal immigrants. 
 The issue is likely to be front and center on Wednesday as the Republicans hold their last debate before the Iowa caucuses.
 Mr. Romney, whose strategy for the Iowa caucuses has been challenged by the new strength Mr. Huckabee has shown in recent polls, was endorsed Tuesday by National Review, the conservative magazine, which called him ''the most conservative viable candidate'' in the race.
 Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher, said that he was flattered to be the subject of the first negative advertisement of the race, and added that the timing of Mr. Gilchrist's endorsement was coincidental but ''providential.''
 Mr. Huckabee defended the tuition proposal at a debate two weeks ago, saying, ''We're a better country than to punish children for what their parents did.'' But last week he appeared to harden his tone, unveiling a new immigration plan that would give illegal immigrants 120 days to register with the government and leave the country before they could apply to immigrate or visit; it called for deporting those who did not and barring their re-entry for a decade.
 The hard line Mr. Huckabee is now taking differs markedly from his tone in the past. In his book ''From Hope to Higher Ground,'' which was published in January by Center Street, he wrote, ''It would be sheer folly to attempt to suddenly impose a strict enforcement of existing laws, round up 12 million people, march them across the border, and expect them to stay.''
 Mr. Huckabee also called in the book for ''giving those here illegally a process through which they pay a reasonable fine in admission of their guilt for the past infraction of violating our border laws and agree to strictly adhere to a pathway toward legal status and citizenship.'' He did not mention sending them back to their native countries.
 Mr. Giuliani has also changed his tone on immigration. He was quoted in The Washington Examiner on Tuesday as saying that when he was mayor of New York, he realized that the Immigration and Naturalization Service was not about to deport the estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants in New York.
 ''If they could, I would have turned all the people over,'' Mr. Giuliani said in the interview, which was given for the new book ''Meet the Next President: What You Don't Know About the Candidates'' (Threshold Editions), by Bill Sammon, a reporter for The Examiner. ''It would have helped me. I would have had a smaller population. I would have had fewer problems.'' 
 In 1994 as mayor, Mr. Giuliani said the opposite.
 ''Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens,'' he said. ''If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.'' 
 More than three-quarters of Republican primary voters described illegal immigration as a ''very serious'' problem for the country in the latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll, which was conducted Dec. 5-9. Fewer than half of Democratic primary voters described the issue as very serious.

HEADLINE: Chief Says G.E. Profit Will Grow 10% or More

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
To hear Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric's chief executive, tell it, his company is having a great 2007 and faces a very nice 2008. 
 Those were the main thrusts of a presentation that Mr. Immelt made to analysts Tuesday. For more than two hours, he laid out the company's prospects for 2008 and answered the expected questions: No, he does not intend to sell GE Money. Yes, G.E.'s growth overseas more than makes up for slow-growth areas in the United States. No, G.E. is not suffering unduly from the subprime mortgage crisis or other financial problems that have hit many of its competitors. 
 ''Time and again we've proved that our scale can help us grow,'' Mr. Immelt said. 
 Specifically, Mr. Immelt said that G.E. would deliver earnings of $2.19 to $2.21 a share this year -- an increase of 14 percent to 18 percent compared with 2006 results. Next year, he promised that earnings would hit at least $2.42 a share, and troubled units like health care and NBC Universal would continue to recover. 
 But while Mr. Immelt's voice remained on an even keel, there was one telltale sign of the frustration he has been feeling over G.E.'s stagnant share price: repetition. Again and again, he repeated: G.E.'s revenue will grow at two to three times gross domestic product next year, its return on total capital will exceed 20 percent, its earnings will grow by 10 percent or better, it will keep raising dividends and buying back shares, and its solid cash flow and high credit rating will enable it to keep investing in new businesses even as it continues to cut costs in existing ones.
 ''This is a great time to be a triple-A-rated company,'' Mr. Immelt said. The clear subtext to his comments was, ''Why aren't investors buying this stock?''
 Mr. Immelt's frustration is understandable. G.E. has shown solid organic growth for several years, yet its shares remain mired in the mid- to high 30s. The shares dropped 38 cents Tuesday, to $37.03. 
 Investors, apparently, simply want more than Mr. Immelt is promising. Many analysts were predicting earnings growth of 13 percent next year, so Mr. Immelt's promise of ''10 percent or better'' left them cold. 
 ''He was surprisingly conservative,'' said Daniel J. Rosenblatt, an analyst with Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, which owns G.E. shares. ''Saying 10 percent minimum doesn't preclude 13 percent, but it's not the same as saying between 10 percent and 15 percent.'' 
 G.E., of course, is a mixed bag of products and businesses, with an equally mixed bag of prospects. This year for the first time a majority of revenue will come from outside the United States. Much of the growth will be in the infrastructure division, which sells aircraft engines, power generators and other products and services that countries need to build transportation systems and other essentials of developing economies. And every plane or generator it sells will provide a stream of high-margin maintenance and repair services in years to come. 
 Mr. Immelt said the company would pursue many partnerships to help it expand its financial services businesses overseas. 
 But GE Healthcare, which just a few years back looked to be one of G.E.'s fastest-growing units, is still facing headwinds. At NBC, the Hollywood writers' strike may curb what had been a brisk turnaround. And, while G.E. has suffered far less than other financial companies during the subprime mortgage crisis, its consumer finance business did not emerge unscathed.
 ''Infrastructure looks fantastic, but GE Money and health care are slowing down the company's overall growth,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said. ''They need to get past them to have a really great 2008.''

HEADLINE: Hoboken's Rebirth Fuels School Aid Formula Fight

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J. 

 BODY:
In the early 1970s, Hoboken was so broken down that some residents feared for their lives. Crime and arson were rampant, and those who could afford to fled to neighboring towns like Secaucus.
 But gleaming restaurants and luxury condominiums now beckon affluent newcomers to Hoboken, like Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who keeps an apartment there. And the city's public school system, which once educated Frank Sinatra, is going through a renaissance, with enrollment growing to 1,874 students this fall, after years of decline.
 Hoboken's rags-to-riches transformation is often cited by critics of New Jersey's so-called Abbott system, in which 31 historically poor urban school districts receive the bulk of state school financing, to illustrate its shortcomings. Cities like Hoboken, these critics say, are no longer impoverished enough to merit special treatment. 
 ''Hoboken is exactly why we need a new school funding formula,'' said Assemblyman Bill Baroni, a Republican from Mercer County. ''Hoboken has been blessed by an economic renaissance that a lot of other towns have not seen. That's why we need to make a new formula that talks about kids and not ZIP codes.''
 Governor Corzine is expected to officially unveil a new school-financing proposal on Wednesday that would shift the emphasis away from the Abbott system -- which takes its name from a landmark New Jersey Supreme Court case -- by directing at least $400 million in new state education money to poor students who live outside the Abbott districts. 
 But Abbott districts say that academic achievement has risen significantly under the system and that they should not be penalized in an effort to expand benefits to the state's 584 other districts in rural and suburban areas. They also say that rising property values do not always mean more money for schools. 
 In Hoboken, for example, school officials said that a majority of their students come from housing projects, not the upscale condos whose owners often send their children to private or parochial schools. Seventy-five percent of the district's students are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, the seventh-highest level among all Abbott districts, according to state statistics. Union City is first, with 92.7 percent, followed by Passaic (84.7 percent) and Asbury Park (81.9 percent).
 Jack Raslowsky, the Hoboken schools superintendent, said that another point lost in the political rhetoric is that Hoboken receives far less state aid than the other Abbott districts. In the district's $54 million budget, state aid accounted for just $12.4 million, of which only $4.2 million for preschool programs was tied to its Abbott status. The local share of contributions was $35 million.
 But because it is an Abbott district, Hoboken's school construction projects are paid for by the state. This year, an $8.5 million renovation was completed on the Calabro elementary school. In the last five years, the state has spent $18 million to bring the district's six schools up to health and safety standards, which included repairing leaking roofs and replacing windows and boilers.
 The state has also agreed to renovate the Connors elementary school and the Brandt middle school and build a new $25 million school complex that will include high school and elementary school buildings and athletic fields to accommodate the growing enrollment, particularly in the preschool and lower grades.
 But those projects were suspended last year after the state ran out of money, and with the current debate over financing for Abbott districts, their future remains uncertain. Hoboken school officials say they cannot afford to pay for the new complex without state assistance.
 Mr. Raslowsky said that because they are in an Abbott district, his schools have been subject to more rigorous academic and financial oversight. In return, he said, he expects the state to follow through on its commitment to improve the district. ''We've been promised this great banquet,'' he said. ''We've finished the appetizers, but there's still the meal to go and we're hungry.''
 David Sciarra, an advocate for the children of the Abbott districts, called the criticisms of Hoboken a ''red herring'' because the district receives so little Abbott aid. More important, he said, were the educational reforms introduced under Abbott to address decades of neglect and concentrated poverty in urban schools. One such reform is the focus on preschool programs in Abbott districts. ''The Legislature could remove Hoboken from Abbott, but it must have a plan in place to continue those educational reforms,'' he said.
 At the Connors elementary school, which overlooks a housing project, the 300 students were supposed to move into temporary classrooms this September while their century-old building was being renovated. When the renovation was suspended, students stayed where they were and the building remained in disrepair. 
 The Abbott money has paid for three preschool classes at the school, two of which are squeezed into the basement because of a shortage of classroom space. The free preschool program has helped many families. Danny LaViena, 49, a repairman, said that his 4-year-old grandson, Selman Brashaw, was able to attend preschool only because of the Abbott money. 
 ''We're low-income people, and we can't get no money to pay for that,'' he said.
 But on Monday afternoon, as a dozen 4-year-olds napped on mats on the floor of one classroom, their teachers rattled off the things that they still did not have: their own bathroom, child-friendly sinks or even a school playground.

HEADLINE: China Agrees to Post U.S. Safety Officials in Its Food Factories

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: XIANGHE, China 

 BODY:
China and the United States, seeking to ease the furor over the safety of food exports, signed an agreement Tuesday calling for a greater American role in certifying and inspecting Chinese food products, including an increased presence of American officials at Chinese production plants. 
 The agreement came as Chinese and American representatives exchanged tough words over recent trade and economic disputes in Beijing on Tuesday and later on Wednesday at the opening of high-level talks in this suburb of the capital. 
 The safety accord, part of several aimed at easing economic tensions with China on a number of divisive subjects, would impose new registration and inspection requirements by Chinese food exporters for 10 specific products, with the United States government maintaining a public list of the exporters' records.
 Michael O. Leavitt, secretary of health and human services, said he expected that Food and Drug Administration officials would eventually be embedded in China's food safety bureaucracy to help train Chinese officials and keep records on their inspections.
 ''The Chinese recognize, as do we, that having F.D.A. personnel here would expedite the process of capacity building and increase cooperation and communication,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''I am optimistic that it will occur.''
 American officials said that the agreement did not cover all the food products sought for tighter inspections, but that it could be expanded. It is to cover some preserved foods, pet food ingredients and farm-raised fish, all products that the United States has said were tainted.
 Andrew C. von Eschenbach, F.D.A. commissioner, said that agency officials were already allowed to inspect Chinese facilities under limited conditions, but that the agreement signed Tuesday would expand that role and possibly set a model for similar agreements in other parts of the world.
 ''This agreement will provide an opportunity to have our people here on a continuous basis with expertise so that we can work with our Chinese colleagues in helping to develop good practices,'' Dr. von Eschenbach said.
 Despite the accords, the economic talks in Beijing and at the Grand Epoch conference in Xianghe were filled with tough talk, including angry complaints by China over the Bush administration's challenge to Chinese practices before the World Trade Organization and its imposition of duties on Chinese goods.
 Opening the ''strategic economic dialogue'' on Wednesday morning, Vice Premier Wu Yi warned the American delegation not to engage in ''confrontation and finger pointing'' or in ''politicizing trade issues,'' and suggested that American leaders were blaming China for their country's own economic shortcomings.
 In his opening comments, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. declared that ''economic nationalism and protectionist sentiments'' were rising in China as well as the United States. If China is unhappy with anti-Chinese sentiment in Congress, he said, it must respond by doing more to open its own economy to American investments and goods.
 According to American officials, the piracy of videos, music and other intellectual property was a source of heated discussion behind the scenes on Tuesday between Susan C. Schwab, the top American trade envoy, and Ms. Wu.
 At the opening of the talks, Ms. Wu defended China's record of fighting piracy and counterfeiting and suggested that the United States' action at the W.T.O. was unfriendly. She also charged that the American news media had ''hyped'' the issue of food safety, ''causing serious damage to China's national image.''
 After reporters were ushered out, Ms. Schwab was reported by American officials to have said that despite American concerns, the Bush administration would continue to go to the W.T.O. to get satisfaction and ''we will win'' in that forum.
 The exchange over the issue was so heated that the meeting concluded more than an hour late, American officials said.
 The food and feed accord signed on Tuesday was the centerpiece of a flurry of 14 separate agreements worked on over the last several months and completed in the last couple of days. Most of them came under the heading of a joint commission on trade and economic issues that met most of the day at China's official guest house.
 Most of these agreements involved familiar commitments by the Chinese to take stronger action against piracy and counterfeiting of trademarks and of software, movies and other intellectual property. The deals are also meant to ease some restrictions in Chinese regulations that have made it hard for American companies to export to China.
 Carlos M. Gutierrez, the Commerce secretary, hailed the accords as helpful in improving the atmosphere leading up to the bigger set of meetings on Wednesday. 
 In addition to agreements to impose registration and certification requirements on imported Chinese drugs, medical devices and active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, there were accords on promoting American tourism for Chinese, on joint development of biofuels and on expanding science and technology exchanges. 
 Mr. Gutierrez said China agreed not to impose, at least for now, an inspection requirement on imported medical devices like heart monitors, stents and surgical implants, which had been the focus of complaints by big producers like Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific.
 That restriction was to be directed at imported medical devices, not ones made in China, which American officials saw as evidence that China was beginning a new policy of ''economic nationalism'' aimed at discouraging American investments and imports in favor of its own industries.
 American officials have recently stepped up complaints that China was using sophisticated regulations to make it more difficult for American products and investments to enter its markets. The complaints have focused on financial services, cellphones, motorcycles and other goods.
 Ms. Wu, apparently anticipating American concerns, said at Tuesday morning's open session, before reporters were barred, that she had heard of these concerns and wanted to rebut them. ''China's door will be open forever,'' she declared, adding that ''reform and opening up'' were in China's interest.
 After Ms. Wu spoke, Mr. Gutierrez repeated concerns about ''economic nationalism'' just as reporters were ushered out. At a news conference Tuesday evening, he said he was somewhat reassured by what he had heard.
 ''I felt that the assurance was quite strong,'' he said. But other American officials said they were not so sure. 
 The biggest breakthrough Tuesday was accomplished not by the administration's economic team of Ms. Schwab, Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Paulson, but by Mr. Leavitt on the food safety issue. American officials said this was an essential agreement to defuse American anxieties.
 But Mr. Leavitt acknowledged that much remained to be done to put it into effect.

HEADLINE: Bill and Hillary Clinton's Pitch in Iowa: 'I Love the '90s'

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

DATELINE: Grinnell, Iowa 

 BODY:
 Bill Clinton, his once salt-and-pepper hair now almost all salt and his fiery speaking voice subdued, went on a swing through Iowa on Monday. The trip -- the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign's fight-celebrity-with-celebrity answer to Oprah Winfrey's stumping for Barack Obama -- was meant to be forward-looking. But Mr. Clinton could not help looking backward. 
 His talks, which were chock full of references to his White House days, underscored a largely unspoken fault line between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. Their battle is, to a great extent, a referendum on a decade. 
 It is hard to think of the onetime boy governor of Arkansas and ''Comeback Kid'' as a nostalgia act, but Mr. Clinton was quick to concede that it was so. He had become, he said wryly, an old racehorse that the Democrats haul out every two years at election time to see if he can still make it around the track. Now, when he speaks about national health insurance, he talks about his heart surgery. The man whose theme was once the musical refrain, ''Don't stop thinking about tomorrow,'' told a gym full of Grinnell College students that at some point ''you realize you have more yesterdays than tomorrows.''
 The polls say voters today are desperate for change, and Mr. Clinton, ever the obliging politician, gave his audiences what they came for. The theme of his engaging, unscripted remarks -- delivered to audiences in Ames, Newton, Grinnell and Iowa City -- was that Mrs. Clinton has always been a ''change agent.'' He cited examples from her antiwar speech at her Wellesley graduation to her recent Senate campaign to get body armor for troops in Iraq.
 Mr. Clinton, however, had a way of returning to the 1990s. When he warned that the growing gap between rich and poor was one of the nation's biggest problems, he noted that the poorest Americans had it better ''in the eight years we served.'' He told his Grinnell audience about the millions of additional people who got student aid during his years in office, and he worked in as an aside that in his two terms in office, 22.7 million jobs were created. 
 In praising his wife, Mr. Clinton talked about her lifetime of accomplishments but paid special attention to her work as first lady. On one stop, he blurted out something that seemed to be on his mind all day. ''I hear a lot of people say we don't want to refight the battles of the '90s, and I agree with that,'' he said. ''I sure would like to have some of the victories of the '90s.''
 A few years ago, Mr. Clinton made a now-famous observation about a different decade. ''If you look back on the '60s and think there was more good than bad, you're probably a Democrat,'' he said. ''If you think there was more harm than good, you're probably a Republican.'' 
 In the current presidential primary, the Clinton campaign is based largely on a speeded-up nostalgia -- like the VH-1 television show ''I Love the '70s.'' It is premised on the notion that the 1990s -- with its strong economy, technology boom and pre-Sept. 11 innocence -- was a golden age rudely interrupted by two terms of George W. Bush.
 Mr. Obama is more forward-looking. When he talks of uniting the nation and moving beyond partisanship, he could be attacking the Clinton era as much as the Bush years. His supporters see him as a new kind of president, ushering America into a more diverse, more global, post-ideological age. 
 Put that way, the advantage might appear to be Mr. Obama's, since he comes off as the more profound agent of change. On the other hand, in presidential elections, voters rarely venture far outside their comfort zones. They may not be able to imagine what an Obama presidency would look like, while they can remember a Clinton presidency quite well.
 Mrs. Clinton has lost ground in the polls recently, but the latest New York Times/CBS News poll suggests that looking backward may be good politics. When Democratic primary voters were asked why they support their candidate, the most common answer was ''good experience.'' The second most common: ''married to Bill Clinton.''

HEADLINE: Republican Presidential Debate

 BODY:
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE PARTICIPANTS: FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI REPRESENTATIVE DUNCAN HUNTER FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN REPRESENTATIVE RON PAUL FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY REPRESENTATIVE TOM TANCREDO FORMER TENNESSEE SENATOR FRED THOMPSON FORMER AMBASSADOR ALAN KEYES MODERATOR: CAROLYN WASHBURN 
 MS. WASHBURN: We're going to start with a discussion about the financial situation facing our country, which was the single biggest issue Iowans of both parties wanted you to talk about. I'd like to ask everyone briefly to answer this question, and then we're going to talk more specifically.
 The comptroller general has said the U.S. faces a tsunami of debt that is a great threat to our national security. Do you agree our country's financial situation creates a security risk? And why or why not?
 We're going to just go down the line, starting with Mayor Giuliani. And please limit your answers on this to 30 seconds. 
 MR. GIULIANI: I believe that it's a major problem, and it's one that hasn't been addressed the way it should be over the course of the last seven, eight, maybe really 20 years. And there are three major things that we have to do.
 First, we have to reduce government spending, and we have to be very disciplined about that. And we have to do it by imposing spending caps on the civilian agencies in governments -- 5 percent, 10 percent, maybe 15 percent. We have to say that we're not going to rehire half of the civilian employees that come up for retirement. Forty-two percent are coming up over the course of the next eight to 10 years. They should not be rehired. That would give us a $20 billion, $22 billion reduction. The other would even be higher. And then we have to reduce taxes. Right now we should reduce the corporate tax. We should reduce it from 35 percent to 25 percent.
 It would be a major boost in revenues for the government. Most importantly, it would be a way of dealing with our fiscal policy in the same way that the Fed is dealing with our monetary policy to create more liquidity.
 And then there are other taxes we should get rid of. We should get rid of death tax and a whole group of others, but the first one should be the corporate tax.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay. Yes or no. I just want to be sure that I'm clear. Is the debt a threat to our national security?
 MR. GIULIANI: I would say I would look at it --
 MS. WASHBURN: (Inaudible.)
 MR. GIULIANI: I wouldn't call it national security. I would call it economic security. It's very, very important. I think --
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman?
 MR. GIULIANI: -- Islamic terrorism as being national security. Economic security is also very important.
 REP. HUNTER: There are two debts that are a threat to the national security. One is the budget deficit, which is going to be about $161 billion this year, but the real deficit, the real loss that we have right now that is a threat to national security is a trade loss. The trade loss this year is going to be $800 billion. It's going to be $200 billion to communist China, which is rapidly becoming our banker, and there's an old saying, ''You don't want to have a banker who doesn't have your best interests at heart.'' We should level the playing field. We should stop China from cheating on trade, bring back a lot of those high-paying manufacturing jobs to this country that we pushed off-shore. That means bigger paychecks. That means more money going into the Federal Treasury and to Social Security and to Medicare, eliminate those twin deficits, and we'll be on the right track.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 We do need to stay at 30 seconds. This is not the time to get behind.
 Congressman?
 REP. PAUL: It's absolutely a threat to our national security because we've spent too much, we tax too much, we borrow too much, and we print too much. When a country spends way beyond its means, eventually it will destroy the currency, and we're in the midst of a currency crisis. Our dollar is going down rapidly as we speak. It's because we have lived beyond our means. We can't afford the foreign policy that we have. We have to cut back. We have to live within our means. If we're going to spend money, we ought to spend it at home, and that is why we have to change this foreign policy. We can't afford it to do what we're doing today because it will destroy our dollar.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 REP. TANCREDO: The reason why it becomes a national security problem is because the bulk of our imbalance of trade is a result of our importation of oil from countries that are not our friends. That's really where it rests. Most of the stuff that -- the rest of the stuff we bring in doesn't constitute that kind of threat to the United States. But when we are supplying funds, supplying the funds for the people in other countries that have an intent -- a malicious intent in regard to the United States, it's a national security issue.
 So of course, energy independence is one huge step in the direction of trying to alleviate that problem.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator?
 MR. THOMPSON: Our country has a 9 trillion-dollar debt. A good chunk of that is owned by China. We're bankrupting the next generation without any question. Every economist in Washington who's looked at it will tell you that. It affects our national security; for one reason is because we're squeezing military spending. We're spending at below historic norms under these circumstances for our defense, and we're spending twice as much for entitlements.
 That's why I put out a specific Social Security plan that'll save Social Security while saving the government $4 trillion. It's all in entitlements. We've got to spend more for the military, as a matter of fact. But we've got to look at Social Security and Medicare and do some things now that won't hurt anybody badly but will save it for the next generation.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor?
 MR. ROMNEY: This is, indeed, a time of extraordinary challenges in this country, and the overspending in Washington and the overpromises that we've made are certainly among those challenges. But this is not a time for us to wring our hands and think that the future is bleak. In fact, the future is bright. We need leadership in Washington that'll rein in excessive spending, and we also need leadership that will help America grow.
 The best answer for our economic woes is to make sure we have good jobs for our citizens, good schools for our kids, good health care for everyone, and that we have policies that promote the growth of the nation. We can have a little playing field around the world, get ourselves off of foreign oil, reduce the excessive spending in Washington, and have a bright future for our kids. This, again, is based upon the strength of the American people. If you want to see a strong America, you don't look to Washington; you look to ways to strengthen the American people.
 MR. HUCKABEE: It's most certainly a national security threat because a country can only be free if it can do three things.
 First, it has to be able to feed itself. It has to be able to put food on the table for its own citizens.
 Secondly, it's got to be able to fuel itself. If it looks to somebody else for its energy needs, it's only as free as those are willing for it to be.
 And it also has to be able to fight for itself. It's got to be able to manufacture its own weapons of defense -- tanks, airplanes, bullets and bombs.
 When we start outsourcing everything and we are in that kind of a trade deficit, then just remember, who feeds us, who fuels us and who helps us to fight, that's to whom we are enslaved. So if we can't do those three things, our national security is very much at risk.
 SEN. MCCAIN: Of course, any nation that no longer has economic strength sooner or later will lose its military strength, so it's a national security issue.
 We have many trillions of dollars of unfunded liability. Obviously, we've been on a spending spree. We cannot increase taxes.
 If oil reaches $100 a barrel, which many people think it may, $400 billion from America treasure will go to oil-producing countries. Some of those -- those monies will go to terrorist organizations. We have got to achieve energy independence, oil independence in this nation. I will make it a Manhattan Project, and we will in five years become oil independent.
 MS. WASHBURN: Ambassador?
 MR. KEYES: I think it's obviously a national security problem, but you have to understand what national security is. The Constitution defines it as securing the blessings of liberty. It has to do with the freedom of our people. If you want to secure the blessings of liberty for the American people, you cut off the spigot that funds the political ambition of our leaders by abolishing the income tax and restoring control of 100 percent of their income to the American worker. That means you replace it with a fair tax system that puts the American people in control of their money. By doing that, you will encourage the politicians to stop spending to fund their little political cliques and only limit their spending to what actually produces results for the American people.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 I want to dig into the budget issue a little bit more. You'll have 30 seconds to answer this next question, and again, I want to start with Mayor Giuliani.
 What sacrifices would you ask Americans to make to lower the country's debt? And I'd like you to be specific.
 MR. GIULIANI: Well, I think the most important thing is the federal government has to restrain its spending. That's the area in which we're hurting ourselves and in which we're creating this problem -- national security, economic security, however you define it. The problem is not the American people.
 What we should be doing is restraining the amount of money that Washington spends in a concerted way, with major reductions in civilian spending, using attrition, and returning -- actually leaving more money in the pockets of the American people. The strength of America is not its central government; the strength of America are its people. Restrain the central government, give people more choice, more money to spend, we're going to see our economy booming.
 That's the kind of future where we can have unlimited dreams.
 MS. WASHBURN: So, Mayor, you've said you would cut non-military spending 10 percent across the board. What sort of sacrifices would that require from people who use those government services?
 MR. GIULIANI: Well, that would -- that would require their trying to figure out other ways to do it. I mean, rather than moving in the direction of more people on government medicine, I'd rather see us reduce the income tax burden, create an exemption for health care so people can buy their own health care. So that's going to require they take a little bit more time, take a little more ownership of their health care. Rather than relying on government as the nanny government, let's rely on people to make choices about their health care. Let's rely on, instead of 17 million people buying their own health insurance, 50, 60, 70 million. You'll see the price come all the way down and you'll see the quality come up. That's an American solution. It's a bold one, but it's the kind of thing America has done in the past. We rely on our people, not on our government.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Congressman Paul, what sacrifices would you ask Americans to make for debt reduction?
 REP. PAUL: I think it's absolutely unnecessary to sacrifice. We want to give people more freedom, more chance to spend their own money. It's unnecessary.
 We can cut by looking at our foreign policy. We maintain an empire which we can't afford. We have 700 bases overseas. We are in 130 countries. We cut there, and then we have a better defense of this country, and the people get that money and they get to spend it here at home. There's no need to sacrifice. We need more liberty, more rights for the people to spend their own money. And in this -- in that situation, there is no sacrifice and no need for it.
 MS. WASHBURN: So, Governor Huckabee, your colleagues seem to think there is no sacrifice needed to reduce the debt. Do you agree? What would you do?
 MR. HUCKABEE: Sometimes it's not so much doing things so that people sacrifice; it's doing them differently. Let me give you an example. A lot of the federal budget goes to health care. We need to
 do what most American companies are finding works in reducing health care cost. That's moving from the intervention-based health care model to a prevention-based.
 Our current model is upside-down. We wait until people are catastrophically ill and then we spend the most expensive ways of trying to cure incurable diseases. If we would put the focus on prevention, we would find, like American business is finding, that there really is savings if you kill the snake rather than just treat the snakebites, which is the way our current system is built.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Romney, I'd like you to address this first. You'll have one minute.
 Are there programs or situations that are so important that you'd be willing to run a deficit to pay for them?
 MR. ROMNEY: Well, we don't have to run a deficit to pay for the things that are most important because we can eliminate the things that aren't critical. You know, in the private sector, where I spent the first 25 years of my life and most of my career, you learn how to focus on the things that are most important, and you get rid of the things that aren't. We have, in the federal government, 342 different economic development programs, often administered by different departments.
 We don't need 342. We probably don't need a hundred of those. We probably need a lot fewer than that. We have 40 different programs for workforce training. There are probably five or six that are really working and a lot that are not working terribly well. We can get rid of some of those. We have 13 different programs to prevent teenage pregnancy. Well, they're obviously not working real well, and we can probably cut it down to one or that are making a difference.
 And so what anyone in the private sector's learned how to do is to focus their resources on those things that have the biggest impact, that are most important. Surely, protecting our country and our defense of our military is critical. Getting our free market finally able to allow all of our citizens to have insurance, health insurance, that's something we did in Massachusetts. Improving our schools with school choice, better pay for better teachers -- these are a lot of things that we can do, but they don't require us to eliminate the things that are most critical in our society. Instead they require us to get rid of those things that are unnecessary.
 And the sacrifice we need from the American people, it's this: it's saying let the programs that don't work go.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. ROMNEY: Don't lobby for them forever.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Congressman Tancredo, how would you answer that?
 REP. TANCREDO: I would say that there is a way and a very clear way to actually establish what the government needs to do in order to reduce its -- the cost that it incurs and to do what is right, and that is called follow the Constitution of this country. The Constitution is a limiting document. It tells the federal government what it can and cannot do. Today we do far too many things that exceed our constitutional -- the constitutional bounds that are placed there.
 We have a responsibility. It is to protect and defend this country. Concentrate on that. Concentrate on doing what's right and what the Constitution itself gives us the responsibility for, and the rest of that stuff becomes extraneous. And honestly, if you think about it, if you ask America, what would you do, what would you sacrifice, the one thing I would say is this: Don't ask the government for womb-to-tomb protection for your life, to build a bubble around you because all of that will cause a humongous amount of money and money that we don't have.
 But we will respond to you, politicians will do it, because they want the vote. Don't ask, and I guarantee you my administration will remain inside the bounds of the Constitution.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator Thompson, could you answer that? Are there programs or situations so important you'd be willing to run a deficit for them?
 MR. THOMPSON: Yes, the military, the security of our people, first and foremost, always; our infrastructure, which is coming apart; and research and development, which is going to help us solve some of the problems in the future as far as energy and a lot of other issues.
 But I want to take a chance on telling the truth to the American people. Our entitlement programs, by 2040 or so we're going to eat up our entire budget. Now we'll go all day here and nobody else will talk about that obvious problem that we've got we've got to address.
 The thing about it is that we can do it now without hurting those programs with -- actually strengthening those programs so that our kids and grandkids have -- I don't think we as American people are so selfish that we're going to put this off the table, kick the can down the road and let everybody else solve that problem, you know, when our grandkids get to be working age. That's not America; that's not what makes us strong.
 And specifically, as far as Medicare is concerned, we need to tell people that are in Warren Buffet's category we're not going to take care of all your Medicare in the future; we can't afford it.
 MS. WASHBURN: Well, which leads me nicely to the next question. I want to go down the line in reverse order and hear from everyone very briefly, please, 15 seconds or so.
 Who in this country is paying more than a fair share of taxes relative to everyone else: the wealthy, the middle class, the poor or corporations?
 Starting with Mr. Keyes.
 MR. KEYES: It's one of those let you and him fight questions the people in the media always want to get us involved in; because they would like to pretend that the tax question is about fighting amongst ourselves when the real sacrifice that's required from the American people we need to start sacrificing some of these incumbents who have funded their political ambition using our money --
 MS. WASHBURN: Remember, we have 15 seconds.
 MR. KEYES: -- who have spent overboard into deficits after promising us on the Republican side that they would limit the government, and then produced the highest budget deficits in the history of our country.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator McCain?
 MR. KEYES: I think we need to stop listening to these phonies and start looking for people who will actually fulfill the words that they speak. That's what I think.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator McCain?
 SEN. MCCAIN: I know that I'm happy to say low-income Americans, except for payroll taxes, don't pay taxes, but we've got to reform the tax code. Nobody understands it. Nobody trusts it. Nobody believes in it. And we have to fix it. And we can't raise taxes as our Democrat friends want.
 So I don't know exactly who's paying the most of the burden, but I would say that the American people need a tax code they can understand and that they know is fair.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee?
 MR. HUCKABEE: Over 80 percent of the American people know that the tax code is irreparably broken. I would lead one to a fair tax, and that means that the rich people aren't going to be made poor, but maybe the poor people could be made rich. That ought to be the goal of any tax system -- not to punish somebody, but to enable somebody so that they can have a part of the American dream. The fair tax does just that.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Romney?
 MR. ROMNEY: I don't stay awake at night worrying about the taxes that rich people are paying, to tell you the truth.
 I'm concerned about the taxes that middle class families are paying. They're under a lot of pressure. Gasoline's expensive. Home heating oil, particularly in the Northeast, is very difficult for folks. Health care costs are going through the roof. Education costs and higher education are overwhelming. And as a result, we need to reduce the burden on middle-income families in this country.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay, a little snappier, gentlemen. (Laughter.)
 Senator Thompson.
 MR. THOMPSON: My goal is to get into Mitt Romney's situation, where I don't have to worry about taxes anymore. (Laughter.)
 MR. ROMNEY: (Off mike) -- your situation. (Laughter.)
 MR. THOMPSON: (Off mike) -- you know, you're getting to be a pretty good actor actually. (Laughter, cross talk.)
 Five percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country. 40 percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all. I think we need to concentrate on preserving the tax cuts of '01 and '03. That's going to be a monumental battle that's going to be coming at the end of 2010.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman.
 REP. TANCREDO: Everyone that is presently paying tax, you could be -- you can make a case that they're paying too much. The reality is, of course, you need a different system entirely. We do need to move away from this archaic -- a system that taxes productivity, which is what we do, to a system that allows for a fair tax. I believe in that.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Congressman.
 REP. PAUL: The most sinister of all taxes is the inflation tax and it is the most regressive. It hits the poor and the middle class. When you destroy a currency by creating money out of thin air to pay the bills, the value of the dollar goes down, and people get hit with a higher cost of living.
 It's the middle class that's being wiped out. It is most evil of all taxes.
 REP. HUNTER: The tax that we're all paying that doesn't help anything -- it doesn't go to defense, it doesn't go to the roads, it doesn't go to medical care -- is the $250 billion-plus that we pay each year not to the federal government, to the Treasury, but to prepare our taxes, defend our taxes, and for the massive cost of the IRS. That's all overhead -- 250 billion-plus dollars. What we ought to do is have a system -- the fair tax system is a good one, or a flatter tax or a simpler tax, because that young couple that pays 1,450 bucks in taxes may pay $450 to their tax preparer. That's a second tax.
 MS. WASHBURN: Mayor?
 MR. GIULIANI: A flatter tax, a simpler tax that you could file on a one page, as an option, would be a good idea. Reducing the corporate tax, as I suggested. Reducing income tax rates across the board, which would mostly benefit the middle class. That's where the focus should be.
 But we've got to reduce taxes across the board, and we should give the death penalty to the death tax. It really is a very unfair tax.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Periodically throughout the debate, we'll give each of the candidates 30 seconds to make a free statement. The candidates drew for the order, and we'll hear from the first two candidates now: Senator McCain, followed by Congressman Hunter.
 SEN. MCCAIN: Thank you.
 I've devoted my life in uniform and in public office to keeping this nation safe. I've been involved in every major national security issue of our time.
 That kind of experience is what's given me judgment, the judgment to oppose a failed strategy in Iraq, a judgment to call for the strategy that's succeeding now. And I wasn't very popular because of it. I have the judgment and the experience, and I believe that I can ask every American to serve. I have one guiding principle, one ambition, and that is to keep America safe and to achieve and maintain our greatness.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Hunter?
 REP. HUNTER: You know, I stand for a strong national defense, enforceable borders and bringing back high-paying manufacturing jobs to this country that we've pushed off-shore with bad trade deals. I've been a member of the Armed Services Committee for 26 years now, and I've chaired that committee for four years. And I'm one of the few guys up here whose worn the uniform of the United States, and my own son has done now three tours in the Middle East, coming back on Thanksgiving.
 I know what it takes to secure this country, and I also built that border fence in San Diego that worked so well. And I wrote the law that takes it across Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, and as president, I will finish that border fence in six months.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 I want to come back to some issues that affect the economy. You'll have 30 seconds again. The longer you go on, the shorter we'll have to go. Thirty seconds to answer these questions, and we're going to start with Congressman Paul.
 One in five jobs in Iowa depends on exports to foreign countries, but we're also exporting a lot of high-wage manufacturing jobs. What's your plan for keeping foreign markets open while protecting good-paying American jobs?
 REP. PAUL: Well, we need to adopt free trade agreements with other countries. Today we inhibit the export of, say, farm products to countries like Cuba. It's time we changed our attitude about Cuba. We should be looking to open these markets, but our markets get closed for monetary reasons because our chief export is our dollar.
 Because we have the reserve currency of the world, people take these dollars and our jobs go overseas. You can't solve any of these problems if you don't look at the monetary system and how it contributes to these job losses in order to provide the prosperity for our people here at home.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Romney, would you answer that?
 MR. ROMNEY: You know, I've spent the last -- as I told you, 25 years in the private sector. I understand why jobs come and why jobs go. I've done business in over 20 countries around the world, and I understand how we can build more strength in our own economy and that's by investing in education, investing in technology and innovation, getting ourselves off of foreign oil, and making sure that the playing field we play on around the world is level. It's not right now. We're going to have to re-negotiate deals with people like those in China that manipulate their currency to put their products in advantage over ours. We want to make sure that we do not have a circumstance where people close down their markets to our goods because we can compete anywhere in the world. One out of three agricultural acres is planted to go off-shore, so don't put up barriers to keep us from being able to trade.
 America can compete anywhere in the world, and to remain a superpower, we must compete around the world.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee?
 MR. HUCKABEE: Well, job migration is a result of three things: when you have excessive taxation that penalizes the productivity of a company; you add to that excessive regulation, which means that you've got more red tape than is possible to get through. And I would say that as president one of my goals would be I can't part the Red Sea, but I believe I can part the red tape. And the third thing is we've got too much litigation. When a company goes into business, particularly small business, from which 80 percent of all American jobs come, most small business people can't fight off the potential liabilities that they come from all of the lawsuits and litigation.
 Take care of those three things, we won't see the incredible level of job migration that we see today.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Some of our big trading partners commit human rights violations.
 Considering that poverty and abuse are often blamed for fostering terrorism, should we alter trade policies with those countries?
 Senator McCain.
 SEN. MCCAIN: Well, obviously we should make sure that every nation respects human rights, and we should advocate that and try to enforce it. But I will open every market in the world to Iowa's agricultural products. I'm the biggest free marketer and free trader that you will ever see.
 And I will also eliminate subsidies on ethanol and other agricultural products. They are an impediment to competition; they are an impediment to free markets. And I believe that subsidies are a mistake, and I don't believe that anybody can stand here and say that they're a fiscal conservative and yet support subsidies which distort markets and destroy our ability to compete in the world, and destroy our ability to get cheaper products into the United States of America.
 MS. WASHBURN: I'm going to move to the next question. What specific changes should be made in NAFTA?
 Mayor Giuliani.
 MR. GIULIANI: I think the main thing is it should be enforced. And the reality is, NAFTA has been a good thing. I was concerned about NAFTA and I became convince, watching it, that it's actually helped us.
 Our percentage of exports, percentage of our GDP, has gone up dramatically from something like 9 percent to 11 percent. It's brought more jobs to America.
 America should think about free trade, global economy, as something we want to embrace. This is what we've always wanted. And America's a country of entrepreneurs and dreamers and creators, and what we should be thinking about is, how much can we sell to these people? As they're coming out of poverty -- 20 million, 30 million people in India, China -- these are new customers for the United States of America.
 And then we have to make sure that we have a level playing field. That's very important. But we shouldn't lose the goal of free trade.
 We're big dreamers here in this country. We've got plenty we can sell all over the world that will make up for what we're buying.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator Thompson, what specific changes would you make to NAFTA?
 MR. THOMPSON: Well, I think free trade and fair trade is the backbone of our economy. I think it's been just as good for us as it has Mexico. In fact, I think Mexico needs to think about that when they criticize us for trying to enforce our border. They export or send more people out of the country every year than we do, in terms of illegal aliens. So it's been a good thing for both countries.
 It's a long, complex document. I have nothing in particular to point out. I just think we need -- need to make a commitment to free and fair trade and make -- and enforce the agreements that we've got.
 The problem is, too many people close their markets to us.
 They want to trade with us, but they want to place undue restrictions to our manufacturers and to our farmers. We can't stand for that.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Tancredo?
 REP. TANCREDO: NAFTA has been a disaster for a lot of places and especially Mexico. Southern Mexico it was a disaster. It destroyed the entire agricultural economy. Guess what happened? They all came north. If NAFTA had worked so well as everybody on the stage appears to think it did, why would we still have so much pressure on our southern border from people trying to escape from a country that does not provide them with the economic opportunities that it -- that NAFTA promised?
 What, of course, is also ingrained in this whole discussion is the lack of sovereignty, the fact that our borders are now meaningless, the fact that Mexican trucks can come across essentially without being checked. These are the problems with NAFTA, and they have to be unwound.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Hunter, you wanted in on that?
 REP. HUNTER: Absolutely. You know, when we had a $3 billion trade surplus with Mexico when we passed NAFTA, and the advocates said we're going to build on that surplus. Today we have a massive trade loss. We went immediately to a $15 billion trade loss. We've had that now for the last many years. And let me tell you, if you take your product made in Iowa down to the Mexican border right now and tried to get it across, you will pay a 15 percent tariff, which they moved into place after we passed NAFTA.
 You know, trade deals are business deals between nations, and we haven't made good business deals between nations. And NAFTA is a bad business deal.
 MS. WASHBURN: I want to move on and hear the three statements from our next two candidates, Congressman Paul first, and then Senator Thompson.
 REP. PAUL: The goal of all political action should be to preserve liberty. We need more freedom in this country. We need to look to ourselves in what we are doing.
 We have drifted so far from our Constitution that the government that -- the Constitution was written to restrain our government. Yet we turned around, and the Constitution now is used to restrain the people. But we have no chance if we don't restrain the government, all that they do in undermining our personal liberties, controlling our economic well-being and using our -- using it as an excuse to police the world. If we don't change the role for government, this country is going to suffer a very, very serious economic crisis.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator Thompson.
 MR. THOMPSON: On all these issues, I've been a strong, consistent, common-sense conservative. But the most important issue facing our country, and will be for a long time, is national security and the safety of our people.
 I've spent a lot of time, both in and out of government, traveling, talking to foreign leaders, dealing with these issues. I know the world we live in. I think I know what we need to do. I think that it's going to require strong leadership.
 And I would ask people to think one thing before they cast a vote. When our worst enemy is sitting down at the negotiating table thinking about what he can do to the United States of America, who do you want sitting on our side of the table representing you? That's probably the guy you ought to elect president.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 I want to take on a new issue. I would like to see a show of hands. How many of you believe global climate change is a serious threat and caused by human activity?
 MR. THOMPSON: Well, do you want to give me a minute to answer that?
 MS. WASHBURN: No, I don't. I --
 MR. THOMPSON: Well, then I'm not going to answer it. (Laughter, applause.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay.
 MR. HUCKABEE (?): How about 30 seconds?
 MS. WASHBURN: No, I -- you know, I want --
 MR. THOMPSON: You want a show of hands, and I'm giving it to you.
 MS. WASHBURN: We're going to follow up on that, but what I need to know is who believes global climate change is serious and caused by human activity.
 MR. GIULIANI: I do.
 MS. WASHBURN: And then we'll talk in more detail about it.
 MR. : Serious? It is.
 MR. GIULIANI: I believe that global climate change is a serious --
 (Cross talk.)
 SEN. MCCAIN: And I think climate change is real, and I --
 MR. HUCKABEE (?): Let's have a chance about it --
 (Cross talk, laughter.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Go -- I'm going to start with Senator McCain, come back to Mayor Giuliani.
 SEN. MCCAIN: I've been involved in this issue since the year 2000. I have had hearings. I've traveled the world. I know that climate change is real.
 But let me put -- put it to you this way. Suppose that climate change is not real, and all we do adopt green technologies, which our economy and our technology is perfectly capable of. Then all we've done is given our kids a cleaner world.
 But suppose they are wrong. Suppose they are wrong, and climate change is real, and we've done nothing. What kind of a planet are we going to pass on to the next generation of Americans? It's real. We've got to address it. We can do it with technology, with cap-and- trade, with capitalist and free enterprise motivation. And I'm confident that we can pass on to our children and grandchildren a cleaner, better world.
 MS. WASHBURN: Mayor Giuliani?
 MR. GIULIANI: I agree with -- I agree with John. Climate change is real. It's happening. I believe human beings are contributing to it. I think the best way to deal with it is through energy independence.
 MS. WASHBURN: Who doesn't agree?
 MR. GIULIANI: And I think energy independence is a --
 MR. : That I agree with.
 MS. WASHBURN: Who doesn't agree?
 REP. HUNTER (?): But he said ''contributing'' but not totally --
 MR. : No -- yes.
 MR. : No.
 MR. : Yeah.
 MR. : Oh, okay.
 MR. : Yeah.
 MR. : Yeah.
 MR. : Well, and I -- (laughter) --
 (Cross talk.)
 REP. HUNTER (?): On our party, you're getting closer --
 SEN. MCCAIN: More than contributing, my friend --
 MR. ROMNEY (?): Give us -- give us each a chance.
 MS. WASHBURN: I did.
 MR. GIULIANI: And I think that our party should embrace this as an issue for us, in our positions --
 MS. WASHBURN: Well, let me come at this way. Let me come at it this way. What impact on the economy would be acceptable in order to reverse global warming and greenhouse gas emissions?
 Governor Romney?
 MR. ROMNEY: Well, it's going to help our economy because we're going to invest in new technologies to get ourselves off of foreign oil, and as we get ourselves off of foreign oil, we also dramatically reduce our CO2 emissions. That's good for the environment; it's also good for our economy. Because $300 to $400 billion worth of oil a year from other people who use it against us, that's bad for our economy, it's also bad for the environment.
 MS. WASHBURN: So then our --
 MR. ROMNEY: We can do these things in a way that help both the environment and the economy and national security. That's the beauty of what we're talking about here, which is, yeah, is global warming an issue for the world? Absolutely. Is it something we can deal with by becoming energy independent and energy secure? We sure can.
 But at the same time, we call it global warming, not America warming. So let's not put a burden on us alone and have the rest of the world skate by without having to participate in this effort. It's a global effort, but our independence is something we can do unilaterally.
 MS. WASHBURN: Mr. Keyes, what do you think about this?
 MR. KEYES: Well, what I think is that a lot of folks out there ought to understand that what you're watching represents the situation in our country. Ask yourself who represents the people they don't let you hear from, and you'll know who you should vote for in the Iowa caucuses. Who represents the voice that they're absolutely determined to overlook in the discussion of our sovereignty and the betrayal of this people's sovereignty -- on the border, on our moral principles, on the major export overseas, which is our jobs.
 These folks represent the very elite, who year after year after year have destroyed our Constitution, betrayed our rights and undermined our strength, created by our people in the world. And yet the one person willing to talk about that is overlooked time and time again. That person represents you.
 MR. THOMPSON: I agree with Alan Keyes's position on global warming. (Laughter, cross talk.)
 MR. KEYES: I'm in favor of reducing global warming because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air -- (off mike) -- politicians, who pretend one thing and don't deliver. (Laughter, cross talk.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Let me come to a question that Iowans may not let you out of answering.
 Governor Huckabee, you've said you support increasing government mandates requiring motorists to use $36 million of biofuel by 2022, which is six times what we're producing this year. Are you willing to increase that mandate, even if it will drive up feed for livestock producers or force consumers to by flex-fuel vehicles?
 MR. HUCKABEE: I don't think that's what's necessary. And the reason that this issue ought to be important is because we don't own this earth. We are simply stewards of it, caretakers. And I know on a day like today, it's hard to believe there is global warming, if anybody's been in Iowa on a day like today.
 But climate change and who's causing it is of less importance than what Senator McCain said, and he's exactly right.
 We have done no harm if we take better care of this planet and give it to our children with cleaner air, cleaner soil and cleaner water. We have done --
 MS. WASHBURN: So are you willing to increase the mandate?
 MR. HUCKABEE: I am willing for us to make the decisions which will not necessarily create the mandates. And let me tell you how we do it.
 You know who one of the biggest energy users is in the whole country? The United States government. If the government commits to being the primary user of alternative forms of energy, we have a market built in. And therefore, the big argument against having alternative energy is there's no market for it. Well, let the government be a marketplace and we'll create the kind of demand that lowers the price rather than raises the price.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Hunter.
 REP. HUNTER: You know, I'd say instead of mandates, incentives. The problem with mandating only biofuels -- and you know, ethanol's not the -- is not the greatest thing in show business. You use a lot of energy to create ethanol, and there's other biofuels out there -- biodiesel, et cetera. But by giving incentives in R&D and by bringing our government laboratories together with business, with our educational institutions, the United States can become the center with a grand new industry of energy innovation. We can be the leaders in the world in this. But you don't want to -- you don't want to push away things like hydrogen, fuel cells and other things. Incentives is the way to go. And we should take the entire array of alternative energy sources and give incentives to private enterprise to get involved and get into the business of delivering us a great product. And we can produce a great new industry for this next generation.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Tancredo, what would you do about mandates?
 REP. TANCREDO: No, I don't believe in mandates. I don't believe that they should be increased. I believe that the market is the best determinant of exactly how these problems should be addressed.
 I don't mind and I would not be opposed to any investment in research and development, but the idea that the government knows the right amount somehow, some way -- some brilliant analyst -- usually some politician who hasn't the slightest idea of the issue -- will make a decision about what is the right amount of mandate to impose on the rest of the country. And you know what? It never works out right. Let the market -- I trust the market more than I do the government.
 MS. WASHBURN: Let's hear free statements from two more candidates -- first, Congressman Tancredo, and then Governor Huckabee.
 REP. TANCREDO: We have had 40 years of unlimited -- 40 or 45 years, really -- of unlimited immigration, both legal and illegal, into this country. It has become a -- that is a problem. Unlimited, massive immigration is a problem. But when it happens commensurately without the same amount of assimilation, it becomes a catastrophe.
 It will become what Teddy Roosevelt warned of when he said you have -- you can have immigration, but if it happens without assimilation, all you end up with is not a nation, but a polyglot boarding house. Some of my friends on the stage, both governors and senators, said they -- we should trust their judgment. Well, their judgment is what got us into this problem, so we need to trust somebody else to get us out.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee.
 MR. HUCKABEE: I think people in this country are looking for leadership. They're looking for change. They're not looking that people would be elected to be so much a ruling class, but a servant class. We've forgotten that. Our Founding Fathers had a brilliant, really revolutionary idea, that the people elected would not represent the elite, but would represent the ordinary. Our Founding Fathers had the idea that when we are elected, we're not elected as a part to be elevated up, but to truly remember who it is we work for. I think sometimes that's what's happened in America: we forget that our job is to keep this country safe first and foremost, and it's to try to encourage Americans to be their best at everything they do. And I can tell you, it's a long way from the little rent house I grew up in to this stage. I'm still in awe that this country would afford kids like me the opportunity to be a president. I'll try not to forget where I came from and where this country needs to go.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 A new topic that some Iowans say hasn't had enough debate during this campaign, and that's education. American 15-year-olds ranked behind 16 other countries in a recent assessment of science literacy. What educational standards does the U.S. need to adopt or improve to compete in the global economy, and what will you do to move us toward those standards, and what's your timetable?
 Senator McCain.
 SEN. MCCAIN: The answer to the problem in education in America is simple: We need more choice and more competition. Entrance by a good student into a college today, they have a number of choices and people are seeking them to be part of those educational institutions.
 We don't have a choice in competition. We need it in K through 12. We need more charter schools. We need vouchers where it's approved by the local state and school boards. We need to have clearly home- schooling if people want that. We need to reward good teachers and find bad teachers another line of work. We need to have all of these compete.
 In my home state of Arizona, we have charter schools, some have failed, but they're competing with the public schools, and the level of education is increasing. In New York City today, there's some remarkable things happening under Mayor Bloomberg and Joel Klein, who have done marvelous work with an educational system that was clearly broken. Those can be examples of a way to improve education in America, provide choice and competition and give every American family the same choice I and my family had, and that is to send our child to the school of our choice.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you. Thank you.
 Mayor Giuliani?
 MR. GIULIANI: I'm here because of the educational choices my parents made or I wouldn't be here or have achieved anything that I've achieved, and that's the place where the decision should be made. Instead of having these education standards done in Washington by the Education Department or some bureaucrats in a state capital or -- or in a board, the choice should be made by parents.
 Parents should choose the school that their child goes to, the same way people choose higher education.
 Has it ever occurred to -- to us that higher education is still the very, very best in the world? And it's -- you're asking me about K through 12. Well, higher education is based on choice. It's based on a large consumer market. It's based on competition.
 It's the area of K through 12 where we have this government command sort of approach. And if we -- if we give the choice to parents, where they can choose a private school, a parochial school, a public school, a charter school, home schooling --
 MS. WASHBURN: Time.
 MR. GIULIANI: -- let them be the -- be the decider, I think we'll see a big revolution in education.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Hunter?
 REP. HUNTER: Three words: Jaime Escalante and inspiration. Jaime Escalante was a great math teacher who in the barrio of Lose Angeles taught young kids calculus, and he taught them so well that the school district called up and said, ''We got a problem. We think your kids are cheating on the tests.'' And he said, ''Test them again.'' And he established this incredible system of calculus in the school district by inspiring young people.
 How many of us have -- have our careers -- can -- can point back to a teacher and say, ''That teacher inspired me''? What we have to do is take away the bureaucratic credentialing of teachers and allow people who are aerospace engineers and -- and pilots and scientists and retired folks to come in and inspire young people in third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Let -- let's inspire them to reach for the stars and give them the incentive to work hard enough to get there -- inspiration, changing the credentialing system, and school choice.
 MS. WASHBURN: Hasn't that teacher since left the public school system?
 REP. HUNTER: And you know why? I read the -- the -- the post- mortem on Jaime Escalante is that the unions ran him out of the school district, and I think that goes right to one of the -- one of the big problems that we have.
 MS. WASHBURN: If we need to improve our educational system quickly to be more competitive in the world, does the federal government need to exercise different influence than it has historically over educational standards?
 If so, in what ways? And if not, how do you encourage state to meet national goals to move us forward?
 Governor Romney.
 MR. ROMNEY: Carolyn, these are 60-second answers, right?
 MS. WASHBURN: Yes.
 MR. ROMNEY: Okay, let's make sure, because time's going pretty quick here.
 Education's an important topic. And the president was right to fight for No Child Left Behind, because we allow states now to test our kids and see how well they're doing, particularly in math and English. We've made the same effort in our state, actually before No Child Left Behind was passed.
 We test our kids; we have high standards. We teach them in English, English immersion. We say, to be successful in America, you've got to speak the language of America.
 We also put in place incentives for kids to do well. For those that take the graduation exam, which you have to take to get out of high school, we say that you're going to get, if you score in the top 25 percent on the test, a four-year tuition-free scholarship to a Massachusetts institution of higher learning.
 MS. WASHBURN: But what about the role of the federal government?
 MR. ROMNEY: And the federal government insists on those tests and those standards, and it's key, and let me continue. I think we also have to have higher pay for better teachers. And people who are not good teachers ought to find a different career.
 And finally we need more parental involvement. And we've tested our kids in Massachusetts, along with all the other kids in the nation. 50 states get tested every two years in English and math, in 4th and 8th grade. My 8th graders came out number one in English. They came out number one in math. My 4th graders: number one in English, number one in math.
 First time in history: one state, number one in all four measures. School choice, better pay for better teachers, high standards, scholarships for the best kids, English immersion: These principles work.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee.
 MR. HUCKABEE: First of all, the whole role of education is a state issue. It's not really a federal issue. And the worst thing that we can do is to shift more burden, more responsibility, more authority to the federal government when more of it needs to go to the states.
 But I think the federal government can play a pivotal role in -- primarily in helping to make sure that the best practices that are working in the states are shared with states who are struggling. Let me give you a couple of examples of what has to happen in all the states, and the federal government can at least share the data and the information.
 One, personalize the learning for the student. We have 6,000 kids every day drop out in this country. They don't drop out because they're dumb; they drop out because they're bored to death. They're in a 19th-century education system in a 21st-century world. If we really are serious, then first of all we make sure that we build a curriculum around their interests rather than just push them into something they don't care.
 Second thing, unleash weapons of mass instruction. I'm a passionate, ardent supporter of having music and art in every school for every student at every grade level -- (applause) --
 MS. WASHBURN: Time.
 MR. HUCKABEE: -- because -- let me just make sure you understand why -- it's not frivolous. It's because if we don't develop the right side of the brain with the same level of attention as we do the left, which is the logical side, we end up with an unbalanced, bored student, which is exactly what we've done, and we're dropping students out of our system because of it.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Paul, what's the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education?
 MR. KEYES: (Off mike.) Do I have to raise my hand to get a question? I'd like to address that question.
 MS. WASHBURN: I'm getting to you.
 MR. KEYES: I would like -- no, you're not. You haven't since several go-arounds so I have to make an issue out of it. I would like to address the question of education.
 MS. WASHBURN: Go ahead.
 MR. KEYES: I don't wish it to --
 MS. WASHBURN: Go ahead. You have 30 seconds.
 MR. KEYES: They had a minute. Why do I get 30 seconds? (Laughter.) See your unfairness is now becoming so apparent that the voters in Iowa must understand there's a reason for it, and the reason for it is what I'm about to say.
 Governor Huckabee just addressed the question of education. He has stood before values voters and moral conservative claiming that he is their spokesman. You know the major problem in American education today? We allowed the judges to drive God out of our schools. We allowed the moral foundation of this republic, which is that we are created equal and endowed by our Creator, not by our Constitution or our leaders with our rights. If we don't teach our children that heritage and the moral culture that goes along with it, we cannot remain free. They will not be disciplined to learn science, to learn math, to learn history, to learn anything, and they don't want to talk about this except when they're squabbling about their own personal faith and forgetting that we have a national creed. And that national creed needs to be taught to our children so that whether they are scientists or businessmen or lawyers, they will stand on the solid ground of a moral education that gives them the discipline they need to serve the right, to exercise their freedom with dignity, and to defend the justice because they understand it is our heritage.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Paul, what's the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education in the United States, and how would you address it?
 REP. PAUL: Probably the federal government. We've been involved at the federal level for our 50 years. We've had a Department of Education. It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education.
 We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we doubled the size of the Department of Education and we have No Child Left Behind. The teachers don't like it, the students don't like it, and the quality of education hasn't gone up; the cost of education has gone up.
 So we need to look to our local resources, we need to release the creative energy of the teachers at the local level. But we can do immediately is to give tax credits -- I have a bill that would give tax credits to the teachers to raise their salaries. At the same time, we should encourage homeschooling and private schooling and let the individuals write that off. The parents have to get control of the education. It used to be parents had control of education through local school boards. Today it's the judicial system and the executive branch of government, the bureaucracy, that controls things, and it would be predictable that the quality would go down. The money goes to the bureaucrats and not to the educational system at home.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Senator Thompson, how would you answer that?
 MR. THOMPSON: The question was what's the biggest impediment to education?
 MS. WASHBURN: What is the biggest obstacle standing in the way, and how would you address it?
 MR. THOMPSON: The biggest obstacle, in my opinion, is the National Education Association, the NEA. I read time and time again -- every time someone wants to inject a little choice into the equation for the benefit of the kids, inject a little freedom, inject a little competition because we're not exactly doing that well because of the things that you pointed out earlier, the NEA is there to oppose it, and bring in millions and millions of dollars to go on television and work and scare people and misrepresent the situation on the ground.
 I think that that just goes against everything that we know, that can make progress in this country.
 We're a nation of freedom and innovation and choice, and well-to- do people are out in the suburbs. They don't seem to care that much. Inner city people need a chance to enjoy the choice that the mayor's talking about for colleges and universities.
 Other people have choice too. If they're wealthy enough to move into a neighborhood because they want their kid to go to school there, that's choice too. Let's give it to everybody else and let's stop people from standing in the way of that.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Congressman Tancredo, what's your take on all that?
 REP. TANCREDO: Yeah, the -- I had the opportunity to serve under Ronald Reagan as the regional director for the U.S. Department of Education. Our task was to try to narrow it down, because we knew we couldn't legislatively get rid of it although we wanted to. And so I went -- in my region, we went from about 222 people. It took us about four or five years to get down to about 60 people.
 I used to always say, we've gotten rid of 80 percent of the people in this department; has anybody been able to tell the difference? And you know what? Not a single soul said they had.
 And something else: If we had gone to 0, you'd never know the difference. That's because we don't need the department. It's an encumbrance on our attempt to actually teach children in this country, as is the federal government and its intervention and its rules.
 But you can't, I don't think, Governor, with all due respect, you can't say on one hand, you're against having government intervention and on the other hand, tell us that you want music and art and everything else in the school. That's not the job of a president. It is the job of a governor. That's what you should run for if you want to dictate curriculum. (Applause.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee, would you like a rebuttal? You have 30 seconds.
 MR. HUCKABEE: Well, I made very clear to the congressman that what I suggested was that the federal government become the clearinghouse. It chose the best ideas. I was a governor 10-and-a- half years.
 I had executive experience longer than anyone on this stage running a government. And I had also the most, I think, impressive education record. And you know what? I looked for what other states were doing that worked. I was looking for all the ideas. We raised standards, we measured, and we held people accountable for the results.
 Any time you give governors the opportunity to know what will work, they'll use it, because it means jobs, it means economic development. That's exactly the only role.
 But if anyone doubts that the president ought not to use the bully pulpit to encourage the best practices, I would say the secondmost job of importance to the president, second to being commander in chief, is to be the communicator in chief.
 And we're losing a lot of kids in this country. A third don't graduate. For a president to say, ''That's none of my business,'' is recklessly irresponsible. A president needs to say it's unacceptable that that many kids leave our schools every single day.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay. Governor Romney.
 MR. ROMNEY: Just one small adjustment to what Governor Huckabee had to say. And I don't believe you had the finest record of any governor in America on education. (Laughter.) And -- because there's another one on the stand who -- who -- whose kids outperform me. The -- the kids in our state, as I indicated, scored number one in all four measures on the national exams, and they did that because of Republican principles, free market principles, applied -- and there was a partnership.
 You see, education is not just the teachers' union. I agree with -- with Senator Thompson on that. Boy, they've been the biggest obstacle to change in education and -- and choice. It's not just that the -- one side of this; it's teachers, it's parents, it's the state, it's the federal government, it's all levels coming together and working together for the benefit of our kids.
 And we face right now an education challenge that's really unusual. We're behind. America's behind in education. Our kids score in the bottom 10 or 25 percent in exams around the world among major industrial nations.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. ROMNEY: And we've got to have the kind of change that requires all of us working together, not just poking and saying it's someone else's job.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 In light of the big needs and the financial realities we've just discussed up to this point, realistically, what do you believe you could accomplish in your first year as president?
 We're going to go down the line, starting with Mr. Giuliani. And so that everyone gets a chance to talk, I need you to keep your remarks to 30 seconds.
 MR. GIULIANI: We can make sure that the country is secure against Islamic terrorism and on the road to winning the war against Islamic terrorists. We could end illegal immigration by beginning a border stat system. It might take two or three years, but we could begin it. We could do a major tax reduction, the ones that I indicated earlier, to stimulate the economy. I would immediately begin to reduce the size of the federal government the way I did when I was mayor of New York. And I would move toward energy independence as a goal similar to putting a man on the moon, the Manhattan Project. You can use a lot of ways to describe the imperative nature of it, but I would make sure that we accomplish energy independence. We would do things that we hadn't done before and that we previously thought were impossible. And you need bold leadership to accomplish that, and I think I can do that.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman.
 REP. HUNTER: First, you got to strengthen the U.S. military. You know, we have to look at the horizon past Iraq and Afghanistan and see the emergence of a North Korea with nuclear capability, Iran proceeding on that path despite what the NIE says, and also the emergence of communist China as a new superpower stepping in the shoes of the Soviet Union.
 So strengthening the military and meeting those horizon threats, and also strengthening our border, enforcing the U.S. border -- that means building the border fence and making sure that we know who is coming into this country, what they're bringing with them -- lastly, bringing back the industrial base of the United States that right now is fragmenting and being sent off to China and to other places around the world, which also is a security threat; bringing back high-paying manufacturing jobs to this country that will serve this next generation well.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you. That's a tall order for a year.
 Congressman Paul, what about you?
 REP. PAUL: Well, there's a limit of what you can do in one year, and at home it's more difficult. You would have to work with the Congress, but a commander in chief could end the war. We could bring our troops home. That would be a major event; it would be very valuable. We could be diplomatically -- we could become diplomatically credible once again around the world. Right now, today, we're not. Even our allies resent what we do.
 We wouldn't have no more preemptive war. We would threaten nobody. We would not threaten Iran. Now it is proven once again Iraq didn't have the nuclear weapon, had nothing to do with 9/11. The Iranians have no nuclear weapon, according to our CIA. There's no need for us to threaten the Iranians. We could immediately turn the Navy around and bring them home, and I think this would be a major step toward peace.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you. Thank you.
 Congressman?
 REP. TANCREDO: The first five minutes after taking office I would free Ramos and Compean, and that's for sure. Then the second thing I would do is to make sure that we begin the process of securing those borders and enforcing the law inside the United States against hiring people who are here illegally. Then I would use that bully pulpit that the governor talked about and is absolutely accurate in terms of the importance of it for a president of the United States for this reason, to explain that it is in fact a war -- a war is not going on in Iraq; that's a battle. We are fighting a war against radical Islam.
 It is a threat to our existence as a nation. It's a threat to Western civilization. It will take someone who's willing to say that --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 REP. TANCREDO: -- and lead Western civilization in this clash.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Senator Thompson, your first year.
 MR. THOMPSON: Well, it wouldn't take me a year. I'd go before the American people and tell them the truth and try to establish my credibility, and tell them that we haven't come to terms yet with the nature of the threat that we're facing or what we're going to have to do to defend ourselves over the years.
 I'd tell them that if they didn't already know it, we're bankrupting the next generation and nobody even wants to talk about it, much less do anything about it. I'd tell them that judges are setting our social policy now in this country and that's going to stop. And then I'd bring in members of Congress and say, look, I just got a mandate. We can work and cooperate together or I'll go over your head to the American people.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Romney?
 MR. ROMNEY: I want to do more than talk in my first year. There are a lot of things I want to get done. First of all, I want to establish a strategy to help us overwhelm global jihad and keep the world safe. I want to end illegal immigration. We can get that done. I want to end the growth -- the expansion growth of entitlements, rein them in. I want to end the extraordinary growth in federal spending and I want to keep our tax burden down and reduce our tax burden on middle-income families.
 I want to get us on a track to become energy-independent. I want to get our schools on a track so they can become competitive globally, and I want to get health insurance for every citizen in America. It's going to take four years for that to happen, but I'll get us on track in that. We'll have a stronger military, a stronger economy and stronger values, with stronger families, after my first year in office.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee.
 MR. HUCKABEE: Well, I like the laundry list that everybody's had, and I would agree that every one of those things is important. Reality is, none of that's going to happen till we bring this country back together.
 I think the first priority of the next president is to be a president of all the United States. We are, right now, a very polarized country, and that polarized country has led to a paralyzed government. We've got Democrats who fight Republicans, liberals fighting conservatives. The left fights the right.
 Who's fighting for this country again? And somehow, we've got to quit even fighting among ourselves as conservatives and as Republicans, and start putting the better interest of our nation. If that doesn't happen, we'll get none of these things done. We've got to be the united people of the United States, and a president has got to somehow remind us that we are a great, resilient nation that has to stick together to solve all of these problems.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator McCain.
 SEN. MCCAIN: Our first obligation, and my qualifications lend to making America safe. We must make America safe. This is a military, diplomatic, intelligence and cyberspace challenge. And I have the credentials and the knowledge and the background and the judgment to do that.
 The second most important thing, if we're going to complete that laundry list, is restore trust and confidence in government. There is none today. We have to fix Medicare. We have to stop this wasteful pork-barrel spending that has led to corruption in Washington.
 Of course we have to fix our borders. We have to sit down together and fix Medicare and Social Security. But I can lead. I can inspire confidence and restore trust and confidence in their government again. That's the key to any success we want to achieve.
 MS. WASHBURN: Ambassador.
 MR. KEYES: Well, what I would concentrate on is restoring the sovereignty of the people of this country. I would restore their moral sovereignty, which is something I think I can do very simply as president by declaring that no action taken by the executive branch would support, aid or abet anyone who is destroying the constitutional rights of those who are in the womb. I would sign an executive order to that effect day one, and we would reestablish this government's commitment to the constitutional rights of our posterity. These folks talk about our posterity, but you can't really respect them if you're killing them in the womb. It doesn't make any sense.
 And I would also want to abolish the income tax. And you say, well, it can't be done in a day. We need to start talking about it and talking about actually implementing the fair tax proposal that will end the wasteful spending by putting them under the discipline of a people who can actually withhold their taxes by changing their patterns of spending.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. KEYES: And finally, I would establish a national border guard. I would seal the borders of the United States so that only those would cross our borders who are subject to our laws and the terms of those laws.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. KEYES: And I would encourage, through this national border guard, a real respect for the security that must be maintained along that border if we're serious about the war on terror.
 MS. WASHBURN: We're going to move to the last three candidate statements. Governor Romney has 30 seconds, followed by Mr. Keyes and finally Mayor Giuliani.
 MR. ROMNEY: I want to begin by saying thank you to the people of Iowa. Over the last year my wife and I have visited many, many homes, many places, over 70 town meetings, 67 counties. Josh, my son, has visited all 99 counties. People here have warm hearts. They've welcomed us, and it's something that's made me feel very good about America. Anybody who's worried about the future of this great land just needs to come to Iowa, meet the people with the kind of heartland values that you have here.
 People here also recognize we face real challenges, and they want somebody who will strengthen America. I know how to keep America strong. I know a lot about the economy. I'll make sure we keep good jobs.
 I learned a lot about education and health care. I'll improve our schools, get our health care system working for all Americans. And I'll make sure that we have the kind of values that we can be proud of that are so essential to the great strength of this nation.
 And finally, I want to say to the people of Iowa: I need your help. I'd like your vote. I want you to get -- get out and participate in that caucus.
 Thank you.
 MS. WASHBURN: Mr. Keyes?
 MR. KEYES: I think that the critical thing here is what you need to do. If you really want to see a change in government, then we need to restore the credibility of the Republican Party, a credibility that has been destroyed by the betrayal of promises to keep government limited that resulted in outrageously high budget deficits at a historic level in this country; the betrayal along the border, with the president telling us that he suddenly discovered we didn't have a secure border six years into his term.
 And if you want to accomplish that, join the political army of America's Revival at AlanKeyes.com, and make sure you become part of that change. We're not going to restore self-government until you become an active people not willing to take the inadequate choices you have, but lifting up the choice that this country needs.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you. Thank you.
 Mayor Giuliani?
 MR. GIULIANI: I've been tested by having to provide leadership through crisis, through difficult crises, not just September 11 but in my time as United States attorney, associate attorney general, mayor of New York City.
 And America needs bold leadership. We have big problems. We have problems that we haven't faced in the past and solve; problems about how to deal with terrorism effectively, problems about our border, problems about our economic security that we've talked about. And to do that, we need bold leadership, we need the kind of ideas that I've put forward in the 12 commitments to the American people, but most importantly, we need an optimistic leader who can bring us these kinds of solutions.
 I've gotten results in the past. I would like the opportunity to do that for my country.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 We're going to shift gears a bit. Voters have told us that character and leadership qualities matter as much or more than many issues. Over the past few months, we asked candidates who have spent time in Iowa about some of their core values, and we videotaped the answers. Since we're pitching websites, you can see all the insights videos at desmoinesregister.com, but today we're going to see a few of them and then expand the conversation.
 Let's watch the first one.
 (From videotape.)
 MR. GIULIANI: And I would do this as president. When I was mayor of New York, I would go get people's opinions. I'd go walk the street, sit down at a restaurant and I'd ask people what they think, and I'd go on radio, have them do a call-in show. I did 96 town hall meetings. It was all for the purpose of hearing what people had to say because maybe, even with multiple sources of advice within government, maybe if you don't hear from the people every once and awhile, you get wrong perspectives.
 REP. HUNTER: Legislation is a function of compromise, and when you put together a budget -- for example, a budget to increase Defense spending and that budget which increases Defense spending may have also pork barrel programs that you don't like, and you promised your constituents you'll fight against pork barrel programs -- in the end, if you vote for the budget of the United States, you vote for a lot of things.
 REP. PAUL: The Internet is delightful. It is just delightful for finding the information, and if there's a question that I need asked, you can find it.
 So I spend a lot of time getting information that was -- at one time in my life was very difficult to find. There should be no excuse in this country anymore for not finding correct answers and analyzing the problems that we face, because the correct answers are out there and judgments should be made to the best of one's ability.
 (End videotape.)
 MS. WASHBURN: So this next set of questions is entirely about character and leadership.
 Mayor Giuliani, your administration in New York has been accused of handling your security expenses in a way that obscured public disclosure. What specifically will you promise to do to ensure that a Giuliani White House is open with information that might be inconvenient to explain to the public?
 MR. GIULIANI: The reality is that all that information --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thirty seconds, please.
 MR. GIULIANI: The reality is that all that information was available and known to people, known six years ago. And I would make sure that government was transparent. My government in New York City was so transparent that they knew every single thing I did almost every time I did it. (Chuckles.) So I would be extremely -- (laughter) -- I would be extremely open.
 I'm used to it. I'm used to being analyzed. I haven't had a perfect life. I wish I had. And I do the best that I can to learn from my mistakes. But as far as, you know, open, transparent government, I think I've had both an open, transparent government and an open, transparent life, and it allows you to lead, then, with honesty and truth.
 MS. WASHBURN: So are there things you could have done in this situation that would have been more open and not raise these concerns about obscuring public --
 MR. GIULIANI: No. the reality is that this was a bookkeeping practice.
 The way it was done actually made it more available to Freedom of Information Act requests. Had it been done just in the police department, nobody would have ever found it. And everything that was laid out a few weeks ago had been laid out six years ago, very well known. Some of the things that I wish, if I had lead a perfect life, would had happened differently, but it was all very well known.
 And on the issue of transparency, I can't think of a public figure that's had a more transparent life than I've had.
 MS. WASHBURN: Mr. Keyes, how would you guarantee an open White House?
 MR. KEYES: I think the most important thing is to be absolutely authentic about who you are, not to say things today that contradict what you were two years ago, like, sadly, Governor Romney. Not to take a stand on the most important principle that faces our nation today, the question of whether we are all created equal and endowed by our creator -- not the Constitution, but our God -- with our unalienable rights from the womb to the tomb, and not to abandon the heritage of the Republican Party as Rudy Giuliani would do and as I could not follow him in doing, so I would not support him if he were nominated.
 And finally, I think it would be important to do what I'm doing in my campaign. We have three phone calls every week. People from all over the country gather online to talk to me, to interact --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. KEYES: -- state their views. We have technologies now that allow people directly to communicate to their leadership --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. KEYES: -- and I would make creative use of those technologies.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Romney, would you like to respond?
 MR. ROMNEY: I'm not sure. (Laughs, laughter.)
 MS. WASHBURN: It's entirely up to you. (Laughter, applause.)
 MR. ROMNEY: This audience and the whole nation has heard time and time again the fact that I was effectively pro-choice when I ran for office. When I became governor of Massachusetts, the first time a bill came to my life that dealt with life, I simply could not side with -- with taking a life, and I came on the side of life. Every bill that came to my desk, every issue that related to protecting the sanctity of life, I came down on the side of life. I'm pro-life. I'm not going to apologize for becoming pro-life. Ronald Reagan followed the same course, as did Henry Hyde and George Herbert Walker Bush. And I'm proud to be pro-life.
 Thank you.
 MS. WASHBURN: Mayor Giuliani, would you like to respond?
 MR. GIULIANI: I think I've explained my position on abortion, which is that I oppose it, but I believe that ultimately the government should leave that decision to a woman and her conscience. I would like to see limitations on abortion. I brought those about in New York City. We reduced abortions. We increased adoptions by 135 percent. But ultimately, it's a position that I thought out a long time ago. For me it's a position on conscience, and it's a position that, in spite of the fact that Alan wouldn't vote for me, I'm not going to change. (Laughter.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator Thompson -- (applause) -- Senator Thompson, you've expressed doubts that the recent report on Iran's nuclear capabilities is accurate. As president, how would you decide when to disagree with available intelligence, and then what would you do?
 MR. THOMPSON: Well, that's probably the most important question that's been asked today.
 We have a real problem with our intelligence community. It, along with certain parts of our military, were neglected for a long, long time in this country, and we're paying the price for it now. The fact is that nobody has any real confidence in the result that they're getting. The result you're talking about was directly contradicted by their strong beliefs just two years ago. So you've got to rebuild from the bottom up.
 I think that, in the meantime, we have to rely on other people. The British are helpful to us. The Israelis sometimes are helpful to us.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. THOMPSON: In many respects, they have advancements that we don't have in terms of our intelligence capabilities. But the president cannot let --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. THOMPSON: -- a piece of paper by a bureaucrat determine -- solely determine what his actions must be.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay, thank you.
 We're going to have to move on. Let's watch the next videos.
 MR. HUCKABEE: (From videotape.) If a person says, I'm a person of faith, but I don't let it influence me and I don't talk about it, what they just told me is that their faith is so immaterial, insignificant and inconsequential that it really isn't a faith at all.
 If it's a faith, it will drive their judgment, it will drive their value system, and therefore, it'll help define them. It's ludicrous to say that I have faith, but it doesn't impact me at all.
 SEN. MCCAIN: (From videotape.) I think the hardest thing in this age of struggle against radical Islamic extremism is balancing the rights of everyone's privacy plus our ability to combat this great evil of radical Islamic extremism, and that's why I think that there has to be the participation of the courts, the legislature, the executive branch and the American people to what measures we take.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee, you are distinguishing yourself from other candidates by focusing on faith. You say your faith doesn't just influence you, that it defines you. A person who chooses you for president, then, would expect that to translate to public policy. So give me two examples you've not previously given -- one in health care and one in education -- where your faith would define change you want to see in policy.
 MR. HUCKABEE: The two overriding principles are you treat others as you wish to be treated. As it relates in health care, that means that we recognize that a person who is sick shouldn't be treated differently because they're in poverty than a person who has extraordinary wealth; that we have some sense of balance in how we approach that. That's the essence of what America is about.
 The second basic principle is that inasmuch as you've done it to the least of these, my brethren, you've done it unto me. As it relates to both health, education or any policy, what it really means is that you go back to what the Founding Fathers said, all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with those rights -- life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
 MS. WASHBURN: But two specific changes in policy.
 MR. HUCKABEE: Well, I think I just tried to give them to you, both in education -- that everyone has an opportunity -- you give education and health care, that you don't have some that are more equal than others.
 So there has to be a sense in which you have opportunity, whether it's through choice in charter schools, in the education field, you have a curriculum that touches every child, not just a few; and in health care you don't have a health care system, like Congress has, that is incredibly almost platinum, but there are a lot of Americans who can't even go to the doctor and find out if they're critically ill --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. HUCKABEE: -- or if they have (a terminal disease ?).
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Governor Romney, as you look at the most pressing problems facing our country and the best opportunities to effect change in the next four years, do you think it's more important for the next president to be a fiscal conservative or a social conservative?
 MR. ROMNEY: I think it's incredibly important that he be a conservative. And I'm going to build on the same foundation Ronald Reagan built. We're not going to get the White House nor strengthen America unless we can pull together the coalition of conservatives and conservative thought that has made us successful as a party. And that's social conservatives, it's also economic conservatives, and foreign policy and defense conservatives. Those three together form the three legs of the Republican stool that allowed Ronald Reagan to get elected and allowed our party to have strength over the last several decades.
 And I'm going to continue to draw, as many of the states try and do, upon those strengths and to build America by virtue of those conservative principles.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay.
 MR. ROMNEY: Whether in health care, education, defense, spending, entitlement reform, you name it, conservative principles work.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. ROMNEY: They've been tested time and again, and they'll keep working.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Congressman Hunter, same question.
 REP. HUNTER: Repeat the question. I was lost in Governor Romney's explanation.
 MS. WASHBURN: Do you think it --
 REP. HUNTER: I thought it was quite good, though. (Laughter.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Do you think it's more important for the next president to be a fiscal conservative or a social conservative?
 REP. HUNTER: I think -- I think they both go to the core of this country, because you have to keep the economy running, you've got to keep the wheels turning, and of course the -- the heart of our country is -- is this idea that -- that -- that human beings have value, that they are given these inalienable rights that have been described by my friend. So those are two very important things.
 But one thing that's extremely important that Governor Romney didn't touch on is this: we also, in being conservative, having a conservative leader -- part of that means not sending technology to our adversaries. And that's going to be the big threat of this next 15, 20 years.
 Governor Romney's corporation that he founded, the Bain Capital Corporation --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 REP. HUNTER: -- has joined up with a -- with a Chinese corporation to -- to buy an American defense contractor.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 REP. HUNTER: I think that is a mistake, and that's a defense contractor that did business with Saddam Hussein and with the Taliban.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you, Congressman.
 REP. HUNTER: So that, I think, is a very important part of conservative leadership.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you, Congressman.
 REP. HUNTER: And thank you.
 MS. WASHBURN: We're going to look at the last video.
 MR. : Okay.
 MR. ROMNEY: (From videotape.) I think we're better off by strictly following the Constitution as it existed and it was brought forward, and if we think there's a need for a new right, then going to the people or their elected representatives to establish that right, rather than having judges from their own heart or their own mind establishing new rights and new laws. It's not for judges to legislate or to create a new Constitution. That's something that only the people and their elected representatives should be able to do.
 REP. TANCREDO: (From videotape.) There are two sides to your human component, you know. One is the God-filled side. One is the human side. And there are things that feed either side, you know? And whichever you feed the most becomes the dominant side. And so you have to kind of concentrate on feeding the good side, or else you will lose control over it.
 MR. THOMPSON: (From videotape.) The least we can do is look at our social policies, and not just be concerned about the consuming of what's before us in the short view but what's best for the overall country, what's best for the future generations of this nation. And are we going to leave this place a better place than when we came into it? To me, that's real patriotism.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Tancredo, your foreign policy positions, on your campaign website, consist of five sentences on Iraq. What assures Americans you're ready to lead our foreign policy?
 REP. TANCREDO: Because the issue, of course, as I mentioned earlier, it's just a battle going on in Iraq. The major battle is, of course, this clash of civilizations. I believe that the whole idea and the whole debate can be narrowed to a relatively small area, on my website or anyplace else, and that is this.
 We cannot leave Iraq.
 We are committed there and will be for a long time, and that doesn't -- I don't care who's elected president. That's the reality of the situation.
 We can, however, stop, in fact, being the police force in Iraq. We are doing it; we are moving in exactly the direction that my website, the statement, anticipates.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 REP. TANCREDO: What more do I have to say? We're getting it done.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 Congressman Paul, your -- you call your campaign a revolution, and I think it's safe to say that your brand of change is one of the most sweeping proposed by any candidate of either party. But getting your agenda through Congress would likely require a revolution of an entirely different sort.
 So how would you adjust your plan in light of political reality in Washington?
 REP. PAUL: Well, the secret is is the term ''revolution'' wasn't my word, and it didn't come up on our web page. It was coined by the supporters. But in a way, it is revolutionary to go back to the Constitution, and we'd like to continue the old revolution. And believe me, freedom is unifying; we bring a lot of people together. People then are free to choose what they would like to do with their lives, free to choose how they would spend their money, and all of a sudden, we would be telling other countries how to live.
 MS. WASHBURN: So getting through Congress -- REP. PAUL: This brings people together. And I think it's appealing to both left and right and middle, and our campaign really has that appeal. So therefore, we would bring the Congress together.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay. Thank you.
 Senator McCain, your reputation as a maverick has put you at odds with your own party leadership from time to time. Give us an example of a time you wished you had compromised to get something done instead of holding firm on your ideals.
 SEN. MCCAIN: I cannot think of a time, and I hope that I could never think of a time, because I came to Washington because I had a set of principles and ideals. But at the same time, I have more legislative achievements than anybody on this -- on this stage by far.
 I have joined together across the aisle on a number of pieces of legislation, many of them very important. I'm proud of my legislative record, of conserving my ideals and my conservative principles and getting things done in Washington. And I am proud of that and I will continue to hold to those ideals, but I will reach across the aisle to the Democrats, who --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 SEN. MCCAIN: -- I have worked with, who know me, and we know we can work together for the good of this country.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 We're going to talk about New Year's resolutions. You have 15 seconds. We're going to start with Mr. Keyes and go this way. Please suggest a New Year's resolution for one of your opponents here today. (Laughter.)
 MR. KEYES: I think the most important New Year's resolution is the one I suggest to the American people: Resolve to return to your respect for the principle that makes us free, that we are all created equal and endowed by God with our unalienable rights.
 MS. WASHBURN: Fifteen seconds, please. Senator McCain?
 SEN. MCCAIN: Let's raise the level of dialogue and discussion and debate in this campaign. Let's not accuse each other of a lack of patriotism or a lack of character. There are differing views on differing issues. There are difference in qualifications. There are difference in experience.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee?
 SEN. MCCAIN: But I think we should all be respectful of one another, and the American people, I think, will benefit from it.
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Huckabee?
 MR. HUCKABEE: I'm going to be a lot more careful about everything I say, because I find that it gets amplified to a new level. So that's my resolution.
 MS. WASHBURN: (Inaudible) -- resolution for an opponent.
 MR. HUCKABEE: Well, I would make it of them, too. (Laughter, applause.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Governor Romney.
 MR. ROMNEY: Let's have a resolution amongst all of us that we'll have a spirited campaign, as we have, but we'll come together, come together real soon when this is resolved, and we will fight to make sure that one of the people on this stage is the next president of the United States -- not one of the people on that Democratic stage you've had more than once.
 MS. WASHBURN: Senator Thompson.
 MR. THOMPSON: Yeah, well, it would be for myself, to try to be a better man, be strong, have faith, try to be a better husband and father.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman.
 REP. TANCREDO: All sounds good, but you asked what we would do, what somebody else, we think, should do in terms of a resolution.
 I have to say it, because you're leading the pack now, and congratulations to you, Governor. But I have to ask you, no, no, no, pointing right over there, right over there. (Laughter.)
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay.
 REP. TANCREDO: No, just a minute, you know, laughter does not count.
 MS. WASHBURN: Okay, I've got to --
 REP. TANCREDO: I have to ask you a question.
 MS. WASHBURN: I have to keep moving.
 REP. TANCREDO: And the question is, how are you going to convince America that you in fact changed your mind, on the issue of immigration, from when you were a governor? That's all I want to know.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Paul.
 REP. PAUL: My advice would be to reread the oath of office, take it seriously, obey the constitution. We can -- we are well defended against all enemies foreign. We should be much more careful about defending against the enemies domestic.
 MS. WASHBURN: Congressman Hunter.
 REP. HUNTER: Yeah, to all my colleagues and, I think, to the American people, we've got lots of folks coming back from the Afghan and Iraqi theaters, lots of young people who need jobs. One thing we could do here, just a couple of weeks before Christmas, is buy American goods. And if we buy American goods, we may save the job of our neighbor or provide a job for that young serviceperson.
 MR. GIULIANI: I would resolve to -- all of us to take a better look at America and realize how lucky we are, how fortunate we are, not to have this kind of pessimistic feeling that some have abroad in this land. America has accomplished great things. We've faced crises like this before.
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. GIULIANI: We've always overcome them. A sense of optimism --
 MS. WASHBURN: Thank you.
 MR. GIULIANI: -- is the thing I would wish for.
 MS. WASHBURN: And we're out -- and we're out of time.
 You can find out more about this debate at pbs.org and at DesMoinesRegister.com. And tomorrow at 1:00 we'll have our debate with the Democratic presidential candidates.
 I want to thank all of the candidates for being here today, as well as our broadcast partner, Iowa Public Television, our studio audience, and everyone at home and at work. Happy holidays, everyone. (Applause.)

HEADLINE: Higher Oil Prices Widened U.S. Trade Deficit in October

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened slightly in October as a record price for imported oil outweighed the export-spurring benefits of a weaker dollar, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. 
 Rising oil costs also pushed import prices 2.7 percent higher in November, the largest gain in 17 years, raising concerns about inflation, according to a report from the Labor Department.
 The monthly trade gap widened 1.2 percent to $57.8 billion, as the average price for imported oil jumped nearly 6 percent to $72.49 a barrel. Minus petroleum, the deficit was its lowest since March 2004.
 ''The entire increase in the October deficit was due to the oil component, where higher prices and increased volumes pushed up the petroleum deficit by $2.3 billion,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics.
 America's overall trade deficit has shrunk more than 8 percent in the first nine months after hitting a record of $785.5 billion for 2006.
 The October report was another indication that a weak dollar and stronger growth overseas are increasing exports, which rose for an eighth consecutive month to a record $141.7 billion.
 The boom in exports has helped maintain growth as other parts of the economy have sagged.
 Even as the United States' overall trade deficit narrowed, the bilateral trade gap with China has continued to rise, hitting a record $25.9 billion in October.
 For the first nine months, the trade gap with China totaled $213.5 billion and is on a pace to surpass the record of $234 billion for all of 2006.
 At the same time, China is a big market for United States exports.
 The rise in oil prices helped push America's imports to a record $199.5 billion in October, even as the weaker dollar weighed on demand for other imported goods.

HEADLINE: In a Funk, Italy Sings an Aria of Disappointment

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER; Peter Kiefer contributed reporting from Rome and Trieste, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
All the world loves Italy because it is old but still glamorous. Because it eats and drinks well but is rarely fat or drunk. Because it is the place in a hyper-regulated Europe where people still debate with perfect intelligence what, really, the red in a stoplight might mean. 
 But these days, for all the outside adoration and all of its innate strengths, Italy seems not to love itself. The word here is ''malessere,'' or ''malaise''; it implies a collective funk -- economic, political and social -- summed up in a recent poll: Italians, despite their claim to have mastered the art of living, say they are the least happy people in Western Europe. 
 ''It's a country that has lost a little of its will for the future,'' said Walter Veltroni, the mayor of Rome and a possible future center-left prime minister. ''There is more fear than hope.'' 
 The problems are, for the most part, not new -- and that is the problem. They have simply caught up to Italy over many years, and no one seems clear on how change can come -- or if it is possible anymore at all. 
 Italy has charted its own way of belonging to Europe, struggling as few other countries do with fractured politics, uneven growth, organized crime and a tenuous sense of nationhood. 
 But frustration is rising that these old weaknesses are still no better, and in some cases they are worse, as the world outside outpaces the country. In 1987, Italy celebrated its economic parity with Britain. Now Spain, which joined the European Union only a year earlier, may soon overtake it, and Italy has fallen behind Britain. 
 Italy's low-tech way of life may enthrall tourists, but Internet use and commerce here are among the lowest in Europe, as are wages, foreign investment and growth. Pensions, public debt and the cost of government are among the highest.
 The latest numbers show a nation older and poorer -- to the point that Italy's top bishop has proposed a major expansion of food packages for the poor. 
 Worse, worry is growing that Italy's strengths are degrading into weaknesses. Small and medium-size businesses, long the nation's family-run backbone, are struggling in a globalized economy, particularly with low-wage competition from China. 
 Doubt clouds the family itself: 70 percent of Italians between 20 and 30 still live at home, condemning the young to an extended and underproductive adolescence. Many of the brightest, like the poorest a century ago, leave Italy. 
 The stakes have risen so high that Ronald P. Spogli, the American ambassador and someone with 40 years of experience with Italy, warns that it risks a diminished international role and relationship with Washington. America's best friends, he notes, are its business partners -- and Italy, comparatively, is not high among them. Bureaucracy and unclear rules kept United States investment in Italy in 2004 to $16.9 billion. The figure for Spain was $49.3 billion. 
 ''They need to sever the ivy that has grown up around this fantastic 2,500-year-old tree that is threatening to kill the tree,'' Mr. Spogli said. 
 But interviews with possible prime ministers, businesspeople, academics, economists and other Italians suggest that the largest reason for this malaise seems to be the feeling that there is little hope that the ivy can be cut, and that is making Italians both sad and angry. 
 An Angry Message
 ''Basta! Basta! Basta!'' Beppe Grillo, a 59-year-old comic and blogger with swooping gray hair, howled in an interview. The word means ''enough,'' and he repeated it to make his point to Italy's political class clear.
 In recent months, Mr. Grillo has become the defining personification of Italy's foul mood. On Sept. 8, he gave that mood a loud voice when he called for a day of rage, to scream across Piazza Maggiore in Bologna an obscenity politely translated as ''Take a hike!''
 A few thousand people were expected. But 50,000 jammed into the piazza, and 250,000 signed a petition for changes like term limits and the direct election of lawmakers. (Voters now cast their ballots for parties, which then choose who serves in Parliament, without the voters' consent.)
 His message was enough inaction and excess (Italian lawmakers are the best paid in Europe, driven around by the Continent's largest fleet of chauffeured cars), enough convicted criminals in Parliament (there are 24), enough of the same, tired old faces. 
 ''The whole kettle of fish stinks to high heaven!'' he yelled. ''The stench rises from the sewers and swirls around and you can't cope.''
 Mr. Grillo leans to the political left, but he spares neither side in his sold-out shows and popular blog. The problem, he said, is the system itself. 
 There is a link between the nation's errant political system and its worsening mood. Luisa Corrado, an Italian economist, led the research behind the study at the University of Cambridge that found Italians to be the least happy of 15 Western European nations. The researchers linked differences in reported happiness across countries with several socio-demographic and political factors, including trust in the world around them, not least in government. 
 In Denmark, the happiest nation, 64 percent trusted their Parliament. For Italians, the number was 36 percent. ''Unfortunately we found this issue of social trust was a bit missing'' in Italy, Ms. Corrado said. 
 Two popular books that set off months of debate capture the distrust of large powers that cannot be controlled. One, ''The Caste,'' sold a million copies (in a nation where sales of 20,000 make a best seller) by exposing the sins of Italy's political class and how it became privileged and unaccountable. Even the presidency, once above the fray, was not spared; the book put the office's annual cost at $328 million, four times as much as Buckingham Palace. 
 The other book, ''Gomorrah,'' which sold 750,000 copies, concerns the mob around Naples, the camorra. But politics, it argues, allows the camorra to flourish, keeping Italy's lagging south poor, and organized crime, by a recent study, the economy's largest sector. 
 These are Italy's age-old problems, but Alexander Stille, a Columbia University professor and an expert on Italy, argues that this moment is different. While the economy expanded, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Italians would tolerate bad behavior from their leaders. 
 But growth has been slow for years, and the quality of life is declining. Statistics now show that 11 percent of Italian families live under the poverty line, and that 15 percent have trouble spreading their salary over the month. 
 ''The level of anger is great because before you could slough it off,'' Mr. Stille said. ''Now life is harder.''
 Italians rarely associate the current crop of aging leaders with a capacity to change. They are the same people who have traded terms in power for more than a decade. Last year, Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's richest man who became prime minister for the first time in 1994, was voted out for not keeping his promises for American-style growth and opportunities based on merit. When he left office, economic growth was at zero. 
 But it became clear that getting rid of the center-right Mr. Berlusconi would be no magic cure. Romano Prodi, who had served as prime minister from 1996 to 1998, won, but he was saddled with a shaky coalition of nine warring parties. 
 He promised a clean slate, but his unwieldy center-left government disappointed with its first symbolic act: its cabinet had 102 ministers, a new record. He has pushed through two reform packages, and the economy is growing again. ''Ours is not a happy situation, but it is better than before,'' he said. 
 But the government has fallen once and threatens to fall again at every difficult vote. Small proposals bring protesters to the streets, one hurdle to making changes as protected interests seek to preserve themselves. Pharmacists shut their doors this year when the government threatened to allow supermarkets to sell aspirin. The cost for just 20 aspirin tablets at a pharmacy is $5.75.
 The measure passed, but the government is largely paralyzed. Voters are fed up, and Mr. Prodi's foes know it. 
 ''I understand the bad humor, the malaise,'' said Gianfranco Fini, leader of National Alliance, the second-largest opposition party. ''People are starting to get strongly angry because you have a government that doesn't do anything.''
 The Generational Divide
 ''It's a sadness that what could be isn't -- that we are not a normal country,'' said Gianluca Gamboni, 36, a financial adviser in Rome, summing up how he feels about Italy, which he loves, but which drives him insane. 
 Unlike the older generation, he travels and sees how much better things work elsewhere. He does not spare himself: he still lives with his parents, not because he wants to, but because only now, after seven years at his job, can he afford Rome's high rents. He is finally considering a place of his own. 
 Mr. Gamboni is on the younger side of Italy's generational divide -- a lens through which many of the country's problems come into focus. It is one of several subterranean forces, easy to overlook at first, but that taken together make clear how much Italy has changed over the past several decades and how little that change has been digested. 
 Over a century, ending in the 1970s, 25 million Italians left for better lives elsewhere. Now, Italy is home to 3.7 million immigrants. The Roman Catholic Church's position is diminishing, from a cultural pillar to a lobbying group. 
 Politically, Italy seems not to have adjusted to the death, in 1992, of the Christian Democrats, who governed for more than 40 years. Economically, it was once easy to solve problems by devaluing the currency, the lira. That is now impossible with the euro, which has also increased prices, particularly for housing.
 Then there is the family. The divorce rate has risen. Large families are a thing of the past. Italy has one of Europe's lowest birth rates, the fewest children under 15 and the greatest number of people over 85, apart from Sweden. Unemployment is low, at 6 percent. But 21 percent of the population between 15 and 24 did not work in 2006. And the old are not letting go. 
 Evidence of Italy's age is everywhere. In parks, clutches of old ladies coo at a single toddler. On television, stars are craggy. (The median age for the presenters of this year's Miss Italia contest was 70. The winner, Silvia Battisti, was 18.) In the political sphere, Mr. Prodi is 68, Mr. Berlusconi 71. 
 ''The generational problem is the Italian problem,'' said Mario Adinolfi, 36, a blogger and an aspiring lawmaker. ''In every country young people hope. Here in Italy there is no hope anymore. Your mom keeps you home nice and softly, and you stay there and you don't fight. And if you don't fight, it is impossible to take power from anybody.''
 ''We don't have a Google,'' he added. ''We can't imagine in Italy that a 30-year-old opens a business in a garage.''
 Selling a Notion of Italy
 In September, word spread through a house of young Romans, over beer and pasta, that Luciano Pavarotti, the tenor and arguably the world's most famous Italian, had died. ''Damn it!'' yelled Federico Boden, 28, a student. ''Now all we have is pasta and pizza!''
 Italy does not seem to rank as it once did for greatness. There is no new Fellini, Rossellini or Loren. Its cinema, television, art, literature and music are rarely considered on the cutting edge. 
 But it does have Ferrari, Ducati, Vespa, Armani, Gucci, Piano, Illy, Barolo -- all symbols of style and prestige. What Italy has is itself, and many believe that the future rests in trademarking mystique into ''Made in Italy.''
 Italian wine was an early test. Producers moved with success from quantity swill to quality. Illy, the coffee house, has flourished by combining quality and uniformity with innovation in methods and style in presentation. 
 ''This is where Italians are winners,'' said Andrea Illy, the company's president. ''Use your particular strengths, which are beauty and culture.''
 But Italian industry depended on low wages, making it vulnerable to competition from China as labor costs rose. Alarms began ringing years ago, with fears that many of Italy's traditional businesses -- textiles, shoes, clothes -- could not compete. Many could not. In Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a chair-making capital, the number of chair companies has shrunk to about 800 from 1,200. 
 ''At first they thought this phase would just pass,'' said Massimo Martino, director of Maxdesign, a furniture company. ''But in reality, many businesses ended up closing because fundamentally the market didn't need them anymore. They didn't want to change.''
 Some companies took up the challenge. Wood was the primary material there, but Mr. Martino began to create chairs, mostly of molded plastic, well designed but inexpensive. Others decided that competing against China on price was impossible. Instead, the aim would be quality and Italy's uniqueness, something China could not match. 
 Pietro Costantini, who runs a third-generation furniture company, said he began focusing not just on the upper end -- he makes extra-large furniture for big Americans -- but also on creating lines that would sell the Italian lifestyle itself. Customers are returning. 
 But entrepreneurs complain that they are alone. Politicians offered little help making Italy competitive, and this remains a major impediment to making their gains grow. Businesses want less bureaucracy, more flexible labor laws and large investments in infrastructure to make moving goods around easier.
 ''Now it's time to change,'' said Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the chairman of Fiat and the president of Ferrari and the influential business group Confindustria. ''If not, why are we going down in every classification of competition in the country? The reason is that in the best of cases we are stopped.''
 It is not clear that this ''Made in Italy'' strategy will be enough. Skeptics argue that foreign investment, research and development funds and money invested by venture capitalists remain too low, as does Italy's competitiveness. 
 But the nation's entrepreneurs are a bright spot in a landscape with few others. Some argue that the younger generation is another key, if not now then when those in power die. They are educated, they are well traveled and, as Beppe Grillo does when he is attracting his masses, they use the Internet. 
 Two center-left parties merged to produce the Democratic Party, aimed at overcoming the system's crippling fragmentation. All sides finally agreed that a new electoral law must be redone to give more breathing room to the winner of the next elections -- crucial for pushing through any major changes. 
 But understanding the problems is the smallest step. Many worry in the meantime that Italy may share the same fate as the Republic of Venice, based in what many say is the most beautiful of cities, but whose domination of trade with the Near East died with no culminating event. Napoleon's conquest in 1797 only made it official. 
 Now it is essentially an exquisite corpse, trampled over by millions of tourists. If Italy does not shed its comforts for change, many say, a similar fate awaits it: blocked by past greatness, with aging tourists the questionable source of life, the Florida of Europe. 
 ''The malaise is: 'I can see all that, but there isnothing I can do to change it,''' said Beppe Severnigni, a columnist for Corriere della Sera. 
 But, he said, ''to change your ways means changing your individual ways: refusing certain compromises, to start paying your taxes, don't ask for favors when you are looking for a job, not to cheat when your child is trying to reach admission to university.'' 
 ''That's the tricky part,'' he said. ''We have reached a point where hoping for some kind of white knight coming in saying, 'We'll sort you out,' is over.''
 ''We Italians have our destiny in our hands more than ever before,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 28, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption with the continuation of a front-page article on Thursday about a collective malaise in Italy misspelled the name of the city where Beppe Grillo, a performer who has given voice to the country's mood, was shown preparing for a performance. It is Novara, not Novarra. 
A front-page article on Dec. 13 about a collective malaise in Italy misspelled the surname of a columnist for Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian newspaper, who commented that many people feel helpless about the country's problems. The columnist is Beppe Severgnini, not Severnigni. The article also referred imprecisely to the 102 cabinet ministerial appointments made by Prime Minister Romano Prodi last year. While that number was a record and reflected the unwieldy nature of Mr. Prodi's nine-party coalition, as the article noted, the 102 appointments included deputy ministers, not just cabinet ministers.

HEADLINE: The Best Doctors: The Elusive Best Standard

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 In ''Rating Your Doctor, Fairly'' (editorial, Dec. 8), you run up against the same problems you face in merit pay for teachers. 
 As a former teacher, I have pointed out the unfairness of such standards for teachers and doctors. Some questions might be: How ill was the patient when he came to the doctor? Had he been to other doctors? Does he follow the doctors' orders? 
 In the classroom, the questions might concern the students' background, ability to learn the material, following directions for outside work and so on.
 A fair and good rating system is desirable, I agree, but only with an understanding of the difficulties presented by the nature of the two professions. 
 Muriel Manuel
 Morgan City, La., Dec. 8, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial has many valid points. But being an obstetrician and reviewing many cases of supposed malpractice, I can assure you that there is malpractice, but many of the cases of bad outcome are not due to malpractice.
 And, as in other specialties, such as neurosurgery and orthopedics, the best doctors are referred the toughest cases, often yielding less than perfect results.
 So malpractice settlements are often totally unrelated to quality of care.
 Arthur A. Fleisher II
 Northridge, Calif., Dec. 8, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 The only way to scientifically and mathematically measure the quality of care provided by a physician is to measure his patient outcomes. 
 This cannot be done fairly without accurately measuring the severity of each patient's illness before being treated. His average cost to the system per patient, including testing, hospitalizations, procedures, medications and so on, must also be calculated. 
 The only economically sound solution to the intractable health care mess is to simply pay high-quality, low-cost physicians more per service than we pay low-quality, high-cost-per-patient ones. 
 Having practiced cardiology in both full-time academia as well as several private practice settings for more than 20 years, I can stipulate this with almost absolute certainty. 
 Richard R. Schneider
 Pittsburgh, Dec. 8, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Rather than relying on the lowest cost of medical care indices supplied by health insurers, or the quality of medical care as measured by certain national standards and guidelines, why not choose physicians based on another, arguably more helpful criterion: Visit the person whom the local physicians and nurses select as their personal physicians.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Upholds Law On Emissions In California

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday upheld a California law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, another in a string of legal defeats for the auto industry this year.
 The ruling, by Judge Anthony W. Ishii of United States District Court, affirms a 2002 California law that would effectively force automakers to raise the average fuel economy of fleets by about 30 percent by 2016. A bill pending in Congress demands a 40 percent mileage increase by 2020.
 The auto companies challenged the California law, which 15 other states say they intend to adopt, saying that it is technically and financially impossible to meet. They also argued that regulation of vehicle mileage is the responsibility of the federal government, not the states. 
 ''We can all agree that higher fuel economy is important, but the issue here was about federal fuel economy law,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. ''Under federal law, only the federal government can set fuel economy standards for all 50 states.''
 Mr. McCurdy noted that the industry had agreed to a pending Congressional mandate to achieve a 35-mile-per-gallon fleetwide average by 2020.
 Judge Ishii, though, said that California was entitled to set its own stricter standards under the Clean Air Act, if the Environmental Protection Agency grants a waiver from federal law, which it has done dozens of times in the last 35 years. California applied to the Bush administration for a waiver in December 2005. The White House has said that it will issue a decision by the end of this month.
 While Republican and Democratic administrations have routinely granted California waivers on pollution programs, this one is more controversial because the auto companies and other industries are lobbying heavily against it, saying it will cost them too much to comply. The White House has not tipped its hand on California's application.
 The judge also rejected the automakers' claim that the state law usurps the federal government's right to conduct foreign policy because climate change is a global problem. He said there was no legal precedent for the claim.
 Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California called the ruling ''a major victory.''
 ''This is the fourth defeat for the Bush administration and the auto companies,'' Mr. Brown said, ''and I hope it sends a powerful message to the White House and to Congress that California's role as an innovator should be appreciated and not negated.''
 He was referring to an April decision by the United States Supreme Court affirming the E.P.A.'s authority to regulate vehicles' greenhouse gas emissions; a federal court ruling from Vermont in May upholding California's law; and a federal appeals court ruling in November chastising the Department of Transportation for failing to enforce its vehicle mileage rules and for not taking the impact of exhaust gases into account.
 In 2002, California adopted the first state law requiring auto makers to begin reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases. In 2004, it issued rules for achieving the reductions. Vermont adopted the same standards, as did other states, including Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. 
 Fran Pavley, a former member of the California State Assembly who wrote the emissions bill, said on Wednesday that Judge Ishii's ruling represented a legal tipping point, leaving the automakers and the Bush administration isolated on the regulation of gases that scientists say contribute to global warming.
 ''What we're finding is that this is a bipartisan issue,'' Ms. Pavley said. ''The states have moved on and they are working together to be responsible in doing their fair share to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.''

HEADLINE: Still Life With Parties and Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: Miami Beach 

 BODY:
 ''DID you do Pucci or Choo?'' Helen Lee Schifter, the Manhattan socialite, asked last week as she stood in the lobby of the Standard Hotel wearing stiletto sandals and what looked an awful lot like bike shorts. 
 What Ms. Schifter was referring to, in her Upper East Side version of baby talk, were separate dinners given by Tamara Mellon, the founder of Jimmy Choo, and Laudomia Pucci, the daughter of Emilio, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the label Ms. Pucci's father began with, essentially, some capri pants. 
 Pucci and Choo were just two parties amid a ceaseless round of celebrations (or cross-platform marketing opportunities) piggy-backing last week on the annual art fair called Art Basel Miami Beach. There were so many that anyone without a crib sheet, or the power publicist Nadine Johnson on speed-dial, was lost.
 There were wingdings hyping British shoemakers (Choo) and also Austrian crystal (Swarovski) and German cars (Audi) and French jewelry (Cartier) and Bahamian resorts owned by Turkish developers (Dellis Cay) and, of course, the relentlessly bullish globalized market for art. 
 There were Russian-sponsored parties and Chinese-sponsored parties and pop-up tattoo booths. There was, at one point, Iggy Pop stage-diving in performance by the beach off Collins Avenue. There was an intimate dinner hosted by Calvin Klein at his monastic bayside house that would have seemed casual if you didn't happen to know that the weeks-long preparations had included casting and importing a dozen or so perfect-specimen actor-slash-waiters from New York. 
 The Standard, of course, is the Andre Balazs hotel that serves as a bolthole for those seeking escape from the Collins Avenue mobs. At any given moment during Art Basel Miami Beach, one might spot Russell Simmons sloping through the Standard's lobby on his way to class at Miami Yogashala or the Houston socialite Becca Cason amiably griping about the city's lack of qualified service personnel or Tom Wolfe drifting by ethereally in two-tone spats and a suit the color of dandelion fluff. 
 Like a lot of the goods on view at Design Miami, one of 21 satellite fairs orbiting around Art Basel, Mr. Wolfe had the look of a rare artifact, one of those precious objects curio dealers sell as mint-in-box. 
 Vintage 1970s, he seemed like a fragile creature transported across time and intellectual galaxies and dropped down into a scrum of billionaires. Plenty of these people, termed the Super Rich to differentiate them from what marketing types call the Mass Affluent, manage to avoid hoi polloi by leasing private planes when they fly to Miami. For this edition of Art Basel, the fractional jet ownership company NetJets flew in 220 craft, a 10 percent increase over last year. 
 Yet despite that, there tends to be a certain bracing social friction in play at Art Basel Miami Beach. Maybe that's even part of the fair's allure. In other places the Sherman McCoys of the world can fortify themselves inside protective bubbles, but that feat is harder to pull off in a sprawling city where a substantial part of the population lives below the poverty line.
 At least during Art Basel it is possible to run into elusive collectors like Steven A. Cohen at parties like the one held for the Webster, a new luxury-goods store opening this spring. The dinner was held in a club in a faded part of South Beach not far from a park where meth heads and homeless people congregate. The ''saumon sauvage'' and baked potatoes stuffed with osetra were provided by Caviar Kaspia, the Paris restaurant that will soon open a restaurant and caviar bar in South Beach, presumably for people tired of the takeout TV dinners from Big Pink. 
 ''It's a hobby,'' Mr. Cohen said of his collection, which he began with the purchase of a Fauvist landscape. ''You have to start somewhere,'' he added, although, having bought de Kooning's ''Woman III'' from David Geffen for $137.5 million and having spent $45.9 million at a recent auction for Francis Bacon's ''Second Version of Study for Bullfight No. 1,'' there is no reason to imagine Mr. Cohen has any plans to stop. 
 And that is probably a good thing, since the effects of the wealth flowing into Miami during Art Basel -- both the cash-on-the-barrelhead and the trickle-down kind -- are palpable. It is not just florists and taxi drivers and caterers (and, like Mr. Klein's actor/waiters, many of those are imported just for the fair) but the city itself that benefits from what amounts to a holiday break for billionaires.
 Jane Jacobs may not be an obvious go-to name in this context, but it was the great urban theorist who once pointed out that old buildings need new uses, and one of the truly salutary effects of Art Basel is how vitalized the city is by the mobs of collectors and dealers and artists and, increasingly, fashion personnel that descend on the town.
 Consider the large-format installation set up in the Design District to celebrate the opening of a new Y-3 store. Videos by Shigeko Kubota, John Baldessari, Lawrence Weiner and Joan Jonas beamed onto streets where a typical day's excitement is the arrival of the lunch truck. Consider the German arts organization that swept into town and persuaded the artist Tim Walker to permit it to convert the old filling station he uses as a studio into a guerrilla exhibition space. 
 Consider the performance, at the opening of an installation by the artist designer Stefan Sagmeister at the Wolfsonian museum, of the composer George Antheil's rarely heard ''Ballet Mecanique.'' Consider the 2,300-degree furnace called the Glory Hole that the Corning Museum of Glass and the Vitra Design Museum set up in the Design District for master glassmakers to engage in public collaborations with designers like Matali Crasset and Constantin and Laurene Boym. 
 ''It's a bunch of crazy designers from all over, and we're going to make plates in all colors and then bust them up and then fuse them,'' Steve Gibbs, a marketing manager for the Corning Museum, said on Friday night as a colleague shot flames at a multicolor plate being held by a technician wearing asbestos mitts. ''It's an experiment in fragility and liquidity,'' Mr. Gibbs added, and he was not talking about the economy.
 It was a surprising feature of the fair, in fact, that despite widespread jitters engendered by the subprime mortgage crisis and devalued dollar, dealers at Art Basel said the bulk of the sales were to Americans.
 ''I was expecting that Europeans would storm the fair and buy great art for cheap money,'' said Rachel Lehmann, a director of the Lehmann Maupin gallery, 95 percent of whose sales were to Americans. 
 ''Americans are less conservative about money,'' she added. ''They consume more and save less than Europeans do.''

HEADLINE: CENTRAL BANKERS TO LEND BILLIONS IN CREDIT CRISIS

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and FLOYD NORRIS; Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
A day after the Federal Reserve disappointed investors with a modest cut in interest rates, central banks in North America and Europe on Wednesday announced the most aggressive infusion of capital into the banking system since the terrorist attacks of September 2001.
 Most market specialists and economists welcomed the effort but concluded that it would probably have only limited success in addressing broader problems in the global economy and the credit markets. 
 In response, stocks initially surged in New York, but most of the early gains dissipated in afternoon trading as the market moved wildly up and down through the day. 
 The effort to grease the wheels of bank lending suggested that policy makers were increasingly concerned about the risk that economies could fall into recession because of failures in the credit markets, which have seized up again in the last couple of weeks after they overcame a bout of panic in August and September. 
 Economists and market specialists say policy makers are trying to reassure bankers that they will stand firm as the lenders of last resort. The coordinated action is being led by the Fed, which will lend $40 billion this month. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Canada will lend $50.2 billion this month and next. 
 ''This is basically a reinsurance policy,'' said William H. Gross, chief investment officer of the bond management firm Pimco. Central bankers ''are saying, 'We will stand behind you.' ''
 He added, ''Now it's up to the private market to gain a little confidence and turn a little macho and start performing on its own.''
 Fed officials said that the move was an effort to improve financial markets, not a response to problems at specific banks, and that it was in the works well before investors reacted negatively to the Fed's modest interest rate cut on Tuesday.
 ''This is not about particular financial institutions with particular problems,'' a senior Fed official told reporters. ''It is about market functioning.''
 Economists said the move was intended to deal with specific problems in the interbank lending market and would not allay the biggest problems in the credit markets related to the weakening American housing market, where prices are falling and defaults and foreclosures are rising.
 ''They do not address the underlying imbalances threatening the world economy -- notably the impact the U.S. housing slump will still have via conventional economic channels,'' said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics in London. ''But they should at least reduce the risk that the credit crunch tips economies into recession.''
 Some critics, however, say the central banks were too eager to appease the financial markets and appeared to have lost their primary focus on fostering low inflation and stable growth.
 ''Some banks are ailing, some businesses are not doing so well, but the economy is fine,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research.
 Others criticized the central banks' awkward announcement of the plan. By not disclosing the effort Tuesday, when the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate, they left investors with the impression that policy makers were not worried about banks' liquidity problems.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.5 percent on Tuesday; it closed up 0.61 percent, at 1,486.59 on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 41.13 points, or 0.31 percent, at 13,473.90. Rising oil prices, which surged more than $4 a barrel, to $94.39, also played a role in stock market gyrations.
 Central bank officials first discussed the plan as early as September, but discussions were put aside when markets appeared to stabilize in October. They were revived this month in conference calls among officials of several nations.
 In the briefing for reporters, a Fed official said: ''We were finalizing details, both on our own and with other central banks. We and other central banks wanted to make this announcement when the affected markets were open.''
 When markets are functioning properly, banks easily and regularly borrow money from each other at rates that are only slightly higher than what the United States government, considered one of the world's safest borrowers, pays when it issues Treasury bills. Like homeowners who borrow against the value of their property, banks borrow against the securities they own.
 But with markets increasingly uncertain about the quality of banks' holdings, lending between banks has slowed and become more expensive. Banks are also less likely to extend loans because they need to hold more capital on their books.
 Underscoring the banks' problems, Wachovia and Bank of America said Wednesday that loan losses were rising and profits would fall further in coming months.
 The difference between what banks pay to borrow and what the Treasury pays has widened from less than half a percentage point in the spring to more than 2.2 percentage points Tuesday. It fell slightly yesterday after the central banks' announcement, but policy makers, by stepping into the breach and lending directly to banks, are hoping to reduce that premium much further.
 The Fed will do so through an auction process it has not used before. It will ask banks to bid the interest rate they are willing to pay for loans totaling $40 billion, split in two equal parts, with the first auction beginning Monday.
 The process is expected to result in a rate that is lower than the discount rate at which the Fed lends money to banks, backed by the same collateral as will be required in the auctions. The discount rate was lowered to 4.75 percent on Tuesday, from 5 percent.
 During the credit crisis, few banks have voluntarily borrowed at the discount rate because it was seen as a sign of weakness. Policy makers say they will be releasing auction results so that the participants know only which Federal Reserve bank made the loans, not which commercial bank borrowed the money. Based on the results of its first two auctions, the Fed plans two more auctions of an unspecified size in January.
 In part, said Larry A. Goldstone, president of Thornburg Mortgage, a lender based in Santa Fe, N.M., the process ''will give the Fed some idea of what the cost of money needs to be in order to get the banks to borrow.''
 In Europe, the Fed and the European Central Bank will swap $20 billion for the equivalent in euros, and $4 billion will be swapped with the Swiss National Bank. The exchanges are aimed at allowing deposit-taking banks in Europe to borrow in dollars. The Canadian and British central banks will lend using their own funds.
 The effort, economists note, will not result in any net addition of money into the banking system, because the Fed wants to keep its target rate for interbank lending at 4.25 percent.
 ''This is not a Fed that is providing a lower funding structure for the system,'' said Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Securities. ''It's trying to get funding out in a way that makes it clear to people that they will be able to do business.''
 Still, several analysts contended that the plan might raise more doubts about whether even bigger problems loomed. ''It smacks of panic,'' Barry Ritholtz wrote on his widely read economics blog, the Big Picture, ''and suggests the Fed is very worried.''

HEADLINE: Remaining True To the Cowboy Life

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Nascar's drivers have long distanced themselves from their sports' moonshine-running past, and millionaire Major League Baseball players compete in cathedrals that bear little resemblance to their game's origins in dusty sandlots. In rodeo, the sport of America's original extreme athletes, not a whole lot has changed.
 Just as they did in the 1882, when Buffalo Bill Cody organized the first major rodeo, in North Platte, Neb., cowboys rope calves, ride rough stock and wrestle steers. Life for a cowboy, however, does not get much better than the 10 days they spend here each December chasing the biggest pot of the year at the National Finals Rodeo.
 It means that after 80 or so rodeos, they are one of the top 15 competitors in their discipline. It means that after more than 270 days on the road driving four cowboys to a truck and sleeping two to a room -- or often a tent -- they finally receive their own accommodations. 
 Will Lowe stood behind a blackjack table at the Mirage last Thursday, gripping a long-neck beer with one hand and tipping his hat to the ladies with the other. Earlier in the evening, he tied on to a bronco named Full Deck, was bounced around like a paddle ball and finished out of the money in the opening round of the bareback riding event of the National Finals Rodeo. 
 Lowe hardly seemed discouraged. 
 ''I felt good, I roped well and I had fun,'' said Lowe, 24, a three-time world champion in bareback riding. ''I mean I'm on a bucking horse for the next nine days, what can be better than that?''
 Lowe and his fellow competitors here are the rare athletes who can trace a direct connection to America's frontier past, right down to the bone-crushing injuries they often sustain. He is a cowboy at the top of his game, who pursues his dream while keeping his day job at his 305-acre ranch in Canyon, Tex.
 They appreciate the money, which has grown from $50,000 at the first national finals in 1959 to $5.5 million now. But their real prize is something not for the bank but for the belt -- the championship gold buckle awarded to the season's top-earning cowboy.
 ''There's a lot a ways to make better money in the world, but I can't think of a better way to live,'' said Tom McFarland, who has earned $84,732 this year riding bareback. ''We have a blast all year long, and then we get to come here once a year and play for big money and the chance to be the best in the world.''
 Lowe, McFarland and Royce Ford are traveling partners who are known on the rodeo circuit as the Wolfpack. They have camped under the stars in Wyoming, fished in the blue waters of Idaho and eaten more fast food than they have ever wanted crisscrossing the West to the tune of more than 80,000 miles.
 ''We spend more time going down the road together than we do at home,'' Ford said. ''We've ate, slept and breathed rodeo. We're always talking about bucking horses and keeping each other positive.''
 In fact, it is essential to remain upbeat in what is often a brutal pursuit. There has been no shortage of patients here in the sports medicine room at the Thomas & Mack Center, where the national finals have been held since 1985. Before the 10 days are completed Saturday, Dr. Tandy Freeman and his team will see about 75 cowboys, and treat many for severe injuries.
 ''We see the kind of injuries you often see in car crashes or people falling of buildings,'' said Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon based in Dallas who runs the operation. ''We have fractured bones and crushed pelvises. But mostly what you see are cowboys competing hurt. They have a different threshold of pain than most athletes, and part of it is economic. If you don't compete, you don't eat.''
 Trevor Brazile, a 30-year-old roper, has won more than $62,000 here despite competing with a herniated disk that is pressing against the nerves in his back. He is considered the Tiger Woods of rodeo and a lock to win the title of All Around World Champion for the fourth time. Still, he is the first cowboy in the rodeo's history to earn more than $300,000 in back-to-back years, and only the seventh to surpass $2 million in career earnings.
 His endorsement contracts are negligible compared with Woods's or even those of lesser N.F.L. stars. Wrangler Western Wear, the National Finals Rodeo's title sponsor, clothes 150 rodeo cowboys, and offers a far smaller number of them incentive bonuses.
 ''There's a couple of six-figure contracts out there,'' said Karl Stressman, Wrangler's director of special events. ''Trevor is one of the few guys out there making $500,000 a year. This sport is blood-driven. These are real cowboys.''
 When Lowe is home in Texas, McFarland in Arizona and Ford in Colorado, they raise cattle, build fences and break horses on the farms they each have managed to maintain.
 ''I dang sure don't feel like no millionaire even though on paper it says I've made that much in prize money,'' Lowe said. ''I'm paying double with the expenses back at home, what it costs me to stay on the road.''
 As much as the cowboys treat a trip here as a reward for a hard season, they know it is their only opportunity to make real money. Each night, a $16,394 first-place check is up for grabs in each event, and prize money is paid down to sixth place.
 Last year, Lowe won three rounds and finished in the money in 9 of 10. He earned $128,302, a National Finals record. On Monday, Lowe wore a broad grin after booting a bronco named Pinball Wizard to a victory in the fifth round. 
 His earnings here through Tuesday stand at $29,615. 
 The other two members of the Wolfpack are doing pretty well, too. Ford and McFarland have each won a round, and McFarland is leading all bareback competitors with $40,721. Ford has earned $28,822.
 ''It's not like your competing face to face against your buddy,'' McFarland said. ''You're competing against your horse, and for all of us, it's really about pushing ourselves to the edge.''
 Even if getting to the edge barely pays? 
 A world title may be out of reach for Lowe this year, but he knows that four more rounds remain, with nearly $53,000 in prize money at stake.
 Whether or not he or his traveling mates are the ones to capture the bulk of it, Lowe knows that they will all be on the road together next year, fishing and camping and trying to get back here again.
 ''We're like one big family, and they are like my brothers,'' he said of McFarland and Ford. ''It is not about the money. Two hundreds years ago, there wasn't any money, either -- just a bunch of crazy cowboys in the middle of some range, trying to ride bucking horses. It's what we do.''

HEADLINE: A Shameful Presidential Threat

 BODY:
The Senate should ignore an incredibly mischievous last-minute veto threat from the White House and vote resoundingly in favor of an energy bill that could come before it as early as today. The bill represents a historic opportunity to ease America's dependence on foreign oil and to take steps in the battle against global warming, and its passage would send a message to the worlds' negotiators in Bali that Washington is at last getting serious about climate change. 
 The centerpiece of the bill is the first meaningful increase in fuel efficiency standards in three decades -- from today's fleetwide average of 25 miles per gallon to 35 m.p.g. by 2020. To win necessary Republican votes, the Senate leadership agreed to drop one valuable provision contained in a measure passed earlier by the House: a requirement that all utilities provide 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. 
 Even so, the bill, as it now stands, contains not only the new fuel standards, which is a huge step forward, but also generous incentives for energy efficiency, for cleaner alternative fuels and for the new technologies that will be required to reduce the country's output of greenhouse gases. By almost any measure, it is the most important energy bill that Congress has entertained in many years.
 It is thus astonishing that President Bush would even think of vetoing it, especially since he called for much the same improvements in automobile mileage as those contained in the bill. In a statement Tuesday, however, the White House demanded that the bill be amended to make the industry-friendly Transportation Department solely responsible for regulating fuel economy as well as carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles.
 This would directly reverse the Supreme Court's historic decision in April declaring that greenhouses gases are air pollutants under the meaning of the Clean Air Act and giving the Environmental Protection Agency the power to regulate them. It would also have the effect of stripping California and other states of the power to impose their own automobile emissions standards. 
 It is no secret that the carmakers and many of their industrial allies detest the E.P.A. and hate the idea that environmentally aggressive states like California have the right to set their own rules -- a right reaffirmed yesterday in federal court in California. But for the White House to advance industry's cause at the 11th hour of the debate over a breakthrough energy bill is inexcusable.

HEADLINE: Shares Hold On to Part of Early Gains

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Shares rose on Wednesday, led by technology and energy stocks, in another volatile day on Wall Street. 
 Investors quickly sent shares soaring -- the Dow rose almost 270 points -- after the Federal Reserve and four other central banks added cash to the financial system. But by late in the end of day, all three major markets had to the rise out of negative territory. 
 Three companies -- Exxon Mobil, Cisco Systems and AT&T -- led the advance. But gains were limited as Wachovia and Bank of America said that credit losses would widen. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 8.94 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,486.59. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 41.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,473.90. The Nasdaq composite climbed 18.79 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,671.14. 
 ''The course the Fed was on didn't seem to be working,'' said Doug Peta, a market strategist at J.&W. Seligman & Company. ''We've got this new medicine we can try.''
 The cash injection helped the S.& P. 500 recoup about a quarter of its loss from Tuesday, when the Fed's quarter-point rate cut disappointed investors. The Fed is coordinating the measures with the European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Canada and Swiss National Bank.
 Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, climbed $1.64, to $91.92. Cisco, the largest maker of computer-networking equipment, added 78 cents, to $28.80.
 AT&T advanced $2.25, to $41.71, the steepest gain in the Dow average. On Tuesday, AT&T announced a $15.2 billion stock buyback plan and raised its dividend 13 percent.
 Chevron added $1.89, to $91.78, after Goldman Sachs lifted its average 2008 forecast for crude oil to $95 from $85 a barrel on ''technological and political uncertainty.'' 
 Oil futures in New York may rise to as much as $105 a barrel by the end of next year, Goldman said. 
 On Wednesday, oil rose $4.37, to $94.39 a barrel, the biggest gain since January, on speculation the central banks' cash injection will spur economic growth.
 Heating oil futures rose almost 5 percent, the biggest gain in more than 10 months, after a government report showed that inventories declined and a snowstorm threatened the Eastern United States.
 For stock traders, it was a second day of watching the Fed. The bank said that it would make up to $24 billion available to the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank to increase the supply of dollars in Europe. The central banks' actions are a response to a surge in short-term borrowing costs. 
 The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, a gauge followed by central bankers, rose to a two-month high of 5.15 percent a week ago.
 ''Obviously, this is being very well received by the market,'' said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at the Philadelphia Trust Company. ''It helps with the confidence and the feeling that the Fed is going to help out the financial system.''
 Banks, however, took another hit. Bank of America fell $1.22, to $43.43, after it said it expected write-downs to increase and ''weak'' earnings through the first quarter of next year. 
 ''You certainly can assume results will again be quite disappointing,'' the chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said.
 Wachovia slid $1.42, to $40.53, after saying that it might double its provision for loan losses in the final quarter and that it could not predict when credit markets would return to normal.
 Bond prices fell. The price of the 10-year Treasury note declined to 101 9/32, from 102 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.09 percent, from 3.97 percent.

HEADLINE: Manhattan: Strike Vote By Building Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Several thousand janitors, doormen and other employees who help clean and operate New York City's office buildings voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to authorize a strike on Jan. 1 if the city's real estate industry does not grant them the substantial raise their union is seeking. Mike Fishman, the union's president, said that a large raise was warranted because office rents in Manhattan have jumped by more than 25 percent in the past year. Negotiators for the building owners say that the workers are already the nation's highest paid and that the industry could be hurt by the shaky economy.

HEADLINE: Airline Trade Group Predicts a Further Drop in Profit Next Year

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
Soaring fuel prices and slowing economic growth are likely to wipe out much of the airline industry's profits next year, despite steady increases in global demand for air travel, the International Air Transport Association, a leading trade group, said Wednesday. 
 Analysts said the expected slowdown could increase pressure on less-profitable carriers, particularly in the United States, to merge. 
 With oil prices hovering in a range of $90 to $100 a barrel, the association cut its forecast for 2008 industry profits by more than one-third, to $5 billion, from the $7.8 billion it predicted in September. It was the industry's second sharp earnings revision in less than six months; in June it issued a 2008 forecast of $9.6 billion in profit next year.
 ''The peak of the business cycle is over, and we are still $190 billion in debt,'' said Giovanni Bisi- gnani, the association's director general. ''So we could be heading for a downturn with little cash in the bank to cushion the fall.''
 Airline earnings have improved strongly in 2007 after six unprofitable years in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 2001. Aggressive efforts to cut costs have reduced nonfuel expenses by 16 percent since 2001, and for the first 10 months of this year, passenger traffic rose 7.3 percent from the period a year earlier.
 The association said that indicated that demand remained robust in most regions. But the increasing risk of a sharp economic downturn in the United States threatens to limit spending on air travel, particularly among business passengers.
 In a report accompanying the revised forecast, the association's chief economist, Brian Pearce, wrote, ''Economic growth and airline revenues have been holding up well during 2007, helping to offset fuel costs and boost airline profitability.'' 
 He predicted, however, that ''revenue support will drop away during 2008 as the U.S. economic slowdown directly restricts air travel growth and has knock-on effects on linked economies and travel markets.''
 Mr. Pearce said that air traffic in Asia, particularly in China, was likely to grow unabated, and to slow only slightly in Europe.
 North American carriers were likely to see the biggest drop in profit, down nearly 19 percent in 2008, to $2.2 billion, from a forecast of $2.7 billion in 2007. With 35 percent of their fleets more than 25 years old, United States carriers were expected to be hurt most by higher fuel costs because older planes can be 30 to 40 percent less fuel-efficient than newer aircraft. The United States domestic market represents about 30 percent of global air traffic.
 The air transport association's revised profit outlook is based on a price forecast for crude oil in 2008 of $78 a barrel on average, well above the $67 average price it forecast in September. The group said it expected fuel to represent 30 percent of total operating costs, up from just over 10 percent in 1997.
 Most United States airlines remain heavily in debt, making them particularly vulnerable to fuel price swings or the effects of an economic downturn.
 ''This industry is so highly leveraged that you don't need a big change in one factor to have a significant impact on profitability,'' said Lloyd Brown, an airline industry analyst at Ernst & Young in London.
 With access to credit tightening across all industries, he added, airlines could soon find it more difficult to finance new and more efficient aircraft.
 The worsening short-term outlook for the industry, Mr. Brown and others said, could put renewed pressure on weaker carriers in the United States to combine operations to save on costs.
 Last month, a New York hedge fund sent a letter to managers of Delta Air Lines urging them to enter merger talks with UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and create the world's largest carrier. The two airlines denied that they were in discussions, but Delta said it had hired advisers to evaluate potential merger partners.
 Peter Morris, chief economist with Ascend, a London-based consultancy, cautioned that consolidation alone might not yield significant cost savings in the short run. That is because unions were likely to resist further job cuts, having made concessions to help carriers emerge from bankruptcy protection.
 ''If you look at the various factors in North America, it could be that the only solution is a smaller, more expensive industry,'' Mr. Morris said.

HEADLINE: India, a Stirring Giant, Is the New Place to See and Be Seen

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
If it's Monday, it must be Romania -- and Finland and Minnesota. 
 A soaring economy and crumbling trade barriers are making India a ''must visit'' destination for foreign politicians and executives. The crush of visitors, often first-timers but also companies seeking to expand their existing operations here, lands daily. They all hope to sign deals, find local partners, sell their wares or just soak up the contradictions that characterize the world's largest democracy, a singular melding of chaos and opportunity.
 Bald demographics make India impossible to ignore, and the slowdown in the United States economy adds to its appeal. About half of the country's 1.1 billion people are under 25, and its rapidly expanding middle class is already estimated to be as large as the entire population of the United States. A rocketing stock market and a fast-growing class of the superrich add to its appeal.
 Trade experts compare the rising tide of interest to the wave of outsiders who flooded China a few years ago. This year, Felipe Calderon Hinojosa became the first Mexican head of state to visit India in 22 years. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the United States Treasury secretary, have all paid their respects. 
 But official delegations are arriving from unexpected corners of the globe, too. On a recent typical Monday in New Delhi, the government played host to Minnesotan businessmen led by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Romanian delegation led by the senior counselor in the ministry of small and medium-size companies, and Finns led by the minister of trade and development. 
 Privatization of major industries, a quickly Westernizing, youthful population and the prevalence of English draw a wildly diverse group of prospectors. 
 On a recent visit to Mumbai, Donald Trump Jr. pledged to invest in real estate there, Jagermeister held parties in New Delhi to introduce consumers to its herbal liquor, Prudential Financial partnered with the Indian real estate giant DLF to create an asset management business and Fiat announced tentative plans to import the Alfa Romeo.
 India is like the ''proverbial bus in today's business world,'' said Suhel Seth, managing partner with Counselage India, a New Delhi-based branding consultancy. ''No one knows where it is going, no one knows whether there is space on it for them -- but no one wants to miss that bus.'' 
 Given the vast and varied interest, Indian business leaders can sound overwhelmed. ''Iceland is suddenly on our radar screen,'' said Supriya Banerji, the deputy director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, one of the country's largest trade groups. ''Malta is coming in and Cyprus is clamoring for us.'' So are Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Mozambique, all of which have sent delegations. 
 It is too soon to tell what impact the visits will have economically. They rarely yield immediate results, and sometimes they produce negative reactions. India's mix of poverty and areas where vast, fetid slums edge newly refurbished international airports and barefoot children beg outside of $500-a-night hotels, has left more than one Western visitor aghast.
 The realities of India often surprise even first-time visitors who have studied the country. Signs of social upheaval -- strikes, dangerous roads and electricity that flickers off even in the most luxurious hotels -- are common. One recent morning in a five-star New Delhi hotel, bleary-eyed Minnesota executives puzzled out a scene from the night before. As they had returned from a visit to the Taj Mahal, thousands of protesters blocked the road, police conspicuously absent. The Americans did not make it back to New Delhi until after midnight. 
 ''We learned a lot,'' said Jonathan B. Farber, president of global underwriting for Travelers, the insurance company, picking his words. It was interesting to see ''how the logistics worked themselves out,'' he said, recalling that as protesters laid down in one lane of the highway, two-way traffic seemed to intuitively share the other lane.
 In spite of such hiccups, most visitors are optimistic about India's future and the opportunities it offers their companies. To date, ''trade has been rather modest,'' acknowledged Asko Numminen, the Finnish ambassador, tall and blue-eyed, in an understated gray suit that complemented his embassy's clean Nordic lines. In a nod to his host country, his tie depicted a field of elephants.
 In Finland, Mr. Numminen said, ''we are speaking about the 'India phenomena.''' He said companies, universities and research centers were looking toward India because it had the ''biggest pool of human resources in the world.'' Since the beginning of September, Mr. Numminen has traveled twice to Chennai to open factories for Finnish companies, and Finnair now has 12 direct flights a week from Helsinki to India.
 Members of foreign royalty are also making official visits to India -- even royalty whose ancestors were involved in colonization of the subcontinent centuries ago. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands arrived in October, with eight of her country's most important chief executives, on her second visit to India.
 Warner Rootliep, general manager for the Air France-KLM Group in the region, said the trip allowed the executives a ''great opportunity to raise some questions directly to the prime minister and other ministers present.'' 
 Showing off a knowledge of India is often de rigueur on the visits. When Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah came in October with university administrators and biotechnology executives to pitch business opportunities with Utah, he boasted over lunch with Indian industrialists that he had celebrated Diwali, the most important Hindu festival, at the governor's mansion back home. 
 Grinning, he said the relationship between the United States and India had ''gone from being flat as a chapati to sweet as gulab jamun,'' referring to a flatbread and a local dessert.
 Mr. Pawlenty of Minnesota started his speech in New Delhi with ''namaste,'' the Hindi greeting, though he was quick to address the obvious question: What could a group of Minnesotan and Indian businessmen have in common? 
 He said Indians tended to like spicy food, while some Minnesotans considered milk spicy, and called the contrasting weather a clear divide. But Mr. Pawlenty noted similarities too: both Minnesota and India broke away from Great Britain, both play forms of hockey, and rural life and farming are a backbone of each. 
 To be sure, India remains in China's shadow. Because of weak infrastructure, a fractious political climate and other hurdles, India's foreign trade and investment figures are dwarfed by China's, where foreign direct investment was nearly $70 billion in 2006. But many foreign companies and governments increasingly equate the two when they talk about the growth markets of the future. 
 The government here expects foreign direct investment to grow rapidly next year, to some $30 billion, from $19.5 billion, and the economy to grow at 9 percent for the third year in a row. 
 And India definitely tops China on one front. Because of increasing business travel demand, American Express predicts, hotel room rates here will increase more than anywhere else in the world in 2008: 34 to 38 percent for midrange hotels and 38 to 41 percent for the best hotels.

HEADLINE: Deal Governing Development in the Catskills Does Not End a Battle

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: HIGHMOUNT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer and his environmental team appeared to have won a big victory in September by brokering a deal to reduce the size of a proposed Catskill Mountains megaresort while protecting 1,200 acres of woodland from development. 
 But with the environmental review of the modified project now under way, it is clear that the long battle over the resort has not ended. 
 More than 250 people slogged through a freezing downpour Tuesday night to comment on the latest proposal to build a luxury resort and spa around the state-owned Belleayre Mountain Ski Center in Ulster County, where the meeting was held. 
 Although the deal announced in September was hailed as a blueprint for the kind of environmentally sensitive development that Mr. Spitzer promised to bring to New York, most of the people in the crowd -- joined by the Sierra Club and local environmental groups -- staunchly oppose the resort, saying it still is far too big. 
 Under the deal, the developer, Dean Gitter, abandoned plans to build a hotel, golf course and lodging units on the eastern side of the Belleayre ski slopes and agreed to sell 1,200 acres he owned there to the state. Mr. Gitter will shift most of the original project to 620 acres on the western side of Belleayre. One hotel would be built on the mountain's ridge and another hotel farther down the slope. The project also includes a golf course and 250 other units. 
 To sweeten the deal, the state agreed to expand Belleayre into the former Highmount ski area that it will buy from Mr. Gitter. The state will also build ski lifts to the ridge-top hotel.
 This part of the Catskills is one of the most economically distressed areas in the state. Since Mr. Gitter first proposed building a resort near Belleayre more than seven years ago, local towns and hamlets have been bitterly divided over whether it would help or hurt. Tuesday's hearing on the environmental impact of the modified project made it apparent that those divisions have continued. 
 When Daniel A. Ruzow, a lawyer representing Mr. Gitter, repeated promises that the project would create hundreds of temporary and permanent jobs, some people in the crowd applauded him. But opponents stood and made their objections known. 
 ''Our communities could survive without a few more boutiques and fashion outlets,'' said Matthew Frisch, whose family has owned a house in nearby Arkville for 50 years. He complained that the project would overwhelm local communities, disrupt traffic and drastically increase air pollution and noise.
 The resort would be in an environmentally sensitive area midway between two of New York City's upstate reservoirs. Dr. Norris K. Lee, a property owner in Hardenburgh, said that clearing the land for the huge project would send storm-water runoff into local streams that flow into the reservoirs, possibly forcing the city to build a hugely expensive filtration plant. 
 Opponents of the modified project include owners of second homes as well as residents whose families have lived and worked in the region for generations.
 Beverly Rainone, 73, who lives directly across a county road from the proposed development, said that the skiing drew her and her husband, Tom, to the area in the early 1970s. While she said she wanted to ski Highmount's trails again, she objected to the size of the revised project and thought the hotel on the ridge should not be allowed. 
 Several people raised concerns about the state's role in the project. The Department of Environmental Conservation, which operates Belleayre and would undertake its expansion, is also responsible for the environmental review of Mr. Gitter's project. 
 ''The agency that is supposed to be a watchdog for the public is now a part of the project that it is reviewing,'' said Ben Korman, 49, who has a weekend home adjacent to the proposed project. 
 Judith Enck, Mr. Spitzer's deputy secretary for the environment, who helped broker the compromise deal, agreed that the state had become a partner in the development project but said she saw nothing wrong with that. 
 ''This proposal certainly benefits the private parties, but it also benefits the state-run ski center in a way that is appropriate,'' she said. 
 A number of people in the audience thought that the governor's compromise agreement would provide a desperately needed shot in the arm for the region. 
 ''I urge those in opposition to reconsider their position,'' said Lewis E. Kolar, a retired banker who is chairman of a new group, Partners for Progress, that supports the development. ''If this project doesn't happen now,'' he said, ''nothing will ever happen.''

HEADLINE: Most Want Musharraf to Quit, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE and CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The first comprehensive public opinion poll conducted in Pakistan since President Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency last month has found that 67 percent of Pakistanis want him to resign immediately and that 70 percent say his government does not deserve re-election.
 The poll suggests that Mr. Musharraf will have to engage in substantial vote rigging to have the government of his choice win national elections on Jan. 8.
 The survey also calls into question the view in the United States of Mr. Musharraf as a leader who can effectively rule Pakistan and deliver in the campaign against terrorism. And it suggests that civil unrest could erupt if Mr. Musharraf were to win the election. 
 The poll was conducted by the International Republican Institute, a nonprofit group based in Washington that is affiliated with the Republican Party and promotes democracy abroad. The results were provided to The New York Times before their release on Thursday. 
 Pakistan's two main opposition leaders, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, each a former prime minister, are already accusing Mr. Musharraf of fixing the vote in advance and vowing protests if he prevails.
 ''If elections are rigged, we are going to need to be in a position like the people of Ukraine were, to protest those elections,'' Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference last week. ''A plan is under way to rig the elections, and to stop progress towards democracy.''
 On Nov. 3, Mr. Musharraf declared a state of emergency, abrogated Pakistan's Constitution, fired the Supreme Court, blacked out the independent news channels and arrested more than 5,000 of his opponents. Since then, most prisoners have been released and Mr. Musharraf has resigned from his post as army chief, but his actions have ''polarized'' Pakistani society, according to the poll.
 Two-thirds of those surveyed ''expressed anger at the current state of affairs, desired change and were anti-Musharraf,'' the institute said. And one third ''remained supportive of President Musharraf and were positive about the condition of the country.''
 An American-backed proposal that Mr. Musharraf form a government with Ms. Bhutto also appears to be deeply unpopular. Sixty percent of Pakistanis polled opposed such a deal, which American officials had hoped would bolster support for Mr. Musharraf.
 Instead, 58 percent said they would support a ''Grand Opposition Alliance'' among Ms. Bhutto, Mr. Sharif and other parties against Mr. Musharraf, a former general who seized power in a 1999 coup. Fifty-six percent said the army, which has intermittently ruled Pakistan since it won independence from Britain 60 years ago, should have no role in civilian government.
 If Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif do not form an alliance, the country appears to be headed toward a hung Parliament, according to the poll. Asked which party they would support in elections, 30 percent of those polled said they would support Ms. Bhutto's party, 25 percent named Mr. Sharif's and 23 percent favored Mr. Musharraf's.
 The poll was based on the responses of 3,520 randomly selected men and women from across Pakistan, according to the institute. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.69 percentage points. 
 ''If they did unite, they would put themselves in a much stronger position,'' said Robert Varsalone, the institute's country director, referring to Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif.
 But the two are bitter personal rivals and, according to Pakistani political analysts, unlikely to be able to form a government together. They predicted continued political instability if no party wins the vote decisively, with Mr. Musharraf, Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif all vying to cobble together governing coalitions with smaller parties.
 The poll also identified several worrying trends for Mr. Musharraf's party. Seventy percent of Pakistanis said they felt the country was headed in the wrong direction and 51 percent said their personal economic situation had worsened. And Mr. Sharif, who returned to Pakistan from exile two weeks ago, appears to be drawing center-right voters away from Mr. Musharraf, a key source of his support.
 Pakistani and Western observers warn that clear signs already exist that Mr. Musharraf and his supporters are manipulating the election. They fear a repeat of nationwide elections won by Mr. Musharraf's party in 2002.
 ''It was Pakistan's most rigged election,'' said Ijaz Gilani, chairman of Gallup Pakistan, an Islamabad-based polling and research firm. ''Never in our history have we had so much pre-poll and post-poll rigging.''
 The irregularities were numerous, according to the opposition and observers, including education requirements that knocked opposition candidates off the ballot and the severe gerrymandering of districts in favor of Mr. Musharraf's supporters. Long before the race, Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif had been forced into exile, weakening the ability of their parties to function. 
 As the race approached, Mr. Musharraf took over much of Mr. Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League. He also passed a requirement that all candidates have a university degree, a measure that knocked some of Ms. Bhutto's and Mr. Sharif's strongest candidates off the ballot.
 Ikram Sehgal, a defense analyst and retired army pilot who runs a security company, said government and intelligence officials also engaged in ''post-poll rigging,'' pressing successful candidates from other parties to defect.
 ''They would say: 'You have not paid your taxes, here are the bills. These are the corruption cases against you,' '' he said. 
 This year, the country's election commission, judiciary and local governments are all run by officials loyal to Mr. Musharraf. Analysts say the president has used the state of emergency to create an electoral playing field that favors his candidates, constraining media coverage, public rallies and the length of the campaign.
 The dismissal and continued detention of Supreme Court and High Court judges ''sent a very strong signal'' that election results could not be appealed, according an election observer who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Instead of the standard 60-day campaign, candidates will have only three weeks after emergency rule, which is expected to end this weekend. Restrictions will remain against rallies and processions, which are only permitted in proscribed places. 
 And Mr. Musharraf has muzzled the country's news media, barring live coverage of election rallies and popular political talk shows. Under a new ordinance unilaterally enacted by Mr. Musharraf under emergency rule, television journalists face up to three years in jail for broadcasting ''anything which defames or brings into ridicule the head of state.''
 In a letter to stations on Monday, government officials accused them of airing live telephone calls from the public that contained ''baseless propaganda against Pakistan and incite people to violence.'' If the practice continued, they said, station owners and journalists could be jailed.
 Fears also exist that government resources are being used in favor of election candidates. The nazim, or district mayor, who controls the local government officials running polling stations, can oversee rigging, Mr. Sehgal said. Opposition parties have demanded they be replaced by neutral officials during the election campaign. 
 Mr. Sehgal also said law enforcement agencies could shutter polling stations where opposition candidates were expected to do well on the pretext that there were disturbances. ''The police find out where they could lose a polling station and they close it early,'' he said. ''And they put the votes of their party in the box.''
 And after ballots are cast, there are concerns about how the vote will be tallied, according to the election observer. Political party observers may be barred from election centers where results from across the constituency will be totaled. ''It's a huge deficiency,'' he said.
 On Wednesday, Aitzaz Ahsan, a top lawyer who has been under house arrest during the state of emergency was imposed, announced that he was pulling out of the election, in deference to the lawyers who have sought a boycott of elections until the former Supreme Court is restored. 
 He and other lawyers predict the vote will be rigged. Mr. Sehgal estimates that Pervez Elahi, the former chief minister of Punjab Province and the leading candidate from Mr. Musharraf's party, can secure 100 seats in Punjab by virtue of his control of government machinery there. 
 Without rigging, he would only get 45 to 50 seats, he said. Mr. Gilani said his polling has shown 20 percent support for Mr. Musharraf's party after the emergency.

HEADLINE: 3M Expecting Strong 2008, Aided by Big Gains Abroad

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The 3M Company said on Wednesday that it expected double-digit sales and earnings growth in 2008 and forecast profit slightly above the average Wall Street estimate. 
 The company expects its growth to come from international markets and the weaker dollar. It forecast moderately softer world economic growth next year, with the United States continuing to be slow but still growing.
 The second half of the year is likely to be stronger than the first, and the company forecast strong and sustainable growth in developing economies like Brazil, Russia, India and China. It also expects no relief in the residential housing market in the United States.
 Shares of 3M rose $2.01, to $86.66.
 3M expects 2008 earnings of $5.44 to $5.47 a share. Analysts' average estimate is $5.42, according to Reuters Estimates.
 The company said it expected sales from existing businesses to grow 5 percent to 8 percent next year, while acquisitions would contribute about 3 percent to revenue growth.
 It said current exchange rates suggest the weak dollar would add up to 3 percent to sales growth.
 Almost two-thirds of its sales next year will be generated overseas, said the chief executive, George W. Buckley.
 That exposure is the highest in the industrial group, an analyst at JPMorgan, Stephen Tusa, said in a research note.
 ''The forecast is stronger than expected,'' Mr. Tusa wrote. ''The upside relative to our expectations comes from both top line and margin.''

HEADLINE: Express Track to a Fare Increase

 BODY:
Next week, the board of the state Metropolitan Transportation Authority is scheduled to vote on raising tolls and fares for mass transit. But the real decision seems to have been made already. Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who wants the increase and approves the appointments of board members, won the support of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who controls 4 of the board's 14 members. It is unlikely that the board, really independent in name only, would defy them. 
 Still, it would be refreshing to see a last stand for mass transit. We have said all along that keeping public transportation running and building for the future is important, but that the cost of doing so should not be borne by riders alone. Thanks to a fluke -- the M.T.A. rebalanced its books and found an extra $220 million (memo to the authority: check your math more often) -- riders are being hit with an average increase of under 4 percent, which is less than the one proposed last summer.
 While that was a welcome development, the other part of the correct funding formula for transit is still being ignored. The state and the city have both severely shortchanged transportation for more than a decade. Instead of providing new dedicated money from general revenues as it should, the state has done the job mostly with real estate taxes that fluctuate from year to year. The results were predictable: when the economy teeters, it takes down transit money. The city contributes a measly 4 percent of the transit budget, although it has marked extra money if Mr. Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan is approved, a far-from-guaranteed outcome. 
 While the authority will end the current year with a $500 million surplus, it forecasts red ink for the foreseeable future and needs to find money now. It's no mystery why Mr. Spitzer, at the end of a rocky first year and facing red ink of more than $4 billion, would want to put off the day of reckoning. It is puzzling, though, that he is holding off a promise of new transit money to 2010 -- when he'll be seeking re-election.
 In the meantime, he should not be rejecting offers for help. The city comptroller, Bill Thompson, produced a study two months ago that found $728 million in potential revenue, more than enough to offset the need for immediate fare increases. And in Albany, scores of lawmakers have vowed to fight for extra money for transportation in the budget due before April 1.
 If the increase is approved, the fare would not rise for the 14 percent of passengers who buy single-ride tickets. But the 86 percent who enjoy discounts will pay significantly more. New York passengers already bear more of mass transit's costs than riders in other major cities. They should be squeezed harder only after every option has been tried.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Chinese Officials Duel on Economic Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: XINGHE, China 

 BODY:
A delegation of senior American economic officials led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. churned through a long day of meetings Wednesday with their Chinese counterparts, picking and poking at many economic issues while encountering arguments from the Chinese on several fronts.
 Mr. Paulson said he hoped that there would be a joint statement at the end of the discussions on Thursday signaling new commitments to ease economic tensions, but, he said, the main value of the conference was that it deepened the trust and openness between the countries. 
 ''The tone was comfortable and it was pragmatic,'' he said, adding that there had been ''interesting, lively but friendly exchanges'' on changes in capital markets, the openness of China to imports and investments, and resistance by the Chinese to Western demands for a more rapid rise in its currency. 
 The Treasury secretary has been pressing China since he took office in mid-2006 to allow the currency, the yuan, to increase in value. A stronger yuan would make exports from China to the United States more expensive and American exports to China cheaper. Some economists say a currency appreciation would ease the trade deficit with China, which could soar to nearly $300 billion this year. 
 The Americans have recently avoided the argument that currency appreciation would alter the trade balance. Rather, Mr. Paulson said he had argued that China's policy of keeping the value of its currency low requires keeping interest rates low, and that this contributes to an overheated economy and inflation.
 ''There is no doubt the Chinese are increasingly hearing this from other members of the global economy,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''I don't just think -- I know -- they're hearing more from others.''
 But in a sign of the discord apparently going on in the meetings, a Chinese official said at a news conference that calls from outsiders for China to engage in ''excessive'' appreciation of the yuan were irresponsible.
 ''We are not in favor of excessively fast appreciation of Chinese currency,'' said Chen Deming, vice minister of commerce, who is scheduled to become the minister next year. ''I don't think it will serve all of us any good.''
 American officials say that China is worried that raising interest rates, slowing the economy and allowing the value of its currency to rise will shrink the economy and throw people out of work, leading to instability.
 Meeting in a conference center here south of Beijing modeled after buildings from the Forbidden City, the American and Chinese delegates moved from large halls to small side rooms in their efforts to reach understandings. They were fortified by what American officials described as the success of a separate process that resulted in the signing of agreements Tuesday, including one on food safety that called for American health inspectors to play a greater role in inspections in China.
 That agreement was negotiated over the last six months by Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, who said that without the dialogue set up last year, it would have been harder to arrange for officials from several agencies to meet with their Chinese counterparts. 
 Other agreements signed by Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez and Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, called for market openings in some limited areas like exports of American medical devices. 
 It was evident, on the other hand, that even as some issues were being solved, others were popping up. American officials were dismayed to learn, for example, of the latest action by the Chinese this week in barring imports of American-made films, many of them Hollywood blockbusters.
 The suspension of imports means that the Chinese will obtain pirated copies of the films at a time the United States has taken China to the World Trade Organization to try to force it to do more to crack down on piracy and counterfeiting of trademarks, videos, music and software.
 According to American officials, Ms. Schwab in one meeting raised other issues, including what she said was a lack of authorization for American credit cards and insurance services, and also the monopoly of the official news agency Xinhua.
 She and Mr. Gutierrez also raised concerns about China's new antimonopoly law and a regulation on mergers and acquisitions, which American business leaders say they fear could lead to the exclusion of American companies from Chinese consumers and markets. 
 Both have said they are concerned that the use of arcane regulations and rules, governing everything from the size of cellphone batteries to the types of wheels for motorcycles, appears aimed at keeping American products out. United States officials said they had been pressing China for a declaration at this session that this was not its intention.
 A top trade official said that a declaration at the opening meeting by Vice Premier Wu Yi, the leader of the Chinese delegation, that Beijing had no intention of abandoning its openness policy was somewhat reassuring, but many remain unconvinced. 
 At one point, Mr. Gutierrez and his team brought a Harley-Davidson motorcycle into the conference center and asked the future commerce minister, Mr. Chen, to pose on top of it. Harley-Davidson maintains that it is barred from selling its motorcycles in China because of new rules on the size of wheels.
 ''We heard a very strong, impassioned and lengthy defense of China's open investment policy,'' a trade official said. ''That was encouraging, but we do continue to see these problems pop up.''
 Ms. Wu, a focus of much discussion among American officials, is an energetic and blunt alumna of China's bureaucracy, with a reputation as a problem solver but also as someone who pushes back. On Wednesday morning she lectured the Americans about not blaming China for their problems at home.
 Earlier this week, she asserted that the American news media had ''hyped'' the problem of food safety and damaged China's image. An American official said that she was susceptible to equally tough talk in return.
 ''This was an opportunity for us to say to the Chinese, 'You know what? It's not media hype,' '' a trade official said. But he said that those who want to open Chinese markets might increasingly be on the defensive against those who want to keep high barriers to foreign investments and products.

HEADLINE: Biogen Takes Itself Off the Block After Failing to Sell High, and Shares Plunge 28%

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Big pharmaceutical companies may be desperate for new products, but they apparently are not ready to obtain them at any price. 
 Investors in the biotechnology company Biogen Idec found that out the hard way late Wednesday when it announced that it had not received any definitive offers after putting itself up for sale two months ago. The company said it would remain independent. 
 Biogen's stock plunged more than $20, or 28 percent, to about $55 in early after-hours trading, having finished up 49 cents, to $75.88, in regular trading. 
 Analysts said the stock had risen so much in anticipation of a deal, especially after Carl C. Icahn showed an interest, that it had become unreasonable even for big drug makers. 
 ''It's definitely a disappointment to Wall Street and will provide some deflation in the M.& A. premiums provided to the larger biotechs,'' said Kurt von Emster, portfolio manager of the MPM BioEquities Fund. 
 Big pharmaceutical companies, struggling to develop new products, have been buying smaller companies or the rights to their products. 
 Many of the traditional pharmaceutical companies are seeking especially to expand into biotechnology -- in part because the protein-based drugs made by biotechnology companies are less likely to face generic competition than the chemical pills made by the pharmaceutical companies. 
 Such a desire led to AstraZeneca's $15.6 billion takeover of MedImmune this year. In the last month Celgene agreed to acquire Pharmion for $2.9 billion, and Eisai of Japan said it would buy MGI Pharma for $3.9 billion. 
 Biogen, one of the oldest and most successful biotech companies, seemed to be an inviting target. It has three big products on the market, Avonex and Tysabri, both used to treat multiple sclerosis, and Rituxan, for lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis. 
 The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., announced on Oct. 12 that it would explore a sale, having drawn expressions of interest. One of them was from Mr. Icahn, who has been bringing his brand of activist investing to the biotechnology arena. 
 Mr. Icahn said at the time that he had made a bid, but suggested his real goal was to force Biogen into the arms of a larger pharmaceutical company. 
 On the day that Biogen announced it was for sale, Mr. Icahn told the company he would not buy it, a Biogen spokeswoman said Wednesday. Mr. Icahn also declined to participate in the later bidding process, the spokeswoman, Naomi Aoki, said. 
 Biogen shares spiked to more than $80 after the announcement, making the company worth $23 billion. That could have made it expensive even for a large pharmaceutical company. Shares then started to slide as prospects for a deal seemed to dim.
 Biogen hired Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch and contacted every large pharmaceutical company, Ms. Aoki said. Investment bankers and analysts said some companies did explore an acquisition. Pfizer, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline were said to be among them. 
 Another complicating factor was that Biogen shares Tysabri with Elan and Rituxan with Genentech. Settling with those companies, in the event Biogen was acquired, could have added to a deal's costs, and there was a chance that Biogen could have lost Tysabri. 
 Roger Longman, managing partner of Windhover Information, a health care information and publishing company, said Biogen's failure to attract a buyer might discourage activist investors who have been pressuring other biotechnology companies to go on the auction block. 
 ''The notion that activist shareholders can just come in and dictate play in the pharmaceutical industry has got a pretty hollow ring to it right now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Countrywide Subpoenaed By Illinois

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The Illinois attorney general is investigating the home loan unit of Countrywide Financial as part of the state's expanding inquiry into dubious lending practices that have trapped borrowers in high-cost mortgages they can no longer afford.
 Lisa Madigan, the attorney general, has subpoenaed documents from Countrywide relating to its loan origination practices, a person briefed on the matter said. Rick Simon, a Countrywide spokesman, said the company was cooperating with the investigation but declined to comment further. 
 The inquiry follows an investigation by Ms. Madigan's office into One Source Mortgage, a Chicago mortgage broker that recently closed its doors. Ms. Madigan sued One Source on Nov. 27, contending that the company misled borrowers by promising low rates on mortgages without advising them that their payments would jump sharply shortly after the loans were made. Countrywide was One Source's primary lender, according to the lawsuit.
 Countrywide, the nation's largest mortgage lender and loan servicer, is coming under increased scrutiny as the home loan crisis deepens. In addition to the Illinois investigation, the company is also fielding inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission about significant stock trades made by Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive, before Countrywide's stock plummeted this year. 
 The United States trustee, which oversees the bankruptcy court system, is investigating Countrywide's actions in two cases involving borrowers in South Florida whose loans were serviced by the company. The trustee is trying to determine if the company's conduct in those cases represents abuses of the bankruptcy system. 
 The attorney general's lawsuit contended that One Source put borrowers into loans with terms they did not understand, especially so-called pay option adjustable-rate mortgages. These loans allow borrowers to pay only a fraction of the interest owed and none of the principal, resulting in a growing rather than a shrinking mortgage balance. Countrywide was One Source's main provider of pay option loans, documents in that case show.
 ''This company's conduct is a prime example of unscrupulous mortgage brokers that has led to a foreclosure crisis for many Illinois homeowners,'' Ms. Madigan said when she filed the suit against One Source.
 Mark D. Belongia, a lawyer at Belongia & Shapiro in Chicago, represents One Source and its president, Charles G. Mangold. Mr. Belongia said his client denied all of the suit's charges and expected to be vindicated in court. 
 Donald Wagner, a professor of Middle East studies and comparative religion at North Park University on Chicago's North Side, is a One Source client who has talked to the attorney general about his troubles with a Countrywide pay option loan. In March 2005, he refinanced his fixed-rate mortgage to help pay for his daughter's college education. He said the One Source broker did not tell him his low teaser rate -- less than 2 percent -- would jump after just one month. 
 ''I kept asking them and checking on that,'' Mr. Wagner said. ''Then it jumped to more than 7 percent and now it's up to 8 percent plus and it's going to jump again. I am actually paying out over 60 percent of my monthly income, and it's only so long that I can do that.''
 Because Mr. Wagner cannot afford to pay both the interest and principal, the amount of his Countrywide loan has risen to $307,000, from $292,000 two and a half years ago. He has had to borrow against his 401(k) and university pension to meet his payments, he said. Making matters worse, when he tried to sell his house last summer to get out from under the mortgage, he learned that the loan carried a prepayment penalty of $12,000. 
 Mr. Wagner has asked Countrywide to drop the prepayment penalty, but it has declined to do so.
 Of the 69 borrower cases examined by the attorney general's office, 26 of the first mortgages and 4 of the second liens were made by Countrywide. Fremont Investment and Loan, a unit of the Fremont General Corporation, was One Source's second-largest lender, with 20 loans. Last March, Fremont Investment consented to a cease-and-desist order issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which contended that the company had practiced unsound lending and had violated laws or regulations. 
 The Illinois suit against One Source Mortgage said the company lured borrowers with misrepresentations about the interest rates on their loans. For example, one borrower was told that he would have an interest rate of less than 1 percent for the first year of his mortgage, but the rate rose to 7.5 percent after a month, according to the complaint.
 One Source also used high-pressure tactics to rush borrowers through their loan closings, according to the suit. Most of the closings took less than 30 minutes, the attorney general said, with some only 10 to 15 minutes. One borrower was told that ''it would take two days to explain everything,'' and that the closing had to take place before that.
 Some borrowers told Illinois investigators that they did not know One Source brokers had inflated their incomes to get them a larger mortgage. One consumer provided pay stubs and tax returns to One Source showing her income to be $2,200 a month, the suit said. Only later did she discover that One Source had listed her monthly income as $9,000. 
 The Illinois attorney general has been aggressive in moving against mortgage lending abuses. State officials were part of the executive committee that negotiated the settlement reached in January 2006 between Ameriquest, a big mortgage lender, and 49 state attorneys general. Under that deal, the company, without admitting or denying the accusations of loan improprieties, agreed to pay $295 million to consumers in 49 states and more than $30 million to cover costs of the investigation. 
 A recent analysis by The Chicago Reporter, an investigative newsmagazine, found that the Chicago area ranks first among United States metropolitan areas in the number of subprime loans issued to homeowners from 2004 through 2006.

HEADLINE: 3 Big Banks See No Relief As Write-Offs Mount Up

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation, the Wachovia Corporation and PNC Financial Services Group said on Wednesday that losses tied to bad debt would be worse than expected, the latest indication that the credit markets are not returning to normal. 
 The chief executive of Bank of America, Kenneth D. Lewis, predicted that disruptions would stretch into next year. 
 Wachovia said that it might set aside twice as much for loan losses than planned in this quarter and that write-downs already equal the third quarter's total. 
 PNC said quarterly profit would be less than analysts estimated.
 Wednesday's announcements are an indication that bankers see no quick end to losses and write-downs, which total about $80 billion this year. 
 Mr. Lewis said loan losses would increase in 2008 at Bank of America, and the chief executive of Wachovia, G. Kennedy Thompson, said conditions were the toughest he had seen in his 32-year career.
 ''None of us know what inning we are in,'' Mr. Thompson said at a conference in Manhattan. ''We know credit quality isn't improving out there.''
 Shares in Bank of America fell $1.19, to $43.46. Wachovia lost $1.42, to $40.53 and PNC declined $2.51, to $68.25.
 ''You certainly can assume results will again be quite disappointing,'' Mr. Lewis said, referring to quarterly earnings. His bank expects to make a profit in the fourth quarter.
 Bank of America said last month that it may need to write down $3 billion of debt securities in the fourth quarter that lost value because of defaults on subprime mortgages. Mr. Lewis said on Wednesday that the cost would be more than that.
 The credit markets ''have turned down again and will probably remain challenging into next year,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Our trading revenue has been considerably depressed by the lack of business activity and widening spreads in a number of product categories.''
 Moody's Investors Service changed its rating outlook on Bank of America to negative from stable.
 Write-downs for debt instruments known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, are ''unknowable,'' Mr. Lewis said
 An analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners, Jeffery Harte, said, ''It sounds like Bank of America is becoming more bearish on the U.S. economy.''
 ''They have one of the best consumer franchises in the world,'' Mr. Harte said, ''but they can't get out of the way of these environmental headwinds.''
 PNC reduced its fourth-quarter earnings forecast after writing down the value of $1.5 billion in mortgages and posting lower trading results. Earnings will be $1 to $1.15 a share, the bank said in a regulatory filing. PNC previously agreed with analysts' estimates of $1.30 to $1.45 a share, a spokesman, Brian Goerke, said.
 PNC increased its provision for credit losses by about $45 million, mostly to cover loans on residential real estate.

HEADLINE: Confidence Falls Among Japan's Manufacturers

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Confidence in business conditions at major Japanese companies fell from three months ago, a closely watched Bank of Japan survey showed Friday, dampening expectations of an interest rate increase and clouding the outlook for the world's No. 2 economy. 
 The quarterly ''tankan'' survey showed the sentiment index for large manufacturers at 19, down from 23 in the previous survey in September, and below the 21 mark forecast by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
 A similar index for large non-manufacturers in the survey, which polls more than 10,000 companies nationwide, also dipped to 16 from 20, below a forecast of 18.
 The disappointing numbers came amid worries that Japan's growth might take a hit from a possible slowdown in the United States economy, which continues to wrestle with a credit crisis and higher raw material prices.
 Last week, the government cited slow corporate capital investment to downgrade growth figures for the July-September quarter. It said the economy grew at an annual pace of just 1.5 percent, worse than a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent.
 Along with sluggish data on jobs and consumer prices, the latest tankan reading has cemented expectations that the central bank will hold off from raising a key interest rate at its policy meeting next week.
 Analysts believe the Bank of Japan, which last raised its benchmark rate to 0.5 percent in February, will sit tight as it gauges the American economy -- a crucial export market -- and fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis.

HEADLINE: Shares Close Mixed on Inflation Concern

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks finished another volatile session mixed on Thursday after a spike in wholesale prices touched off inflation concerns and partly overshadowed a strong increase in retail sales last month.
 Despite the uneven economic news, an upbeat forecast from Honeywell International propped up the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Prices at the wholesale level rose 3.2 percent in November, the biggest increase in 34 years, after a steep increase in wholesale gasoline prices. While the Fed generally focuses on inflation figures that exclude food and energy costs, a sharp rise in the overall inflation could make it harder for the central bank to continue cutting interest rates.
 But the news was not all bad. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 1.2 percent in November, the largest amount in six months and double what economists had expected, and a Labor Department report showed a decline in new claims filed for unemployment benefits. 
 The Dow rose 44.06, or 0.3 percent, to 13,517.96.
 Broader stock indicators showed smaller moves and finished mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 1.82, or 0.1 percent, to 1,488.41, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 2.65, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,668.49.
 Scott Fullman, director for investment strategy at I. A. Englander & Company in New York, said investors struggled with the day's economic readings as well as with the Fed's agreement with the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Canada and Switzerland to help bolster the credit markets.
 ''It's definitely a mixed picture. People are still digesting what came from the Fed. You put this all together and it gives you a healthy dose of volatility,'' he said. ''I really don't think anybody is saying, 'I'm very confident to get into this market.'''
 The market's back and forth trading has most likely kept some uneasy investors out of the market, said Robert Schaeffer, vice president of Becker Capital Management in Portland, Ore. He pointed to relatively light trading volumes of late as evidence of hesitation by some investors.
 ''You don't like to stick your neck out because the S.& P. may be down 30 points in the next five minutes. It makes people hesitant to invest.''
 A slowdown in the housing market remains a concern for Wall Street, as do rising mortgage defaults, which have made banks hesitant to lend to one another amid uncertainty about who might be holding bad debt. 
 Honeywell gained after forecasting 16 to 21 percent growth in earnings per share for 2008. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had been expecting a 17 percent increase. Honeywell, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, rose $2.91, to $60.65.
 JetBlue Airways rose 90 cents, or 14 percent, to $7.15 after the German airline Deutsche Lufthansa said it planned to pay $300 million for a 19 percent stake in JetBlue.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 28/32, to 100 13/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, jumped to 4.20 percent from 4.09 percent at 5 p.m. on Wednesday. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: A New Breed Of Billionaire

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.. 
Landon Thomas Jr. reported from Istanbul and elsewhere in Turkey in October and did additional reporting from New York.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
Stuck in a traffic jam in his bulletproof BMW, the richest man in Turkey lets loose with a satisfied grin. 
 Since 2000, Husnu M. Ozyegin has spent more than $50 million of his own money, building 36 primary schools and girls' dormitories in the poorest parts of Turkey. Next to the Turkish government, Mr. Ozyegin is the biggest individual supporter of schools in the country -- and an official from the education ministry has told him that his market share is increasing.
 ''Not bad,'' he says in his gruff, cigarette-scarred voice as he pockets his mobile phone. ''If I can have an impact on one million Turkish people in the next 10 years, I will be happy.''
 The global wealth boom has created a new breed of billionaire in once-destitute countries like Turkey, India, Mexico and Russia. Propelled by their rising economies, robust currencies and globally competitive companies, they have ridden a surge in local stock markets that have reached previously untouchable heights in a short five-year timeframe. Now, a number of them are using their wealth to bolster their standing and push for social changes. 
 These entrepreneurs, who have made their billions in private sector industries like telecommunications, petrochemicals and finance, are distinct from a past generation of international billionaires, most with ties to Middle Eastern oil or valuable land holdings. Not only have they become the richest men in their countries; they are among the wealthiest in the world.
 For these emerging economies, where loose regulation, opaque privatization processes and monopolistic business practices abound, this extraordinary and uneven creation of wealth rivals in many ways the great American fortunes made at the turn of the 20th century. 
 While such countries have long been accustomed to vast disparities between a tiny class of the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses, the new elite shares some characteristics with counterparts in the United States. And just as Rockefellers, Carnegies and Morgans once used philanthropy to smooth the rough edges of their cutthroat business reputations -- as have a current generation of wealthy Americans that includes Bill Gates of Microsoft and Sanford I. Weill of Citigroup -- local billionaires in emerging markets are trying to do the same. 
 Global Philanthropy 
 Carlos Slim Helu, the telecommunications entrepreneur in Mexico who is worth more than $50 billion, has pledged billions of dollars to his two foundations that will aid health and education. Roman Abramovich, Russia's richest man, who has a net worth of $18 billion, has channeled more than $1 billion into the impoverished Arctic area of Chukotka, where he also serves as governor, building schools and hospitals.
 And in India, Azim Premji, the chairman of the software company Wipro who is worth $17 billion, has established his own foundation that supports elementary education.
 To be sure, as these fortunes are still being made, the sums donated are relatively small in light of the pressing social needs of these countries. But as return-driven philanthropy has gained in popularity through the efforts of Mr. Gates and others, emerging market billionaires are applying similar bottom-line oriented lessons to their own countries. 
 ''What we are seeing in these countries,'' said Jane Wales, president of the Global Philanthropy Forum, ''are people emerging from the private sector with tremendous wealth who are attracted to highly strategic philanthropy.''
 A Nontraditional Climb
 Here in Turkey, Mr. Ozyegin, who is 62 and has a net worth of $3.5 billion, did not secure his wealth by buying government assets on the cheap or by belonging to a rich family that controls a monopoly -- two traditional routes to great wealth in the developing world.
 The founder of a midtier corporate bank called Finansbank, he cashed in on a rush of interest by foreign financial institutions in Turkish banks last year and sold a controlling stake in his bank to the National Bank of Greece, receiving $2.7 billion in cash.
 Flush with money and ambition, he is doing all that he can to lift Turkish educational standards at the primary and university level. 
 Sitting in his personal conference room atop Finansbank's main office in Istanbul, Mr. Ozyegin recalls Aug. 18, 2006, when the sale of his 49 percent stake officially closed. 
 ''I remember that day better than my birthday,'' he said, as he leaned back in a plush leather chair. ''I was not only a billionaire but the richest man in Turkey. It's a great feeling, but your responsibilities increase.'' 
 Like many self-made billionaires, Mr. Ozyegin has a direct, demanding manner, and a day spent traveling with him does not yield much casual conversation. He carries two cellphones, Throughout a long day he juggles calls from his wife, his assistant, his son and assorted government bureaucrats, as well as the managers of his various businesses. 
 He typically works 11-hour days, not solely from his suite of offices but also from his car, plane or boat, checking in on his far-flung operations in Turkey as well as Russia, Romania and China. 
 ''I'm first generation, that gives me satisfaction,'' he said. ''Getting to the top is not so easy; staying there is more difficult.''
 Mr. Ozyegin's grandparents came to the southern Turkish city of Izmir from the Greek island of Crete in the late 19th century, during the dying days of the Ottoman Empire. The son of a doctor, he attended Robert College, an elite academy in Istanbul, before setting off to Oregon State University in 1963 with $1,000 in his pocket.
 An overachiever, he played basketball and led the student government, but earned mediocre grades. Harvard Business School seemed like a long shot given that he was in need of a scholarship. But he attached a picture of himself welcoming Robert F. Kennedy to Oregon State to his application and was accepted. ''I guess they liked me for my leadership abilities,'' he said.
 After a successful banking career, he founded Finansbank in 1987, selling his two homes and borrowing $3 million to get the deal done.
 At the outset, the bank's ambitions were small, providing corporate banking services to Turkish businesses. The bank's fortunes fluctuated in line with the volatile economy, expanding rapidly during the heady years of strong economic growth, but facing extinction on two separate occasions, in 1994 and 2001, when the Turkish markets suffered contractions.
 Becoming Competitive
 As a businessman, his frequent interaction with Southeast Asia, China and Russia has impressed upon him the need for Turks to become more competitive in today's global economy.
 ''The most important problem that Turkey has is education,'' he said.
 He cites the rapid increase of applications to Harvard Business School from Chinese and Indian students. Turkey, a smaller country, sends only four to eight students a year, said Mr. Ozyegin, who meets with the students when he visits. 
 Beyond his public school investments, Mr. Ozyegin has plans to spend up to $1 billion over the next 15 years on a new private university, to be called Ozyegin University. 
 ''I want to do something on a major scale,'' he said. ''My vision is that we can train and export people like India does.''
 Since he started his building program in 2000, Mr. Ozyegin has completed 36 schools and girls' dormitories at a cost that varies from $400,000 to $1.8 million each. He wants to reach 100 by 2010. He works closely with the government, with most of the building taking place in the country's poorest regions in the south and northeast.
 ''That is a lot, it is a very significant number,'' said Filiz Bikmen, the executive director of Tusev, a philanthropy foundation in Istanbul.
 Turkey has the lowest ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary school of any country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which requires its 30 members to meet minimum requirements for living standards and democratic practices. Turkey's low standing is a result of a traditional culture that, especially in poorer areas, places a higher premium on a boy's education than a girl's.
 In a country where the ruling party draws its root support from an electorate that is becoming more Islamic in attitude and outlook, Mr. Ozyegin's aim to reach out to undereducated girls touches a sensitive cultural vein (through his wife's foundation, Acev, he has also helped pay for women's literacy and early education programs in poor parts of the country.) 
 A practicing Muslim but avowedly secular in outlook, Mr. Ozyegin embodies the hopes as well as fears of Turkey's elite, many of its ranks now supporters of the ruling Justice and Development party, which has led the revitalization of the Turkish economy.
 Mr. Ozyegin hopes that focusing on education as an economic development tool will help transcend the current bitter disputes over religious practice, including whether the increase in the number of women wearing head scarves signifies the emergence of a more Islamic, less secular Turkey.
 ''I want Turkey to have the same education levels as Europe 25 years from now,'' he said. ''Whether you wear a scarf should not matter.''
 A Focus on Education
 When Mr. Ozyegin visits a school, he is frequently met by the district's mayor, a representative from the education ministry and various other local notables. His visits, like his business meetings, are swift and to the point -- a sweep through the school's halls and a barrage of questions directed at school officials. 
 At a primary school bearing his name, in a working-class district on the outskirts of Istanbul, he marches into a classroom of wide-eyed sixth graders who jump to their feet with the spirit and alacrity of a platoon hailing its general and he exhorts them to heed their studies. 
 At another school, he upbraids an official for countenancing stained carpets and trash that lines the building's long hallways. ''This place is full of garbage,'' he said, his voice low and angry. ''Do something about it. It's shameful.''
 There are touching moments, too. A newly built primary school in a village close to the border with Armenia echoes with shouts of its 360 students as Mr. Ozyegin's wife, sister and brother-in-law, who oversee the logistics of the building program, stop by for a visit.
 Rarely do the children here attend high school. Many of them speak Kurdish as their first language, and their parents eke out an existence as sheep and cow herders. 
 Clothes are frayed and toes poke through the holes of plastic shoes. But, like the fading evening light on the snowy peak of nearby Mount Ararat, there are glimmers of hope, too.
 Danyan Kuba, a tall, nervous seventh grader dressed in a coat and tie, is asked what he wants to be when he grows up. He shifts awkwardly, looks down at his shoes and back up again. ''I want to be a math teacher,'' he says in a strong, clear voice. 
 For Mr. Ozyegin, becoming one of the richest men in the world has brought its own pressures. He gets many letters each day. Some ask him to erase the debt they have on their Finansbank credit cards.
 Others are more poignant -- recently he received a letter from an admirer in jail asking for a pair of shoes and a suit, a request he plans to honor.
 Like some who have made so much, Mr. Ozyegin likes to keep score.
 Warren E. Buffet may be the richest man in the world, but Mr. Ozyegin says, his wealth has risen faster. ''My compounding is better than Buffet's, but my track record is only one-half as long,'' he said.
 He is also a student of the life of J. P. Morgan: he reels off how much Morgan, who dominated the world of finance at the turn of the 20th century, left to his son, daughter and wife, as well as the salary he awarded the captain of his yacht. But Mr. Ozyegin's lack of renown on the larger global stage nags at him.
 ''I'm giving away 2 percent of my net income every month,'' he said. ''I don't think Bill Gates is doing that.''

HEADLINE: Selig Says Report 'Is a Call to Action' And Vows to Act Swiftly

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
The way an old, reliable relative never misses a family function, Bud Selig has always been there for baseball. As a longtime fan of the game, a team owner and, eventually, as the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Selig has shown his plain, Midwestern face at every notable low and high moment of the game for several decades.
 It has brought him scorn when he was blamed for caustic work stoppages and ridicule when he halted an All-Star Game. And it has brought him satisfaction as he presided over baseball's unforeseen turn-of-the-century renaissance. 
 But there was no moment quite like Thursday, when the 73-year-old Selig stepped to the rostrum at a Manhattan hotel amid one of baseball's most troublesome days. He was there to confront a situation that in every estimation he had set in motion.
 There may be much disagreement over whether Selig and baseball's owners could have done more to prevent the steroids era that was so forcefully depicted in the report released Thursday by George J. Mitchell, the former federal prosecutor and United States senator. But there is no question the report would not have occurred unless Selig had ordered Mitchell to investigate baseball's steroid problem 20 months ago.
 On Thursday, the man who sought that outside investigation against the advice of his confidants appeared saddened, proud and perhaps most strangely, invigorated.
 Although he began speaking in soft, grandfatherly tones as he talked of mistakes made and the game's integrity, Selig quickly went into an almost prosecutorial mode. 
 ''This report is a call to action,'' he said, raising his right index finger. ''And I will act.''
 Selig was widely criticized for doing little to push for mandatory drug testing 10 years ago and was mildly chided for it by Mitchell on Thursday. He not only accepted the findings and recommendations of Mitchell's report, but also said he wanted to go beyond them.
 While Mitchell recommended against punishment for players linked to performance-enhancing drugs, Selig mentioned disciplinary actions and pledged swift action. When it came to Mitchell's proposed changes, Selig announced that he would immediately enact every one that did not require approval from the players' union. For example, Selig said, teams would no longer be given 24 hours' notice of a drug test.
 Selig vowed to fight to find an easier way to detect human growth hormone, calling for a summit of doctors and researchers to discuss the subject.
 ''So long as there might be potential cheaters in the game, we have to constantly update what we do to catch them,'' he said. ''And that's exactly what I intend to do. We will not rest.''
 Selig was, as usual, dressed conservatively, wearing a drab sport coat, white shirt and solid tie, but much of the rest of him seemed refashioned.
 For more than a year, he said he was not worried about what the Mitchell report would reveal. He conceded Thursday that he wished he was not discussing the use of performance-enhancing drugs by dozens of players, although he did not seem overly distressed by it. He was busy looking forward, promising to strengthen baseball's diligence and vigorously calling for the players' union to cooperate with him.
 It was as if the kindly old relative we all knew for decades stood up during Thanksgiving dinner and announced that he never did like turkey and was leading a revolt to cook a ham next year. Selig would not even refer to the day as disappointing.
 ''Do I believe it's a setback?'' he asked. ''No. The sport will be better off.''
 Selig stayed true to form in some ways. He did not fall on his sword, but he did not pick it up and renew the fight. His foremost skill as a baseball administrator has always been a kind of coy, homespun conciliation. Selig did not quarrel when asked if he believed baseball's leaders might have been able to avert the wrongdoing described in Mitchell's report had they been more focused on it, instead of on economic issues, as was alleged by Mitchell.
 ''People have different ideas about what happened a decade or two decades ago,'' he said. ''Hindsight is wonderful. But George Mitchell is right: it's time to move on.''
 And so, one of baseball's most recognizable faces appeared again and survived Day 1 of a new and ugly chapter for the game. Whether Bud Selig has taken the first step toward redrafting his legacy may depend on how the baseball community responds to his bold call to action.
 ''Anybody who knows me well has to know that this is not something I wish had happened, but it has,'' Selig said. ''And I have to do something about it. I cannot say it any more plainly. I have to do something.''

HEADLINE: Economy Holding Up, Reports Find

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Maybe the American economy is not going to keel over just yet, after all.
 Government reports released Thursday showed surprising resilience in the broader economy, even as the financial system and the housing market continue to weaken. Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in November, and even housing-related areas like furniture and building materials were up.
 Wholesale prices surged, indicating strong demand and raising cautionary flags about inflation, and a weekly report found that new unemployment claims fell by 7,000, suggesting a healthy job market. 
 For much of the fall, investors and economists have been waiting for more definitive signs that the economy either is headed for a recession or will surely avoid one. A clear indication one way or the other would make it much easier for the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy by leaning against the prevailing winds.
 But with opposing economic forces appearing to offset each other, the Fed is in a quandary. Home prices are falling, mortgage defaults are rising and lending is slowing down, but a falling dollar is promoting American exports, while increasing jobs and rising wages are allowing many Americans to keep shopping.
 ''We will muddle through,'' predicted James T. Swanson, chief investment strategist for MFS Investment, a mutual fund company based in Boston. ''There is not going to be an 'all clear' or a big collapse.''
 Underscoring that uncertainty, Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, told investors on Wednesday that the odds of a recession were ''getting closer and closer to 50-50.'' On Thursday, CNBC reported that Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, had raised his prediction for a recession to 50 percent, from 30 percent.
 For some economists who have been more upbeat recently, the retail sales data from the Commerce Department was seen as a vindication of their view that economic conditions were not as dire as the skeptics say. Sales were up in most parts of the economy, with the exception of the beleaguered auto sector.
 Part of the increase may be due to an earlier start to the holiday shopping season. Rising energy prices appear to explain about half the increase, but even excluding sales at gasoline stations, spending was still up a respectable 0.6 percent from October and 4.5 percent from the same month last year.
 ''The November retail sales data is welcome relief,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn. ''The best thing about this report is its breadth -- every category was up strongly except autos.''
 Market specialists who expect harder times say the recent data does not yet reflect the full effects of the housing slump and the credit crisis.
 Home prices have fallen about 5 percent from their peak in the summer of 2006, and many economists estimate that prices across the nation will fall, on average, at least an additional 10 percent before they level out. Some foresee prices plunging as much as 30 percent.
 An estimated 2.7 percent of the nation's owner-occupied homes were for sale at the end of September, according to the Census Bureau. That is about one percentage point higher than the vacancy rate during the recession in the early 1990s.
 ''We are not remotely close'' to the bottom of the housing market, said Barry L. Ritholtz, chief executive and director of equity research at Fusion IQ, ''until we get this huge inventory worked out.''
 Mr. Ritholtz, who writes on the popular blog The Big Picture, also noted that during the housing boom, rising real estate wealth helped support a lot of consumer spending. Americans were tapping nearly $250 billion worth of home equity every quarter in the form of second mortgages and refinancings. That represented nearly 10 percent of disposable income.
 For the third quarter of this year, though, equity withdrawals fell to about $170 billion, or 6.6 percent of disposable income, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
 Borrowing costs are also on the rise for businesses and consumers without perfect credit histories. Some are not able to borrow at all. Even home buyers with sterling credit records are being forced to pay higher interest rates for jumbo mortgages that have balances of more than $417,000 -- the limit for loans that can be purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The crosscurrents in the economy have put the Fed in a tough position. It has cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a full percentage point since September to help restore the banking system, but its easing has also helped weaken the dollar and led to concern about inflation. On Wednesday, the Fed and other central banks said they would lend more than $90 billion in an effort to ease the flow of credit. 
 The dollar has fallen 3.3 percent against a basket of six major currencies, and some inflation indicators have ticked up since the Fed started cutting rates. The Labor Department said the producer price index rose 3.2 percent in November, up from 0.1 percent the month before, mostly because of a spike in energy prices. But even excluding energy and food, wholesale prices were up 0.4 percent.
 ''This is a testing time for the Fed, because central banks have to be forward-looking,'' said Paul Sheard, global chief economist at Lehman Brothers, who expects inflation to moderate as the economy slows but does not tip over into a recession. 
 ''We think it is going to take another couple of years for this to play through,'' Mr. Sheard said. ''The housing shock is a slow-moving shock. It's not like a spike in energy prices or a geopolitical shock like 9/11.''

 While your Dec. 7 front-page article about United States foreign assistance and the work of the Millennium Challenge Corporation covered important aspects of the organization's efforts to help the people of the world's poorest countries through economic growth, it didn't mention essential elements of this topic. 
 From the Marshall Plan to the modern-day battle to fight AIDS, America's efforts to help its friends escape poverty and suffering are founded on the principle that economic progress and democratic governments are the bedrock for building long-term stability and prosperity. 
 M.C.C.'s unique approach to poverty reduction builds on this idea, and proclaims that foreign aid is most effective when the recipient countries are held accountable for their actions. This is not too much to ask of countries receiving American tax dollars.
 With more than $5 billion worth of projects ramping up that will bring new roads, irrigation systems and other large-scale infrastructure closer to completion, 2008 will be a pivotal year for M.C.C. These innovative projects have been developed and designed by the host countries from the bottom up, through an unprecedented process of citizen involvement. While M.C.C. is focused on investing this money as expeditiously as possible, it will not allow for reckless assignment of funds. By delivering assistance in tranches based on measurable progress, the M.C.C. process builds capacity within a country and raises the local standard for how a government should manage projects of this kind. 
 As any person with significant overseas experience will agree, doing business on such a scale in the world's poorest countries is not always easy, and should never be hasty. M.C.C.'s work should therefore be measured not only by dollars disbursed, but also by expanding the ability of the recipient country to take ownership of the project, commit to its sustainability, and involve its people in the process.
 This is what sets M.C.C. apart, and why I am proud to see the progress that we've achieved in such a short time. 
 John J. Danilovich Chief Executive Officer, Millennium Challenge Corporation Washington, Dec. 10, 2007

HEADLINE: In Turnabout, Seeking Job Of Comptroller, Not Mayor

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The outlook for New York City's 2009 elections shifted on Thursday when Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president, announced that he would not run for mayor -- as he had long planned -- but for comptroller instead.
 Mr. Carrion's decision came after intense urging from many politicians in the Bronx and the rest of the city. They contended that Mr. Carrion could not prevail in a Democratic primary that also included William C. Thompson Jr., the current comptroller, who is a mayoral candidate. 
 The politicians, mostly black and Hispanic elected officials, told Mr. Carrion that his effort to become New York City's first Puerto Rican mayor would be crippled by dividing the minority vote between him and Mr. Thompson, New York's only black elected official holding a citywide office. And they said that neither Mr. Thompson nor Mr. Carrion would have much of a chance without solid support from black and Hispanic voters.
 The clearest beneficiary of Mr. Carrion's decision is Mr. Thompson. But it leaves a stronger, if narrower, field for the Democratic nomination, including the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens and who ran for mayor in 2005.
 Mr. Carrion, 46, made his announcement at the end of a breakfast speech before the Association for a Better New York at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Manhattan. In his speech, he discussed his vision for New York's economy and education system. At the end, he said, ''I have decided to run for,'' then pausing for dramatic effect, ''for New York City comptroller in 2009.''
 For months, Mr. Carrion maintained that his sights were fixed on running for mayor and that he did not subscribe to the commonly held views regarding ethnic and racial politics. Even on Thursday, he said there were no ethnic considerations involved in his decision.
 ''We're beyond that,'' he told reporters after the speech. ''There was a time when racial and ethnic politics really ruled the day. But, if you look, you can see our city's ability to go beyond that and go beyond party and conventions.'' 
 For the moment, Mr. Carrion said, ''I'm anxious to wrap my arms around that $112 billion investment fund, pension fund, and ensure the efficient operation of our city agencies.''
 Assemblyman Jose Rivera, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman, who attended Thursday's breakfast, said Mr. Carrion's decision was the correct one. He observed that he had been a part of previous efforts to elect a Hispanic mayor, most recently during the two mayoral campaigns of Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president.
 Echoing many black and Hispanic politicians, Mr. Rivera said, ''Billy Thompson is running for mayor, and that's no secret.'' He added: ''Would I want to be part of an effort to possibly create a division, a rift? I don't think so. I think the best thing Adolfo could do is to run for comptroller. It's not a bad position.''
 Mr. Thompson issued a statement on Thursday regarding Mr. Carrion's decision. ''Adolfo Carrion has distinguished himself as a leader and an accomplished public servant,'' the statement said. ''He would be a formidable candidate for any citywide position that he seeks.''
 It was not clear whether Mr. Thompson and Mr. Carrion had had any conversations regarding the politics of 2009 immediately before Thursday's announcement. The men are friends and have said in the past that they never particularly relished the idea of running against each other.
 Mr. Carrion said only that he had had conversations with a number of politicians and with his wife before deciding to run for comptroller.
 Mr. Carrion's decision also changes the outlook for the comptroller's race. Having raised more than $1.3 million toward a 2009 race, Mr. Carrion immediately becomes a major force in the Democratic primary for comptroller.
 Other potential candidates for the Democratic nomination for comptroller are the City Council members David I. Weprin and Melinda R. Katz of Queens, and Simcha Felder and David Yassky of Brooklyn. Also in the race is Assemblyman James F. Brennan, a Democrat from Brooklyn.

TINO SEHGAL
 This Situation
 Marian Goodman
 24 West 57th Street
 Through Jan. 10 
 Space can be enlivened and filled with many things, including talk. For proof, spend a little time in ''This Situation,'' the brilliant, challenging performance piece with which Tino Sehgal is making his New York gallery debut. 
 The work is performed six days a week during gallery hours, by six players whose unscripted discussion is triggered by memorized quotations culled by Mr. Sehgal from three centuries of Western thought. You won't see the same six people every time; they rotate from a group of 30 trained by the artist. 
 A rising star on the international scene, Mr. Sehgal doesn't make objects, send out announcement cards or dispense news releases, nor does he allow his pieces to be photographed. Being there is the only way to experience his careful structures of words, time, human relations and art-world rituals. At the Frieze Art Fair in London in 2005, whenever people stepped into the otherwise empty booth of the Wrong Gallery, a boy and girl, pacing back and forth, would say: ''Hello, welcome to the Wrong Gallery. We are showing 'This Is Right' by Tino Sehgal.'' They would then proceed to enact five earlier performance pieces available for purchase. (Collectors who buy Mr. Sehgal's art are trained to perform them.)
 ''This Situation'' is more complex. Whenever someone steps into the space at Goodman, the six players break off their conversation, inhale deeply and greet the visitor in unison with ''Welcome to 'This Situation.''' Then they walk backward a few steps, one of them tosses out a new quotation, and they're off again.
 A kind of time travel unfolds. Each quotation takes us to a different point in intellectual history: Karl Marx's London, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Paris (or Guy Debord's), the United States just after World War II. The players' slow-motion movements and stagy poses migrate too. They evoke Classical sculptures or modern teenagers, Watteau's pleasure seekers or loitering smokers. Occasionally you'll recognize the chatting, reclining party of three at the center of Manet's ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe.'' Periodically the players also break off and recite, in a round robin, ''Tino Sehgal, 'This Situation,' 2007.''
 The discussion ranges unpredictably across economics, philosophy, social change, child rearing, personal freedom and of course Situationism. Art per se is rarely touched on. There are moments of closure and hopeless disagreement or befuddlement. A visitor may be invited to participate with ''What do you think?'' -- or more pointed comments, if you happen to be taking notes. But even when it resembles an arcane graduate seminar or a cerebral encounter group, ''This Situation'' retains an unexpected urgency.
 Civilized conversation and its requirements of empathy, honesty, clarity and of course listening are among Mr. Sehgal's subjects here, along with the collective nature of knowledge and problem solving. At certain points the room feels filled with nothing so much as a desperate concern for the state of the world. ROBERTA SMITH
 WADE GUYTON
 Friedrich Petzel Gallery
 537 West 22nd Street, Chelsea
 Through Saturday 
 Wade Guyton's show of new paintings looks at first like a garage-band version of Mark Rothko's somber Houston chapel, made even darker by sheets of black-painted plywood covering the gallery floor. As is his custom, Mr. Guyton takes modernism, with its touchy-feely spiritual pretensions, for a hard ride. And as always he goes well beyond a one-line put-down. The art-into-life aesthetic of John Cage and the painting-into-architecture aesthetic of Blinky Palermo would seem to be among his models. 
 All the paintings in the show are large and abstract. Made up of faint patterns of horizontal and vertical lines on a black ground, they suggest early Frank Stella pinstripes in progress, or inked-over Agnes Martins. The medium really is ink, though not applied by hand. Each painting is made up of edge-to-edge black rectangles applied to linen by an Epson inkjet printer. A central vertical line in each work marks where the linen was folded to fit the printer's width. Other lines result from accidents of printing and reprinting the incrementally placed rectangles that make up each piece.
 Accident is Mr. Guyton's modus operandi. He hit on the monochromatic format while making other kinds of paintings, traces of which remain under some of the present works. Yet he never entirely relinquishes control: periodic tugs at the linen during printing affected the patterns and tones.
 The creaky plywood floor he has laid down -- a replica of the one in his studio -- reinforces a sense of impurity and instability, unmodernist if not necessarily antimodernist, like late Ad Reinhardt. It also contributes to making the show, so laconic and adamant, a knockout total experience, one of the memorable gallery sights of the season. HOLLAND COTTER 
 STAGESTRUCK 
 The Magic of Theater Design
 Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation Gallery
 26 Wooster Street, SoHo
 Through Dec. 22
 Some of the most effective examples of installation art are found on theater stages, as this ambitious show of paintings, drawings and three-dimensional models for contemporary sets and costume designs demonstrates. The show -- organized by Peter Harvey, who created the original 1967 scenery for George Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' and by the art and film writer David Noh -- covers a lot of ground, and it is clearly a labor of love. It is also a product of deep knowledge and long professional connections. 
 Opera is generously represented by Robert Indiana's designs for the Santa Fe Opera's 1976 production of the Virgil Thomson-Gertrude Stein collaboration ''The Mother of Us All,'' and by a fantastically detailed David Hockney drawing for the 1975 Glyndebourne Festival Opera production of ''The Rake's Progress,'' for which he created an entrapping world of linear crosshatches and grids.
 There's lots of ballet, including Oliver Smith's 1944 gouache sketch for Jerome Robbins's ''Fancy Free'' and Cecil Beaton's 1952 costume designs for a Frederick Ashton piece. There is a smattering of what might be called avant-garde theater in designs by John Cage and Robert Wilson.
 But Broadway dominates, and the quickest way to grasp the range of talent involved is to consult Mr. Noh's shout-out of names in the gallery's magazine, The Archive. The issue published for the show is a great read, packed with theater lore, from which one learns, for example, that the set for the original 1968 production of ''The Boys in the Band,'' designed by Mr. Harvey, was based on Barbara Walters's Upper East Side living room.
 The living room itself, as it happens, was designed by J. Frederic Lohman, who with his partner, Charles W. Leslie, established the Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation in 1990 after having run a gallery in SoHo for many years. The foundation describes itself as ''an outlet for art that is unambiguously gay and which, often, is denied access to most mainstream venues.'' 
 While I'm not sure the art in ''StageStruck'' is unambiguously anything except wonderful, I'm certain the foundation, with its artists' slide registry and a permanent collection of more than 3,000 works, is a thoroughly nonmainstream pearl beyond price. HOLLAND COTTER
 HEATHER ROWE
 Leslie Hewitt
 D'Amelio Terras
 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea
 Through Dec. 23
 Heather Rowe's solo show is a magnum opus version of the architectural sculpture she has been giving us ina more fragmentary form until now. The basic elements are slender uprights with small shelves and alcoves, and irregularly placed strips of reflective materials. In the past the results have resembled free-standing barriers or openwork screens, dividing the space of the gallery. The single large work in this show, though, is a full walk-in enclosure that narrows to a sharp point. 
 The effect is like an image of a ship or an odd-shaped cage, but even more like a house fitted out with decorative detailing: pieces of cabinetry and ornamental molding, small mirrors and so on. Over the last few years, it seems, we have been watching this young artist slowly, step by step, build a home. Starting with a wall, expanding to a room, it's now an almost-grand enclosure. And the more ambitious it becomes, the more haunted it feels, as if it were also growing a secret history. 
 Half-hidden history is also the basis of Leslie Hewitt's work. Her recent photographs of collages -- made from other photographs, newspaper clippings and handwritten notes -- refer to African-American history from the 1960s onward, without claiming an obvious stake in that history. Her solo show here works in a similarly distanced way, but in the form of a walk-in installation. 
 It has three parts. One is a short, grainy video, vaguely ethnographic looking but actually a performance, of a black woman in an ''exotic'' setting walking with a stack of books on her head. The second is a typed first- person statement by the writer Rose Olu Ronke Ojo in which a woman describes seeing another woman, probably an immigrant to New York City, who reminds her of her own mother. The third is a photographic montage that includes dictionary definitions of words related to consumption.
 The parts don't add up to an easily translatable whole, but pack all kinds of ideas about the not-at-all-hidden burden of neo-colonialism as an old story and a continuing reality.

 JOHN STEPHAN
 Paintings From the 1970s
 Washburn Gallery
 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan
 Through Dec. 21
 Rarely do art and gallery architecture match up as well as they do in this radiant show of John Stephan's paintings from 1970 and 1971. Five canvases, each roughly six feet square, are arrayed around the Washburn Gallery's main exhibition space. Each displays a hard-edged single-color disc, rimmed by thin, multicolored outer rings. 
 The effect, concentrated by the gallery's intimate scale, is vividly optical and uncannily spiritual. The broad, flat discs seem to pulsate. Pushing forward in some cases and receding in others, they exert a subtle bodily force on the viewer, and because of the encircling colored bands they seem to vibrate around the edges. 
 Visually the canvases relate to Color Field painting, but they also intimate a mystical dimension that could be Tantric or Jungian. The images are like cosmic searchlights or dish antennas channeling transcendental energies. Mr. Stephan made disc paintings exclusively for the last 30 years of his career, as though painting were more magical ritual than traditional craft. 
 John Stephan (1906-95) was a landscape painter and a W.P.A. artist in the 1930s. In the '40s he exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, and from 1947 to 1949 he and his wife, Ruth Stephan, published a famous art and literary magazine, The Tiger's Eye. (Washburn's second gallery space has a show of paintings and drawings by Tiger's Eye contributors, including Max Ernst, Arshile Gorky and William Baziotes.)
 Mr. Stephan's last solo exhibition in New York was in 1973, which helps explain how, undeservedly, he can be so poorly remembered today. KEN JOHNSON
 BETH CAMPBELL
 Following Room
 Whitney Museum of American Art
 Through Feb. 24
 Beth Campbell's ''Following Room'' looks at first glance like one of Dan Graham's installations -- if Mr. Graham were partial to Ikea products -- with a plain wood chair, a lamp, a red pillow and a cheap laminated bookshelf stocked with knickknacks reflected in multiple mirrors. On closer inspection, however, one sees that there are no mirrors. (The giveaway: You can see through the installation without encountering your own reflection.) Ms. Campbell has instead created a dozen copies of the same tableau and arranged them to mimic the effects of mirrors reflecting one another.
 Why is it a bit disappointing to discover that Ms. Campbell is more interested in replication than reflection? Perhaps because the work fits so neatly into the current vogue for extreme verisimilitude, as practiced by artists like Gregor Schneider and Ron Mueck. (Ms. Campbell's work also includes the uncanny overtones of Surrealism found in photographs by Jeff Wall and Gregory Crewdson.)
 In previous decades the same installation would have been couched in the language of Baudrillard and the simulacrum, while today the wall text and gallery handout assert its links to biography and subjectivity and ''mimesis as the labyrinth of self-discovery.'' The only real evidence of this is an overturned book in the tableaus titled ''The Other Side of Me.''
 Ms. Campbell's installation ultimately runs into the same problem that haunted Photorealist painters: beyond showcasing a meticulous, mimetic virtuosity, what does it add up to? Her installation might be a meaningful exploration of reproduction in the age of virtuality, but it's hard to shake the feeling that substance here is subordinate to eye- dazzling style.

HEADLINE: Live Rock on a Small Bankroll

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
THE name on the marquee was Air Supply, and the line went halfway down the block. It was Saturday night at the B. B. King Blues Club & Grill on 42nd Street in Manhattan, and I had no ticket. But I walked right in.
 Snob that I am, I was not there for Air Supply. (Although, in truth, ''Lost in Love'' gets heavy play on my iPod.) I was there for the band at Lucille's, a restaurant within B. B. King's that often has notable blues acts and doesn't charge for entry. The attraction this night was neither bluesy nor very notable: a pedestrian local covers group. But as I bobbed my head to Bad Company and Black Crowes songs, I couldn't have been more pleased. I was warm, I was being entertained and I hadn't paid a dime.
 New York is a paradise of live music, but much of it can be discouragingly expensive. Tickets for the major concert halls typically start at $40 or $50 and rocket upward from there. Even in clubs it's not unusual to pay $25 or $30 to see a hot touring band. 
 But in a kind of alternate universe for the modestly compensated (and the merely stingy) the city also has a vast network of bars and restaurants that waive a cover charge. At most you may be asked to buy a drink, but as I found in seven nights of budget-conscious concert hopping, waitresses and tip jars can be avoided, if you can bear the guilt. In 27 sets at 22 rooms, I paid a total of $30 for drinks and donations, and only $18 of that was compulsory -- a few times I was just thirsty.
 If you're lucky, you might even get that drink free. After B. B. King's I went to Hill Country, a barbecue restaurant on West 26th Street where the Doc Marshalls, a first-rate Cajun and country band, were celebrating a new album with three rug-cutting sets. At the end of the first, at 11, two waitresses climbed on the bar and asked for attention. It was easily gotten. For a moment I think every man there thought the same two words: ''Coyote Ugly.'' Instead we were treated to free shots of bourbon, with a request from one of our cowboy-hatted hostesses. 
 ''At the count of three,'' she hollered, ''I want to hear the biggest Texas 'yee-haw' you can muster!''
 No yee-haws or any other hoots or yawps were held back a few nights earlier at a show by the Defibulators at the Rodeo Bar on Third Avenue, which styles itself a honky-tonk oasis in Manhattan, with Lone Star beer, peanuts by the basket and free country and rockabilly every night. The Defibulators, from Brooklyn, are quintessential Rodeo Bar. Like a hoedown band from a Warner Brothers cartoon, they played raucous and slightly surreal ''whackabilly,'' as they describe it, and featured two washboard percussionists, one in crimson long johns, the other in a Viking helmet. 
 When there is no charge, you sometimes get what you pay for. An ''Old Time Jam'' at Freddy's Backroom in Brooklyn was too sparsely attended to live up to the advertised hootenanny. And while I have enjoyed previous editions of Cross Pollination, a series in which two acts perform separately and then collaborate for a third set, an unrehearsed-sounding version of R.E.M.'s ''Fall on Me'' by Bess Rogers and That Fleeting World fell flat.
 But Cross Pollination, Tuesdays at Pianos on the Lower East Side, is an impressive feat of indie gumption. Run by two young musician-promoters, Jay Goettelmann and Wes Verhoeve, it has been going for three and a half years, with some big names passing through -- big for the indie universe anyway -- like Nicole Atkins, Cloud Cult and Jaymay. (I saw installment No. 169.) Its success owes much to the central financial axiom of gratis entertainment: If you don't charge, they will come and might even spend more than they would have otherwise.
 ''It just makes more economic sense,'' said Mr. Goettelmann, a St. Louis transplant. ''It's better for the audience. The artists frequently make more money in the tip jar than they would after the venue has taken a cut, and we've taken a cut. We frequently make more with our percentage off the bar than we would after we take our cut off a ticket. And the bar is making more off the bar.''
 Establishments that don't charge at the door are dotted throughout the city, but the Lower East Side is the capital. Within two blocks of Pianos -- which usually has paid shows in its main space but free events upstairs -- there are 10 or so such bars. Expand the radius a bit and you have dozens of choices. The Living Room is the Bottom Line of this sphere, packing in four or five singer-songwriters a night. With a similar average of sweaty rock bands, Arlene's Grocery is the no-cover CBGB.
 Wandering from gig to gig I was repeatedly reminded of the embarrassment of musical riches in New York available literally for nothing. At the 55 Bar, a Prohibition-era sliver in Greenwich Village, Julie Hardy, a breezy young jazz singer, announced that she had written lyrics to a Wayne Shorter song. Then she added, ''Wayne Shorter approved my lyrics,'' and began ''Song of the Iris.'' 
 One frigid night on Avenue C I was too early for a set by Eli Degibri at the cozy Louis 649, so I ducked into Banjo Jim's across the street. There Terry Waldo, a pianist and historian who studied with Eubie Blake, was presiding over a leisurely ragtime musicale.
 That night my wallet never left my pocket. But it's not always so easy, and no cover doesn't necessarily mean free. Many clubs, like the Living Room and the nearby Rockwood Music Hall, have a one-drink minimum per set, and even at places that never charge a cover, like the Lakeside Lounge on Avenue B, musicians often pass the hat. They all deserve to make a living of course. 
 A few lessons learned: First, the more crowded the club, the easier it is to hide from the wait staff. This was evident at an early set at the Zinc Bar on West Houston Street, where I was the third person present, after the bartender and the performer: no way to avoid buying a drink there. Second, sitting at a table is the international sign of willingness to order. And third, waitresses will not forget if you promise to get something later. 
 For any veteran concertgoer tired of the familiar club circuit, seeking out free shows can be like rediscovering live music in New York. One of the best performances I saw was an appearance at the East Village record store Other Music by Tinariwen, an African guitar band that put the tightly packed crowd into a wonderful state somewhere between trance and dance. (A video of that show will be posted on Dec. 28 on the store's Web site, othermusic.com.) Sound Fix, an indie record store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, also has a live series -- free of course -- in a spacious bar in the back. 
 The strangest location of all, though, I almost missed. I spotted a listing for Joel Frahm, a saxophonist whose records I like but whom I'd never seen, at an unfamiliar place, ''The Salon at Arthur's IP,'' on East 13th Street. Clutching the address, I wandered up and down 13th Street and was about to give up when I noticed a jazz trio playing in the window of Arthur's Invitations and Prints, a stationery shop. 
 Turns out it wasn't Mr. Frahm, who has been playing there once a month for the last year or so but couldn't make it that night. Filling in was John Ellis, another saxophonist, and as I wandered the sales floor, pretending to browse through the Christmas cards and wrapping papers, I enjoyed 20 minutes of surprisingly intimate music.
 Speaking by telephone this week, as he prepared for his regular Tuesday-night show at the Bar Next Door on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village (cover charge: $8), Mr. Frahm -- who has recorded with Brad Mehldau and played at places far more illustrious than Arthur's -- explained the benefits of the engagement. Each musician gets $100; it's a relaxed atmosphere; and it's early enough that he can easily fit in another show the same night, he said.
 ''And if you're a jazz musician in New York City,'' he added, ''a gig's a gig.''
 But for a fan, it's just a little sweeter when it's free.

HEADLINE: Investors Shrug Off Global Cash Injection

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Market euphoria over trans-Atlantic action by central banks to fix the global credit crisis wore off quickly Thursday, with investors saying they expect the injection of cash to do little to solve long-term problems. 
 The rates that banks charge each other to lend money dipped in Europe but remained close to a seven-year high, as financial institutions continued to hoard money to shore up their balance sheets and brace for another market downturn. 
 The action by the central banks on Wednesday might have helped ease some strain on liquidity in the last weeks of the year, but it did little to restore confidence diminished by a global financial crisis and a slowdown in the American economy, some analysts said. 
 ''Central banks can and should keep reducing costs of money and increase availability of it, but there is little reason why the sentiment should change anytime soon,'' said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh. ''That will just come with time.'' 
 The Federal Reserve, which led the coordinated action, will lend $40 billion this month, and the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Canada will offer $50.2 billion this month and next. 
 The Bank of Japan said Thursday that it was also ready to act, and Australia's central bank put its weight behind the coordinated plan. Banks in those countries have so far been largely spared from losses related to the subprime mortgage problems in the United States and Europe. 
 Any cash injection by central banks, even though deemed necessary to avoid defaults of financial institutions, is unlikely to reduce borrowing costs among banks in the long run. 
 ''The liquidity measures are not a silver bullet, given the seriousness of the financial system problems from asset deterioration and lack of trust between banks,'' Mike Gallagher, head of research at IdeaGlobal, wrote in a note. 
 Banks around the world have reported more than $66 billion of losses this year, mainly because of the drop in value of assets linked to mortgages in the United States. 
 Some analysts, including Mr. Milligan, expect central banks to continue to cut interest rates as recent reductions have yet to trickle through to customers with mortgages.

HEADLINE: Arizona Is Split Over Hard Line On Immigrants

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
A new Arizona law against employing illegal immigrants has shaken businesses, scared workers, delighted advocates of stricter immigration controls and added to tensions in a state split over who belongs here and who does not.
 And that is even before the law's scheduled effective date, Jan. 1.
 State officials are seeking to curb illegal immigration by choking the supply of jobs with the law, which threatens to pull the business license of any employer that knowingly hires an illegal immigrant.
 It is an example of the scores of state and municipal laws meant to address illegal immigration on the belief that the federal government has not done enough to thwart it. But the Arizona version is among the toughest and could test states' ability to crack down on the countless businesses that have relied on illegal workers.
 Arizona makes for a striking laboratory. Its estimated population of 500,000 illegal immigrants is among the highest and fastest growing in the country, and illegal workers make up an estimated 9 percent to 12 percent of the work force, mostly in low-skill jobs in the service, construction and landscaping industries, according to research at Arizona State University. 
 Legal challenges to the law, signed in July by Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, were filed by business and immigrant rights groups, asserting that the law would usurp federal authority, lead to ethnic profiling and hinge on sometimes inaccurate government records. A federal judge on Tuesday will consider a temporary restraining order blocking the law from going into effect; the judge rejected another challenge last week.
 Businesses and immigration groups say they have already tallied some of the effects of the law.
 Advocates for immigrants contend that, at a minimum, hundreds of people unauthorized to work have left the state or been fired. Some school districts have at least partly attributed enrollment drops to the law. Though the housing slump and seasonal economic factors make it difficult to pin down how much is attributable to the new law, illegal workers say employers are checking papers and are less inclined to hire them.
 ''They started asking everybody for papers one day, and those like me that didn't have them were fired,'' said Luis Baltazar, a Mexican immigrant who worked for a paving company until a few weeks ago and was soliciting work at a day labor hiring hall here.
 Another immigrant, Jose Segovia, said work had plummeted in the past few weeks, more so than in the four previous Decembers he spent in Phoenix. ''Some of my friends went back to Mexico,'' Mr. Segovia said, ''and I am thinking of going, too, if it doesn't get better here.'' 
 Michael Francis, who grows several crops near here, said that he requested and kept documentation that his 150 employees were eligible to work, but that some had left and he was having difficulty filling the jobs. ''The people from the office buildings in Phoenix are not going to swarm the countryside to clip onions,'' Mr. Francis said. ''There are just not a lot of people knocking on the door to do this kind of work.''
 Groups representing the state's 150,000 licensed businesses say the wording of the law is vague and has led to confusion over whether it applies to all employees or only those hired after Jan. 1. The bill's sponsor, Representative Russell Pearce, Republican of Mesa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the law applied to all employees, not just new hires.
 As a result of the confusion, employers have scrambled to compile and check paperwork, and a cottage industry of law forums and consulting is emerging.
 ''The legal costs of being investigated and prosecuted based on claims with little or no merit could be substantial,'' said Glenn Hamer, the president of the state Chamber of Commerce, one of the groups suing to block the law. ''This could lead to fishing expeditions and will burden county attorneys from other priorities like investigating murder, rape, child molestation.''
 Arizona's law stands out.
 The law calls for suspending a business license for at least 10 days on the first offense and revoking it for a second one, effectively shutting down the business. Several states call for pulling a business license after the federal government has determined that an employer hired illegal workers, but Arizona's law empowers the state to act alone.
 Although it is already a federal offense to hire illegal workers, the law's authors contend that more illegal workers will be found because it requires the state's 15 county attorneys to investigate any complaint they deem not frivolous.
 ''That's the problem,'' said Julie A. Pace, a lawyer representing business and advocate groups opposed to the law. ''This is the federal government's authority, not the state's.''
 But backers of the law say the state's power to grant business licenses includes the authority to set the criteria for them.
 The county attorneys have not taken a position on the law as a group, but they have worked toward developing a uniform process to file and weigh complaints.
 Ms. Napolitano called the law flawed, but signed it anyway, saying it was better than risking a possible ballot measure that could be ''even more draconian'' and difficult to overturn. ''It was left up to Arizona because the federal government has failed to act,'' she said.
 Ms. Napolitano signed the legislation a few days after a Congressional effort to revamp immigration laws failed, with one of its key sponsors, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a presidential candidate, predicting a confusing hodgepodge of state laws. Mr. McCain's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the state law Thursday night.
 Jim Weiers, a Republican and the speaker of the Arizona House, said an ad hoc group was preparing recommendations on what if any changes to make to the law. But Mr. Weiers stood by it, suggesting that if the anecdotal reports of its early impact were true, so much the better.
 ''If all this is happening then the law, before it has taken effect, is working,'' he said. ''The whole idea was to make sure we are not going to be a place people come to illegally to start a better life.''
 Some businesses contend that the difficulties of verifying legal employment have been exaggerated and that the law will eventually improve competition in the marketplace if cheap, foreign labor is cut.
 ''We are out competing against businesses using illegal labor and not registered as contractors,'' said Gary Hudder, an asphalt paving contractor who is president of the Yavapai County Contractors Association in Prescott, which, in contrast to the state contractors association, supports the law. ''This will level the playing field,'' Mr. Hudder said.
 Still, economists say the law could damage the economy.
 ''If you take 12 percent of the work force away, that is going to be a problem,'' said Dawn McLaren, an economist at Arizona State University, adding that people not currently working could never make up the difference. ''The largest group to join the work force was during World War II, and that was a big motivator. I don't think patriotism is going to drive this one.''
 Some business owners said they worried that they would unfairly be singled out by disgruntled employees or people who assume many Spanish-speaking workers are illegal.
 ''We have had U.S. citizens give us false documents because law enforcement was against them for whatever reason,'' said Saul Perez, who manages a construction company here. ''This is not necessarily going to catch as many undocumented workers as people believe.''
 All of the state's businesses will be required to use the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify system, a pilot program that electronically checks Social Security and other records to confirm legal employment status. An outside auditor for the department warned this year that naturalized citizens were more likely to be incorrectly flagged as unauthorized to work than American-born workers, but a department spokeswoman said that the overall error rate was ''extremely low'' and that improvements were continuing.
 Illinois, which had adopted a law barring use of E-Verify over accuracy concerns, agreed Thursday not to enforce it until a lawsuit filed by the Homeland Security Department was resolved. The state said it would consider amending the law to address the federal government's concerns.

HEADLINE: Arguing Against the Death Penalty, in a Gym Near Connecticut's Death Row

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Conn. 

 BODY:
In a ground-floor courtroom here on Thursday morning, a plasma television offered a pixilated glimpse of what appeared to be a school gymnasium set up for a debate team tournament.
 Yet the image of the gym was not from a school, but from the Northern Correctional Institution, a maximum security prison 13 miles away in Somers.
 Judge Stanley T. Fuger Jr. of Superior Court usually presides over his cases in a courthouse. But with seven of the nine residents of Connecticut's death row expected to appear before him -- defending their claims that Connecticut's death penalty discriminates against minorities -- state officials had deemed no courthouse secure enough. 
 So Judge Fuger turned the prison's basketball court into a real court. His bench -- little more than a wooden desk, swivel chair and microphone -- sat on one sideline. At half court, lawyers spoke at a lectern, flanked by plastic folding tables. 
 Behind them and opposite the judge were the five inmates who had chosen to attend the hearing, each shackled at the hands and feet and each in a makeshift cubicle meant to separate them. They were accompanied by their lawyers and correction officers. 
 Beyond the sheer oddity of the proceeding, John Massameno, a senior assistant state's attorney, objected to the case as ''the most egregious abuse of the writ of habeas corpus that we have witnessed and that the courts have accumulated a record of.''
 At the least, it made for one of the most bizarre courtroom scenes in recent memory, and state officials were hard-pressed to say when an actual proceeding, judge and all, had taken place inside a prison.
 ''I can't say it's the first time,'' said Brian Garnett, a spokesman for the Department of Correction, ''but it's highly unusual.''
 It took place on the same day that the New Jersey Assembly approved legislation to abolish its death penalty. The bill is expected to be signed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine, making the state the first in four decades to ban executions. The State Senate approved the bill on Monday.
 New York effectively banned its death penalty in 2004 when the State Supreme Court found flaws in the law, and legislators let the decision stand. 
 Although Connecticut has not executed anyone in decades, the murder of a mother and her two daughters in Cheshire this summer has again forced the issue of capital punishment into the state's collective consciousness.
 In the prison gym on Thursday, the lawyers for the inmates spent the morning arguing against a motion by the state to dismiss their habeas corpus challenge on the grounds that they had taken too long to develop their argument and had abandoned an earlier study, paid for by taxpayers, about whether the death penalty was discriminatory. He suggested that the inmates' lawyers had abandoned it because it did not help their cause.
 ''While the state is certainly not in favor of any rush to judgment,'' Mr. Massameno said, ''we certainly don't think it would be appropriate to countenance the kind of unwarranted delay and obstructionism and misstatements that have occurred in this case.''
 Undaunted, lawyers for the inmates filed into evidence a newly completed 127-page report by John J. Donohue III, a Yale Law School professor and economist, that they said showed that the death penalty in Connecticut was applied in an unfair and almost random fashion.
 David Golub, a lawyer for the inmates, defended the new report and said that the petitioners had followed every scheduling order throughout the case.
 ''The lawyer has the right to bring a case even if the evidence is to be developed while the case is in progress,'' Mr. Golub said.
 The inmates in the gym -- two black, two white and one Hispanic -- had little in common beyond their shared objection to the death penalty. They ranged in age from 28-year-old Eduardo Santiago, convicted of carrying out a murder-for-hire seven years ago in West Hartford, to 61-year-old Robert Breton, convicted of murdering his former wife and teenage son 20 years ago in Waterbury.
 Two other death row members, both black, who are also participating in the habeas corpus petition, chose not to attend the hearing on Thursday. One of them, Russell Peeler Jr., only made his way to death row on Monday after a judge affirmed the death sentence he received for orchestrating the murder of a Bridgeport mother and her son in an effort to keep the boy from testifying against him in another trial. 
 None of the inmates spoke during the three-hour proceeding. On the closed-circuit video transmission, they stood out in their bright yellow jumpsuits, sitting, and occasionally fidgeting, in their individual cubicles. 
 State officials had not wanted them there in the first place. In a letter dated Nov. 21, Theresa C. Lantz, the state correction commissioner, said she wanted the hearing to take place without the inmates because of safety concerns. Short of that, she sought separate hearings to minimize the potential for violence. 
 Her third choice, she wrote, was for the proceeding to take place inside the prison, off-limits to the public. 
 And so it did. There were at least two correction officers for each inmate, and lawyers had to pass background checks, and leave their cellphones and BlackBerrys outside -- along with paper clips. 
 Even with all the security precautions, the hearing began precisely at 10 a.m., allowing Mr. Massameno and Mr. Golub to conclude their arguments before the court system was shut down because of snow at 1 p.m.
 And the gymnasium in Somers returned to being a gymnasium. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 15, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a hearing on a claim by death row inmates in Connecticut that the state's death penalty discriminates against minorities misstated the timing of the last execution in the state. Michael Ross, a serial killer, was executed by lethal injection in May 2005; it has not in fact been ''decades'' since the state executed anyone.

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Trade Talks Conclude With Modest Deals and Mutual Wariness

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: XIANGHE, China 

 BODY:
The United States and China ended three days of intense economic talks Thursday with accords on food safety, energy and environmental cooperation, but with what Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. acknowledged was only modest progress in opening Chinese financial markets.
 Mr. Paulson, who led a team of several cabinet members, proclaimed the talks a success, though there was little sign that China was ready to act more quickly on crucial issues that have stirred anger in Congress. Chief among these is letting the value of its currency rise more rapidly against the dollar, a step that would make Chinese exports more expensive. 
 American officials said they left the talks with lingering concern that China was increasingly using arcane regulations to keep out American products as diverse as cellphones, insurance and motorcycles.
 ''The biggest issue we have with China right now is economic nationalism,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview, adding, ''In China, what you find is that you've got an increasingly powerful domestic industry that is a strong lobby.''
 The biggest disappointment for the American delegation appeared to be the lack of progress on financial services. Though China pledged last spring to expand the scope for joint securities companies in brokerage and asset management, it has made no progress in lifting ceilings on foreign investment in such firms. There has been a deal, however, to let foreign companies issue stocks and bonds denominated in the Chinese currency, the yuan.
 The lack of progress made it likely that China would continue to be a hot topic in American politics. China's trade deficit with the United States is expected to soar to nearly $300 billion this year, representing nearly half the overall American trade deficit.
 The new food safety accord reached Thursday would expand Chinese efforts to ensure the safety of toys, chemicals and other products. In addition, there were agreements to combat counterfeit pharmaceuticals and to better regulate the pharmaceutical ingredients that are often used in making counterfeit drugs.
 There were also agreements to promote Chinese tourism in the United States and to embark on a 10-year effort to cooperate on energy and the environment.
 But continuing American concerns were underscored, when the Chinese, shortly before the talks began, suspended the release of new Hollywood movies -- apparently in retaliation for Washington's move in taking them to the World Trade Organization over the issue of piracy of movies, music and software.
 The mood in Congress was clearly on the minds of both delegations, especially because the head of the Chinese team, Vice Premier Wu Yi, had opened the talks by warning that China might retaliate if Congress passed any of the punitive legislation it was considering.
 On Thursday, apparently mindful of Congressional attitudes and trying to draw a parallel to China's promotion of its own industries, Mr. Paulson said that leaders on both sides ''recognize the need to fight economic nationalism and protectionism in our two countries.''
 ''Nations cannot protect their way to prosperity,'' he declared, in what aides said was an allusion to the bills being pushed by Democrats and many Republicans that would impose penalties on China if it did not change some economic policies.
 The talks were part of a ''strategic economic dialogue'' set up a year ago by Mr. Paulson, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs with many years of experience doing business in China. He has argued that broad exchanges on long-term issues could improve the atmosphere for deals in specific areas.
 But many in Congress are growing impatient over the results of Mr. Paulson's dialogue, and the secretary was emphatic on Thursday in saying that the accord on food safety, reached by several agencies on both sides, was made possible by the mechanism he championed after he took office in 2006.
 ''Rather than recriminations and finger-pointing when this issue arose, both our nations were quick to sit down together and work the substance of the issues,'' Mr. Paulson said, recalling the furor touched off last spring by disclosures of tainted Chinese pet food, processed foods, toothpaste, toys and other products. 
 American delegates also sought to persuade the Chinese that the legal challenges mounted by the Bush administration in the last year were not aggressive acts but a recourse to legitimate grievance procedures.
 Both the commerce secretary, Carlos T. Gutierrez, and Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, sought to assure the Chinese that appealing to the W.T.O. to adjudicate disputes, or imposing duties on Chinese goods deemed to have been dumped on American markets, were not acts of bad faith.
 A senior official in the room said that Ms. Wu, an experienced economic negotiator, understood that the United States was more accustomed to litigating disputes. But Ms. Schwab and Mr. Gutierrez acknowledged they were not sure that they had entirely convinced the Chinese side that legal challenges were not personal insults.

HEADLINE: House Passes Restrictions On Interrogation Methods

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE; David Johnston contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Defying a veto threat from President Bush, the House of Representatives voted Thursday to prohibit waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency against high-level prisoners from Al Qaeda.
 The 222-to-199 vote, largely along party lines, sends the legislation to the Senate, where passage is less certain. The measure, part of the intelligence authorization bill, would restrict all American interrogators to techniques included in the Army Field Manual, which prohibits the use of physical force.
 In a statement this week, the White House said the president would veto the bill, as a ban on harsh interrogations ''would prevent the president from taking the lawful actions necessary to protect Americans from attack in wartime.'' 
 The vote took place as the House Intelligence Committee pressed for more information about videotapes of interrogations of two men suspected of being operatives for Al Qaeda in 2002 and the destruction of the tapes in 2005.
 In a letter to the C.I.A. director, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Silvestre Reyes of Texas, and its top Republican, Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, demanded by Friday all cables, memorandums and e-mail messages relating to the videotapes and the legal advice given to agency officials before the tapes were destroyed.
 The letter also says the panel wants to take testimony on Tuesday from the former chief of the agency's clandestine service, Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., who has been described by intelligence officials as having ordered the destruction of the tapes, and John A. Rizzo, the agency's acting general counsel, who officials have said opposed their destruction.
 In an appearance Wednesday at a closed committee meeting, General Hayden offered to make the material available, the letter said.
 Mr. Rodriguez has hired Robert S. Bennett, a well-known Washington lawyer, to represent him in Congressional and Justice Department inquiries into his handling of the tapes.
 Mr. Bennett has represented a number of high-profile clients -- among them former President Bill Clinton, Caspar W. Weinberger, the former defense secretary, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary and World Bank president.
 ''Mr. Rodriguez has been a loyal public servant for 31 years and has always acted in the best interest of the country,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''He's done nothing wrong.''
 The videotape issue has reignited debate about the proper limits of American interrogation. Since 2005, the military has been restricted to the 19 interrogation techniques listed in the Army Field Manual, which was revised last year. But Congress last year permitted the C.I.A. to use a secret set of alternative interrogation methods, which were approved by President Bush in July.
 Some of the most extreme methods used by the C.I.A. starting in 2002 have been dropped since then, officials say, including the use of prolonged exposure to cold and waterboarding, in which water is poured over a prisoner's mouth and nose to produce a feeling of drowning.
 Intelligence officials say waterboarding was used on three high-level Qaeda prisoners, including Abu Zubaydah, whose interrogations were videotaped. They say it has not been used since 2003.
 But the Justice Department, in still-secret legal opinions, has continued to insist that waterboarding is not torture and is lawful. The bill passed by the House would make it clear that waterboarding or any other use of physical pressure against a prisoner being questioned is illegal.
 ''The House is back in the business of conducting oversight of the intelligence community,'' Mr. Reyes said in a statement after the bill was passed.
 But Mr. Hoekstra charged that the bill contained unnecessary spending resulting from Democratic earmarks, including $23 million from the National Drug Intelligence Center, placed by Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat in whose district the center is located. Mr. Hoekstra also opposed the limits on interrogation, saying it was a mistake to give Al Qaeda the interrogators' ''playbook'' by limiting them to the public Army Field Manual.
 In addition to the restrictions on interrogation methods, the administration opposes several other provisions, including an amendment proposed by Mr. Hoekstra that would require officials to brief the House and Senate intelligence committees on an Israeli airstrike in September against a site in Syria.

HEADLINE: 2 Big Manufacturers Upbeat on Next Year

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Two big manufacturers said Thursday that they expected stronger growth next year despite the slowing economy.
 One of the companies, United Technologies, said it expected 2008 earnings to grow by 10 percent to 14 percent. It saw global growth and reaffirmed its profit forecast for the current year. 
 The other, Honeywell International, forecast profit growth of 16 to 21 percent, broadly above Wall Street estimates, with strength in its aerospace business and continued growth in emerging markets.
 Honeywell, of Morris Township, N.J., said its outlook, which called for stronger growth than some other blue-chip conglomerates have forecast, was achievable even in the face of a slowing economy. 
 The company said it expected 2008 profit of $3.65 to $3.80 a share. That was largely ahead of analysts' forecasts of $3.67, according to Reuters Estimates.
 ''Over all, we're planning for a softening global economy, and we expect some spillover of the weakening in the U.S. residential and credit markets,'' Honeywell's chief financial officer, David J. Anderson, told investors. ''But on the other hand, we expect that to be offset by the relative strength that we're experiencing in emerging regions.''
 The company reiterated its 2007 earnings outlook of $3.14 to $3.16 a share, in line with analysts' estimates of $3.16.
 United Technologies, based in Hartford, is the world's largest maker of elevators and air-conditioners as well as a leading producer of armaments systems. It said it expected a profit of $4.65 to $4.85 a share next year on revenue of $59 billion.
 The projected profit increase matched a forecast the company provided in October, but on Thursday the company offered greater detail.
 Analysts tabulated by Reuters Estimates had looked for $4.85 a share, on sales of $57.7 billion.
 United Technologies also reiterated a full-year estimate for 2007 earnings of $4.22 to $4.25 a share.
 The company said it expected more than 60 percent of its sales to come from outside the United States.
 United Technologies, whose subsidiary companies include Sikorsky helicopters, Pratt & Whitney engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners, said it expected sales from existing businesses to grow in the mid-single digits and predicted higher operating profit in all six business units.
 The company has benefited from global aviation demand and investment in infrastructure projects, particularly in China and India.
 ''It's been a very good aero cycle and we see that continuing,'' the president, Louis R. Chenevert, said. Mr. Chenevert is expected to become chief executive next year, succeeding George David, who has said he will stay on as chairman for two to three years.
 ''Commercial construction looks robust at this time,'' Mr. Chenevert said, adding that the housing market is softer than the company thought a year ago and was likely to experience ''continuing stress.''

HEADLINE: Industry Flexes Muscle, and a Weaker Energy Bill Passes

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Pared-down energy legislation cleared the Senate on Thursday by a wide margin after the oil industry and utilities succeeded in stripping out provisions that would have cost them billions of dollars.
 The legislation still contains a landmark increase in fuel-economy standards for vehicles and a huge boost for alternative fuels. But a $13 billion tax increase on oil companies and a requirement that utilities nationwide produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources were left on the floor to secure Republican votes for the package.
 The tax measure and the renewable electricity mandate were included in an energy bill that easily passed the House last week. But industry lobbyists focused their attention on Republican members of the Senate and on the White House, which repeatedly threatened to veto the bill if the offending sections were not removed. 
 Earlier in the week, Senate leaders agreed to drop the renewable electricity section. And on Thursday, after a failed effort to cut off debate on the bill, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he would reluctantly remove the tax provisions as well, clearing the way for passage in the early evening. 
 The slimmed-down bill passed 86-8.
 The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric utilities, led the opposition to the renewable electricity mandate. Along with its member companies in the Midwest and Southeast, the group carried out an extensive lobbying campaign warning that the bill would cause sharp increases in electric rates.
 The institute was joined by the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce and groups representing the paper, mining, petrochemical and refining industries.
 Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the institute, said that a federal mandate would conflict with mandates for renewable power in place in more than half the states and that this could possibly complicate efforts to pass a nationwide program to combat climate change. 
 ''The federal government jumping in now and second-guessing the states and enacting a fuel mandate in advance of economy-wide greenhouse gas regulation just wasn't going to make it out of Congress,'' Mr. Riedinger said.
 The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted that it would pass overwhelmingly early next week. A White House spokesman said President Bush was pleased that the bill was ''moving in the right direction'' and that he would sign it when it reached his desk.
 The oil industry conducted its own campaign of opposition to the tax provisions, arguing that it would impose burdens on the industry when it needed all the resources it had to find and develop new sources of energy. 
 ''We made sure that everybody knew our point of view -- the White House, the House, the Senate,'' said James Ford, director of government affairs at the American Petroleum Institute. ''We told our story and told it thoroughly.''
 Mr. Ford said that even with the tax provisions removed, the oil industry had concerns about meeting the bill's requirement that 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels be blended into gasoline by 2022. He said the bill was far too specific about how much of certain kinds of fuels must be produced, whether from corn, various other plant fibers or animal fats.
 ''With all these boutique biofuels, we need an ability to adjust the mandate if technological advances aren't made,'' Mr. Ford said.
 Environmental advocates were generally pleased with passage of the new vehicle fuel-economy standards and the biofuel provision. Dan Becker, an environmental consultant who has been working on auto efficiency issues for nearly 20 years, called passage of the bill the biggest environmental victory since enactment of the Clean Air Act of 1990.
 But some environmentalists said they were unhappy that the bill would not provide large incentives for expansion of renewable energy sources like wind, solar and biothermal.
 Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth Action, accused Senate Democrats of ''capitulating'' to Senate Republicans and the White House.
 ''When the Republican leadership and the polluter lobby have blocked important legislation, Senate Democrats have been all too willing to move in their direction,'' Mr. Blackwelder said in a statement. ''The result is that the two most positive provisions of the energy bill -- a clean energy mandate and a tax package reining in handouts for fossil fuels and promoting clean energy -- are being removed, while detrimental provisions, such as a radical five-fold increase in unsustainable biofuel use, remain.''
 Separately, Congress reached a tentative agreement on a major energy package that it plans to enact outside the energy bill, according to a Senate Democratic staff member. The agreement, to be included in a broad government spending bill, would authorize the Energy Department to guarantee loans for various energy projects, making financing far easier. 
 The agreement would guarantee loans of up to $25 billion for new nuclear plants and $2 billion for a uranium enrichment plant, something those industries had been avidly seeking. It would also provide guarantees of up to $10 billion for renewable energy projects, $10 billion for plants to turn coal into liquid vehicle fuel and $2 billion to turn coal into natural gas.

HEADLINE: At Divided Climate Talks, Consensus That U.S. Is at Fault

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Thomas Fuller reported from Nusa Dua, Indonesia, and Elisabeth Rosenthal reported from Rome.

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
Amid growing frustration with the United States over deadlocked negotiations at a United Nations conference on global warming, the European Union threatened Thursday to boycott separate talks proposed by the Bush administration in Hawaii next month.
 Humberto Rosa, the chief delegate from Portugal, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, said the discussions next month would be meaningless if there were no deal at the conference here this week on the resort island of Bali.
 Germany's environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel, told reporters, ''No result in Bali means no Major Economies Meeting.'' He was referring to the formal name of the proposed American-sponsored talks. 
 The goal of the Bali meeting, which is being attended by delegates from 190 countries and which is scheduled to end Friday, is to reach agreement on a plan for a future deal to reduce greenhouse gases.
 The escalating bitterness between the European Union and the United States came as former Vice President Al Gore told delegates in a speech that ''My own country, the United States, is principally responsible for obstructing progress here in Bali.''
 Mr. Gore arrived at the conference from Norway, where he, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, received the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to alert the world to the danger of global warming. He urged delegates to agree to an open-ended deal that could be enhanced after the Bush administration leaves office and the United States policy changes.
 ''Over the next two years the United States is going to be somewhere it is not now,'' Mr. Gore said to loud applause. ''You must anticipate that.''
 There appears to be broad consensus among the delegates that a new agreement on climate change should be ready by 2009, in time to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the current agreement that limits emissions by all wealthy countries except the United States, which signed the Kyoto agreement but has refused to adopt it. Gaping differences remain between countries over how to share the burden of switching from types of energy that contribute to global warming.
 The United States and the European Union remain at odds on many major points, including whether an agreement signed here should include numerical targets, a move that the United States and a few other countries, including Russia, oppose.
 The emerging economic powers, most notably China and India, also refuse to accept limits on their emissions, despite projections that they will soon become the dominant sources of the gases.
 ''I'm very concerned about the pace of things,'' Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is playing host to the meeting, said Thursday.
 The United Nations released fresh data on Thursday confirming what it called the planet's continued and alarming warming.
 The 10 years ending in 2007 were the warmest on record, said Michel Jarraud, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency, citing data taken since the late 1800s from a global network of weather stations, ships and buoys.
 ''It's very likely the warmest period for at least the last 1,000 or 1,300 years,'' he told reporters.
 The data did not surprise scientists -- every recent decade has been warmer than the previous one -- but in releasing the numbers here the agency hoped to spur the 190 deadlocked governments into reaching a deal that would set a deadline for a global climate change agreement.
 Disagreements exist across a wide range of issues and between numerous blocs of countries but the United States has come under especially strong criticism here by countries rich and poor and by its own domestic critics.
 ''The best we hoped for was that the U.S. would not hobble the rest of the world from moving forward,'' said Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit American organization. ''Our delegation here from the States has not been able to meet that low level of expectation.''
 Paula Dobriansky, the head of the American delegation, said Thursday that she was committed to obtaining an ''environmentally effective and economically sustainable'' agreement by 2009.
 ''We are working very hard to achieve consensus,'' she told reporters.
 Delegates here have seen two faces of America: the cautious negotiators, who have sought to water down the more ambitious goals of the European Union; and the more activist voices, from people like Mr. Gore and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who gave a speech on the sidelines of the conference.
 In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg criticized both the Bush administration and Congress for not being aggressive enough in addressing global warming.
 ''There's a belief that the United States should not do anything until all the other governments are willing to go along and do it at the same time,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We should be doing this regardless of whether the world is following or not.''
 The World Meteorological Organization said Thursday that the world's average surface temperature had risen by 0.74 degrees Celsius, or 1.33 degrees Fahrenheit, since the start of the 20th century. To the general public that may seem a modest rise, but scientists consider it alarming in the context of historical shifts in temperature.
 The difference between temperatures today and an ice age is only 5 or 6 degrees Celsius (9 or 10.8 Fahrenheit), according to Mr. Jarraud of the World Meteorological Organization.
 Several weeks ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nation's leading scientific body on the topic, released its gloomy assessment of warming that is being cited by European delegates here as a clarion call. Climate change was ''unequivocal,'' the report concluded.
 ''Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years,'' the report said. Greenhouse gases were very likely the dominant force driving up temperatures now, it said.
 The panel, made up of hundreds of scientists, releases its assessment of the data and science on climate change every five years.

HEADLINE: A Worrisome New Wrinkle In Bailouts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: Norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The financial market crisis of 2007 may be remembered as the beginning of the nationalization of a large part of the financial system. This week, it took a government bailout to shore up UBS. Last month, it was Citigroup that got government aid to help recover from its bad investments.
 You may not have noticed that these were government bailouts. They were government deals, but not the traditional kind. The difference is that the governments putting up the cash were not the ones where the banks were based. Singapore bailed out UBS; Abu Dhabi did the favor for Citi. 
 Neither government took control of the banks in question, but they will no doubt be able to exert substantial influence, particularly if the banks find themselves with a need to raise more capital. 
 Lawrence Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, calls the phenomenon ''cross-border nationalizations.''
 Government cash these days is all the rage on Wall Street, where investment banks long to profit from what they call ''sovereign wealth funds.'' Goldman Sachs estimates that the funds have $2 trillion in assets, much of it waiting to be invested. There are estimates that the figure could top $15 trillion within a decade.
 That kind of money can buy a lot. And the fact that it is controlled by governments, either directly or through state-owned companies, means that the current round of major international investments and takeovers may be significantly different from earlier ones, with more disturbing implications. 
 In the 1980s, when Japanese companies were buying up everything from movie studios to Rockefeller Center, it was easy to dismiss the nationalistic complaints that were heard.
 There were jokes that the heroes of World War II movies would be the pilots who bombed Pearl Harbor. But, of course, the new bosses were just as eager to sell tickets as the old ones had been, and American heroes are still seen on the screen. Nor were Japanese owners of Rockefeller Center likely to refuse to rent office space to American companies. (In the end, it turned out the Japanese had overpaid, and they fled Rockefeller Center with losses.)
 But government investments can be different.
 ''The logic of capitalism depends on shareholders having profit maximization as their primary objective,'' Mr. Summers said in an interview. ''Governments may have many interests.''
 Those interests can include gaining access to technology, helping local suppliers or customers, gaining access to resources, assuring local employment or making all types of political points. Even if a government is interested only in making money through what it hopes will be wise investments -- as seems to be the case in the UBS and Citigroup bailouts -- a successor government may have differing priorities. 
 Worries about the trend have been felt most acutely in Europe, where Gazprom, the Russian energy company, has been seeking to buy companies. There is fear that Gazprom could use control of European gas distribution not to maximize its own profits but to serve Russia's foreign policy interests. In the United States, Citgo, an oil refiner, is controlled by the Venezuelan national oil company and has been used to promote the foreign policy of that nation's government.
 These issues are arising because of the nature of the countries that have been running up huge trade surpluses with the rest of the world -- though primarily with the United States. In many cases, the accumulation of assets reflects the surging price of commodities. That has been true for Middle Eastern countries and for Russia. Other countries, most importantly China, have accumulated large foreign currency reserves as they kept the dollar from rising too much against their currencies.
 In either case, that leaves a lot of wealth in the hands of governments rather than individuals or companies.
 Much of the surge in world growth over the past generation has come from countries moving away from nationalized businesses and selling them through privatization plans that were sometimes inequitable but that did lead to wealth creation. On average, capitalists are better at choosing investments than are government bureaucrats.
 It would be strange if the next generation experiences a reversal of the trend, in which more and more productive assets fall under the control of governments -- and governments that are not especially interested in the welfare of the citizens who live in the countries where the companies have operations.

HEADLINE: Abbas's Premier Tells Israel to Reopen Gaza

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Gaza City.

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank 

 BODY:
The moderate Palestinian Authority government based in the West Bank, in a departure from past policy, on Thursday publicly called on Israel to lift economic restrictions on the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Islamic group Hamas.
 The Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, addressed the issue of Gaza at a news conference where he presented the core elements of his Palestinian Reform and Development Plan before an important meeting of international donor nations, set for Monday in Paris. 
 He emphasized that the plan was ''for Gaza and the West Bank together'' and that the Palestinian Authority considered the Gaza Strip ''an inseparable part'' of the Palestinian homeland. 
 To that effect, a statement from Mr. Fayyad's office distributed at the news conference said that ''the blockade must be lifted,'' and noted that the authority ''has indicated its willingness to manage the crossings in and out of the Gaza Strip if Israel agrees to lift its blockade.'' 
 Hamas seized control of Gaza in June in a brief war, routing the rival Western-backed forces of Fatah. The Palestinian president and Fatah chief, Mahmoud Abbas, set up a caretaker government led by Mr. Fayyad, an independent economist, whose writ is limited to the West Bank.
 After the takeover, Israel sealed its border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that the Fatah forces had fled and were no longer providing security on the other side. Israel, like the United States and the European Union, lists Hamas as a terrorist group and will not deal with it. 
 Israel also decided to press Hamas by admitting to Gaza only the minimum amount of goods required to avert a hunger or health crisis among its 1.5 million people, and prohibiting most exports. Israel contends that its approach is working. 
 ''Hamas's popularity is suffering, because it cannot deliver,'' Mark Regev, a spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said Thursday. A combination of military pressure, diplomatic isolation and economic leverage ''is leading to an erosion of their strength,'' Mr. Regev said. 
 The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, in the West Bank, says the restrictions have led to a collapse of Gaza's private sector, which provides more than half the jobs there. But it had largely maintained a public silence on the closure, and privately had supported it, leading Hamas to accuse it of collusion. 
 A Hamas leader in Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, said this week that, ''People realize now that the Ramallah government is responsible for the suffocation of Gaza.'' 
 The authority's new public stance may be intended in part to deflect internal criticism. But the authority also wants to re-establish a foothold in Gaza, by offering to take over the crossings.
 ''It is our responsibility as the legitimate authority of all the Palestinians,'' said Mr. Fayyad, rejecting any suggestion that such a move would require prior coordination with Hamas. 
 Ala al-Araj, an economic adviser to Ismail Haniya, the Hamas chief in Gaza, said that Hamas had been ''willing since July for the United Nations or a private company to take control of the crossings.'' But ''Israel and the Ramallah government don't accept that,'' he said Thursday.
 He added that Hamas would ''not reject any party that is acceptable to Israel,'' as long as it was ''transparent and credible'' -- a veiled reference to widespread charges of corruption when Fatah was in control. 
 Israel is unlikely to agree to an immediate policy reversal, but Mr. Regev did not rule out change later. ''If a new reality emerged on the other side of the crossings,'' he said, that could lead to a new reality on the Israeli side. 
 Israel has already responded to some of Mr. Fayyad's requests to ease up on the Gaza population. Last week, Palestinian farmers began exporting their strawberry and flower crops via Israel to Europe, after an agreement between the Israeli Agriculture and Defense Ministries and Mr. Fayyad. They were the first exports from Gaza since June. 
 Also, in the past two weeks, Israel has allowed busloads of Palestinians to leave Gaza for Egypt, via Israel. They included students who study abroad and people who need medical treatment, Col. Nir Press, the leader of Israel's Coordination and Liaison Administration at the Gaza crossings, said Monday. Many had been stuck in Gaza since June. 
 The recent escalation in violence continued Thursday. A rocket fired from Gaza hit a house in Sderot, an Israeli border town, wounding a woman inside. Soon after, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, said medical officials there. One was identified as a member of Islamic Jihad. 
 Israeli Army officials said the strike was aimed at a cell that had fired rockets at Israel.

HEADLINE: Dow Chemical Gets Kuwaiti Partner

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 

 BODY:
Dow Chemical plans to sell a 50 percent interest in five of its global businesses to a Kuwaiti company for about $9.5 billion to form a joint petrochemicals venture, the company said Thursday. 
 Dow said the transaction with the Petrochemical Industries Company, a subsidiary of the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, is expected to close in late 2008.
 The joint venture will be based in the United States and employ more than 5,000 people worldwide, mostly current Dow employees, the company said.
 It will make and market polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate plastics, and ethylenamines and ethanolamines. Amines chemical compounds that are used in wood treatment, pharmaceutical processing and coatings.
 The value of Dow's five businesses that will form the venture is about $19 billion, it said.
 ''This joint venture, after it closes, Day 1 and beyond, will be the player in the petrochemical field,'' said Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's chief executive. 
 The deal will help maximize the value of Kuwait Petroleum's resources while helping to diversify Kuwait's economy, the chief executive, Saad al-Shuwaib, said.
 Mr. Shuwaib said. The joint venture would ''enable P.I.C. to expand and diversify its international petrochemicals presence, while building on our longstanding relationship with Dow.''
 Following a series of agreements between Western and Middle Eastern ventures, the deal did not surprise analysts.
 ''We expect a positive stock response but likely muted given a deal of roughly this nature has been anticipated for some time,'' John Roberts, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group, wrote in a note to investors.

HEADLINE: Democrats Soften Tone For Final Debate in Iowa

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
In the final Democratic presidential debate of the year Thursday, both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama were put on the spot about leadership: whether she tended to be too secretive and insular, and whether he could mold a new foreign policy when many of his advisers had worked in Bill Clinton's White House.
 Mrs. Clinton, confronted at the debate in Johnston, Iowa, specifically about her closed-door health care task force in 1993-94, said she had ''learned a lot from that experience,'' but did not blame herself for being secretive. 
 ''Clearly one of the principal lessons is that you have to have a very strong communication strategy, and we didn't do that,'' she said, before promising to have an ''open and transparent government'' if elected president.
 Mr. Obama, meanwhile, traded humorous jabs with Mrs. Clinton over his use of her husband's advisers. Before Mr. Obama could answer how he would differ from the Clinton era when the advisers were the same, Mrs. Clinton piped up, ''I want to hear that!'' As the audience broke into laughter, Mr. Obama said, ''Well, Hillary, I'm looking forward to you advising me, as well.'' 
 Mr. Obama went on to say that veteran advisers were not an obstacle to fresh thinking. ''I think that there are a lot of good people -- in the Clinton years, the Carter years, George Bush I -- who understand that our military power is just one component of our power,'' he said.
 Those two moments were brought on by questions from the moderator of the debate, which was sponsored by The Des Moines Register. They were among the few ripples in an otherwise placid 90-minute forum, where, in a sharp departure from past debates, not one of the six Democratic candidates attacked another by name.
 Instead, with three weeks to go until the first-in-the-nation caucuses there, the candidates took the opportunity to make friendly pitches to Iowa voters. Strategists fear that voters could be turned off by an increasingly negative tone in the campaign.
 Indeed, one of the most striking displays of camaraderie of the campaign season came when Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was asked whether he was uncomfortable talking about race, given some of his past statements that he had later apologized for, including calling Mr. Obama, who is the only black Democratic candidate, ''clean'' and ''articulate.''
 Mr. Biden, a six-term senator, looked ashen and downcast as he recalled that the civil rights movement was the spark for his political career, and said that no one who knows him ''has ever wondered about my commitment to civil rights and civil liberties.''
 Several other candidates then applauded him, and Mrs. Clinton and Senator Christopher J. Dodd added ''Hear! Hear!'' Then Mr. Obama asked for a moment.
 ''I have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that he has made with respect to racial equality in this country,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So I will provide some testimony, as they say in church, that Joe is on the right side of the issues and is fighting every day for a better America.''
 For the most part, though, the candidates sought to underscore the closing arguments they intend to make in the final days of Iowa, where three candidates appear locked in a dead heat: Senator Clinton of New York, Senator Obama of Illinois, and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.
 Tapping Democratic anger at President Bush, they mentioned the word ''change'' or some variant more than three dozen times. Mr. Edwards hewed especially close to his campaign themes, returning over and over to pledges to restore trust, honesty and character to government.
 ''We're having trouble growing and strengthening the middle class because corporate power and greed have literally taken over the government,'' he said, in another frequent refrain. ''And we need a president who's willing to take these powers on.''
 Mr. Obama, meanwhile, vowed to ''level with the American people about how we're going to solve our problems.'' Mr. Dodd of Connecticut championed human rights and an energy independence plan in a couple of his answers, and emphasized his support for a tax on carbon-based fuels that he said were ''killing this planet.''
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico pledged to support universal preschool and full-day kindergarten. In one of the few mentions of foreign policy, he expressed concern that politicians and the news media were paying less attention to the Iraq war.
 ''Somehow, we're losing sight that that's the most important fundamental issue affecting our country,'' Mr. Richardson said.
 Rather than point up contrasts, the candidates fell mostly into agreement when the debate moderator, The Register's editor, Carolyn Washburn, asked how they would strive to bring fiscal discipline to Washington, negotiate fair trade agreements and improve the economic condition for struggling Americans.
 Mrs. Clinton said at one point that she favored ''raising taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals,'' while keeping middle-class tax cuts, and said that, as president, she would want Congress ''to send me everything that Bush vetoed, like stem cell research and the Children's Health Insurance Program.''
 In a more subtle way, though, the Democratic contenders sought to draw distinctions as they head into the last three weeks of the Iowa campaign. The Republican candidates had a similar opportunity in their final debate of the year on Wednesday.
 ''Everybody on this stage has an idea about how to get change,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Some believe you get change by demanding it. Some believe you get it by hoping for it. I believe you get it by working hard for change.''
 Mrs. Clinton's advisers said after the debate that this remark referred, respectively, to Mr. Edwards (for his aggressive style on the stump), Mr. Obama (for his call for a politics of hope), and Mrs. Clinton (who has sought to cast herself as a workhorse). 
 The Clinton campaign, which has seen its momentum ebb as Mr. Obama's has grown in recent weeks, has decided to challenge him directly for the mantle of change agent, a phrase that Mrs. Clinton, her husband and aides are now using repeatedly.

HEADLINE: So Many Presidential Debates, So Little Concern Shown for the Cities

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In mid-October, I noted that the Democrats and Republicans had held 17 or so presidential debates (the number can vary, depending on who's counting), but that with all the gabbing they managed not to focus on America's cities.
Well, two months have passed, and that observation is no longer valid. 
 The candidates have now held 25 or so debates without talking about urban issues.
 Someone ought to alert the Guinness people. For sidestepping matters of direct concern to more than 80 percent of the population -- people living in urban and suburban areas -- this has to be some kind of record.
 The grievance is hardly new. But it is glaring this time around because of the large number of candidates who you'd think would have cities and their suburbs high in their minds. Look at them: former mayors of New York City and Cleveland, a senator from New York, a former community organizer out of Chicago.
 Sure, they have discussed terrorism, health care, the economy, immigration and other matters that affect cities as much as the rest of the country. But what about basic urban and suburban concerns like housing, transportation, crime, education, Medicaid costs, homelessness, crumbling infrastructure?
 There has been barely a word, though blame no doubt lies not only with the candidates but also with debate M.C.'s who ignore these topics.
 The silence has not gone unnoticed by the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy, a nonpartisan, though decidedly liberal, New York think tank. (Its name, in case you wondered, is rooted in a sermon by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who said two months before his assassination in 1968 that he wanted to be remembered as ''a drum major for justice.'')
 Over the last few weeks, together with The Nation magazine, the institute asked mayors from Miami to Boston, from Baltimore to Los Angeles, for the issues they thought should be on the candidates' plates.
 Ten mayors were interviewed -- Atlanta, Buffalo, Denver, Minneapolis, Rochester and Salt Lake City round out the list -- and the number may grow. Their comments were videotaped and excerpts posted on a Web site, www.mayortv.com, which the institute hopes to have up and running on Friday.
 ''Instead of writing a report or issuing a critique or counting the number of times that the presidential candidates have talked about cities, we decided that the voices that really need to be heard are the mayors' themselves,'' said Andrea Batista Schlesinger, Drum Major's executive director.
 All 10 mayors are Democrats or independents, reflecting political realities in many cities. Republican mayors were approached, too, and some expressed interest, Ms. Schlesinger said, but the timing didn't work out. Maybe later.
 One obvious choice would have been Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a man for all parties (Democrat, born-again Republican, reborn-again independent). ''But alas,'' Ms. Schlesinger said, his possible involvement ''fell through some kind of scheduling black hole.''
 Not surprisingly, the mayors' issues are essentially those mentioned above: housing, infrastructure, economic development, public safety and so on. Loud and clear is their frustration with what they perceive as Washington's lack of interest in their troubles.
 Ms. Schlesinger said the mayors were not asked for their views of the Bush administration. They volunteered their opinions, she said: ''There was a lot of hunger to talk about it.''
 The result was a tattoo of unflattering references to ''these disastrous Bush years,'' as Mayor Rocky Anderson of Salt Lake City put it.
 As for the candidates, Mayor Byron W. Brown of Buffalo complained that they treat cities like A.T.M.'s, going to them to raise campaign cash but then turning their attention to more rural places like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, ''where the majority of our citizenry does not live.''
 The war in Iraq was mentioned. ''You know,'' Mayor Sheila Dixon of Baltimore said, ''we have wars here in our cities. Drugs -- it's a huge war. It hasn't gone away.''
 Mayor Manny Diaz of Miami cited social issues, like gay rights and abortion, that have loomed large in some debates. But ''for those of us in the trenches,'' he said, education and safe neighborhoods ''are the kinds of things that people are looking at.''
 For Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis, ''an urban agenda'' is desirable. ''But what I'd rather have,'' he said, ''is for every presidential candidate to have an urban sensibility.''
 ''Urban America, to me, is really the future of America,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Cabby Takes Plastic, or at Least Is Supposed To

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ; Reporting was contributed by John Eligon, Kate Hammer, C.J. Hughes and Jennifer Mascia.

 BODY:
More than half the city's yellow cabs are now fitted with devices to accept credit cards for payment. Drivers fought the credit card plan with an unexpected fury -- and it was at least partly responsible for their decision to go on strike twice.
 But just because taxis have the devices, it doesn't necessarily mean riders can use them -- they may have to resort to some gentle and not-so-gentle arm-twisting to be allowed the privilege.
 Many cabbies, it seems, will use the card swipers only sullenly, and only after a resistance that can be as ingenious as it is misleading. Excuses range from, ''There is a minimum cab fare for credit card use'' to ''The device doesn't have to be activated until the new year'' to ''It's too short a ride.'' (Not true, not true, and not true, say city officials.)
 The Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates yellow cabs, has received hundreds of complaints in recent weeks about cabbies refusing credit cards. 
 Matthew W. Daus, the taxi commissioner, said on Tuesday that cabbies had twice refused to take his credit card.
 ''At this point, there is no excuse; whether drivers feel that it's wrong, it's done,'' Mr. Daus said Friday. ''The law is the law.'' He added that after his Tuesday remarks were publicly reported, credit card volume jumped by 15 percent.
 In an informal survey this week, a team of five from The New York Times, with each member attempting about 20 trips, fanned out into Manhattan, boarded cabs and tried to use credit or debit cards (the transactions are the same) to pay the fare.
 Of the 92 tries (winter weather cut some attempts short), 47 trips, or about half, were successfully paid for with plastic.
 Some transactions were far from cheerful. When a reporter pulled out a credit card to pay a $3.70 fare for a ride of a few blocks to 81st Street and Columbus Avenue, Honore Didia, 48, frowned.
 The machine does not work, he exclaimed. Really? Looks fine, the reporter said. Well, Mr. Didia averred, go ahead.
 ''There are areas,'' Mr. Didia said, almost hopefully, ''where the thing doesn't work.''
 As the reporter waited for the receipt to be printed out, Mr. Didia muttered, ''If you don't have cash, you shouldn't take a taxi.''
 Thirty-five of the cabs that were approached, or nearly 40 percent, didn't have the high-tech devices installed yet and couldn't take cards if their drivers wanted to.
 Henry Esaie, 41, from Queens Village, doesn't want to. He does not have a credit card reader on purpose and has hired a lawyer to fight the city-ordered installation.
 But Mr. Esaie is not optimistic. ''I'm just buying time,'' he said. By Jan. 31, the city hopes to have the devices in most, if not all, of New York's 13,100 yellow cabs.
 Nine drivers whose cabs were equipped with the new devices could not or would not complete the transaction, no matter what. And a 10th, after completing the transaction by credit card, said there was a 35-cent transaction fee for credit cards, which is not true.
 Some of the 10 drivers' excuses seemed genuine. Enrique Rodriguez-Torres, 72, looked baffled when the touch-screen for credit card payment did not appear. After several swipes, a bill printed from the meter but the device did not accept the credit card.
 So Mr. Rodriguez-Torres had to ask for cash. ''I hate this computer,'' he said.
 What is at issue is a bit tangled. In 2004, the taxi commission negotiated an agreement with the medallion owners, the ones who have city licenses to operate cabs.
 In exchange for higher fares, the operators agreed to the installation of ''technology enhancements.'' In the back seat of every cab would be a television screen the size of a dictionary that provides video entertainment for passengers.
 Linked to global positioning satellites in space, the screen would also provide an electronic map of the cab's approximate location in the city and record the beginning and end of each trip. It eliminates the need for the cabby to do so with paper and clipboard.
 But mostly city officials wanted a cashless option for paying the fare. More than half of all consumer payments in the nation are paid with credit or debit cards, officials said.
 Moreover, passenger tips may increase, as they do in restaurants, if consumers don't handle cash, the officials argued.
 When the cabby starts the credit card process, the backseat television turns into a touch-screen display, like a bank A.T.M. The passenger looks at the fare, taps O.K., enters a tip if so inclined, and swipes a credit or debit card through a card reader, which is also in the back of the cab. The cabbie has nothing to do except hand over the receipt.
 Many of the drivers were furious. The electronic devices would break down, they said. The 5 percent processing fee that goes to the credit card company and others would bleed them dry. Passenger tips, already scant, would wither in the anonymity of the touch-screen displays.
 The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, the drivers' group that called the strikes in September and October, plans to release a report next week detailing problems with the credit card machines, including blind spots in the city where the devices can't link to satellites.
 Bhairavi Desai, the alliance's executive director, said the installation cost of $3,000 or more for the machines is passed along to the driver through higher lease payments for the cab.
 ''The whole technology is economically disastrous for the drivers,'' she said.
 Cesar Soto, 49, agreed. Unmarried, diabetic, and a cabdriver for 25 years, he lives with his mother, Gladys, in Washington Heights. He has a figure of a praying mantis, a symbol of hope in his native Dominican Republic, taped to his meter. ''It's the color of money,'' he said.
 In the 1990s, Mr. Soto said, he could take home $700 or more a week. But with the slowing city economy after Sept. 11, 2001, then higher cab fares in 2004 that drove many riders to buses and subways, he is lucky these days to take home $400 a week.
 The 5 percent credit card fee -- 50 cents subtracted directly from every $10 paid to the driver -- was the last straw, he said.
 He went out on strike twice and would do so again, Mr. Soto said. When a reporter and photographer entered his cab earlier this week, he immediately tried to discourage the use of a credit card.
 Armed with newspaper articles and statistics, he said most riders were sympathetic. ''They usually pay cash when I explain,'' Mr. Soto said. He allowed the credit card payment, but his machine ran out of paper, sending him sputtering.

HEADLINE: Ethiopians Said to Be Forcing Civilians to Fight in Rebel War

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
 -- The Ethiopian government, one of America's top allies in Africa, is forcing untrained civilians -- including doctors, teachers, office clerks and employees of development programs financed by the World Bank and United Nations -- to fight rebels in the desolate Ogaden region, according to Western officials, refugees and Ethiopian administrators who recently defected to avoid being conscripted.
 Ethiopia has been struggling with the rebels for years. But with tens of thousands of its troops now enmeshed in a bloody insurgency in Somalia and many thousands more massing on the border for a possible war with Eritrea, the government seems to be relying on civilians to do more of its fighting in the Ogaden, a bone-dry chunk of territory where Ethiopian troops have been accused by human rights groups of widespread abuses.
 In a recent report, government officials in the region called upon elders, traders, women and civil servants to form local ''security committees'' and mobilize their clans to destroy the rebels and their bases of support. The government says that the rebels are terrorists who have carried out assassinations and bombings, and that civilians have volunteered to fight them. 
 But by many accounts, the militias are hardly voluntary. One Western aid official said soldiers had barged into hospitals to draft recruits and threatened to jail health workers if they did not comply. In other cases, lists of names were posted on public bulletin boards, ordering government employees to report for duty, according to a member of the regional Parliament and two Ethiopian administrators who have fled the country. Many of those who refused were fired, jailed and in some cases tortured, the administrators and the Parliament member said.
 The civilians are serving as guides, porters, translators and foot soldiers, and they are sent into the bush with little or no training to confront hardened guerrilla fighters. In the ensuing battles, many civil servants have recently been killed, according to accounts corroborated by Western officials and aid workers.
 ''Anybody who works for the government -- teachers, doctors, clerks, administrators -- has to join a militia,'' said Hassan Abdi Hees, who worked as the head accountant in a government office in the Ogaden and is now seeking asylum in Kenya. ''I left because I didn't want to die.''
 Several Western officials say they are alarmed about this new strategy, especially when the first signs may be emerging of a humanitarian crisis that aid officials predicted over the summer. 
 Earlier this year, the Ethiopian military sealed off large swaths of the Ogaden to choke off support for the rebels, preventing much of the commercial traffic and emergency food aid from entering. Western aid officials warned this could cause a famine. 
 The military has since relaxed some restrictions, but a survey by the aid group Save the Children U.K. found that child malnutrition rates in some areas have soared past emergency thresholds and are now higher than in Darfur or Somalia, widely considered the two most pressing crises in Africa.
 In late November, John Holmes, the most senior humanitarian official at the United Nations, came to the Ogaden to assess the situation. While there, he said, he heard reports of civilian militias being formed, and observed that it was increasingly difficult to find health workers, livestock workers and trained professionals to distribute much-needed aid in the region, which now faces a drought.
 ''There is not a catastrophe there, for the moment,'' he said. ''But there is a lot of concern the Ogaden could become a serious humanitarian crisis.''
 Ethiopian officials deny this.
 ''Many media and international organizations have been exaggerating the problems,'' said Nur Abdi Mohammed, a government spokesman. ''There is no food aid problem. There is no malnutrition problem.''
 As for militias, Mr. Mohammed said, ''What is happening is that the local tribes are forming to fight against the O.N.L.F.,'' the Ogaden National Liberation Front, the main rebel group in the area. 
 ''The people want to protect their livelihood,'' Mr. Mohammed added.
 According to the recent government report, which was published by regional authorities, rank-and-file civil servants are not the only ones called upon to fight the rebels. It also lists several employees who work for programs financed by international donors. 
 They included a pastoralist development project that receives millions of dollars from the World Bank and the Ethiopian government's AIDS prevention office, which is supported, in part, by the United Nations and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A second government document ordering civil servants to report for duty lists 10 employees from an AIDS office. 
 One government official said that his entire department, including white-collar professionals, clerks, watchmen and drivers, had been forced to go on reconnaissance patrols to hunt down the rebels. The official, who feared government reprisals if he were identified, said the militia duty interrupted humanitarian programs supported by the United Nations, and that several colleagues were killed while on patrol.
 ''We don't know how to operate guns, but the government sent us to the front lines,'' the official said.
 Other civilians who served in the militias said they were not given camouflage, and even had to buy their own rifles.
 ''It's terrifying,'' said Ali Mahamoud, a Koranic teacher who said he was yanked out of Arabic class a few months ago and was assigned to a militia. ''You can't see the rebels when they're shooting at you. And the Ethiopians will kill you if you try to run.''
 The rebels said the civilians were easy targets.
 ''They don't know the bush,'' said Daous, a commander for the Ogaden National Liberation Front.
 Some of the region's best-trained professionals have chosen to flee, including Sadik Mohammed Hajinur, a Sudanese-trained doctor who used to work at a rural hospital. He said that Ethiopian soldiers had demanded that he recruit militia members from his clan and that when he refused, they beat him with rifle butts. 
 ''I faced so many problems from the army,'' said Dr. Sadik, who is now seeking asylum in Sweden.
 Dr. Sadik and other refugees described the militia program as another example of the lengths to which the Ethiopian government will go to control the Ogaden region, which lies on the border of Somalia and is home to mostly ethnic Somalis, who speak a different language and have a different culture from the highland Ethiopians who rule the country. 
 Several United Nations officials and Western diplomats said they were discussing the militia program in private meetings, but said they could not comment publicly for fear of provoking the ire of the Ethiopian government, resulting in a possible suspension of humanitarian efforts in the region. 
 ''We are walking a very thin line, and we need to concentrate on saving lives right now,'' a United Nations official said.
 Ethiopian authorities have already expelled the Red Cross from the Ogaden, accusing aid workers of being spies.
 The Bush administration considers Ethiopia its No. 1 ally in combating terrorism in the Horn of Africa, and the American government provides it with roughly $500 million in annual aid. Last winter, American commanders gave Ethiopia crucial intelligence to oust an Islamist movement that had controlled much of Somalia.
 But Human Rights Watch says it has documented dozens of cases of severe abuse by Ethiopian troops in the Ogaden, including gang rapes, burned villages and what it calls ''demonstration killings,'' like hangings and beheadings, meant to terrorize the population.
 ''This is a mini-Darfur,'' said Steve Crawshaw, the United Nations advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. 
 The Ethiopian government's response to such criticism is often one word: Eritrea. Ethiopian leaders have accused their tiny neighbor of arming insurgents in Somalia and the Ogaden. Eritrea denies this, but a United Nations report concluded that the country had indeed shipped planeloads of weapons into Somalia. 
 Ethiopia also blames Eritrea for failing to compromise on the border issue, which has led to a major military buildup on both sides.
 As for human rights, Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, said at a recent news conference that ''there have been no widespread human rights violations in the Ogaden, not only because we believe in the respect for human rights, but because we know how to fight the insurgency.''
 But several soldiers who have recently defected said they had participated in brutal killings. Ahmed Mohammed, 24, said he was born in the Ogaden and had served two years in the national army. In August, he said, his platoon was blockading a road and caught a truck trying to sneak through. The soldiers dragged the driver out and Mr. Ahmed said he watched his commander saw off the driver's head with a 10-inch hunting knife.
 ''We left the body by the road,'' said Mr. Ahmed, who is now a refugee in Kenya. His account could not be independently verified, but was consistent with those of other soldiers who had defected.
 Mr. Mohammed, the government spokesman, dismissed the story, saying: ''There is not a single soldier who is abusing human rights. The Ethiopian military is very disciplined and would not abuse its own people.''
 Recent refugees said the military had been trying to starve them out and the blockade was like a noose on some parts of the region, cutting off food supplies. 
 In October, Save the Children U.K. surveyed more than 600 Ogadeni children and found that 21 percent were acutely malnourished, compared with United Nations surveys that found malnutrition rates of 19 percent in an area of Somalia and 13 percent in Darfur, Sudan. The United Nations considers 15 percent the emergency threshold. 
 ''We've crossed the line into a humanitarian crisis,'' said one Western diplomat who asked not to be identified because he was afraid of reprisals from the government. 
 Western officials said the Ethiopian government had begun to respond by loosening the restrictions on commercial traffic and food and allowing the United Nations to open field offices in the Ogaden. ''There have been positive developments in the last three weeks,'' said Marc Rubin, emergency director for Unicef in Ethiopia.
 But there is a lot of catching up to do. The amount of emergency food that the United Nations World Food Program has dispatched to the Ogaden this year is a fraction of what it was last year, 19,475 tons compared with 155,249 tons.
 Several refugees said they had been reduced to eating grass.
 Habsa Ghaffir, who arrived at a camp in Kenya four weeks ago, said that after Ethiopian troops burned her fields and shot her husband, her 4-year-old son starved to death.
 ''I remember him saying to me, 'Mom, bring me food, Mom, bring me tea, Mom bring me water,''' Ms. Habsa said.
 But she had none.
 ''It is like they are trying to wipe us out,'' she said, nervously snapping twigs between her fingers as she spoke outside her hut. ''Even here, we're not safe.''
 United Nations officials said Ethiopian intelligence agents had infiltrated Kenya, and on Nov. 2, there was a mysterious attack that only added to these fears.
 According to the Kenyan police, masked men burst into an apartment building in a Nairobi slum and shot five Ethiopian refugees. Two died, along with a guard outside who was shot in the head.
 Nothing was taken. Witnesses said the killers went straight to the Ethiopians' room. The victims had been student leaders in Ethiopia, and the Kenyan police said some of them had previously asked for protection.
 The Kenyan police commander, Joseph Maina Migwi, said he could not say whether Ethiopian security agents had been involved.
 ''But whoever did it,'' he said, ''were definitely paid professionals.''

HEADLINE: In Export-Import Data, More Signs of a Slowdown

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: Norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AMERICAN consumers may finally be showing some restraint. At least that is the indication from the trade figures released this week, which provide another indication of a slowing economy.
 The rate of increase in imports has begun to decline, and is now at its lowest level since 2002, when the economy was only slowly emerging from a recession. At the same time, export growth has remained strong, thanks to a buoyant world economy and a weaker dollar that has made American goods seem cheaper to overseas buyers. 
 From August through October, the most recently reported three months, the quantity of American imports, adjusted for inflation, was up just 1.1 percent from the same period of 2006. Over the same period, the volume of exports was up by 9.6 percent.
 As can be seen from the accompanying chart, the last time import volumes declined was in 2001 and 2002, which was also the most recent recession. The time before that, in 1990 and 1991, was another recession. In each of those cases, the figures fell into negative territory only after the recessions began.
 After the 2001 recession ended, imports rose even faster than exports, leading to a rapid rise in the American trade deficit. But import growth peaked in August 2004 and has come down significantly since then.
 Whether by coincidence or not, that was one month after the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index peaked. Americans who used their homes as piggy banks to finance consumption were less able to do so once home prices began to slip.
 Inflation-adjusted prices do not completely describe trade reality, of course, since it is nominal dollars that are spent. But the rate of growth in actual spending on imports was up just 5.1 percent from a year before. Reflecting soaring oil prices, that gain was well above the rates of gain earlier this year, but still far below the double-digit gains in most of 2005 and 2006.
 A major reason for the improved trade position -- and for the economic woes in Detroit -- is the weak car market. The trade deficit in motor vehicles, including parts, was lower over the last 12 months than at any time in the last four years. Exports of American cars and parts actually rose 12 percent in the 12 months through October, compared with the 12 months before that, while imports fell by 1.5 percent. Imports declined from every major auto-exporting country, except Mexico, where they rose 4 percent.
 Will Americans step up their purchases of imports once the economy improves and home prices start to recover? They certainly did after every previous slowdown.

HEADLINE: Paid in Dollars, Some Americans Are Struggling in Europe

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Erica Nevins's faith in the dollar was shaken the moment she pressed a crumpled $1 bill into the hand of a little girl begging for money on the streets of Marrakesh, Morocco.
 ''I don't want this. This is nothing,'' Ms. Nevins recalled the scornful reaction of the child, who demanded more.
 Since then Ms. Nevins, an American fashion executive, has replayed that moment over and over in her head as she confronts the harsh reality of living on a dollar income in Paris and then moving to costly London. ''The absurdity of this is that it's so true,'' she said. ''A dollar really means nothing. It's scary.'' 
 With plunging exchange rates, American expatriates whose pensions or incomes are paid in dollars are scrimping. No more dinners out when a bottle of Perrier for 3.50 euros translates to $5 and no more holiday shopping binges when a shiny iPod for 159 euros is equal to $230. Ultimately, some are moving to greener pastures that match the color of their money.
 ''Those that can hold out are holding their breath and we're hoping for a return of the dollar, but those that can't are going,'' said Susie Bondi, an American who has lived in Paris for 12 years, but is moving to Vienna in January with her husband, Fred, to stretch their pension dollars in a city with a lower cost of living.
 The last six months have been anxious for expatriates, with the dollar sinking against the euro, the pound and currencies like the Czech koruna and the Costa Rican colon. The declines are accelerating the flight of expatriates in Europe, according to tax lawyers who listen to the problems of clients who are giving up because they see no relief in sight.
 Even United States government employees are feeling the pinch in countries with strong currencies like the Czech Republic, where the koruna has gained 17 percent this year against the dollar.
 Radio Free Europe, the United States-backed broadcaster based in Prague, is suddenly facing a housing crisis for many of its 500 employees. And the chief executive, Jeffrey Gedmin, ranks the weak dollar as one of the critical issues that the news organization is facing, along with attacks around the world on journalists, who have been kidnapped in Baghdad and jailed in Azerbaijan.
 ''For me it's become an ethical issue,'' said Mr. Gedmin, who was in Washington this month lobbying legislators for relief and trying to raise funds privately to aid hard-hit employees. ''I have a genuine ethical issue to take care of people who are trying hard to take care of their own countries.''
 Employees who have long been paid in dollars pumped the money into the local economy and to landlords who gratefully accepted dollars when the currency was strong.
 Now most of the organization's employees living in Prague are being pressured to convert rental contracts from dollars to korunas and have received notices about rent increases.
 The impact of the sagging dollar has been particularly acute for expatriates who live on fixed pensions paid in dollars, or self-employed workers whose clients are largely based in the United States.
 Josh Soskin moved from San Francisco to Barcelona in September to start a freelance video production company that supplies clients like Current TV in the United States with short video features on European stories.
 These days, he said, he finds himself sitting on his bed, with his head in his hands, obsessively checking currency rates on his laptop. ''They pay us $2,500 for a piece, and you cash it in and it's 1,400 euros or less. That's shocking,'' Mr. Soskin said.
 To survive and hedge currencies, Mr. Soskin is now scouting for European clients who will pay him in euros. Other self-employed workers -- from medical translators to online entrepreneurs -- are simply cutting off American clients because it is no longer worth working for them.
 Vincent Gagliostro is a graphic designer and freelance video filmmaker who left the New York advertising industry two years ago to settle in Paris with its promise of cheaper living, which reduced his monthly housing costs from a $6,000 mortgage to an 18th-century apartment rental for 1,700 euros. When he first moved to Paris, he said, he worked for a base of clients from the United States, but he is trying to diversify to earn euros.
 ''The dollar still heavily weighs on the quality of my life. As long as I continue to rely on at least 50 percent of my income with American clients, it's going to do that,'' Mr. Gagliostro said. ''My goal would be to lose the American clients altogether.''
 Mr. Gagliostro's partner, Richard Nahem, a Brooklyn native, has also sought to supplement their income by offering customized tours of the Marais, but his new business, Eye Prefer Paris Tours, is dominated by Americans and Canadians who pay him in a mix of euros and dollars. To economize, he has cut back on his own indulgences, like clothing purchases. But he cannot resist his favorite high-end patisserie, Gerard Mulot, where a chocolate eclair costs 2.80 euros ($4).
 Some employees have successfully pressed their companies to shift from dollars to local currencies. Ms. Nevins, who was paid in dollars while living in Paris, changed her income to pounds when she moved to London earlier this year.

HEADLINE: Money Goes Far in New York, if You're European

BYLINE: By KATE HAMMER and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
Margaret Dragonette arrived in New York last week -- three nieces, a cousin and loads of empty luggage in tow. By the time Ms. Dragonette, an administrative assistant for a nonprofit in Liverpool, was heading home, her group had filled six large suitcases and five carry-on bags. The bags were so stuffed with Juicy Couture T-shirts, Guess watches and Croc sandals that her nieces would have to wear the Ugg boots she was giving them for Christmas on the plane.
 ''Your money just keeps on going,'' said Ms. Dragonette, awed at the buying power of her British pounds, each worth $2.03 at the time. 
 The dollar was so weak, said her cousin, a 27-year-old nurse, ''We had trouble spending all our money.'' Add a new superlative to New York's long list: world's most fabulous discount mall. 
 With the dollar near its lowest rate against the pound in 26 years, and its lowest rate against the euro ever, many Europeans are looking at the United States the way some Americans have long viewed Latin America and the Caribbean and, once upon a time, Europe -- a cheap place to flex their strong currency. 
 The situation is more than a potential blow to Americans' self-image, it could be a blow to the world economy as some central bankers worry about ''currency tension,'' and many countries move trillions of dollars out of their reserves and buy euros instead.
 The dollar's fall has been so drastic, it has seeped into the popular consciousness. In his last video, rapper Jay-Z cruised the streets of New York flashing not a stack of Benjamins, but a fistful of euros. 
 The dollar had been at relatively low levels against the pound and euro for most of this year, but in April it broke the $2 for $:1 barrier and the exchange rate started to make headlines in Britain. Travel soared. 
 ''You already got high-quality holidays and friendliness and now you even got the good prices,'' said Alan Waddell, chief operating officer of Visit USA in London, which promotes British travel to the United States.For a new breed of European tourists, working-class and first-time visitors, the weak dollar is more than an everything-off coupon. ''It means we can come,'' said Inaki Benito, a 27-year-old bus factory worker from Vitoria, Spain, who never thought he would be able to afford a two-week stay in New York.
 Even with the weak dollar, Mr. Benito and his traveling companion, Eneko Ruiz-de-Samanie, a tire factory worker, had to rent an apartment in the Bronx rather than stay in hotels, so they would have money during for shopping and Broadway shows. 
 ''This year is unbelievable,'' said George Chaves, the guest relations manager at Fitzpatrick Hotels, two Manhattan hotels catering to British and Irish tourists, for the last six years. ''We're seeing families of modest means, they're here for the first time and they can't believe the purchasing freedom and the spending power they have.''
 A standard room at one of the Fitzpatrick hotels costs about $460 a night.
 Though statistics are not kept by tourists' economic class or income level, anecdotal evidence from travel agents and hoteliers, as well as New Yorkers, suggested there was a huge wave of new visitors to New York over the summer. The number of tourists from Britain, for instance, was up 22 percent in August 2007, compared with August 2006. 
 The year-over-year increase for September was only 6 percent, but indications were that this fall's travelers were more well-traveled and even less budget-conscious.
 More guests at Mr. Chaves's hotels are seeing Broadway shows, from the orchestra seats, and he is making more reservations for them at expensive uptown steakhouses like Bobby Van's, Maloney & Porcelli and Smith & Wollensky. (No word on whether the flush Europeans are tipping.)
 Matthias Jungkind, a 34-year-old financial controller from Dusseldorf, Germany, finds the low exchange rate laughable, literally. Every time he saw the dollar price tag on an item, he said, he giggled involuntarily. 
 But monetary authorities are not laughing. The dollar has been so low for so long, Europeans are worrying about how expensive their exports are becoming for American consumers when priced in dollars, and how much that hurts European growth. 
 Last month, Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, warned that an appreciating pound and euro, combined with most oil-producing countries and China linking their currencies to the dollar, creates ''great currency tension.'' 
 Such tension could hurt the dollar further as countries like China, which holds the largest reserves of American currency outside the United States, see their dollar reserves sink in value and hurry to move them to other currencies. A Chinese official threatened to do that last month, though other leaders contradicted him.
 Still, an estimated $1.2 trillion in dollar holdings will move to other currencies over the next five years, economists at Merrill Lynch said. In May, Kuwait dropped its currency's link to the dollar, and in October, Iraq said it wanted to diversify its heavily dollar-dominated reserves. Other countries, including Qatar, have complained about the negative effect of the weakening dollar on their reserves.
 ''The current currency system is quite fragile and will break down as it leads to imbalances and capital losses'' among countries with dollar reserves, said Nouriel Roubini, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
 It is still less clear whether one or several currencies will replace the dollar as the main reserve currency. ''With the euro, the world has gained an alternative reserve currency but other currencies have also won in strength,'' said Chris Munns, a lecturer at the London School of Economics.
 Whatever the long-term effect of the strong euro (and the weak dollar), in the short run the current exchange rate could serve American interests, not only because it helps reduce the current- account deficit, but also because Europeans could help save what is expected to be a somber holiday shopping season, even though retail sales figures for November, released Thursday, were better than anticipated.
 Europeans are descending on the nation's shopping malls and department stores at the highest rate in seven years. 
 International travelers are expected to spend $92 billion in the United States in 2007, 7.5 percent more than last year, according to the Commerce Department. The number of visitors from abroad, including those from Canada and Mexico, is expected to rise 5 percent to 53.6 million this year, but Europeans make up the largest group of overseas visitors to the United States, with about 35 percent of them visiting New York City. 
 Low prices should keep them coming. Increasing demand tied to the weak dollar has set off a price war among trans-Atlantic airlines, pushing prices to new lows, said Sean Tipton, spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents in London.
 Holly Lancaster, a 52-year-old airline customer service agent from Miami, said she was experiencing tourist envy after a November trip to Greece. ''I just couldn't do as much with my money as I wanted,'' she said. 
 Phillip Kwong, a 29-year-old systems analyst from Queens is just happy somebody -- anybody -- is spending money this holiday season. ''It's actually better for our economy that more Europeans are coming here to spend their money,'' he said. Most surprising, despite the visible increase of European tourists in places like New York, overall travel to the United States is still below pre-Sept. 11 levels, according to Cathy Keefe of the American Travel Industry Association. Overseas travel is down 17 percent from its peak in 2000. Without the positive effects of the weak dollar, ''we can't imagine what the numbers would be right now,'' she said.
 Many airlines say that the travel frenzy among Europeans is a wash, since the weak dollar means fewer Americans are traveling in the other direction.
 Until that two-way traffic returns, European travelers can take advantage of a favorable exchange rate and cheap flights to get an effectively free holiday, once you factor in what they save on shopping. ''You just have to shop enough,'' said Mr. Tipton of the British travel agency association.

HEADLINE: Deal on Reviving Climate Treaty Seems Close, but Is Elusive

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; Thomas Fuller reported from Nusa Dua, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York. Peter Gelling contributed reporting from Nusa Dua, and Graham Bowley from New York.

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
The world's countries, trying to wrap up two weeks of intense and at times emotional talks here on a two-year timetable for reviving an ailing, aging climate treaty, appeared close to a final agreement on Saturday but divisions remained. 
 The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, implored the assembly: ''You have before you a strong and good draft. Seize the moment, this moment for the good of all humanity.'' 
 Earlier, agreement appeared within sight after a significant policy shift by the Bush administration, which had long rejected the need to formally negotiate new steps to avoid climate dangers. This time, the United States agreed to set a deadline for an addendum to the original treaty, which was signed by Mr. Bush's father in 1992. 
 But some countries, notably China and India, still objected to parts of a compromise that was reached, and later United States representatives said they could not accept the deal either.
 The agreement would note the need for ''urgency'' in addressing climate change and recognize that ''deep cuts in global emissions will be required.''
 Still, it would not bind the United States or any country to commitments on reducing greenhouse pollution.
 ''It starts a negotiation that allows but doesn't require an outcome where the U.S. takes a cap,'' or a national limit on greenhouse gases, said David Doniger, a former climate negotiator in the Clinton administration and the climate policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 The draft agreement would also set the stage for the first commitments by developing countries to ''measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation actions.'' But it includes no language making such steps mandatory.
 American negotiators here had pushed hard to get developing countries, including emerging economic giants like China and India, to agree to seek cuts while retaining flexibility on how to make them.
 The agreement, if completed by 2009, would also ensure continuity for parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing addendum to the original climate treaty, which took effect in 2005. 
 The Kyoto pact limits emissions by three dozen industrialized countries but has been rejected by the United States. 
 Its emissions caps expire in 2012, and adherents, particularly European countries, were eager to start the process of setting new limits to sustain markets in emissions credits -- a keystone of the protocol. The Bush administration is increasingly under pressure domestically to take action on global warming. 
 Climate legislation is gaining momentum in the Democrat-controlled Congress and presidential candidates from both parties are generally more engaged on the subject. 
 In April, the Supreme Court rejected the Bush administration's contention that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant and ordered it to re-examine the case for regulating carbon dioxide from vehicles.
 Environmental campaigners called the proposed agreement here a welcome step. 
 The differences in philosophy at the meeting have been striking and fundamental. European Union negotiators said they favored specific government-imposed caps on emissions and wanted industrial countries to lead the way. 
 The United States favors relying on ''aspirational'' goals, research to advance nonpolluting energy technologies and a mix of measures, including mandatory steps like efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances -- but all set by individual nations, not mandated by a global pact. 
 Developing countries, a vaguely defined group that includes countries as different as China and Costa Rica, have long insisted that rich countries, which spent more than a century adding carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, should take the first step. 
 The tenor of the conference improved markedly after European nations, frustrated with the United States, threatened on Thursday to boycott talks proposed by the Bush administration in Hawaii next month.
 Germany's environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who led the criticism of the United States earlier in the week, said Friday, ''The climate in the climate convention has changed a little bit.
 ''It's true that during the last night and during the negotiations America was more flexible than in the first part of the conference. We very much appreciate this. Not only the Americans but also other parties.''
 Reuters reported Friday that the European Union had dropped a central demand that the guidelines for the agreement should include a reference to tough emissions targets for wealthy countries to meet by 2020.
 Coincidentally or not, the mood shifted after a speech Thursday by former Vice President Al Gore, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize this year for helping to alert the world to the danger of global warming. 
 After declaring the United States was ''principally responsible for obstructing progress'' in Bali, he urged delegates to agree to an open-ended deal that could be enhanced after President Bush left office.
 ''Over the next two years the United States is going to be somewhere it is not now,'' Mr. Gore said to loud applause. ''You must anticipate that.''
 Developing nations, notably China and India, stuck with their longstanding refusal to accept limits on their emissions, despite projections that they will soon become the dominant sources of climate-warming gases.
 Separately, participants agreed on a system that would compensate developing countries for protecting their rain forests, a plan that environmentalists described as an innovative effort to mitigate global warming. 
 Rain forest destruction is a major source of carbon dioxide, and living rain forests, according to recent research, play an important role in absorbing the gas.
 Precisely how countries with large rain forests, like Indonesia and Brazil, would be compensated has not been fully worked out.
 United Nations officials said part of the financing would come from developed countries through aid and other financing would come from carbon credits traded under the Kyoto pact.

HEADLINE: Tool Maker Sharply Cuts Its Outlook

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The tool maker Black & Decker slashed its fourth-quarter profit outlook on Friday, citing worse-than-expected conditions in North America and a one-time charge. 
 Shares of the company fell $5.67, to $74.46.
 Black & Decker has been suffering from a slowdown in construction in the United States, a result of the two-year slump in the housing market.
 The company also said it would recall some DeWalt XRP cordless drills made in the last 18 months, and take a pretax charge of about $25 million in the quarter.
 The recall and the slowdown will cause fourth-quarter sales to decline at a low-single-digit percentage rate, Black & Decker said. It had earlier forecast modest sales growth.
 ''The change in the operating environment is expected to have a significant negative impact on operating income, compared to previous guidance,'' the company added.
 Black & Decker, which also makes Kwikset locks, said it expected to report net earnings of $3.39 a share for the fourth quarter.
 Excluding a large one-time gain from a tax settlement and the recall-related charge, the company said it expected to earn $1.03 a share for the quarter.
 Analysts, on average, were looking for $1.60 a share, according to Reuters Estimates, after the company forecast $1.55 to $1.65 in October.
 An analyst with Sterne Agee, Nicholas P. Heymann, said the magnitude of the lowered outlook signaled that retailers did not order many tools after Thanksgiving weekend, which represents the start of the holiday shopping season.
 Mr. Heymann said it also indicated that a second reorder would not occur because of weakened consumer spending on remodeling and a softening of holiday sales of consumer durables.

HEADLINE: China's Seafood Industry: Dirty Water, Dangerous Fish

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Chen Yang contributed research from Shanghai and Fuqing.

DATELINE: FUQING, China 

 BODY:
Here in southern China, beneath the looming mountains of Fujian Province, lie dozens of enormous ponds filled with murky brown water and teeming with eels, shrimp and tilapia, much of it destined for markets in Japan and the West. 
 Fuqing is one of the centers of a booming industry that over two decades has transformed this country into the biggest producer and exporter of seafood in the world, and the fastest-growing supplier to the United States. 
 But that growth is threatened by the two most glaring environmental weaknesses in China: acute water shortages and water supplies contaminated by sewage, industrial waste and agricultural runoff that includes pesticides. The fish farms, in turn, are discharging wastewater that further pollutes the water supply. 
 ''Our waters here are filthy,'' said Ye Chao, an eel and shrimp farmer who has 20 giant ponds in western Fuqing. ''There are simply too many aquaculture farms in this area. They're all discharging water here, fouling up other farms.'' 
 Farmers have coped with the toxic waters by mixing illegal veterinary drugs and pesticides into fish feed, which helps keep their stocks alive yet leaves poisonous and carcinogenic residues in seafood, posing health threats to consumers. 
 Environmental degradation, in other words, has become a food safety problem, and scientists say the long-term risks of consuming contaminated seafood could lead to higher rates of cancer and liver disease and other afflictions. 
 No one is more vulnerable to these health risks than the Chinese, because most of the seafood in China stays at home. But foreign importers are also worried. In recent years, the European Union and Japan have imposed temporary bans on Chinese seafood because of illegal drug residues. The United States blocked imports of several types of fish this year after inspectors detected traces of illegal drugs linked to cancer. 
 This week, officials from the United States and China signed an agreement in Beijing to improve oversight of Chinese fish farms as part of a larger deal on food and drug safety. 
 Yet regulators in both countries are struggling to keep contaminated seafood out of the market. China has shut down seafood companies accused of violating the law and blacklisted others, while United States regulators are concentrating on Chinese seafood for special inspections. 
 Fuqing (pronounced foo-CHING) is at the top of the list this year for refused shipments of seafood from China, with 43 rejections through November, according to records kept by the United States Food and Drug Administration. All of those rejections involved the use of illegal veterinary drugs. 
 By comparison, Thailand, also a major exporter of seafood to the United States, had only two refusals related to illegal veterinary drugs. China as a whole had 210 refusals for illegal drugs. 
 ''For 50 years,'' said Wang Wu, a professor at Shanghai Fisheries University, ''we've blindly emphasized economic growth. The only pursuit has been G.D.P., and now we can see that the water turns dirty and the seafood gets dangerous. Every year, there are food safety and environmental pollution accidents.'' 
 Environmental problems plaguing seafood would appear to be a bad omen for the industry. But with fish stocks in the oceans steadily declining and global demand for seafood soaring, farmed seafood, or aquaculture, is the future. And no country does more of it than China, which produced about 115 billion pounds of seafood last year. 
 China produces about 70 percent of the farmed fish in the world, harvested at thousands of giant factory-style farms that extend along the entire eastern seaboard of the country. Farmers mass-produce seafood just offshore, but mostly on land, and in lakes, ponds, rivers and reservoirs, or in huge rectangular fish ponds dug into the earth. 
 ''They'll be a major supplier not just to the U.S., but to the world,'' said Richard Stavis, the chairman of Stavis Seafoods, an American company that imports Chinese catfish, tilapia and frog legs. 
 China began emerging as a seafood power in the 1990s as rapid economic growth became the top priority in the country. But environmental experts say that headlong pursuit of higher gross domestic product has devastated Chinese water quality and endangered the country's food supply. In Guangdong Province in southern China, fish contaminated with toxic chemicals like DDT are already creating health problems. 
 ''There are heavy metals, mercury and flame retardants in fish samples we've tested,'' said Ming Hung Wong, a professor of biology at Hong Kong Baptist University. ''We've got to stop the pollutants entering the food system.'' 
 More than half of the rivers in China are too polluted to serve as a source of drinking water. The biggest lakes in the country regularly succumb to harmful algal blooms. Seafood producers are part of the problem, environmental experts say. Enormous aquaculture farms concentrate fish waste, pesticides and veterinary drugs in their ponds and discharge the contaminated water into rivers, streams and coastal areas, often with no treatment. 
 ''Water is the biggest problem in China,'' said Peter Leedham, the business manager at Sino Analytica, an independent food safety testing firm that works with companies that buy from China. ''But my feeling is China will deal with it, because it has to. It just won't be a quick process.'' 
 Fishing for Prosperity
 Fuqing is called qiaoxiang, or home, for those who go overseas, because for decades this port city on the East China Sea is where thousands of people fled as stowaways. 
 In the 1980s, some emigrants began sending home money and ideas at just about the time that investors were arriving from Japan and Taiwan, promising to help the country build fish farms. 
 ''Aquaculture was popular in Japan, so I saw the future,'' said Wang Weifu, a longtime eel producer. 
 Thousands of peasants who had struggled to earn a living harvesting rice and potatoes began carving up huge plots, digging rectangular pits and filling them with water to create fish ponds. Other parts of the country followed, creating fish farms alongside roads, near rivers and streams and in big lakes, ponds and reservoirs. 
 Today, the mighty Yangtze River is lined with fish farms. Historic Lake Tai is stocked with crab pens. Near Ningde, 90 miles north of here, thousands of people live in a huge bay area, where they float on large wooden rafts, feeding and harvesting caged fish, like the yellow croaker. 
 The government hoped the building boom would lift millions out of poverty. And it did. There are now more than 4.5 million fish farmers in China, according to the Fishery Bureau. 
 Lin Bingui, 50, is one of them, a former bricklayer with an easy smile who now manages 20 enormous shrimp and eel ponds in western Fuqing, on reclaimed land with access to a narrow strait of seawater. 
 ''This doesn't take a lot of technology,'' he said while walking into an indoor pond, where he raises baby eels. ''You just learn it as you go along.'' 
 The boom did more than create jobs. It made China the only country that produced more seafood from fish farms than from the sea. It also helped feed an increasingly prosperous population, a longstanding challenge in China. 
 Many growers here struck it rich as well, people like Lin Sunbao, whose 25-year-old son is now studying at Cambridge University in England. ''My best years were 1992, '93, '94,'' he said. ''I only had one aqua farm, and I earned over $500,000 a year.'' 
 As early as the mid-1990s, though, serious environmental problems began to emerge after electronics and textile manufacturing plants moved into central Fuqing. Water shortages appeared in the southeastern part of the city, and some fish farmers say their water turned black. 
 Government records document the environmental ills in the region. The nearby Dongzhang Reservoir, a water source for agriculture and more than 700,000 people, was recently rated level 5, near the bottom of the government scale, unfit for fish farming, swimming or even contact with the human body. 
 The Long River, the major waterway in Fuqing, has been degraded by waste dumped by paper factories and slaughterhouses. The government this year rated large sections of the river below level 5, or so highly polluted that it is unfit for any use. And nearby coastal waters which are also heavily fish farmed are polluted with oil, lead, mercury and copper, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration in China. 
 As water quality in Fuqing declined, farmers who often filled their ponds with too much seafood tried to fight off disease and calm stressed fish with an array of powerful, and often illegal, antibiotics and pesticides. 
 Eel producers, for example, often used nitrofuran to kill bacteria. But that antibiotic has been banned for use in animal husbandry in the United States, Europe, Japan, and even China, because it has caused cancer in laboratory rats. 
 Importers of Chinese seafood quickly caught on. In recent years, eel shipments to Europe, Japan and the United States have been turned back or destroyed because of residues of banned veterinary drugs. Eel shipments to Japan have dropped 50 percent through August of this year, dealing a heavy blow in Fuqing. 
 Chinese farmers say they have stopped using the banned medicines, and have suffered a 30 percent decline in survival rates of their fish and other seafood. 
 ''Before 2005, we did use drugs blindly. They were very effective in fighting disease,'' said Wang Weifu, chairman of a local eel association, noting that drug residues might still be in the water. ''But now we don't dare because of the regulations.'' 
 Some growers have lashed out at Japan, arguing that it keeps raising the drug residue standard simply to protect its own eel farms against competition. But growers here say buyers from Japan will eventually be forced to purchase eels from China. 
 ''Our market will expand in Russia and Southeast Asia, and the E.U.,'' Mr. Wang said. ''Also, we see big prospects in the Chinese market. In five or six years, as we transfer our export destinations, Japan will be begging us.'' 
 Retreating From the Coast
 The drive about 175 miles west of Fuqing leads into the lush subtropical mountains of Fujian Province, where some of China's richest bamboo and timber reserves can be found. There, near the city of Sanming, Fuqing eel producers have built a collection of aquaculture farms, huge cement tubs wedged into the mountainside, covered by black tarps and stocked with millions of eels. 
 ''This costs a lot more up here, but we had to do it,'' said Zheng Qiuzhen, a longtime Fuqing eel producer who now operates near Sanming. ''We had to do something about the water problems.'' 
 In much of the country, seafood growers are leaving crowded coastal areas for less developed regions, where the land is cheaper and there is cleaner water. But they say the overall cost of doing business so far from the coast is higher, given the expense of shipping the fish in oxygenated trucks to the processing plant in Fuqing and their forswearing illegal drugs, which lowers survival rates and increases the growth period of most fish to five years from three years. 
 ''You can't find many places as beautiful as this, covered by trees and bamboo,'' said Lin Sunbao, who moved from Fuqing to Sanming. ''We use water from mountain streams. And because our water is better, it's harder to get disease.'' 
 This is one of the solutions to the water crisis in China: to seek out virgin territory and essentially start the cycle all over again. And that worries scientists, who say aquaculture in China is not just a victim of water pollution but a culprit with a severe environmental legacy. 
 Industrial fish farming has destroyed mangrove forests in Thailand, Vietnam and China, heavily polluted waterways and radically altered the ecological balance of coastal areas, mostly through the discharge of wastewater. Aquaculture waste contains fish feces, rotting fish feed and residues of pesticides and veterinary drugs as well as other pollutants that were already mixed into the poor quality water supplied to farmers. 
 Besides algal blooms, some of the biggest lakes in China, like Lake Tai, are suffering from eutrophication nutrient bombs, brought on partly by aquaculture, that can kill fish by depleting the water's oxygen. The government is forcing aquaculture out of these lakes, and also away from the Long River in Fuqing. 
 Places like Sanming may not be pristine for long. Heavy industry is moving in, lured by mineral riches and incentives from local governments, which are pushing for development. 
 And Sanming already has 72 giant eel farms, producing 5,000 tons of seafood a year. Those farms together use about 280 million gallons of water a day and then discharge the wastewater the following day, back into the Sanming environs. 
 There are efforts to operate aquaculture in a sustainable way. In Norway, for instance, salmon producers use sophisticated technology, including underwater cameras, to monitor water quality and how much fish feed is actually consumed. But nothing like this is being done in China, and specialists like Li Sifa of Shanghai Fisheries University insist that Chinese regulations are too lax and that enforcement efforts are often feeble or nonexistent. 
 The government has stepped up its inspections of fish farms and seafood processing plants here, alerting workers of the dangers and consequences of using illegal drugs. But the drugs have remained a problem, partly because of poor water quality. 
 A possible solution to the water woes is to move aquaculture well out to sea, specialists say, with new technology that allows for deepwater fish cages served by automatic feeding machines. 
 The United States is already considering such a plan, partly as a way to make it less dependent on imports, which now fill 80 percent of its seafood needs. China is also considering adopting what is now being called ''open ocean'' aquaculture. 
 Currently, China's coastal fish farms face many of the same challenges as those on land. Waters there are heavily polluted by oil, lead, mercury, copper and other harsh substances. Veterinary drugs dropped in shoreline waters may easily spread to neighboring aquaculture farms and affect species outside the cages, and while coastal waters are less polluted than those on land, aquaculture farms, with their intensive production cycles, are prone to be polluters. 
 Still, said An Taicheng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: ''China has to go to the sea because it's getting harder and harder to find clean water. Every year there are seafood safety problems. One day, no one will dare to eat fish from dirty water, and what will farmers do?''

HEADLINE: Ethanol's Getting-Acquainted Problem

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MAAG

DATELINE: LIMA, Ohio 

 BODY:
If America's great ethanol fuel experiment is ever going to work, Bill Timmermeister will be among the first to know. 
 Mr. Timmermeister invested in a local ethanol plant that will ferment corn to produce 54 million gallons of ethanol a year beginning in January. He also owns the Lima Auto Mall, which sells more ethanol-burning cars than any dealership in town.
 But by his account and that of others in the Midwest, ethanol remains a mystery to the motoring public, even in states that have pushed it hardest. The number of stations in the country selling E85, a fuel consisting mostly of ethanol, has jumped fivefold in the last three years, but it is still unavailable to the vast majority of motorists.
 Americans drive millions of cars able to burn E85, but many do not even know it. Those who do are not always aware they must do some math every time they pull into a station to figure out which is cheaper, E85 or gasoline. 
 ''This is the absolute best place for ethanol fuel to take off,'' said Mr. Timmermeister, noting that Lima is on the eastern edge of the nation's Corn Belt. ''But will it happen? I don't know yet.''
 The ethanol industry is experiencing a historic boom, with record investment in new plants, more ethanol-burning cars on the road and rising public awareness. With Congress on the verge of passing an energy bill that will drastically ratchet up ethanol production, automakers are promising to build millions more ethanol-capable vehicles, universities are developing better methods to produce the fuel and big retailers like Wal-Mart are studying ways to bring it to consumers.
 But enormous hurdles remain. 
 Most ethanol produced in the country is blended with gasoline in a mixture called E10, containing up to 10 percent ethanol. It can be burned in any engine and is generally sold in areas with air-quality problems because the ethanol helps to reduce certain pollutants.
 The mixture called E85, a gasoline blend consisting of 70 to 85 percent ethanol depending on the season, could contribute more to reducing the nation's dependence on oil if it were widely used. But it is available almost exclusively in the Midwest, far from the coastal regions where most Americans live and most cars are sold.
 The number of stations selling E85 has jumped to 1,413, from 285 three years ago. But that is still fewer than 1 percent of the gas stations in the country. And the number of cars that can burn E85, about six million and rising, is still only 2.4 percent of the nation's automobile fleet.
 ''It's a classic chicken-and-the-egg problem,'' said Brian Turner, analyst at the National Commission on Energy Policy in Washington. ''There's no demand because for most people the fuel just isn't available. And it's not available because the demand isn't there.''
 Even when people can find E85, they are often fooled by the price. It is almost always cheaper per gallon than gasoline. But because E85 contains less energy than gasoline, fuel efficiency drops 10 to 30 percent, depending on the vehicle. 
 Recently, Arnold Foss, a retired farmer, drove to a Kroger gas station in Perrysburg, Ohio, to fill the tank of his 2003 GMC Yukon, which can burn E85 or gasoline. E85 at the station cost $2.73 per gallon, while regular unleaded was $3.13.
 ''I'm saving 40 cents a gallon with E85, and I don't notice any difference in gas mileage,'' Mr. Foss said.
 ''He's wrong,'' said David Champion, director of automobile testing for Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine. In its October 2006 test of the Chevrolet Tahoe, the sister truck to the GMC Yukon, Consumer Reports found that the giant sport utility vehicle's average mileage dropped 27 percent, to 10 miles a gallon, when switched from gasoline to E85. Mr. Foss was actually losing more than 40 cents for every gallon of E85 he pumped.
 ''I meet a lot of people who buy E85 just because it's cheaper,'' Mr. Timmermeister said. ''The fact that they're still losing money just sails right over their heads.'' 
 A few small fuel retailers are building a business model that helps consumers at least break even. The MFA Oil Company, a farmers cooperative that sells E85 at 45 locations in Missouri, has lowered prices so it will always cost 20 percent less than gasoline, largely compensating for the lost efficiency. 
 Sales are up, but even the company's busiest ethanol pump does only half the volume a gasoline pump would, and MFA admits it could probably make more money by sticking to gasoline. ''We're willing to take the risk to develop this market because our farmer members believe we're doing the right thing,'' said Tom May, the marketing director.
 Bigger retailers are also testing the ethanol market, one reason the number of ethanol pumps nationwide has jumped. The Kroger supermarket chain sells ethanol at 42 stations and plans to install more pumps at its gas stations in Ohio and Texas, said Meghan Glynn, a spokeswoman. 
 Perhaps the biggest unknown for ethanol fuel right now is Wal-Mart. The retail behemoth is studying whether to install ethanol pumps at its stores, said Dave Tovar, a spokesman.
 ''Wal-Mart can come in as the big gorilla and blow the doors off the ethanol fuel market,'' said Curt Magleby, director of government affairs at the Ford Motor Company.
 The six million cars and light trucks able to burn E85 are known as flex-fuel vehicles; they adjust automatically to run on any mix of ethanol and gasoline. But most people who drive them do not know it because, until recently, it was rare for automobile dealers to mention the feature in their sales pitches. 
 The six million cars exist because flex-fuel vehicles cost only $100 more to build, and they provide special credits for Detroit that allow automakers to sell more gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles than would otherwise be allowed under federal mileage standards, said Therese Langer of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
 Lately, automakers have begun to emphasize the feature, and some flex-fuel cars come with yellow gas caps as a clue. Even so, most new cars -- and hence most new ethanol-burning cars -- are sold on the coasts, where high transport costs for ethanol make it difficult to sell E85, Mr. Champion said.
 ''Unlike with oil, there's no pipeline for ethanol,'' said Nathanael Greene, policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''We can't get the fuel to market at a reasonable price. That is the bottleneck right now.''
 The ethanol market is glutted at the moment, but a big national switch to E85 would require far more of the fuel. By most estimates, the country can produce only about 15 billion gallons from corn without severe disruption of the food-production system. That much ethanol would displace less then 7 percent of the nation's gasoline.
 That means new technology is needed to create ethanol from sources like wood chips and straw, known as biomass. Turning those into ethanol could eventually displace more than a third of the nation's gasoline, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory said in a report. The energy bill under consideration in Congress would require expanded ethanol production from both corn and biomass. Construction is beginning on small factories that will use biomass, but the economics have yet to be proved.
 ''When you're talking about ethanol fuel, uncertainty is the name of the game,'' said George Naylor, a corn farmer in central Iowa and president of the National Family Farm Coalition. ''The whole thing is up in the air right now.''

HEADLINE: Investors Sell on Inflation Data

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell Friday after accelerating inflation spurred concern that higher prices will curb consumer spending and give the Federal Reserve less leeway to cut interest rates.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 20.46 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,467.95. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 178.11 points, or 1.3 percent, to 13,339.85. The Nasdaq composite index lost 32.75 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,635.74.
 The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $582 million, fell 2 percent, to 753.93. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 9/32, to 100 4/32, with a yield of 4.23 percent, up from 4.20 percent Thursday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
 The Consumer Price Index climbed 0.8 percent in November, the most since September 2005, the Labor Department said. Prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 percent, also more than forecast. The dollar gained the most against the euro since August 2004 as the surge in inflation caused traders to pare bets that the Fed would cut rates in January.
 ''The markets will have some indigestion with this inflation number,'' said Michael H. Strauss, market strategist and chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn. ''Consumers are recognizing they really have to hunker down as they see their heating oil costs and their gasoline costs.''
 Heating oil futures in New York declined Friday amid forecasts of above-normal temperatures over the next two weeks. Heating oil for January delivery fell 0.68 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.6079 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 4.1 percent this week.
 Crude oil for January delivery fell 98 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $91.27 a barrel. The futures rose 3.4 percent this week.
 The S.& P. 500 lost 2.4 percent in the week, trimming its yearly advance to 3.5 percent. The Dow average dropped 2.1 percent this week, reducing its 2007 gain to 7 percent, while the Nasdaq decreased 2.6 percent and is up 9.1 percent on the year.
 Black & Decker, the largest United States maker of power tools, slumped $6.82, or 8.5 percent, to $73.31 after it cut profit forecasts.
 Circuit City fell 59 cents, to $6.82. The company's profit margins might shrink as television prices fall and consumers buy fewer warranties, said a Bear Stearns analyst, Christopher Horvers. A Morgan Stanley analyst, Gregory Melich, also said the retailer was likely to post a third-quarter loss.
 Financial stocks dropped for a fourth day, as analysts predicted bigger losses for banks and brokerage firms. Bank of America, the second-biggest United States bank, lost 89 cents, to $42.16. JPMorgan Chase, the third largest, retreated 56 cents, to $45.20.
 Citigroup, the biggest United States bank, fell 31 cents, to $30.70. The decision by the chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, to bail out seven subprime-affected investment funds with $49 billion spurred speculation that the bank would cut its dividend.
 The S.& P. 500 financials index tumbled 6.1 percent this week even after policy makers in Europe and North America announced plans to revive credit markets by injecting cash into the banking system and the Federal Reserve cut borrowing costs for a third time this year.
 Amazon.com, the world's largest Internet retailer, fell $3.32, to $89.08, and eBay, the biggest auction site, declined $1.39, to $32.70, after a research company, comScore, said online holiday sales grew at the slowest pace ever.
 Internet sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 11 increased 19 percent, to $20.5 billion, comScore said. Online sales in November and December might rise 20 percent, a record low for the industry and slower than the 26 percent pace a year earlier.
 ''The consumer is getting hit by higher energy prices, and given the state of the overall housing market, we're expecting consumers to pull in their spending,'' said Rose Grant at Eastern Investment Advisors in Boston. ''We don't think consumer spending will be as strong as in past quarters.''
 Hotel stocks fell after a PricewaterhouseCoopers report said United States revenue growth might slow for the industry in 2008. Marriott International, the world's largest hotel company, declined $2.33, to $31.49. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide fell $2.83, to $46.62.
 Goldman Sachs, the world's biggest securities firm, added $2.19, to $210.67. Goldman might post a record full-year profit of more than $11 billion on Tuesday, increased by $4 billion from bets on subprime-mortgage-related lending, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing analysts. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment, according to The Journal.

HEADLINE: Report Says That the Rich Are Getting Richer Faster, Much Faster

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The increase in incomes of the top 1 percent of Americans from 2003 to 2005 exceeded the total income of the poorest 20 percent of Americans, data in a new report by the Congressional Budget Office shows.
 The poorest fifth of households had total income of $383.4 billion in 2005, while just the increase in income for the top 1 percent came to $524.8 billion, a figure 37 percent higher. 
 The total income of the top 1.1 million households was $1.8 trillion, or 18.1 percent of the total income of all Americans, up from 14.3 percent of all income in 2003. The total 2005 income of the three million individual Americans at the top was roughly equal to that of the bottom 166 million Americans, analysis of the report showed. 
 The report is the latest to document the growing concentration of income at the top, a trend that President Bush said last January had been under way for more than 25 years.
 Earlier reports, based on tax returns, showed that in 2005 the top 10 percent, top 1 percent and fractions of the top 1 percent enjoyed their greatest share of income since 1928 and 1929. 
 The budget office report takes into account a broader definition of income than tax returns that is known as comprehensive income. It includes untaxed Social Security benefits, welfare, food stamps and part of the value of Medicare benefits, giving a fuller picture of incomes at the bottom than tax data.
 Much of the increase at the top reflected the rebound of the stock market after its sharp drop in 2000, economists from across the political spectrum said. About half of the income going to the top 1 percent comes from investments and business.
 In addition, Congress in 2003 cut taxes on long-term capital gains and most dividends, which advocates said would encourage people to turn untaxed wealth into taxable income. Some economists have said that the increase in incomes at the top is illusory and is in good part simply converting untaxed assets into taxed income to take advantage of reduced tax rates.
 The Congressional Budget Office report made no attempt to explain the increases in income in its annual report on effective federal tax rates paid by people at different income levels. 
 Asked how much of the increase at the top was from the tax cuts rather than market gains, Peter R. Orszag, the budget office director, said, ''I can't give you an answer to that because we just don't know.''
 Chris Frenze, Republican staff director for the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, said the increase in top incomes is much more modest if viewed over longer time periods. Since 2000, he said, the average income of the top 1 percent has risen $97,900, or 6.7 percent, the same percentage increase this group had from 1992 to 1997.
 Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington who characterizes the Bush administration's policies as YOYO economics, based on You (Are) On Your Own, said the differences in income growth explained why so many Americans have told pollsters that they are feeling squeezed.
 ''A lot of people justifiably feel they are working harder and smarter, they are baking a bigger and better pie, and yet their slice is not growing much at all,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It is meaningless to middle- and low-income families to say we have a great economy because their economy looks so much different than folks at the top of the scale because this is an economy that is working, but not working for everyone.'' 
 At every income level Americans had more income, after adjusting for inflation in 2005 than in 2003, but the increases ranged from almost imperceptible for the poor to modest for the middle class and largest for those at the top. 
 On average, incomes for the top 1 percent of households rose by $465,700 each, or 42.6 percent after adjusting for inflation. The incomes of the poorest fifth rose by $200, or 1.3 percent, and the middle fifth increased by $2,400 or 4.3 percent.
 The share of all federal taxes paid by the top 1 percent grew, but only slightly more than half the rate of their growth in incomes because of the tax rate cuts. The top 1 percent paid 27.6 percent of all federal taxes in 2005, up from 22.9 percent in 2003, while the share paid by the middle fifth of taxpayers declined to 9.3 percent from 10 percent in 2003.
 The share of their income that the top 1 percent paid in all federal taxes and in income taxes fell. The total tax rate dropped 1.8 percentage points, to 31.2 percent, from 2003 to 2005 while their average income tax rate declined one percentage point, to 19.4 percent, largely because of the cuts in taxes on capital gains and dividends.

HEADLINE: World Bank Raises Record Aid, but U.S. Slips as Donor

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
The World Bank, overcoming misgivings about its direction and leadership, said Friday that it had raised $25.1 billion in aid for the world's poorest countries, a record sum that includes donations by China and Egypt, nations that were once recipients of such aid.
 For the first time, Britain overtook the United States as the biggest donor, a highly symbolic change given Washington's traditional influence in choosing the bank's president and charting its policies. 
 Bank officials said the change in rankings was partly caused by currency swings, since the dollar has dropped in value against European currencies. But the willingness of the United States to cede its top spot was clearly the most closely watched element of the negotiations here.
 ''The U.S. is stretching; Britain is stretching,'' the bank's president, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday. Britain has ''the advantage of a stronger currency, the pound,'' he said.
 The record overall donations were a coup for Mr. Zoellick, a diplomat and former trade negotiator in the Bush administration, who replaced Paul D. Wolfowitz as bank president in July. Mr. Wolfowitz left after a bitter ethics dispute that frayed ties with aid officials, particularly among European governments.
 Britain's pledge of $4.2 billion, and $2.2 billion from Germany -- both big increases -- suggested that the rift with Europe had been healed. German officials heaped praise on Mr. Zoellick, who skipped the negotiations to attend the United Nations meeting on climate change in Bali, Indonesia.
 ''The atmosphere has improved and become more trusting,'' said Eric Stather, the German deputy minister for economic cooperation and development. ''He has shown a clear vision for the future of the bank.''
 Britain, the United States, Japan and Germany were the four largest donors among the 45 countries that pledged money to be used over the next three years. The total was 42 percent more than the bank raised in its previous campaign in 2005.
 In all, the World Bank collected $41.6 billion for its International Development Association, or I.D.A., which provides grants and interest-free loans to more than 80 poor countries, roughly half of them in Africa.
 Of that amount, $16.5 billion is from the World Bank's internal funds, including previous donor pledges for financing debt forgiveness and contributions from two other World Bank divisions, the International Finance Corporation and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
 Mr. Zoellick pushed for these donations to jump-start the fund-raising effort, which he predicted would be arduous. The World Bank raised $32.1 billion in its last round of fund-raising. In addition to the declining dollar, countries are grappling with their own budget pressures. Moreover, the role of the International Development Association has come under question in development circles in recent years.
 Wealthier nations increasingly prefer to channel aid through their own development agencies. They also tend to earmark large contributions for specific diseases, like AIDS, or specific development projects, like ones relating to climate change and the environment. 
 ''It's easier for governments to raise money for particular diseases,'' Mr. Zoellick said. He has defended the International Development Association, noting that ''this is the core funding that the poorest developing countries rely on.''
 Mr. Zoellick spent a lot of time persuading what he called ''middle income'' countries to donate aid to poorer countries. China, because of its vast foreign-exchange reserves, was an obvious target. Its undisclosed donation, though small, was a victory for his diplomacy. 
 As for the United States, he played down its slide in the rankings. In percentage terms, he said, the American donation still represented a healthy increase from its last one. The United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said the contribution of $3.7 billion was 30 percent higher than previous levels.
 Development experts said the loss of the top ranking was symbolically important, even if Britain had been closing in on the United States for years. More significantly, though, it shows that Europe has thrown its support behind the World Bank.
 ''The Europeans were looking for a sense of direction and some confidence in where the bank was going,'' said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a public policy organization in Washington. ''This shows there is a renewed confidence.''

HEADLINE: I Am Not a Health Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID U. HIMMELSTEIN and STEFFIE WOOLHANDLER. 
David U. Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler are professors of medicine at Harvard and the co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 IN 1971, President Nixon sought to forestall single-payer national health insurance by proposing an alternative. He wanted to combine a mandate, which would require that employers cover their workers, with a Medicaid-like program for poor families, which all Americans would be able to join by paying sliding-scale premiums based on their income. 
 Nixon's plan, though never passed, refuses to stay dead. Now Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama all propose Nixon-like reforms. Their plans resemble measures that were passed and then failed in several states over the past two decades. 
 In 1988, Massachusetts became the first state to pass a version of Nixon's employer mandate -- and it added an individual mandate for students and the self-employed, much as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards (but not Mr. Obama) would do today. Michael Dukakis, then the state's governor, announced that ''Massachusetts will be the first state in the country to enact universal health insurance.'' But the mandate was never fully put into effect. In 1988, 494,000 people were uninsured in Massachusetts. The number had increased to 657,000 by 2006. 
 Oregon, in 1989, combined an employer mandate with an expansion of Medicaid and the rationing of expensive care. When the federal government granted the waivers needed to carry out the program, Gov. Barbara Roberts said, ''Today our dreams of providing effective and affordable health care to all Oregonians have come true.'' The number of uninsured Oregonians did not budge.
 In 1992 and '93, similar bills passed in Minnesota, Tennessee and Vermont. Minnesota's plan called for universal coverage by July 1, 1997. Instead, by then the number of uninsured people in the state had increased by 88,000.
 Tennessee's Democratic governor, Ned McWherter, declared that ''Tennessee will cover at least 95 percent of its citizens.'' Yet the number of uninsured Tennesseans dipped for only two years before rising higher than ever. 
 Vermont's plan, passed under Gov. Howard Dean, called for universal health care by 1995. But the number of uninsured people in the state has grown modestly since then.
 The State of Washington's 1993 law included the major planks of recent Nixon-like plans: an employer mandate, an individual mandate for the self-employed and expanded public coverage for the poor. Over the next six years, the number of uninsured people in the state rose about 35 percent, from 661,000 to 898,000. 
 As governor, Mitt Romney tweaked the Nixon formula in 2006 when he helped devise a second round of Massachusetts health care reform: employers in the state that do not offer health coverage face only paltry fines, but fines on uninsured individuals will escalate to about $2,000 in 2008. On signing the bill, Mr. Romney declared, ''Every uninsured citizen in Massachusetts will soon have affordable health insurance.'' Yet even under threat of fines, only 7 percent of the 244,000 uninsured people in the state who are required to buy unsubsidized coverage had signed up by Dec. 1. Few can afford the sky-high premiums. 
 Each of these reform efforts promised cost savings, but none included real cost controls. As the cost of health care soared, legislators backed off from enforcing the mandates or from financing new coverage for the poor. Just last month, Massachusetts projected that its costs for subsidized coverage may run $147 million over budget.
 The ''mandate model'' for reform rests on impeccable political logic: avoid challenging insurance firms' stranglehold on health care. But it is economic nonsense. The reliance on private insurers makes universal coverage unaffordable. 
 With the exception of Dennis Kucinich, the Democratic presidential hopefuls sidestep an inconvenient truth: only a single-payer system of national health care can save what we estimate is the $350 billion wasted annually on medical bureaucracy and redirect those funds to expanded coverage. Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obama tout cost savings through computerization and improved care management, but Congressional Budget Office studies have found no evidence for these claims.
 In 1971, New Brunswick became the last Canadian province to institute that nation's single-payer plan. Back then, the relative merits of single-payer versus Nixon's mandate were debatable. Almost four decades later, the debate should be over. How sad that the leading Democrats are still kicking around Nixon's discredited ideas for health reform.

HEADLINE: Huckabee Camp Shifts Focus for New Hampshire

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H. 

 BODY:
Mike Huckabee, who surged in Iowa polls with an appeal to religious and social conservatives, returned Friday to New Hampshire, where he is still an also-ran for the Republican presidential nomination, and opened a newly focused campaign for the votes of working people and economic conservatives.
 The shift was evident in biographical TV ads which began running here portraying Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, as ''a committed conservative'' in contrast to parallel advertisements in Iowa that praise him as ''a Christian leader.'' 
 Mr. Huckabee also announced here on Friday that the Republican political strategist Ed Rollins, who helped shape the party's appeal to working-class Democrats in the Reagan years, would assume the role of national campaign chairman.
 The candidate stood with obvious pride and what seemed like a certain boyish awe as Mr. Rollins called Mr. Huckabee's communication skills ''as close as anyone comes'' to those of his former boss, Ronald Reagan.
 In his first stop in this state since his Iowa surge several weeks ago, Mr. Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, told factory workers in Boscawen that his own economic status growing up in Arkansas as the son of a city fireman was ''one generation away from dirt floors.'' He said he knew what it meant to struggle for basic necessities, and he summarized his ''fair tax'' plan, which would replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax, as a plan ''where you keep your whole paycheck.'' 
 Mixing a populist note with the tone of a minister, Mr. Huckabee said his plan would ensure economic fairness by guaranteeing that ''you pay the same as all those people who don't pay their taxes now, folks like gamblers and prostitutes.'' 
 The ''fair tax'' is a regressive tax that many economists say would put a disproportionate share of the tax burden on people at lower income levels. Critics of the plan say it would be a windfall for the rich.
 Asked by reporters if his increased focus on economic issues meant he would be playing down the born-again credentials he displayed in Iowa in appealing to evangelical Christian congregations and home-schoolers, Mr. Huckabee said, ''I've never downplayed or up-played my religious convictions.'' 
 Chip Saltsman, Mr. Huckabee's campaign manager, said Mr. Rollins would help the campaign reach the economically conservative voters who were ''a big part of the reason this party has been so successful'' since the 1980s. ''There's Reagan Democrats all over the Northeast,'' he said, adding that the Huckabee campaign hoped to win them over.
 Traditionally, New Hampshire primary voters have favored moderates in both parties, partly because independents can vote in either party's primary. High taxes are a perennial hot-button issue in the state, which is one of only seven without an income tax.
 With his new status as a contender, Mr. Huckabee has attracted more criticism from his rivals for the nomination. On Friday, he answered accusations by former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, his closest rival in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3, that he was too liberal as governor of Arkansas, saying he was a pragmatic politician who improved human services while reducing debt.
 On illegal immigration, a reporter asked if the position he recently embraced in Iowa -- proposing that the nation's estimated 12 million illegal immigrants be made to return to their home countries before applying for entry -- was substantially different from his previous statements favoring fines but allowing immigrants to remain here while applying for legal status.
 ''It is a change,'' he conceded, adding that he remained adamant, then and now, that there should be ''no amnesty'' for illegal immigrants.
 Chuck Norris, the TV and action movie star who has endorsed Mr. Huckabee, accompanied him to the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton. 
 Mr. Huckabee, who chose the site as a place to reassert his support for veterans' rights, mingled with residents at lunch, bending to talk with and in some cases to shout greetings to the men, most of them World War II veterans. 
 When it was his turn to be greeted, Marshall Gorney, 88, who has severe cataracts, held the candidate's outstretched hand and instructed him to ''turn your face around a little this way so I can see you.'' The candidate complied. Afterward, Mr. Gorney described Mr. Huckabee as ''a good-looking guy.''

HEADLINE: REPORT TO URGE SWEEPING CHANGE FOR SUNY SYSTEM

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Warning that New York has ''slipped in stature'' and that its once-powerful position in national research has ''faded,'' a commission set up by Gov. Eliot Spitzer is recommending that the state free its public colleges and universities to raise tuition without the Legislature's approval and to charge different prices from campus to campus.
 ''New York State's public higher education institutions face a chronic problem -- they have too little revenue and too little investment,'' said the report. 
 Those changes, sure to face political resistance, are among many broad proposals to reshape the public university system that are outlined in a report to be delivered to the governor on Monday.
 The 30-member commission is calling for the state to create its own low-cost student loan program, to clear up a $5 billion backlog in maintenance and construction at its public universities and to hire 2,000 new full-time professors -- including 250 academic stars who could bring in research dollars and prestige.
 And it proposes a $3 billion Empire State Innovation Fund that public and private universities could tap for research grants in fields like bioscience, engineering and medicine that can fuel economic development.
 The commission, which is issuing its first report in time to influence Governor Spitzer's next budget, used strong language to paint a picture of a public higher education system in dire need of repair, especially at its high-end research universities, in an era of stiff competition nationally and internationally. 
 In the report, which was obtained by The New York Times, the commission pointed in particular to the state aid structure and limits on campus autonomy. ''New York's public institutions are constrained by over-regulation on tuition pricing and insufficient state aid,'' it said.
 The report added that a dearth of revenues had compromised academic quality and left the colleges far too short of full-time faculty members. It said the most competitive states had ''far more revenue to support academic programs and services.'' It called for a rejuvenated higher education system that would foster more research and technological innovation and draw in more of the most talented students from the United States and abroad. 
 Governor Spitzer has said that higher education will be a priority for the coming year, and his senior adviser, Lloyd Constantine, has worked closely with the commission. But with the state forecasting budget difficulties, it is not clear how much of the plan the governor will adopt, or whether he will have the muscle to win its approval after a year of political missteps. The tuition proposals in particular could be a hard sell in the Legislature.
 The report did not provide a cost estimate for the commission's recommendations or suggest how the state should pay for them.
 A spokesman for the governor said on Friday that Mr. Spitzer would not comment until he received the report on Monday. The commission chairman, Hunter R. Rawlings III, the former president of Cornell University, also declined to comment. 
 New York is one of the few major states to shy away from differential tuition pricing, which allows research universities, which are more costly to run, to charge more. Under New York law, schools within the state and city systems can charge different tuition only for special degrees like medicine or law. Community colleges, which are subsidized by local governments, also charge different tuition.
 In California, by contrast, students in the California State University system pay less than $4,000 a year in tuition and fees, while students at the University of California system campuses pay more than $8,000. Differential pricing in New York would most likely lead Stony Brook, Albany, Binghamton and Buffalo to charge more than SUNY's other four-year colleges.
 Besides suggesting that colleges get more autonomy, the commission recommends a plan for all campuses designed to assure more stable financing. 
 Under a ''compact'' for public education, the state would pay the annual operating costs of salaries and energy and assume 20 percent of the costs of new investments that it approves. 
 In return, the universities would be allowed modest regular tuition increases and would be expected to step up fund-raising to shoulder other costs. The commission report calls for the tuition changes to be phased in over three years and suggests the first increases might be an average of 2.5 percent to 4 percent a year. 
 The commission said these tuition increases would not result in added costs to needy students who get state assistance. 
 Undergraduate tuition for state residents is now $4,350 a year at SUNY and $4,000 at CUNY. SUNY's tuition jumped 28 percent and CUNY's 25 percent in 2003, the first increases since 1995. Some campuses charge fees totaling $1,000 or more.
 SUNY's 64 campuses have become economic and cultural centers as well as sites for higher education, and legislators guard them the way they guard local military bases. Lawmakers have also kept tight control of tuition, saying their constituents don't want to pay more. While the SUNY and CUNY systems officially have the right to set their own tuition rates now, the money goes to the state, and if the money is not returned to campuses through appropriations, schools do not benefit from raising tuition. 
 Lawmakers have steadily fought off efforts in the past to allow the research centers at Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo and Stony Brook to charge more than other colleges or to allow regular indexed tuition increases. 
 Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, chairwoman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee, served on the commission. She said she could not comment on the report. 
 She said she had no doubts that the public universities ''have been systematically underfunded and undercapitalized, and that has to be corrected.''

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill Easing Home Loan Rules

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate passed legislation on Friday that would make more Federal Housing Administration loans available to subprime borrowers facing foreclosure.
 The bill, passed 93 to 1, is the first of a package of efforts that the government is considering to address the housing slump. On Dec. 6, President Bush announced that federal regulators and private lenders had agreed to a voluntary freeze on rates on some subprime mortgages. 
 The Senate plan would lower the down payment required of low- and middle-income home buyers taking out federally insured loans, and would allow larger loans. It would also make it easier for homeowners with adjustable-rate loans due to reset to get F.H.A.-backed loans.
 The Senate F.H.A. measure must be reconciled with a similar House bill, passed in September, which had higher loan limits and more flexible down payment requirements.
 ''This legislation is the perfect example of the kind of help Americans are looking for,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was a sponsor of the bill, said on the Senate floor. ''It is definitely and desperately needed.''
 Congress and the Bush administration are addressing the worst housing slump in 16 years by trying to expand the role of the F.H.A. The agency's loan terms, which are more stringent than those of many lenders, may have caused some borrowers to turn to subprime mortgages. Housing officials estimate that the legislation will help about 200,000 homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments.
 The legislation was pushed by the housing industry, including groups of home builders and real estate agents who stand to benefit from an expansion of F.H.A. loans. Government auditors criticized it in Congressional testimony, saying looser loan requirements should be accompanied by greater oversight.
 The White House has previously endorsed the efforts of Congress, while citing some concerns.
 Senators of both parties described the bill as only a part of a larger package of initiatives needed to address the housing crisis.
 It is ''a very strong first step in fixing the problem,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, a Republican of Florida who was housing and urban development secretary in President Bush's first term.

HEADLINE: In a Mess, Yes, but She's Got a Plan

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Sheila C. Bair never expected to find herself in the middle of the subprime mortgage mess.
 True, Ms. Bair has spent most of her career in Washington, where she's built a solid reputation as a financial regulator, culminating with her appointment as assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department during the first years of the George W. Bush administration. And true, she had been nervous about subprime mortgages long before they were was on the radar screens of most other regulators. 
 ''When I was at Treasury I worked with Ned Gramlich'' -- the late Federal Reserve governor --''on an initiative to get mortgage lenders to agree to best practices for their subprime loans,'' she recalled the other day. But in 2002, she left Treasury for Amherst, Mass., where she joined the faculty of the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts -- and promptly lost track of the issue. ''I didn't see the implications, nor did I realize this kind of lending had taken off,'' she said. 
 Then, in the summer of 2006, the White House called. The person the administration had hoped to nominate as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the nation's primary bank regulator, was suddenly proving unacceptable. (According to the Washington rumor mill, that choice, Diana L. Taylor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's companion and, at the time, New York's superintendent of banking, was nixed by the National Rifle Association, presumably because of Mayor Bloomberg's antigun stance.) 
 Suddenly, the administration needed a new nominee -- a Republican who understood the issues surrounding financial institutions, was a known commodity in Washington, and had friends on both sides of the aisles. That describes Ms. Bair, a lifelong moderate Republican who cut her teeth working for Bob Dole, to a T. She took office in June 2006.
 Fast forward to last week, when, with great fanfare, the White House announced a plan that encourages mortgage lenders to give across-the-board breaks to a certain category of subprime borrowers who are in danger of losing their homes. The lead dog in unveiling the complicated plan was Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. It was under his auspices that all the various mortgage constituents -- loan originators, holders of mortgage-backed securities, servicers, and representatives of the borrowers -- met and agreed on the plan. And he was the one who announced it to the media. 
 Mr. Paulson is also the one being praised by those who are happy to see the administration finally doing something about the subprime crisis -- and criticized by both those who say it does too little, and others who believe that the federal government should stay out of it entirely and let the parties take their lumps, no matter what the consequences.
 And yet the person who spurred the government to action, and came up with the core idea at the heart of the government's plan, was not Mr. Paulson. It was Sheila Bair.
 Not long after she settled in as F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Ms. Bair said: ''I started hearing that lending standards had deteriorated in subprime. So we started looking into it.''
 What she discovered startled her. Lending standards had indeed deteriorated, as mortgage originators introduced such ''innovations'' as no-money-down loans that required little or no financial information about the borrower -- and loan applications that practically begged borrowers to fib about their income. (Those are the so-called liar loans) 
 Particularly troubling to her was a series of popular adjustable-rate mortgages -- loans with teaser interest rates of, say, 7 percent that would reset within a year or two at much higher interest rates. ''That could often bring a payment shock of 30 to 40 percent,'' she said. 
 The truth is, when these loans were made, nobody ever expected that they would be repaid. Instead, the widespread assumption was that they would be refinanced before the reset ever kicked in. ''If you look at the 2003 originations,'' she pointed out, ''they were almost all refinanced instead of reset.'' That was possible of course, because housing prices were still rising at a historic pace --and everyone believed they would keep going up forever.
 But of course, the rise in housing prices was unsustainable, and by 2007, the housing bubble was over. Suddenly all those new homeowners with adjustable-rate subprime mortgages poised to reset in 2008 and 2009 were stuck. By the F.D.I.C.'s calculations, there were 1.7 million such mortgages, and the vast majority of those borrowers lacked the financial means to make the higher payments once the reset took place.
 To Ms. Bair, the answer was obvious: debtholders needed to give the borrowers some debt relief. Why? Because widespread foreclosures would be bad for everybody. Even putting aside the question of whether unsophisticated borrowers had been preyed upon by predatory lenders -- and therefore deserved some after-the-fact protection -- the economic arguments for loan modification were, in her mind, powerful. 
 The holders of the debt -- primarily Wall Street, which holds the complex securities into which subprime mortgages were bundled -- would at least get some money if the loans were modified, instead of nothing. Homeowners would get to stay in the homes and make payments they could afford, while waiting for the market to recover. Besides, she said: ''Foreclosures hurt everybody. They hurt entire neighborhoods. Vacant properties contribute to crime. And they hurt the economy at large.''
 Once upon a time, loan modifications would be made by bankers who met with the borrowers and hammered out new terms. But now that loan originators sell the mortgages to Wall Street, that is no longer possible. So in March, the F.D.I.C. held a series of ''securitization round tables,'' essentially an effort to jawbone debtholders into agreeing to freeze the starter interest rate, instead of allowing the reset rate to go into effect. They promised to do so -- but it never happened, something Ms. Bair realized in September, when Moody's reported that fewer than 1 percent of the loans were being modified.
 At that point, Ms. Bair did something regulators rarely do: she went public with her central idea. In a speech in early October, she pointed out that over $300 billion worth of loans in the pipeline were due to be reset over the next few years. ''We have a huge problem on our hands,'' she said. 
 She continued: ''For owner-occupied housing where the loan is current, just convert the subprime hybrid A.R.M. into a fixed-rate mortgage. Keep it at the starter rate. Convert it into a fixed rate. Make it permanent. And get on with it.'' 
 ''She got out in front,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, ''but not in an obnoxious way. And she had a great deal of credibility.''
 Mr. Paulson and others at Treasury began to warm to her idea as they felt under increasing pressure to do something to stem the coming wave of foreclosures. Ultimately, the voluntary plan announced last week by Mr. Paulson is narrower than Ms. Bair's idea; it will freeze the resets for five years, instead of permanently. And most experts I spoke to believe it will probably cover, at most, only 300,000 of the 1.7 million mortgages that are due for resets over the next few years.
 Some of these exclusions make obvious sense -- anyone who got a subprime mortgage to buy a second home won't be eligible, for instance. Other caveats don't make much sense at all: eligibility is based in part on credit scores, and people with poorer credit will make the cut while those with very good credit won't. ''People will rearrange their circumstance to meet the criteria,'' predicted Peter D. Schiff, the author of ''Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse.''
 Still, says Daniel Alpert, the managing director of Westwood Capital, ''It's a Band-Aid.'' And thus the real question: Should the government be doing more to help the people who took on subprime loans and now face foreclosure? It is a hard question to answer. Many of the sweeping relief plans floated by Democrats ignore the fact that many people who got liar loans were speculators searching for the quick score -- and many others simply lacked the financial means to be homeowners. Representative Frank told me that in Minneapolis recently, where he held a hearing on the subprime crisis, one couple told him that ''we got evicted so we bought a house.'' That's just crazy. 
 There is also a surprising amount of opposition to even the limited plan put forth by Mr. Paulson. I've been struck, for instance, by the groundswell of resentment from homeowners who did not speculate or get caught up in the housing bubble -- and who now feel that people who acted irresponsibly are getting a break they don't deserve. The problem, however, is that Ms. Bair is right about the potential consequences of doing nothing at all. ''Sure there were people who made bad decisions,'' said Desmond Lachman, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ''But if the alternative is that the economy will be crushed, I don't see why the rest of us have to pay for that'' just to make a point to those who overreached. 
 And then there are the real fire-breathers like Mr. Schiff, who think any government intervention is too much. ''The people in those homes who can't afford to pay the mortgage have no right to be in them,'' he said sternly. ''They have no means to pay for it. They don't get squatters' rights. If they're foreclosed on, they won't be homeless. There is an ample supply of rental properties.''
 I suppose. But I like Ms. Bair's analysis better. ''Sometimes,'' she said, adding a final rationale for her idea, ''I think you have to have some compassion.''
 Sometimes you do.

HEADLINE: Building a Greener Cardboard Box

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
AMERICANS are using more cardboard in different ways each year. But tree replanting and technological advances in making cardboard are easing the environmental impact, says Patrick J. Moore, chairman and chief executive of the Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, the largest maker of paper-based packaging products, with $7.2 billion in sales in 2006. Mr. Moore, who is based in St. Louis, says recycling programs are also improving the environmental impact of all the packaging that Americans consume. Here are excerpts from a conversation:
 Q.How extensively do Americans use cardboard in packaging and how is that changing? 
 A. It is certainly the most widely used form of shipping product from point to point. Corrugated container use is very much aligned with consumer product consumption. However, the source of containers has changed over the last number of years partly because of the loss of manufacturing in North America to lower-cost foreign manufacturing centers, which means that things have to be shipped farther. Today, 84 percent of corrugated containers are for nondurables such as food and beverages. Consumers see corrugated packaging every day in their normal lives. 
 A second trend in the retail sector has been the growth of ''big box'' stores, or mega-retailers. As a result, corrugated packaging plays a much more important role in the supply chain. It is used for dual purposes, not only for protecting the product and getting it to its final destination at a retail store, but it also carries the responsibility for helping to sell the product.
 Q.What is the rate of increase in the American consumption of cardboard?
 A. Over the past five years, consumption has been up about 1.5 percent annually. Aside from what touches the consumer directly, it's also used more in manufacturing. It's really evolved pretty dramatically.
 Q.In view of all the concern about the environment and the global competition for resources like wood, what kinds of external pressures are you facing?
 A. From the standpoint of economics, it's still a regional demand-and-supply issue. What that means is that in North America, demand is very well balanced with supply. We are in the midst of a price increase for our products.
 Of the products we make, about a third of our raw material comes from recycled fiber and two-thirds comes from virgin fiber. Our industry is concerned about the sustainability of forests. Statistically, we plant far more trees than are cut down in North America. We don't see any pressure long term on the availability of virgin fiber. We are not under pressure on that front.
 Q.What kind of future does cardboard have?
 A. It's quite promising. When you look at emerging markets, they are developing larger consumer markets than we have seen. There is growth in global population and growth in global wealth. People are consuming much more differently than previously. Much of that comes in corrugated packaging. In the United States, the industry is more mature, but we will see continued growth here, particularly as we look at the nondurable sector. That's going to continue to grow for us.
 Q.What can be done to reduce the environmental impact of all this cardboard?
 A. Smurfit continues to manufacture containers that contain less fiber. We're doing that by designing corrugated packaging with very similar strength characteristics but using less wood fiber.
 Q.Is cardboard holding its own against other forms of packaging such as plastic, which has its own environmental challenges?
 A. We certainly think that our product offers a distinct advantage relative to the competing packaging, such as plastic or glass. Everything that we make today comes from renewable resources. Certainly, we believe corrugated is a friendlier alternative than some of the other forms of packaging. From a manufacturing process standpoint, we have the ability to reuse a significant amount of chemicals, and we also use recycled fiber that comes from curbside collections across the country. We reprocess that into our paper and packaging products. United States recovery rates for paper are good. We recover almost 54 percent of all paper used today in the United States. For glass, it's 24 percent and for plastics, it's only about 15 percent.
 Q.Is it true that we have so much recycled paper that you export some to China?
 A. We sell scrap fiber to China. As a society, we're actually recovering more fiber today than we have the capacity to consume. So it's natural that the product gets sold internationally. Most of the demand is in Asia.
 Recycling in this way keeps resources out of North American landfills. You'll continue to see China as a net importer of recycled fiber.
 Q.So we're selling them the paper that they use to package up all the goods that they sell to us?
 A. Yes.
 Q.All the recycling efforts that individual Americans make are not just a wasted effort? They are having an impact?
 A. Absolutely. The 54 percent recovery rate continues to grow. In 1993, more than 35 million tons of paper was recovered and 38 million went into landfills. Last year, more than 50 million tons was recovered and less than 36 million went into landfills. We've seen a dramatic change in the use of paper. That's been a very effective development.
 Q.The subject of cardboard extends out in many different directions, doesn't it?
 A. Yes, it's a lot more interesting than many people think.

HEADLINE: CHOKING ON GROWTH; China's Seafood Industry: Dirty Water, Dangerous Fish

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Chen Yang contributed research from Shanghai and Fuqing.

DATELINE: FUQING, China 

 BODY:
Here in southern China, beneath the looming mountains of Fujian Province, lie dozens of enormous ponds filled with murky brown water and teeming with eels, shrimp and tilapia, much of it destined for markets in Japan and the West. 
 Fuqing is one of the centers of a booming industry that over two decades has transformed this country into the biggest producer and exporter of seafood in the world, and the fastest-growing supplier to the United States.
 But that growth is threatened by the two most glaring environmental weaknesses in China: acute water shortages and water supplies contaminated by sewage, industrial waste and agricultural runoff that includes pesticides. The fish farms, in turn, are discharging wastewater that further pollutes the water supply. 
 ''Our waters here are filthy,'' said Ye Chao, an eel and shrimp farmer who has 20 giant ponds in western Fuqing. ''There are simply too many aquaculture farms in this area. They're all discharging water here, fouling up other farms.'' 
 Farmers have coped with the toxic waters by mixing illegal veterinary drugs and pesticides into fish feed, which helps keep their stocks alive yet leaves poisonous and carcinogenic residues in seafood, posing health threats to consumers. 
 Environmental degradation, in other words, has become a food safety problem, and scientists say the long-term risks of consuming contaminated seafood could lead to higher rates of cancer and liver disease and other afflictions. 
 No one is more vulnerable to these health risks than the Chinese, because most of the seafood in China stays at home. But foreign importers are also worried. In recent years, the European Union and Japan have imposed temporary bans on Chinese seafood because of illegal drug residues. The United States blocked imports of several types of fish this year after inspectors detected traces of illegal drugs linked to cancer. 
 This week, officials from the United States and China signed an agreement in Beijing to improve oversight of Chinese fish farms as part of a larger deal on food and drug safety. 
 Yet regulators in both countries are struggling to keep contaminated seafood out of the market. China has shut down seafood companies accused of violating the law and blacklisted others, while United States regulators are concentrating on Chinese seafood for special inspections. 
 Fuqing (pronounced foo-CHING) is at the top of the list this year for refused shipments of seafood from China, with 43 rejections through November, according to records kept by the United States Food and Drug Administration. All of those rejections involved the use of illegal veterinary drugs. 
 By comparison, Thailand, also a major exporter of seafood to the United States, had only two refusals related to illegal veterinary drugs. China as a whole had 210 refusals for illegal drugs. 
 ''For 50 years,'' said Wang Wu, a professor at Shanghai Fisheries University, ''we've blindly emphasized economic growth. The only pursuit has been G.D.P., and now we can see that the water turns dirty and the seafood gets dangerous. Every year, there are food safety and environmental pollution accidents.'' 
 Environmental problems plaguing seafood would appear to be a bad omen for the industry. But with fish stocks in the oceans steadily declining and global demand for seafood soaring, farmed seafood, or aquaculture, is the future. And no country does more of it than China, which produced about 115 billion pounds of seafood last year. 
 China produces about 70 percent of the farmed fish in the world, harvested at thousands of giant factory-style farms that extend along the entire eastern seaboard of the country. Farmers mass-produce seafood just offshore, but mostly on land, and in lakes, ponds, rivers and reservoirs, or in huge rectangular fish ponds dug into the earth. 
 ''They'll be a major supplier not just to the U.S., but to the world,'' said Richard Stavis, the chairman of Stavis Seafoods, an American company that imports Chinese catfish, tilapia and frog legs. 
 China began emerging as a seafood power in the 1990s as rapid economic growth became the top priority in the country. But environmental experts say that headlong pursuit of higher gross domestic product has devastated Chinese water quality and endangered the country's food supply. In Guangdong Province in southern China, fish contaminated with toxic chemicals like DDT are already creating health problems. 
 ''There are heavy metals, mercury and flame retardants in fish samples we've tested,'' said Ming Hung Wong, a professor of biology at Hong Kong Baptist University. ''We've got to stop the pollutants entering the food system.'' 
 More than half of the rivers in China are too polluted to serve as a source of drinking water. The biggest lakes in the country regularly succumb to harmful algal blooms. Seafood producers are part of the problem, environmental experts say. Enormous aquaculture farms concentrate fish waste, pesticides and veterinary drugs in their ponds and discharge the contaminated water into rivers, streams and coastal areas, often with no treatment. 
 ''Water is the biggest problem in China,'' said Peter Leedham, the business manager at Sino Analytica, an independent food safety testing firm that works with companies that buy from China. ''But my feeling is China will deal with it, because it has to. It just won't be a quick process.'' 
 Fishing for Prosperity
 Fuqing is called qiaoxiang, or home, for those who go overseas, because for decades this port city on the East China Sea is where thousands of people fled as stowaways. 
 In the 1980s, some emigrants began sending home money and ideas at just about the time that investors were arriving from Japan and Taiwan, promising to help the country build fish farms. 
 ''Aquaculture was popular in Japan, so I saw the future,'' said Wang Weifu, a longtime eel producer. 
 Thousands of peasants who had struggled to earn a living harvesting rice and potatoes began carving up huge plots, digging rectangular pits and filling them with water to create fish ponds. Other parts of the country followed, creating fish farms alongside roads, near rivers and streams and in big lakes, ponds and reservoirs. 
 Today, the mighty Yangtze River is lined with fish farms. Historic Lake Tai is stocked with crab pens. Near Ningde, 90 miles north of here, thousands of people live in a huge bay area, where they float on large wooden rafts, feeding and harvesting caged fish, like the yellow croaker. 
 The government hoped the building boom would lift millions out of poverty. And it did. There are now more than 4.5 million fish farmers in China, according to the Fishery Bureau. 
 Lin Bingui, 50, is one of them, a former bricklayer with an easy smile who now manages 20 enormous shrimp and eel ponds in western Fuqing, on reclaimed land with access to a narrow strait of seawater. 
 ''This doesn't take a lot of technology,'' he said while walking into an indoor pond, where he raises baby eels. ''You just learn it as you go along.'' 
 The boom did more than create jobs. It made China the only country that produced more seafood from fish farms than from the sea. It also helped feed an increasingly prosperous population, a longstanding challenge in China. 
 Many growers here struck it rich as well, people like Lin Sunbao, whose 25-year-old son is now studying at Cambridge University in England. ''My best years were 1992, '93, '94,'' he said. ''I only had one aqua farm, and I earned over $500,000 a year.'' 
 As early as the mid-1990s, though, serious environmental problems began to emerge after electronics and textile manufacturing plants moved into central Fuqing. Water shortages appeared in the southeastern part of the city, and some fish farmers say their water turned black. 
 Government records document the environmental ills in the region. The nearby Dongzhang Reservoir, a water source for agriculture and more than 700,000 people, was recently rated level 5, near the bottom of the government scale, unfit for fish farming, swimming or even contact with the human body. 
 The Long River, the major waterway in Fuqing, has been degraded by waste dumped by paper factories and slaughterhouses. The government this year rated large sections of the river below level 5, or so highly polluted that it is unfit for any use. And nearby coastal waters which are also heavily fish farmed are polluted with oil, lead, mercury and copper, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration in China. 
 As water quality in Fuqing declined, farmers who often filled their ponds with too much seafood tried to fight off disease and calm stressed fish with an array of powerful, and often illegal, antibiotics and pesticides. 
 Eel producers, for example, often used nitrofuran to kill bacteria. But that antibiotic has been banned for use in animal husbandry in the United States, Europe, Japan, and even China, because it has caused cancer in laboratory rats. 
 Importers of Chinese seafood quickly caught on. In recent years, eel shipments to Europe, Japan and the United States have been turned back or destroyed because of residues of banned veterinary drugs. Eel shipments to Japan have dropped 50 percent through August of this year, dealing a heavy blow in Fuqing. 
 Chinese farmers say they have stopped using the banned medicines, and have suffered a 30 percent decline in survival rates of their fish and other seafood. 
 ''Before 2005, we did use drugs blindly. They were very effective in fighting disease,'' said Wang Weifu, chairman of a local eel association, noting that drug residues might still be in the water. ''But now we don't dare because of the regulations.'' 
 Some growers have lashed out at Japan, arguing that it keeps raising the drug residue standard simply to protect its own eel farms against competition. But growers here say buyers from Japan will eventually be forced to purchase eels from China. 
 ''Our market will expand in Russia and Southeast Asia, and the E.U.,'' Mr. Wang said. ''Also, we see big prospects in the Chinese market. In five or six years, as we transfer our export destinations, Japan will be begging us.'' 
 Retreating From the Coast
 The drive about 175 miles west of Fuqing leads into the lush subtropical mountains of Fujian Province, where some of China's richest bamboo and timber reserves can be found. There, near the city of Sanming, Fuqing eel producers have built a collection of aquaculture farms, huge cement tubs wedged into the mountainside, covered by black tarps and stocked with millions of eels. 
 ''This costs a lot more up here, but we had to do it,'' said Zheng Qiuzhen, a longtime Fuqing eel producer who now operates near Sanming. ''We had to do something about the water problems.'' 
 In much of the country, seafood growers are leaving crowded coastal areas for less developed regions, where the land is cheaper and there is cleaner water. But they say the overall cost of doing business so far from the coast is higher, given the expense of shipping the fish in oxygenated trucks to the processing plant in Fuqing and their forswearing illegal drugs, which lowers survival rates and increases the growth period of most fish to five years from three years. 
 ''You can't find many places as beautiful as this, covered by trees and bamboo,'' said Lin Sunbao, who moved from Fuqing to Sanming. ''We use water from mountain streams. And because our water is better, it's harder to get disease.'' 
 This is one of the solutions to the water crisis in China: to seek out virgin territory and essentially start the cycle all over again. And that worries scientists, who say aquaculture in China is not just a victim of water pollution but a culprit with a severe environmental legacy. 
 Industrial fish farming has destroyed mangrove forests in Thailand, Vietnam and China, heavily polluted waterways and radically altered the ecological balance of coastal areas, mostly through the discharge of wastewater. Aquaculture waste contains fish feces, rotting fish feed and residues of pesticides and veterinary drugs as well as other pollutants that were already mixed into the poor quality water supplied to farmers. 
 Besides algal blooms, some of the biggest lakes in China, like Lake Tai, are suffering from eutrophication nutrient bombs, brought on partly by aquaculture, that can kill fish by depleting the water's oxygen. The government is forcing aquaculture out of these lakes, and also away from the Long River in Fuqing. 
 Places like Sanming may not be pristine for long. Heavy industry is moving in, lured by mineral riches and incentives from local governments, which are pushing for development. 
 And Sanming already has 72 giant eel farms, producing 5,000 tons of seafood a year. Those farms together use about 280 million gallons of water a day and then discharge the wastewater the following day, back into the Sanming environs. 
 There are efforts to operate aquaculture in a sustainable way. In Norway, for instance, salmon producers use sophisticated technology, including underwater cameras, to monitor water quality and how much fish feed is actually consumed. But nothing like this is being done in China, and specialists like Li Sifa of Shanghai Fisheries University insist that Chinese regulations are too lax and that enforcement efforts are often feeble or nonexistent. 
 The government has stepped up its inspections of fish farms and seafood processing plants here, alerting workers of the dangers and consequences of using illegal drugs. But the drugs have remained a problem, partly because of poor water quality. 
 A possible solution to the water woes is to move aquaculture well out to sea, specialists say, with new technology that allows for deepwater fish cages served by automatic feeding machines. 
 The United States is already considering such a plan, partly as a way to make it less dependent on imports, which now fill 80 percent of its seafood needs. China is also considering adopting what is now being called ''open ocean'' aquaculture. 
 Currently, China's coastal fish farms face many of the same challenges as those on land. Waters there are heavily polluted by oil, lead, mercury, copper and other harsh substances. Veterinary drugs dropped in shoreline waters may easily spread to neighboring aquaculture farms and affect species outside the cages, and while coastal waters are less polluted than those on land, aquaculture farms, with their intensive production cycles, are prone to be polluters. 
 Still, said An Taicheng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: ''China has to go to the sea because it's getting harder and harder to find clean water. Every year there are seafood safety problems. One day, no one will dare to eat fish from dirty water, and what will farmers do?''

HEADLINE: Getting an Early Start On Drawing the Future

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Yorktown Heights, N. Y.
 ON a recent morning here, teams of elementary school students participating in a Ford competition were putting the finishing touches on their environmentally friendly car designs. 
 ''In 100 years, oil will be gone,'' said Andrew Friedman, 11, one of the creators of the Electric, a car designed to run on electricity and solar power. 
 His teammate, Luke Shkreli, 10, added, ''This won't make you sick like the stuff that comes out of the back of the car.''
 Another team had a different approach. Their car, the ENVI, would have four power sources: wind, solar and hydrogen fuel cell, with electricity as a backup. ''They all work together'' charging three batteries, said Swarnav Pujari, 11, sounding more like a Ph.D. candidate than a fifth grader as he explained how wind would come in through the front grille, hit a turbine that moved a shaft to make energy that would go to a generator. 
 One design, the Phoenix, had an interior made of recyclable materials; another, the Ultimate, had an exterior that changed colors at night, replacing the need for headlights, and a navigation system that drove the car for you, sensing accidents before they happened.
 The innovations pushed the students' limits of creativity, research and teamwork, and that's exactly what Charles S. Brooks, a special education teacher at Brookside Elementary School here, had in mind when he helped to create the event.
 ''More often than not, kids thrive in the art world,'' he said.
 Mr. Brooks came up with the idea after reading an article in The New York Times last year that profiled Ian and Moray Callum, brothers who grew up in Scotland dreaming about and drawing cars. They eventually became designers for Jaguar and Mazda, among other companies.
 Mr. Brooks said he was so inspired by the article that he and two colleagues (Karen Richards, an art teacher, and Beth Crescimanno, a teacher for gifted and talented students) decided to develop a design project incorporating learning strategies for different types of students.
 Mr. Brooks pitched the idea to Ford, which owns both Mazda and Jaguar, in August, and Moray Callum, design director for cars for Ford North America, soon called ''saying they were in,'' Mr. Brooks recalled. 
 ''I wanted to be a car designer because I just wanted to draw cool cars,'' said Mr. Callum, speaking from Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. But these youngsters, he said, ''are a lot deeper,'' adding, ''The kids are at an age when they are very creative and not overburdened by engineering and business.'' Adults, he said, are often concerned primarily with economics, but ''kids have an honesty and freshness -- they want to save the earth.''
 The fourth- and fifth-grade students who wanted to participate were asked to write essays on why they wanted to design environmentally friendly cars. All of the 50 students who applied were chosen and the 48 who decided to participate were organized into 11 teams. 
 Jeff Nield, another Ford designer, visited the Westchester County school in October to brief students on the automobile industry. 
 ''Their attention span was better than older age groups,'' Mr. Nield said in an interview from Dearborn. ''They asked some pretty interesting questions,'' such as what vehicles he was working on that were environmentally friendly and what Ford was doing to reduce dependence on oil.
 He showed the students a video on concept cars and demonstrated drawing and design basics, explaining that cars have faces, characters, expressions and personalities, like people. Some are playful, represented by a round shape.
 Mr. Brooks said that the developmentally disabled students brought their own strengths to the program because many of them were talented artists and looked at things in different ways.
 Mrs. Crescimanno, the gifted and talented teacher, said she was surprised by the strong role some students took.
 ''We think we know, but when they get together, different leaders emerged,'' she said. Some teams had a hard time negotiating, which presented challenges. ''It's the learning process more than the product,'' she said.
 Jason Horowitz, father of the twins Jesse and Dylan, 11, said it was important that his sons, who were on the Electric team, worked things out on their own with their teammates. But, once, he suggested gently that they think through the solar energy concept.
 ''It's really not a lot of fun to run out of power at night when the sun is down,'' he told them. He said he encouraged them to ''make sure the logic was consistent.''
 Mr. Brooks said a business-education collaboration helped students learn about the real world, much like an apprenticeship.
 Mr. Callum agreed.
 ''I grew up in Scotland,'' he said. ''No one knew what to do with me.'' This project, he said, shows the students that car design is ''an exciting and valid career.''
 On the evening of Nov. 29, the students presented their designs to an audience of families, classmates and teachers. Mr. Callum, Mr. Nield and two representatives from the local Ford dealership were the judges.
 Luka Yancopoulos, 9, explained the purpose of jazzy graphics on the side of the Veezer. ''The cool stripes aren't only fashionable, they keep small animals and deer and stuff away from your car -- they don't like the smell,'' he said.
 Many cars were loaded with technology -- iPod docks, wireless Internet access and the ability to download music while driving. One team sensitive to older people included an audio cassette player. There were also cars with Sony PlayStations and a three-foot television screen. One car had five TVs.
 ''It's a whole new high-tech experience never seen before'' said Robert Kramer, 10, who told the audience that the Phoenix would have massage chairs, but only for the passengers, ''so drivers don't get distracted.''
 One car even had a homework table. Another had an ice-cream cooler and a milk warmer for tea and coffee.
 At the end of the evening, Mr. Callum loaded up his car to take the entries to Dearborn for further review. Five days later, the three winning teams were announced.
 The Ultimate was cited for outstanding teamwork, which included team T-shirts. The car was also praised for having a strong green message and accident-prevention technology. The ENVI stood out for its solar panels, backup battery, recyclable materials and its safer seat belts. The H20 F.U.V. (Ford utility vehicle), powered by hydrogen, won for its strong research with a great green message, its three-dimensional clay model based on the drawing and the professional presentation.
 The winners will be invited to the New York auto show next March to tour Ford's stand, see new vehicles and talk to professional designers.
 ''We all have the 'what ifs' in our lives,'' Mr. Brooks said. But with these kids, ''There's a good chance that these are the cars they might be driving.''

HEADLINE: The Facts Say No

BYLINE: By MARCELLE CHAUVET and KEVIN HASSETT

 BODY:
EVER since the pioneering work ''Measuring Business Cycles'' by Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns was published in 1946, the question of whether the United States economy is in a recession has been answered with opinions. 
 But as James Hamilton, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, has demonstrated, simple statistical models exist that can take economic data and deliver an indication of the current state of the economy. These models do not render an opinion but rather provide a factual answer to the question.
 An extension of Mr. Hamilton's model developed by one of us (Ms. Chauvet) relies on several monthly indicators and outputs to deliver a probability that the economy is in a recession in a given month. The model's prediction is analogous to a weather forecast. If it says that the chances of rain are 80 percent, then you pack an umbrella. If the model says the probability of recession is 80 percent, then you ready your policy action. 
 If an economist had relied on this model over the past 60 years and declared that we were in a recession if the probability of one was greater than 50 percent for two months in a row, that economist would have correctly called every postwar recession without ever giving a false signal. 
 The National Bureau of Economic Research's recession dates agree with those made by the model. But the model estimates probabilities in real time as the data arrive. The bureau has made pronouncements that the economy entered a recession even after the recession was already over. 
 According to the model, the probability that the American economy was in a recession in October, the last month for which we have data, was only 16.5 percent. This is high enough to make us nervous about the future, but it is low enough that we can be fairly sure that if a recession is going to be visible in the data, it did not begin until November at the earliest.
 Given the many uncertainties surrounding the implosion of the housing sector, it is certainly possible that the economy is headed for dark times. Economists will inevitably have differing opinions about that. But as to the factual question of whether we are in a recession given the data in hand, the unambiguous answer is no.
 -- Marcelle Chauvet, a professor of economics at the University of California, Riverside, and Kevin Hassett, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. They are the co-authors, with James Hamilton, of the forthcoming ''Calling the Business Cycle.''

HEADLINE: The Heart of Teardown Country

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

 BODY:
HAVE you ever lived near a teardown in progress? Has it ever been your daily fate to deal with noise, smells, dirt and construction crews right next door -- only to behold, after endless months, a space-hogging ''mansionization'' in place of the petite Cape Cod you used to find so sweet? 
 If not, your turn may come sooner than you think. Despite the overall problems troubling the nation's real estate market, the New York metropolitan region has now surpassed Chicago, the former record holder, to become the teardown capital of the United States, according to a recent report by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has been tracking the phenomenon since 2002.
 Financially speaking, there are far worse fates for a homeowner than to be the neighbor of a ''bash and build.'' Love them or hate them, teardowns generally bolster the resale prices of their neighbors. Although a lot of people do object initially, Mary Ann Laurita, a Realtor at William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty in Westport, Conn., said that that's only until they decide to put their own homes on the market. 
 ''They come to like teardowns when their own house is up for sale,'' she said, ''because rebuilds bring the price of their home up.'' 
 Therein lies the reason that the teardown market has proved somewhat immune in the current climate: while they represent only a small part of new home sales, that part is at the higher end of the scale. 
 ''Teardowns are doing a little better than overall markets, because most teardowns are located in highly desirable neighborhoods that command a premium price and are somewhat easier to sell,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors in Washington. 
 According to the National Trust estimates, New Jersey leads the pack in the New York metropolitan area, with 75 municipalities recording a significant number of teardowns. Adrian Fine, director of the trust's Northeast field office, in Philadelphia, said that the trust relies largely on local news reports for its figures. 
 In New York State, 51 areas had a large number of teardowns, many of them urban neighborhoods like Fieldston and Riverdale in the Bronx; Bay Ridge, Gravesend and Park Slope in Brooklyn; Astoria, Bayside, Flushing and 15 other parts of Queens; and Staten Island.
 The reason for the region's newfound pre-eminence in this niche, Mr. Fine explained, is that it has ''a high concentration of communities with great amenities that are close to Manhattan, with high enough property values that it makes sense for teardowns to occur.''
 Teardowns undertaken by individuals have remained strong, said Brian Hickey, the founder and president of teardowns.com, an Internet real estate company begun in 2001 that focuses on homes ripe for demolition. He cited a 19 percent jump in registrations for new buyers at the site in the last year.
 On the other hand, he said, speculative rebuilding, in general, appears to have softened to some extent. But several pockets of extreme affluence seem impervious to any and all negative trends. For instance, speculators in Greenwich, Conn.; Bedford in Westchester County, N.Y.; and Old Westbury on Long Island are just as involved in the process as they've ever been.
 ''The Greenwich teardown market is very, very hot right now, because there are no vacant lots anymore,'' said Dominick DeVito, a Greenwich builder who has done six teardown projects in the last few years alone. He characterized Greenwich as the ''epicenter of the epicenter'' of teardowns. 
 ''If you want a nice lot in Greenwich,'' he added, ''you have to do a teardown.'' 
 Last year, through teardowns.com, Mr. DeVito bought a 2,200-square-foot house, built in 1947 on two acres in Greenwich for nearly $1.8 million. The owner, Gandhi Ireifej, had paid $550,000 for the house in 1999 and had planned to demolish it and rebuild on his own. But he changed his mind, daunted by the cost and effort involved. 
 ''To get the most value out of the lot,'' Mr. Ireifej said, ''we decided to take the money and run, and let builders do it.'' (Mr. Ireifej moved to a larger house, also in Greenwich, that he plans to expand, but he is also hoping to buy another teardown as an investment.) 
 Mr. DeVito has nearly finished building an 8,800-square-foot replacement house on the site. It has five bedrooms, five full baths, two half baths and a four-car garage. Mr. DeVito plans to put it on the market in late December for $5.9 million, and he expects to sell it within 30 days.
 A quick sale at that price ''is not too far off the mark,'' said Betsy Campbell, a Realtor at Sotheby's International Realty in Greenwich, who does not know Mr. DeVito and has not seen his new house. ''The market in Greenwich is definitely up, and it's driven by new construction,'' she said. Close to 40 percent of her sales are either teardowns or rebuilds, she added.
 When it comes to teardowns in nearby Bedford, ''property is so valuable and so expensive that it's not cost-effective to build anything other than high-end properties,'' said Joan Keating, a broker there with Prudential Holmes & Kennedy. 
 Teardowns have become so common in the area that Ms. Keating often advertises an older house simply as ''a gorgeous site,'' and she lists most such properties twice, both ''as land and as a residential home,'' she said. In addition, to persuade buyers to do their own teardown, she often engages an architect to draw up plans to show what a new house might look like on the property.
 Nina Naqvi, a Realtor at Century 21 in Old Westbury, said most brokers in high-end areas don't use the term ''teardown'' anymore. ''It's not a proper selling term,'' she said. ''We call it a 'rebuild' or 'remodel.' There are a lot of homes on the market like that, but we list it as 'a lot available,' and we say, 'You can build your dream home on this lot.'''
 These properties are selling well, she said, though prices have come down slightly.
 Caroline Shepherd, an associate broker at Houlihan Lawrence, finds much the same situation in Bedford. ''Teardowns have enormous potential,'' she said, ''and people are standing in line for good land with endless possibilities.'' The local real estate market has been ''surprisingly good,'' she added, and nearly a third of her business this year has included some kind of teardown or rebuild.
 The same is true in Old Westbury, said Michael Berman, a vice president of Stewart Senter Inc., a Hempstead construction company that specializes in houses in the $2-million-to-$10-million range. During the last year, he said, the company has completed seven teardowns and rebuilds, all of them ranging from 7,000 to 12,000 square feet.
 Although ''it's not the go-go years of a few years ago,'' Mr. Berman said, ''we're still very busy.'' 
 Speculative rebuilders in other parts of the region tell a slightly less rosy story. 
 Three years ago, Jonathan Nissman bought a three-bedroom house on two acres in Pound Ridge, N.Y., for $620,000. He tore down the 1960s-era ranch and built a 4,000-square-foot four-bedroom with four and a half baths and a three-car garage.
 He put the new house on the market in February 2006 but has yet to sell it, although he recently dropped the price from $1.65 million to $1.35 million. 
 ''We'd like to move this house,'' he said, adding that he has no plans to do another teardown project. 
 It is the size of the profit margins required by speculators that has caused some to opt out, said Daniel McMillen, a professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has conducted a financial analysis of teardowns in the Chicago area. Builders like to sell for two or three times the original price, he said, so ''the slowdown in the housing market will slow teardowns being done on speculation.'' 
 But regardless of how quickly a teardown project goes or how much money the rebuild sells for, the neighbors always take notice. Some will probably be up in arms about a spate of demolitions destroying the character of their community; others will be delighted at the prospects that the new construction will increase their own property values.
 After watching the razing of several older houses in the hamlet of Oyster Bay, on Long Island, irate residents formed a group they called Save the Jewel by the Bay. It was instrumental in instituting an 18-month moratorium on both demolitions and new construction, which ended in June, said Kathryn Prinz, a founder. Now anyone planning to demolish a house built more than 50 years ago must appear before a review board to get permission.
 Gordon F. Joseloff, the founder of a Connecticut online newspaper called westportnow.com, riled residents two years ago when he instituted a feature called Teardown of the Day. It includes a photograph of a property newly proposed for demolition, as well as the address, the listing details and the sale price.
 Mr. Joseloff, who has since been elected Westport's first selectman (the equivalent of mayor), believes that his site's exposure of teardown properties was what persuaded the town's Planning and Zoning Commission to impose a 90-day waiting period on such projects. In addition, the town has hired a land-use consulting firm to help develop laws to regulate the size of new houses. 
 A common reason for resisting teardowns in many municipalities, Ms. Keating said, citing demolitions in the Bedford area as a case in point, is that neighbors ''assume there is historical value to the building being taken down, but 90 percent of the time, there isn't.'' 
 But neighbors can be equally vociferous in their support of teardowns. Mr. Joseloff says that he has fielded angry calls from Westport residents who accuse him of ''messing with their nest egg'' by imposing size restrictions that will ultimately damage their ability to reap a substantial profit from the sale of their homes. 
 Frank J. Mottola Jr., the Building Department's director and the zoning officer for the Borough of Tenafly, N.J., said, ''Neighborhood groups spring up only when we attempt to curtail the use of land in their area.'' He receives several teardown applications each month, he said, and almost every one is for a much larger home. 
 ''Our Planning Board grappled with this, to put a limit on the new construction so it doesn't appear out of scale for the neighborhood,'' he explained. But, he added, ''people look at their home as more of an investment than they used to, and they don't want their development rights curtailed.''
 Teardown sales have been increasing in Tenafly during the last few years, and are likely to persist. ''There's no more land being produced in Tenafly,'' said Marlyn Friedberg, an owner and broker at Friedberg Properties, which has offices in Tenafly and five other locations. About half of her sales are now teardowns, she said, and such houses are sold ''in 'as is' condition, or 'as value in the land.'''
 Yet a certain ambivalence remains, no matter where the teardowns are occurring. As Ms. Laurita, the Westport broker, put it, ''Buyers like charm, but charm is not so easy to live with.''

HEADLINE: Not if Exports Save Us

BYLINE: By JASON FURMAN

 BODY:
LOOKING only at standard macroeconomic statistics, you would think the economy was in very good shape. Gross domestic product has grown at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the last six months, well above the historical average. The price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose at a 1.6 percent annual rate over the same period, well below the historical average. 
 But these statistics are like looking through a rearview mirror. The latest G.D.P. statistics go only through the end of September. They do not tell us where the economy is today, let alone where it is heading.
 Much of what we see outside the windshield, like falling house prices, rising foreclosures, financial turmoil and oil prices near an inflation-adjusted record, are more timely and troubling. But they shed light on only a small fraction of what goes into producing G.D.P. That millions of families are suffering is undeniable and requires a robust policy response. But whether economic growth is turning negative, pushing the economy into a recession that would hurt tens of millions more, remains unclear.
 It is difficult to discern whether a recession is inevitable because we are in the midst of a new type of financial crisis, one for which history has no map. When banks sustain large losses, like the savings and loan association crisis in the 1980s or the collapse of the Japanese bubble in the 1990s, the result is a contraction in credit, a slowdown in consumption and investment, and a recession. 
 But in the current turmoil, the banking sector (which started out with very healthy capital balances) seems to be incurring losses that, while large, appear to be far lower than those in previous crises. The losses are spread across a range of poorly understood entities and investors, such as hedge and pension funds, around the globe. It is far from inevitable that this bad financial news, the equivalent to the loss in assets seen in a typical bearish day on Wall Street, will translate into a sustained reduction in economic activity.
 The one piece of good news, contrary to public perception, is the falling dollar. It is increasing exports and slowing imports, thus helping to prop up the American economy. Net exports added 1.4 percentage points to economic growth over the past six months, more than making up for the 0.7 percentage point subtracted by the decline in residential construction. Exports should continue to grow over the coming year.
 Even if the economy avoids a recession, the road ahead will be rocky. A slowing economy compounds the problems facing workers, who did not receive inflation-adjusted wage gains even in the past few years of strong G.D.P. growth. As our focus necessarily shifts to the short-run task of averting a recession, we should not forget the need for the progressive tax policies and robust social insurance that are needed to help everyone share in the gains of a strong economy.
 -- Jason Furman, a special assistant to the president for economic policy from 1999 to 2000 and the director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.

HEADLINE: In Minneapolis, A Block Transformed

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: Minneapolis 

 BODY:
 THE Phillips neighborhood, just south of downtown here, was riddled with vacant and run-down properties 15 years ago. It was an area where the drug trade was rampant. 
 One by one, the drug houses and other derelict properties were bought, renovated and rented or sold to local residents -- mostly minority residents and immigrants -- at affordable prices by the Hope Community, a nonprofit neighborhood and housing organization. The group had acquired the homes over the years, in some cases from the city, for as little as $1. 
 Hope Community started out in 1977, in a little red house, as a Dorothy Day homeless shelter for women and children. The organization has since overseen the rehabilitation of 10 houses and is behind the development of buildings with 126 affordable-housing units, a playground and a community center. 
 Two more mixed-income projects are under way. One of them, the Wellstone, a mixed-use building with 49 rental apartments and 6,000 square feet of commercial retail space, broke ground in October. An as-yet-unnamed building across the street will break ground early next year. Rental units at the Wellstone will range in size from studios to three-bedrooms, and 25 percent of the units will be leased at market rate. 
 Together, the buildings will add 300 units of mixed-income housing, from condominiums to be sold at market rate to small studios reserved for the formerly homeless.
 ''From the beginning, we approached neighborhood revitalization as more than creating affordable housing,'' said Mary Keefe, the executive director of Hope Community, which also provides adult education classes and tutoring for children. ''We are not social workers or service providers -- we are catalysts.'' 
 By 2009, Hope Community housing will occupy all four corners of the Portland-Franklin intersection, a thoroughfare for people commuting from downtown to wealthier neighborhoods farther south. 
 As luxury condos have been built north of the Phillips area closer to downtown, fears of encroaching gentrification prompted the organization to take a more aggressive approach to stabilizing the neighborhood. 
 ''In order to really change the community,'' Ms. Keefe said, ''we realized there had to be critical mass.'' By building mixed-income housing, Ms. Keefe said, Hope Community is trying to address the inevitable changes on the way and to assist the population that is already there. 
 One person who has benefited from the organization's neighborhood programs and affordable housing is Anthony Satchel Sr. He learned about Hope's apartments after taking a computer class at the community center. He has since rented an apartment in one of Hope Community's affordable-housing units, paying $700 a month for his one-bedroom. He also tutors children who come to the community center and helps to recruit other local residents to volunteer as well. 
 ''I found out,'' Mr. Satchel, 56, said, that tutoring ''calls for a lot of patience. The kids, they call me 'The Enforcer.''' 
 Having lots of activity in and around Hope Community's buildings helps to improve the neighborhood's safety. For a single mother like Valerie Morris, 52, whose daughter, Alexis, is 15, a safe and drug-free environment is critical. 
 Ms. Morris has lived in a housing unit operated by Hope Community since 2003, where she pays $664 a month for a one-bedroom. After being laid off recently from her part-time job, she is worried about not being able to pay her rent (which is based on income levels). ''They're working with me on the rent since I got laid off,'' she said. ''And I don't have to worry about my daughter coming home when I'm not here.'' 
 An unintended result of creating affordable housing and economic development has been a lower rate of foreclosure. As the subprime mortgage crisis has roiled other low-income neighborhoods across the country, the number of foreclosures in the Phillips neighborhood is lower than in wealthier sections of Minneapolis, according to the Minneapolis Community Planning and Economic Development Department. 
 The Phillips neighborhood has 118 foreclosures, the department said, while the Powderhorn area, just south of Phillips, which has only slightly higher property values, has 309 foreclosures. 
 ''Where there has been the most investment, including affordable rental housing built by Hope Community, there are the least foreclosures,'' said Mike Christenson, the department's director. 
 Lower foreclosure rates could help keep crime rates down. According to a study by Dan Immergluck, an associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Geoff Smith, research director at the Woodstock Institute, when the foreclosure rate increases one percentage point, neighborhood violent crime rises 2.33 percent.
 Constructing affordable housing, however, is not easy. The financing is complex and can take a long time to come to fruition, according to John W. Cuningham, the founder of Cuningham Architects, which designed Hope. The Wellstone is being built in partnership with Aeon, another affordable housing development agency, which has nine major donors, including local and state government agencies, foundations and private donors.
 ''Every funding source puts them through flaming hoops,'' Mr. Cuningham said. ''It's just excruciating. From the time we start designing to the time it's built, it takes five years or longer.'' 
 But the effort to acquire financing for more affordable housing has been worthwhile for people like Patrick J. Bayle. A recovering drug addict who was once homeless, Mr. Bayle, 48, now works for the Salvation Army mentoring others in recovery. Classes at the Hope Community helped him earn his general education diploma, and now he is attending college to complete a degree in social work. Without his $575-a-month studio apartment, Mr. Bayle said, he would have had to work two jobs to pay rent. 
 ''I don't make much money right now,'' Mr. Bayle said. ''I'm going to college to increase my earning potential,'' he added, hoping that eventually he will be able to afford to buy a home of his own. 
 Minnesota has achieved the highest homeownership rate -- 76.3 percent -- in the country, in large part because of its policy in encouraging affordable housing, according to Timothy E. Marx, the commissioner of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency. His agency has invested $1.6 billion over two years in affordable housing statewide, including the Hope Community.
 ''We shape our buildings and they shape us,'' Mr. Marx said, paraphrasing Churchill's remarks on the restoration of the House of Commons after World War II. ''What is really noteworthy about Hope Community is the fact that it's mixed income,'' he added, noting that the mix of market rate and affordable housing builds ''quality of life.''

HEADLINE: Bet the House on It

BYLINE: By LAURA TYSON

 BODY:
THE economy faces a vicious downward spiral of foreclosures, declining property values and mounting losses on mortgage-backed securities and related financial assets. 
 The resetting of interest rates on more than 2 million subprime loans will prompt a large number of foreclosures, perhaps a million a year in both 2008 and 2009. These huge waves of foreclosures will depress the price of residential real estate still further. Plummeting real estate values and escalating foreclosures will cause further losses on mortgage-related securities and will further burden American consumers already dealing with higher energy prices and substantial debt. 
 Given the dampening effects of these developments on both consumption and investment spending, it is increasingly likely that the economy will slip into recession next year. The Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates and to experiment with new ways to pump liquidity into the financial system. 
 The Bush administration's plan for a voluntary freeze by lenders on interest-rate resets for a small fraction of subprime loans has been judged inadequate by the financial markets. Bolder measures -- a temporary moratorium on foreclosures on subprime owner-occupied homes, a freeze on interest rate resets for subprime adjustable rate mortgages, and federal funds to help at-risk borrowers to stay in their homes and at-risk communities to reduce foreclosures -- are required to contain the potential damage to the overall economy from the crisis in the housing and mortgage markets. 
 -- Laura Tyson, a professor of business and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1993 to 1995.

HEADLINE: AS CONCERNS RISE, U.S. IS REVIEWING AFGHAN MISSION

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Deeply concerned about the prospect of failure in Afghanistan, the Bush administration and NATO have begun three top-to-bottom reviews of the entire mission, from security and counterterrorism to political consolidation and economic development, according to American and alliance officials. 
 The reviews are an acknowledgment of the need for greater coordination in fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, halting the rising opium production and trafficking that finances the insurgency and helping the Kabul government extend its legitimacy and control. 
 Taken together, these efforts reflect a growing apprehension that one of the administration's most important legacies -- the routing of Taliban and Qaeda forces in Afghanistan after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 -- may slip away, according to senior administration officials. 
 Unlike the administration's sweeping review of Iraq policy a year ago, which was announced with great fanfare and ultimately resulted in a large increase in troops, the American reviews of the Afghan strategy have not been announced and are not expected to result in a similar infusion of combat forces, mostly because there are no American troops readily available. 
 The administration is now committed to finding an international coordinator, described as a ''super envoy,'' to synchronize the full range of efforts in Afghanistan, and to continue pressing for more NATO troops to fight an insurgency that made this the most violent year since the Taliban and Al Qaeda were routed in December 2001. 
 ''We are looking for ways to gain greater strategic coherence,'' said a senior administration official involved in the review process.
 One assessment is being conducted within the United States military. Adm. William J. Fallon, commander of American forces in the Middle East, has ordered a full review of the mission, including the covert hunt for Taliban and Qaeda leaders. 
 ''It's an assessment of our current strategy and how we are doing,'' said a senior military officer. ''It's looking at whether we've done enough or need to do more in terms of expanding governance and economic development, as well as wrestling with the difficult security issues that we have been dealing with in Afghanistan.'' 
 Senior State Department officials also said that R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, was coordinating another internal assessment of diplomatic efforts and economic aid -- the sorts of ''soft power'' assistance beyond combat force that officials agree are required for success. 
 A third review, one that has previously been part of the public discussion, involves the strategy of NATO, which last year assumed control of the security operation in Afghanistan and has since been criticized by American officials and lawmakers for not being aggressive enough. 
 At an alliance meeting in Scotland on Friday, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates successfully gained a commitment from NATO to produce what senior Pentagon officials called an ''integrated plan'' for Afghanistan.
 ''The intent is to get people to look beyond 2008 and realize this is a longer-term endeavor,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, who was with Mr. Gates in Scotland. He said the plan would ''start off by acknowledging the success we're having in terms of reconstruction and education and governance and so forth, but it also will state where we want to be in three to five years, and how we get there.'' 
 The NATO assessment is to be completed for a meeting of alliance heads of state in Bucharest, Romania, next spring. The other reviews are due early next year. 
 Publicly, administration officials have expressed optimism that the war in Afghanistan can be won, but Mr. Gates told Congress this week that his optimism was ''tempered by caution.'' 
 In recent months, though, Mr. Bush's senior advisers have expressed a growing unease.
 While there is a sense that this year's troop buildup in Iraq has turned around a dire situation, the effort in Afghanistan has begun to drift, at best, officials said. That prompted Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, to oversee internal deliberations that resulted in the push for the new reviews.
 The NATO-led security assistance mission in Afghanistan has about 40,000 troops; of those, 14,000 are American. Separately, the United States military has 12,000 other troops in Afghanistan conducting specialized counterterrorism missions.
 Mr. Gates has declined to name specific allies that have not fulfilled pledges for combat troops, security trainers and helicopters for Afghanistan, or whose governments have placed restrictions on their combat forces. But he has noted that Britain, Canada and Australia had met their commitments and carry their full combat load.
 Some members of Congress have not been so diplomatic.
 ''The Germans, the Spanish, the Italians don't send any troops to the south except for 250 troops by Germany,'' said Representative Joe Sestak, Democrat of Pennsylvania. A retired three-star admiral who worked on the staff of the National Security Council in the 1990s, Mr. Sestak complained that some allies ''refuse to do combat ops at night and some don't fly when the first snowflake falls.''
 As part of the NATO review, alliance diplomats and military officers are closely watching the actions of Britain, which may be able to commit additional troops to Afghanistan as it reduces its deployments in Iraq.
 To that end, Britain has opened its own ''strategic review'' of the Afghan mission, especially in the turbulent southern provinces, which will shape the alliance's assessment, according to a senior diplomat of a NATO nation.
 ''Essentially what's driving it is that a year ago, we were regarding Afghanistan as an outstanding success -- we established democracy, we were in control of many parts of the country,'' the NATO diplomat said. ''Now we have significant issues with certain areas producing opium and the Taliban coming back in certain parts of the country, as well.''
 The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, was more direct in assessing possible failure in Afghanistan.
 ''I have a real concern that given our preoccupation in Iraq, we've not devoted sufficient troops and funding to Afghanistan to ensure success in that mission,'' Mr. Skelton said. ''Afghanistan has been the forgotten war.''
 Strained by commitments in Iraq, the American military has few troops available to expand its forces in Afghanistan. ''It is simply a matter of resources, of capacity,'' Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress this week. ''In Afghanistan, we do what we can. In Iraq, we do what we must.''
 Both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Mr. Gates have urged Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, to consider proposals for eradicating poppy fields by aerial spraying to halt the rapid increase in opium production. But the Afghan president has thus far rejected the idea, and even American officials admit that vastly increased eradication efforts would be counterproductive unless alternative livelihoods were immediately available to the poppy farmers.
 The Karzai government also is said to be reluctant to endorse having an international coordinator with expanded powers, fearing its own legitimacy and credibility could be undermined.
 Julianne Smith, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the mission in Afghanistan was at riskof failure, as political support in European capitals strained NATO's ability to sustain, let alone expand its effort there.
 ''The mission in Afghanistan has been suffering from neglect on all sides,'' she said.

HEADLINE: As China Goes, So Goes Global Warming

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
GIVEN the accelerated melting these days in Greenland, it's probably no longer appropriate to use the adjective ''glacial'' to describe treaty negotiations aimed at curbing dangerous human interference with the climate. 
 The talks in Bali over the last two weeks were just the latest baby step in trying to make that happen. The Bali achievement? Two more years of talks. In the meantime, concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main climate-heating emission, continue the climb that began 250 years ago, as industrialization surged on a diet of fossil fuels.
 So, presuming the industrialized and industrializing nations are serious, who or what can realistically turn the carbon tide? 
 As always, the fingers of many experts on energy and the environment point both west and east -- to the United States and China. 
 The established superpower arose riding a wave of fossil-fueled prosperity. The emerging one, sitting on a wealth of coal, sees few reasons not to follow suit; after all, it has only just caught its wave (with India and others in hot pursuit).
 Yet the tide can only be turned, a host of scientists and economists with varied perspectives agree, if China and other rising powers like India speed through the familiar path in nation building -- resource extraction, industrial and economic growth, accompanying despoliation, and then environmental restoration and protection. If they don't, their emissions will eventually swamp all other sources, according to many analyses.
 Richard Richels, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, helped produce an ominous forecast: even if the established industrial powers turned off every power plant and car right now, unless there are changes in policy in poorer countries the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could still reach 450 parts per million -- a level deemed unacceptably dangerous by many scientists -- by 2070. (If no one does anything, that threshold is reached in 2040.) 
 Libertarians say that once countries get rich, they'll do the right thing for the climate. But critics of this view say the long life of carbon dioxide (and of sources like the coal-burning plants China is building at the rate of one a week) mean that waiting just compounds the problem beyond fixing. 
 Theories abound over how best to help China embrace emissions-reducing policies. One way, many scientists and scholars say, is to make nonpolluting energy sources cheaper than the unfettered burning of abundant fossil fuels. Right now they are far more expensive. 
 That is why several dozen top-flight climate and energy experts sent a letter this month to members of Congress and the presidential candidates seeking a tenfold rise in the federal budget for energy research, now about $3 billion a year.
 Some economists say the only thing that will speed the change is money, whether it is called aid, technology assistance, or something else. 
 Representatives of developing countries have long made this point, noting that the established powers spent a century building the greenhouse-gas blanket. Speaking in Bali, Munir Akram, Pakistan's United Nations ambassador, said: ''What we have to do is to find a way to reduce emissions by those who can afford to reduce emissions.''
 But there are plenty of doubts about the willingness of Congress, particularly, to pay emerging economic competitors.
 Some experts see the best prospects for change coming from the ground up, pointing to efforts like MetroBus, a program involving the World Resources Institute that greatly expanded the use of mass transit in Mexico City. 
 BinBin Jiang, a research associate in energy and development at Stanford University, sees similar opportunities in creating an efficient infrastructure for China's exploding midsize cities. ''That's where you determine if you are going to leapfrog or go along the old Western path,'' she said.
 But Ms. Jiang also stressed that meaningful change in energy and climate policy within the United States was critical, too. ''China is clearly responsible for the largest wedge of emissions in the future, but the United States is still the biggest roadblock,'' she said. ''The U.S. is not going to be influential by telling China what to do. It has to lead by example.''

GRAPHIC: CHART: ''Will emissions be even greater than this?'' A widely used economic model produced this carbon forecast. But world emissions for these five years were significantly higher than the model predicted. So the forecast shown above may be understated. ''Who is responsible?'' About half of the carbon dioxide emitted each year stays in the atmosphere for many decades, trapping heat. Since 1850, humans have raised atmospheric concentrations by about one-third over pre-industrial levels. Here is where that increased concentration came from. ''Who will be responsible?'' The 32 years from 2005 to 2036, highlighted at the top of this page, are expected to match the 20th century's carbon output. Here is where those emissions are expected to come from.

HEADLINE: A Zoo Explorer Starring in His Own Series

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT 

 BODY:
 DECEMBER may seem like an odd time to go to the zoo, but visitors to Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo this time of year will find no crowds and no lines. They may also discover that the oasis of animals on the zoo's 36 acres are friskier in the brisk air and more prone to showing off.
 ''When the weather's chilly, their activity level really picks up,'' Jim Knox, an educator at the zoo, said of the approximately 130 species of animals from North, Central and South America at the Beardsley. 
 Visitors who make it Tuesdays through Saturdays in the winter are also most likely to find the 6-foot-4-inch Mr. Knox, in a royal blue shirt, khaki pants and his Beardsley jacket, strolling the grounds, eager to introduce children to any of the zoo's furry, feathered, leathery, hard-shelled, slimy, prickly or patterned residents.
 ''There's really no better time to visit the zoo,'' Mr. Knox said on a recent tour, walking toward the Siberian tiger habitat, where Victor, a 500-pound male who was born at the zoo almost three years ago, played with a papier-mache pinata packed with a tiger's version of candy: beef knuckle bones.
 Victor's mother and two sisters wrestled nearby, and one of them stood on her hind legs and stretched her front paws up the cage, eliciting ''wows'' from the few passers-by.
 Viewers of Connecticut Public Television will also soon be able to see Mr. Knox, 42, in a new PBS series he helped create, ''Jim Knox's Wild Zoofari.'' The Beardsley is featured in the third episode of the 15-episode series, and other episodes highlight wildlife destinations around the country, like the Bronx Zoo, the San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park and the National Aquarium in Baltimore.
 The series began broadcasts on PBS in select markets in September, and is slated to run on Connecticut Public Television starting in February. Mr. Knox is scheduled to talk about the show Dec. 16 from noon to 3 p.m., during the zoo's winter festival. (For more on the show, visit www.wildzoofari.org.)
 ''Jim is amazing with the animals and amazing with the kids,'' said Lucie Houle, the spokeswoman for Rhode Island PBS. ''There are a lot of people out there who are knowledgeable about animals, but to be able to convey it all in such a fun, accessible way is an awesome talent.''
 So accessible that Mr. Knox recently helped a 10-year-old boy get over his fear of snakes by taking out Baby, an 8-foot-long, 30-pound boa constrictor. Mr. Knox wrapped the snake around his waist and talked so gently and amusingly about the nonvenomous creature's habits that the boy inched closer and, with a smile, started to pet the reptile. 
 In the 30-minute episodes, Mr. Knox takes a small group of children, ages 6 to 11, to meet animals at different zoos. They play with koalas, get close to colossal Komodo dragons, communicate with gorillas, feed fruit to moon bears, release a sea turtle back into the wild, pet a newborn giraffe and meet gigantic white rhinos and rain forest ocelots for the first time.
 In the episode featuring the Beardsley, the only zoo in the state, Mr. Knox teaches his explorers how to track deer, coyote, skunk, bobcat and bear. 
 One of seven children growing up in Armonk, N.Y., Mr. Knox said that he and his brother, Bruce, 40, an aviation specialist at Citation Shares in Greenwich, ''were always out in the woods, hiking and fishing and looking for animal tracks.'' 
 ''We shared bunk beds, so every night we would talk, and one of our dreams was that some day we would work together, maybe with animals,'' Mr. Knox said.
 He said he and his brother started thinking of the TV series three years ago; now they are co-creators, and Bruce Knox is the producer.
 ''My ultimate goal is to share my knowledge and love of wildlife with every child around the world, just as I have with my own children,'' said Jim Knox, who lives with his wife, Eileen, and their three children, ages 5, 13, and 15, in Newtown.
 Mr. Knox studied animal science at Cornell University, but graduated with a degree in economics and business management. ''I went to work for a large company and realized very quickly that wasn't for me,'' he said. ''My dad always told us to follow our dreams and do what we love, so I said that's it, I'm going to work at a zoo. Who cares about the pay cut as long as I'm happy?''

HEADLINE: A Grim Diagnosis for the U.S., and a Prescription

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
EVERY once in a blue moon, a book comes along that seems to articulate my most deep-seated fears about the future of America, its economy and its body politic. I do wish the best for my beloved country, but I see so many ominous signs at every turn: wars seemingly without end or clear purpose; a widening income gap between the financial elite and middle-class families who can no longer afford to own homes; the kowtowing of ambitious politicians in both major parties to special-interest groups; the loss of respect for America around the world.
 In ''The Squandering of America: How the Failure of Our Politics Undermines Our Prosperity'' (337 pages, Knopf, $26.95) Robert Kuttner sounds a chilling, if often shrill, alarm about these and many other political and economic issues. Mr. Kuttner is a self-proclaimed liberal Democrat and heterodox economist who founded The American Prospect magazine and wrote a column in BusinessWeek for 20 years. He is also the author of several books critiquing laissez-faire capitalism and unregulated markets. 
 ''The potential of our economy to underwrite a society of broad prosperity is being sacrificed to financial speculation,'' Mr. Kuttner declares in his new book's opening chapter. ''The winnings are going to a narrow elite, jeopardizing not only our broad prosperity but our solvency. In less than a decade, our government budget, gutted by tax cuts, has shifted from endless projected federal surpluses to infinite deficits. Our trade imbalances and financial debt to the rest of the world have grown from a modest concern to levels that could produce a crash.''
 Mr. Kuttner cites numerous studies and statistics that show a staggeringly disproportionate distribution of wealth in America. Among the most telling is the fact that the median income of working-age families has actually fallen by 5.4 percent over the last seven years, adjusted for inflation, even as the gross domestic product has grown by 18 percent.
 The very rich, meanwhile, have become much, much richer. ''For the richest one-tenth of 1 percent, inflation-adjusted income soared by 550 percent from about $3.6 million in 1970 to $24 million in 2000,'' he writes in summarizing recently updated National Bureau of Economic Research studies. ''And at the very top, the richest 400 people had 1.1 percent of all the income in America, more than double their 1992 share.''
 As he decries income disparities at home, Mr. Kuttner condemns American trade policies as lacking ''a strategic focus.'' Trade should be aligned with the nation's broad ''fair trade'' interests rather than the powerful ''free trade'' corporate lobbies, he says. 
 Mr. Kuttner also points out that some of our trading partners are quite clearly focused on using barriers and low-wage labor to gain advantage for their own countries. In 2005, the bottom line was an $83 billion negative trade balance with Japan and a whopping $243 billion negative trade balance with China.
 Mr. Kuttner attributes the squandering of America's economic health mainly to what he describes as the systematic dismantling of the government-managed economy that was created under Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.
 The push for deregulation in recent decades, he contends, has created a ''casino economy'' in which labor unions have become marginalized, pension funds are hijacked as vehicles for speculation, and financial elites enrich themselves through hedge funds and private equity groups with little accountability to government or the public.
 Mr. Kuttner blames both Democrats and Republicans for the current economic mess. He says that after Bill Clinton pledged not to ''coddle dictators,'' his ''emphasis on human rights quickly gave way to the pressure of business interests that wanted to do deals with the Chinese.''
 Likewise, he contends that ''Republican-oriented business leaders once presided over a corporate welfare state, in which generous wages and benefits and partnerships with unions were seen as decent ways to reward workers' loyalty.'' By contrast, he says, today's corporate executives ''are more interested in grabbing the biggest possible pay packet and in showing Wall Street quarterly earnings, accurate or otherwise, that boost stock prices (tied to option benefits for themselves).''
 Mr. Kuttner's proposed solution is to create what he believes to be an enlightened form of ''managed capitalism,'' as opposed to the present version, in which capitalists effectively manage -- and limit -- government for their own ends. 
 In his view, American government can and should provide universal health care and a Social Security safety net, as well as opportunities to earn decent wages here at home.
 WE can start to realize these goals, he says, by imposing progressive taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, and by instituting trade policies that are protectionist only to the extent that they are based on long-term interests of the country as a whole, rather than on the short-term profit goals of the financial elite.
 Mr. Kuttner expresses high hopes for his brand of ''pocketbook populism,'' and I share his hopes. 
 My most deep-seated fear, however, it is that we will have to wait for at least a generation of blue moons before America musters the political will to make such dreams come true.

When a Teenager Takes the Wheel
 To the Editor:
 Gerri Hirshey, in ''Teenagers and Cars: A Deadly Mix'' (Dec. 9), asks: ''Do any of them see the very real peril? And as adults, don't we know enough -- and do enough -- to save them from themselves?'' 
 The real issue is much broader: it is not to save these teenage drivers from themselves, but rather to save the whole of society from them. 
 On Nov. 16, my 81-year-old mother was crossing the street, in the crosswalk with the light, when she was struck by a car driven by a 17-year-old making a left turn. His license had already been suspended once. 
 I don't know what his parents were thinking when they gave him the keys, or what he was thinking when he got behind the wheel or when he failed to yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk. 
 In fact, I don't know if he was thinking at all. But he certainly was not thinking about the peril in which he placed others, not just himself, when he was driving. 
 As a parent of two teenage drivers, I can only assume that he didn't intend to kill my mother, but that doesn't change the fact that she died as a result of her injuries. The young driver -- and his parents' car -- survived. 
 While we may do everything we can to save our children from themselves, we -- and our children -- must do more to protect the safety of us all. 
 Lynne Bernstein Bedford, N.Y.
 To the Editor:
 As an orthodontist, I work with hundreds of teenagers. Many of my 17-year-old patients have been involved in accidents while driving or as passengers with a 17-year-old at the wheel. One patient was killed in an accident this year.
 When I walk into my office in the morning, I often wonder which of my wonderful young patients might be the next to have his or her picture in the newspaper as a victim of a car accident.
 To decrease this carnage on our roads, I suggest:
 Raise the driving age to 18. 
 Prohibit students from driving to high school. (An exception could be made for students who must be at a job immediately after school.) 
 Immediately revoke the licenses of young drivers for a significant length of time for any motor vehicle violation, or for any other crime (including drug and alcohol use). 
 Mark J. Schwitz Marlboro
 To the Editor:
 I have a constructive suggestion to reduce the chance of a teenage driver fatality. Parents should avoid the temptation to give their teenagers the old family car when they buy themselves a new, safer vehicle.
 I am a neurosurgeon and have seen three separate teenage fatalities that could have been prevented if the vehicles involved had had side air bags. 
 In each case, the parents had given their child an old family car lacking these safety devices. Yet they bought themselves a new car that featured the very safety features that could have saved their child.
 If only these parents had the chance to go back in time, they would surely have given their children the safer car and kept the old family car for themselves. 
 Jeffrey S. Oppenheim Suffern, N.Y.
 We Should Be Asking, 'Is This Trip Necessary?'
 To the Editor:
 In ''A Congested Economy'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 25), Sam Staley views the ground and air traffic congestion in our region as a problem to be solved by adjusting toll rates, using congestion pricing at airports and adding runways. 
 But at a time when we are increasingly aware that our carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to disastrous global warming, we should be seeking a different remedy.
 We are living beyond our means in our energy consumption. With so much of our carbon dioxide emissions coming from our various forms of transport, it is time that we encourage economic policies that ask, ''Is this trip necessary?'' 
 Can we afford globalization, with its increased movement of goods, tourism and consumption? And with more immigration come more people who are striving to achieve our high-consumption style of living.
 We can all hope that there will be a time when technology will have found a means of meeting our energy needs without the destructive carbon dioxide emissions. But until then, we should be concentrating on preserving a livable world for future generations by using less energy and getting more out of what we do use.

NEVER ENOUGH 
 By Joe McGinniss. 
 Illustrated. 358 pp. Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 Joe McGinniss's new book, about the November 2003 murder of a Hong Kong-based investment banker named Robert Kissel, expands his true-crime oeuvre from bloody trilogy to bloody quartet. ''Never Enough'' begins with a cluster of hard-boiled cliches that create a cartoonish first impression. Kissel's father ''played to win'' but ''knew how to catch flies with honey.'' Kissel's own ''killer instinct slumbered'' during high school in New Jersey; he would gaze across the Hudson at the Manhattan skyline like a ''kid with his face pressed against the glass of the candy store window.'' Meanwhile ''it was her way or the highway'' for Nancy Keeshin, the selfish woman Kissel would marry. New York City is ''the land of hopes and dreams, the fast track, the big league.''
 McGinniss seems on autopilot, speed-dialing up interviews with family and friends of the victim (Rob) and perp (Nancy), scanning e-mail traffic and court transcripts, cruising the bountiful landscape in pursuit of a narrative -- a straightforward cautionary tale of ambition, avarice and violence -- that could write itself. 
 He wants us to recognize his protagonists as stand-ins for volatile forces at play in the American psyche and marketplace, and there's a temptation to dismiss ''Never Enough'' as a sexed-up rehash of themes and pathologies we know too well. But McGinniss can be a talented writer and observer, with a special interest in often affluent people gone unimaginably bad: a Special Forces physician in ''Fatal Vision'' (1983), a New Jersey businessman in ''Blind Faith'' (1989), a North Carolina college student in ''Cruel Doubt'' (1991) and now the glamorous wife of a Merrill Lynch power broker. 
 ''Never Enough'' has been published at an interesting moment -- a confluence of 20th anniversaries marking three events that shaped perceptions of Wall Street and its culture. Remember Black Monday, the 508-point market crash? And ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' Tom Wolfe's evisceration of New York's masters of the universe? And Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street,'' which popularized the vernacular of warfare in the skyscrapers of financial districts worldwide and offered the moneyed class a mantra, seductively articulated by the corporate raider Gordon Gekko: ''Greed ... is good.''
 It's impossible to read ''Never Enough'' without thinking that Stone's movie is a silent partner in McGinniss's enterprise. For a young trader on the Street in 1987, or 1997 or 2007, Gekko was and is a role model to be mostly admired and emulated. It's instructive to read ''Never Enough,'' with its population of Gekko clones like the two Kissel brothers, Rob and Andrew, as a tragic sequel to the movie, a dramatized audit of the 20 ensuing years of heedless self-interest. In this iteration, redemption is nowhere on the menu.
 In 1987 -- a time, McGinniss writes, when ''Wall Street was overflowing with young men making millions before the ink on their grad school diplomas was dry'' -- Rob Kissel, ''23, handsome and single,'' the son of a vindictive New Jersey businessman known for tyrannizing his family as well as his competitors, established himself on Wall Street's doorstep, enrolling in New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business.
 Within two years he landed his first job, with the investment bank Ladenburg Thalmann, and acquired the requisite splendid digs, an apartment in La Rochelle, a landmark building on Columbus Avenue, for himself and his fiancee. By 1990, he had moved up to the United States division of Lazard Freres, the firm where Felix Rohatyn made his name and bundle. It was at Lazard that Rob, lacking the polished salesmanship needed for mergers and acquisitions, ''found his niche in the more predatory realm of distressed debt. The idea with distressed debt was to make money from failure, not success.'' In other words, like Gekko, Rob Kissel was a swashbuckling pioneer of leveraged buyouts and disaster capitalism.
 Arguably, Kissel's first acquisition as a dealer who could sniff out the profit in failure happened a year earlier, when he married Nancy, artist manque; and college dropout, a clubbing-till-dawn waitress he had met on a nude beach in the Caribbean. Their union was a perfectly fine match by the limited and nonnegotiable criteria for trophy wives -- appearance (the indispensable facade of pretty pictures), sexual acquiescence and the capacity to produce an heir to the throne (willingly or not).
 For the hypermaterialistic and chronically adolescent Nancy, what was nonnegotiable was control, the power to sculpture her world to gratify her ever-sharpening appetites and desires. Motherhood, naturally, made her lose a good deal of control, and this sense of loss intensified, with increasingly dire consequences, when Rob, poached by Goldman Sachs in 1996 (and several years later by Merrill Lynch), was transferred to Hong Kong, investment banker heaven, right on schedule to exploit the imminent collapse of Asian economies. ''Rob's Hong Kong,'' McGinniss writes, ''was one very long branch on which hundreds of vultures perched. ... And there was no shortage of carrion to pick over. For a distressed-debt specialist based in Hong Kong, the East Asian financial crisis was the opportunity of a lifetime. Suddenly there were trillions of dollars' worth of distressed assets scattered all over the continent. It was a bonanza beyond belief.''
 The loot gushed forth in direct proportion to the shrinking hours Rob penciled in for his family, but ''the more money he made, the less happy'' Nancy was. The opulence of her life as an expat wife failed to soothe her feelings of abandonment, boredom and oppression. Her response to criticism was hysterical and unforgiving. In the same way her husband had wedded self-worth to net worth, she had based her life on lifestyle itself, the self-delusion that money equals an endless spool of romance with no boundaries, no constraints. No longer able to indulge in that fantasy with her husband, her resentment led her into the arms of another man.
 Rob found out, hired a detective, bought spyware to monitor her e-mail, asked her to end the affair, dragged his heels, decided to ask for a divorce. Rob, she would later assert, began to sexually brutalize her. In the autumn of 2003, in what she insisted was an act of self-defense, she bludgeoned him to death one night in the bedroom of their apartment after drugging him with a milkshake. Three years later, deeper into the twilight zone of Kissel family dysfunction, Rob's older brother, Andrew, slumlord, embezzler, architect of another ugly Kissel marriage, was found murdered by a still unknown assailant on the eve of his sentencing on federal bank fraud charges. Despite the recovery of an e-mail message in which she fantasized killing her husband, Andrew's wife was cleared of involvement, if not suspicion, in his homicide.
 If McGinniss never quite finds the depth in these people, perhaps it's because it isn't there. They flourish and fail on a one-dimensional plane of avarice, contemptuous of common decency. Their hearts are oblique, their souls unfathomable. We would be compelled to feel sorry for them if they weren't hellbent on gobbling up the world, spending, along with everything else, our compassion.
 Twenty years after Gordon Gekko, ''Never Enough''updates its famous mantra. Greed destroys.

HEADLINE: Crime Is Low, but Fear Knows No Numbers

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY. 
More Dispatches: nytimes.com/cityroom

 BODY:
JOSE SANTIAGO, 39, has been around Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, ever since he was a child and started spending summers in the neighborhood with his father, a building superintendent who worked there. Mr. Santiago is a building superintendent himself now, living and working just down the street from where his father lived and worked. 
 It is a good neighborhood, he said, and safe. Much safer, anyway, than during the crack epidemic of the 1980s, when he once saw a man punch a woman in the face in broad daylight to steal her earrings. Those were the years when he got used to the sight of hollow-eyed people searching the cracks in the sidewalks for anything they could use to buy drugs. 
 With all that in the past, this might seem like a strange time for Mr. Santiago to worry about the safety of his teenage daughter and the friendly-looking people who live in his building. 
 Strange because the neighborhood is wealthier than ever, with the glossy white Richard Meier building going up at Grand Army Plaza. Strange because, statistically, the city is at its safest point in recent memory, with crime down sharply in all categories from the highs of the early 1990s.
 But the other day, sitting in the lobby of his building, Mr. Santiago sounded nervous. ''Crime around here, I guarantee you, it's going to pick up,'' he said. ''This year it's going to pick up. I have a gut feeling.''
 He bases this feeling on the teenagers he sees wearing what look like gang colors on handkerchiefs and beads. And he recounts a string of disturbing recent incidents: a man who was fatally stabbed on Washington Avenue, and another who was shot and injured on St. Johns Place. As of last week, in fact, murders and rapes were down from last year in the 77th Precinct, which includes Prospect Heights, but robberies, felony assaults and burglaries were up.
 Even with those increases, crime in the area is a fraction of what it was in 1990. Plenty of old-timers and would-be old-timers would point to that fact as evidence that New Yorkers now are soft. Muggings happen, this argument goes. Don't like it? Go back to Ohio.
 Over the summer, Mr. Santiago was walking past a bodega on Underhill Avenue near Prospect Park when he saw a group of skateboarders exchange words with a bunch of tough local kids. The interchange turned violent, and according to Mr. Santiago, somebody got hit over the head with his own board and was cut. 
 Over the months, as retold time and again through the local grapevine, the injury became increasingly serious, until Mr. Santiago, an old-timer himself in a way, chuckled at the way neighborhood rumors can get out of hand. ''But still,'' he said, turning serious again. ''You get hit on the head, it's not a good feeling. It's dangerous as hell.''
 This is the other, murkier side of those encouraging crime numbers. They don't make themselves felt uniformly throughout the city. People still get guns pointed at them, and iPods still get stolen. And low numbers can obscure the fact that being the victim of a crime is unpleasant, even if the city is home to fewer such victims.
 And from where Mr. Santiago sits, there is always the possibility that the situation will regress, if not entirely, at least noticeably. Maybe because the economy is weakening, or because gentrification is inevitably accompanied by tensions, or because the rich people in upscale buildings like the one down the street are easy targets. 
 Or maybe Mr. Santiago and people like him are just worriers. Maybe things will keep getting better in this new New York, where, according to statistics made public a few weeks ago, the chances of being killed by a stranger are, statistically, close to zero. These are the possibilities that the people who paid Richard Meier to design his building in Prospect Heights are betting on. 
 Eventually we will know who was right. But as of now, there are numbers, and then there are some people's gut feelings. ''I predict this summer is going to be crazy,'' Mr. Santiago said. ''Not wild, crazy, bananas, but crime is going to pick up.''

HEADLINE: Bell Labs Is Gone. Academia Steps In.

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PAY me now, and pay me later. 
 That's the new mind-set at some leading research universities in dealing with business -- and the essence of an emerging model for how corporations can tap big brains on campus without having to pay their salaries.
 Corporations have long been able to license intellectual property from universities, but these deals are cumbersome to negotiate and tend to work best when corporate researchers know exactly what they need to create. 
 They don't always. Often, they explore scientific and technological frontiers without a map. After blue-sky thinking and random experimentation, they build new products without relying on neatly defined patents or published scientific papers -- the bread-and-butter of academic knowledge production. 
 In the bygone days of innovation, large corporations -- like RCA, Xerox and the old AT&T -- maintained internal laboratories like Bell Labs. These corporate labs were essentially research universities embedded in private companies, and their employees published academic papers, spoke at conferences and even gave away valuable breakthroughs. Bell Labs, for instance, created the world's first transistor after World War II -- and never earned a dollar from the innovation. 
 Almost no corporate labs based on the Bell or Xerox model remain, victims of cost-cutting and a new appreciation by corporate leaders that commercial innovations may flow best when scientists and engineers stick to business problems. 
 The obsession with marrying research and markets, while generally a strength of American capitalism, leaves some needs unmet. To fill them, ''companies need boots on the ground at universities,'' says Henry Chesbrough, a business professor who studies innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.
 A vanguard group of universities is giving corporations greater access to ivory-tower laboratories -- for a price. Stanford has paired with Exxon Mobil in a deal worth $100 million over 10 years. The University of California, Davis, is getting $25 million from Chevron. And Intel has opened collaborative laboratories with Berkeley, the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon.
 The appeal of these arrangements is that ''we get broad engagement with universities,'' says Andrew A. Chien, Intel's director of research. ''Their researchers work on frontiers, in unexplored territory. We want explorers.''
 Intel hopes to learn more about scientific and technical developments that might influence its business, even decades from now. The company says it benefits from having its own employees rub shoulders with professors, while gaining the chance to observe younger talent in Ph.D. programs.
 ''You can view this as a pure pipeline,'' says Mr. Chien, himself a former professor. 
 Jean Stephenne, president of the vaccine division of GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company, says university partnerships with corporations will grow ''because technology is changing so rapidly.'' Even if companies have the resources to finance their own research and identify the right academic problems to tackle, they usually don't have the time to assemble a staff to pursue these problems. Without help from university professors, Mr. Stephenne asks, ''How can we cope?'' 
 Some people doubt that formal partnerships between corporations and universities can deliver real benefits. 
 ''Universities don't innovate,'' says Curtis R. Carlson, chief executive of SRI International, a nonprofit research institute in Menlo Park, Calif., that bought what remained of RCA's lab. ''Innovation means you get it out so people can use it. The university is not going to take it to the world.''
 But corporations hope that universities can help them take innovations to the world faster and more efficiently. Last month, BP pledged to spend $500 million over 10 years on alternative-energy research to be carried out by a new Energy Biosciences Institute at Berkeley, which will manage work done at a nearby Department of Energy lab and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
 ''This is a new model we're working through in real time,'' says Robert J. Birgeneau, the chancellor of Berkeley.
 CRITICS of corporate-university partnerships fear limits on academic freedom or, worse, that companies might censor results that go against their interests. The risk of such interference seems small, however. Despite the large amount being offered by BP, the money will be divided three ways; of Berkeley's annual research budget of $500 million (nearly all from the federal government), BP will be contributing less than 3 percent. 
 Under the terms of the partnership, meanwhile, Berkeley professors are free to publish results of BP-funded research. The university also will own the rights to any resulting intellectual property. BP would even have to license that intellectual property, though payments are capped and the company would get the first look at promising results.
 The alternative to corporate funds is for universities to rely even more on government funds. And that raises parallel issues in the minds of some academics. The idea that government funding plays no role in prioritizing research ''is completely at odds with reality,'' says Michael Crowe, the president of Arizona State University.
 The marriage of corporations and university researchers is still in its early days. ''In the decades ahead, we will see more differentiation among universities in how they go about doing this,'' Mr. Crowe says.
 For universities, no matter what models emerge, the key is to deliver benefits to society and business.
 ''Will these partnerships produce products you won't get from two people in a garage?'' Mr. Birgeneau asks. ''We don't know that yet. It is an important question.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 23, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A headline last Sunday with the Ping column, about research partnerships between universities and corporations, referred incorrectly to the status of Bell Labs. Although it is no longer part of AT&T, it has not been discontinued; it is now the research arm of Alcatel-Lucent. The column also misspelled the surname of the president of Arizona State University, who said that universities' roles in such partnerships would evolve in coming decades. He is Michael Crow, not Crowe.

HEADLINE: A Fabled Club Seeks an Encore in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
AS a teenager growing up in Flatbush, Allan Pepper used to set aside his schoolbooks every evening and tune in to the radio station WINS for the alternative education offered by the legendary D.J. Alan Freed. Mad for more, the gratefully distracted student discovered a jukebox sale and rental shop on Coney Island Avenue, not far from his home, that sold the 78s -- five for a dollar -- after current hits had run their cycles. Eventually, he sold his record collection to friends and used the money to venture into an even more daring genre of recordings: jazz.
 The musical flexibility of that shift was the hallmark of the Bottom Line cabaret, which Mr. Pepper opened in 1974 at Mercer and West Fourth Streets in Greenwich Village with his business partner and boyhood friend, Stanley Snadowsky. 
 Over the decades, styling himself after Mr. Freed and especially his hero, the promoter Bill Graham, impresario of the Fillmore clubs in San Francisco and New York, Mr. Pepper oversaw the rising fortunes -- and often, the wincing declines -- of nearly every popular act to pass through New York. 
 Mr. Pepper is 65, and with adjustments made for age and experience, his life today is not so different from those long-ago evenings spent listening to his radio. The dining room of his modest house in Tenafly, N.J., is cluttered with CDs and cassette tapes of recordings from the club that was his life's passion. He is working his way through them, selecting tracks for a live boxed set to be released next year in honor of the club, which closed in 2004. 
 Lori Cheatle, a film producer and fan of the Bottom Line, had approached Mr. Pepper about filming the club's last days in late 2003, when New York University, its landlord, was threatening to evict the club for failure to pay about $185,000 in back rent. 
 Mr. Pepper still believed then that the Bottom Line would be saved, but Ms. Cheatle saw a good story no matter what happened: either Mr. Pepper's triumph or -- better, really -- his idealism bowing to whims of a faceless landlord. Then, the quest for redemption. ''It's this notion of, can there be second acts in life?'' Ms. Cheatle said recently.
 When Mr. Pepper isn't listening to music or being filmed, he is looking for a space to start up the Bottom Line again. ''Why give it up now,'' he said this fall, ''just because some major corporation came and took it away from me?''
 He didn't always feel so determined.
 After losing the club, Mr. Pepper said, he feared falling into depression. For days after, brooding at home, he used to unthinkingly pick up the phone and dial the club to check the box-office numbers and ask if there were any calls for him. ''Then,'' he said, ''I'd realize there wasn't a call for me to make.'' 
 His own phone, though, was ringing, and his inbox was overflowing. Don Duggan, a 50-year-old Bay Ridge native and live music enthusiast, volunteered himself to the cause, flooding Mr. Pepper with e-mail messages that proclaimed Manhattan dead to live music and Brooklyn electric with potential. ''I'd send e-mails to Allan and say, 'Your audience is waiting for you,''' Mr. Duggan said.
 Though Mr. Pepper appreciated the kind words, the idea of moving to Brooklyn seemed far-fetched. He visited more than 50 possible locations in Manhattan, but after a year of searching, none seemed promising. Hearing this, Mr. Duggan again suggested Brooklyn, and he offered to drive Mr. Pepper around Park Slope and Carroll Gardens to take a look. 
 ''It's very much a neighborhood as the Village was when you first started,'' Mr. Duggan told him. Mr. Pepper's daughter Jessie, who lives in Carroll Gardens, gave her blessing. Gradually, Mr. Pepper warmed to the thought of taking the Bottom Line to his native borough. 
 ''In Manhattan I've found that it's really about dollars and cents,'' he said, ''and even when you attempt to talk to people that you think could understand on some kind of aesthetic level what you're trying to accomplish, I haven't got the same reaction that I've got with Brooklyn.''
 So Mr. Pepper has transplanted his idealism back across the East River. Plans for the new Bottom Line, which is backed by several investors, include not only a music club but also an adjacent pub decorated with memorabilia. The hope is that the pub's revenue will anchor the enterprise financially and allow the club to flourish. 
 Still, the rebirth is slow going. Each potential property faces the inevitable comparison with the original, and Mr. Pepper goes months without viewing new sites. 
 The variables of location and space make it difficult to estimate the club's eventual cost, according to Joel Wechsler, a real estate broker for Grubb & Ellis who is representing Mr. Pepper. Even in Brooklyn, he said, ''pricing in the real estate market has gotten to be so phenomenally high that it's made it very difficult for us to find something that has a realistic price tag on it for the club to survive.'' 
 In spite of his vague timeline and economics, several Brooklyn officials are encouraging Mr. Pepper, eager to adopt the Bottom Line and its cultural clout.
 ''Any place that can attract the likes of Miles Davis or Bruce Springsteen is a place we believe could attract a high degree of talent and visitorship in Downtown Brooklyn,'' said Joe Chan, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a group that is putting Mr. Pepper in touch with potential owners or builders. 
 WITH a sense of irony, Mr. Pepper has also been following a developing story at New York University. After the Bottom Line vacated its premises, the building that had housed the club was converted into a lecture hall and renovated with money donated by an N.Y.U. student; it was later discovered that the student had acquired the money, and millions more, by defrauding investors. 
 The university was criticized for keeping about $200,000 of the student's $1.25 million gift, and only in October, more than a year after the donor pleaded guilty, was the name of the student's family removed from the building. 
 Mr. Pepper insists he harbors no grudge against his one-time landlord. Nevertheless, there is still a flicker of vindication in his brief analysis of the scandal, delivered with a wry smile: ''Karma.''

HEADLINE: Why the Fed Can't Fix It Now

 BODY:
The credit crunch is back. Markets eased somewhat after August's initial seizure. But bankers and other lenders, still uncertain about who is sitting on once-and-future mortgage-related losses, are again nervous about making loans. That is increasing the odds of a recession. 
 Having failed to use its power to curb junk lending back when it might have helped to head off the problem, the Federal Reserve is now confronting the limits of its powers to reverse the situation. 
 The Fed -- which cut interest rates by a quarter of a point last week -- appears reluctant to lower rates aggressively. That is understandable on some fronts. A deeper cut would have worsened fears of inflation and opened the Fed to accusations that it was using interest rate policy to prop up stock prices on Wall Street. 
 To have had a real chance of juicing the economy, however, last week's cut would have needed to be more aggressive. That is because lower rates boost activity largely via mortgage lending. With the mortgage market freezing up, a significant rate cut might have broken the ice. The modest cut barely registered. 
 The Fed's new plan to grease credit markets with $40 billion in loans to banks this month, and more next month, is also unlikely to solve the problem. Making the money available lessens the risk that banks' short-term borrowing difficulties could, in themselves, provoke a recession. But the banks still have to cope with hundreds of billions of dollars of long-term loans that may well go bad as the housing market weakens and defaults soar -- the same for securities that are tied to those loans. Given those underlying problems, a severe downturn, if not an outright recession, may be unavoidable. 
 Whichever way the economy breaks, the volatility and vulnerability of the moment should prompt a thorough investigation of how things got to this dangerous tipping point. There are a lot of angles, but one thing is sure: the mortgage bubble inflated as the Fed, other regulators and lawmakers looked the other way, a willful ignorance that was certainly reinforced by the Bush administration's antiregulatory fervor. 
 The Treasury Department is now saying it will propose a new bank regulatory framework next year, but that will, at best, be an overdue starting point for change. Congress and the presidential candidates need to begin a serious discussion about how the mortgage debacle occurred, sparing no agency and no policy maker. 
 That is the only way to ensure that it does not happen again.

HEADLINE: Yale and New Haven Find Common Ground

BYLINE: By DAVID McKAY WILSON

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
 AS a former real estate developer, Bruce D. Alexander is particularly well positioned to lead Yale University's effort to improve downtown New Haven. On a recent tour, he crowed about the city's revival as a destination for urban shoppers and suburbanites out for a night on the town, and was quick to promote the city's thriving restaurant scene. 
 ''We should do a little brochure with the 25 best restaurants,'' Mr. Alexander, Yale's vice president of New Haven and state affairs and campus development, said to an aide. ''We need to get that published.'' 
 Mr. Alexander's boosterism is just one facet of a well-financed program that over the past 14 years has transformed Yale from the punching bag of New Haven politicians and community activists into a welcome partner in the city's revitalization. The change in attitude was ushered in by Richard C. Levin, an economics professor who became the university's president in 1993. 
 Mr. Levin was determined to end the longstanding battle between town and gown. He did so by brandishing Yale's financial might and intellectual firepower to invest in the city, for the mutual benefit of the school and its environs. 
 Among those observing the turnabout has been Roxanne Condon, chairwoman of the Dixwell Management Team, a grass-roots community group from Dwight, the neighborhood on Yale's northern border. Yale recently pledged to invest $500,000 in Scantlebury Park, a vacant piece of city-owned land in Dwight that Yale and community activists have worked on developing into a playground for neighborhood children. 
 ''When I moved here in 1985, it was like a fortress, and it seemed like Yale just forgot about the community,'' said Ms. Condon, 52, a clinical therapist who works with children. ''Now everybody is realizing that we are in this together, that if the community improves, that improves Yale because Yale benefits from the improvement of the community. It's a whole new mind-set.''
 That mind-set starts in Mr. Levin's office in Woodbridge Hall. He took the reins two years after Yale was rocked by the murder of a 21-year-old student on Hillhouse Avenue. Among his first initiatives was the Yale Homebuyer Program, which subsidizes the purchase of city homes for Yale employees, who receive $5,000 for down-payment and closing costs, and $2,000 a year for 10 years. So far, 830 Yale employees have bought homes in the city, helping stabilize neighborhoods, with Yale leveraging more than $100 million in sales with an investment of $18 million into city real estate for its employees. 
 Yale also began increasing its voluntary contributions to the city in response to criticism of its property-tax-exempt status for university buildings. Those payments have grown to $4.3 million this year, from $1.2 million in 1992. In addition, the state's tax relief program, which reimburses municipalities for a portion of the property taxes that would have been paid by tax-exempt institutions, brought $43 million to New Haven in 2007, according to a university report. 
 The university's support of the Science Park at Yale has provided start-up space for entrepreneurs in the region's biotech industry, which now includes 22 firms in New Haven. Yale's expanded commercial holdings have also driven up its portfolio of taxable property; the university pays $3.5 million a year in commercial property taxes, making it New Haven's largest taxpayer. 
 The university is also New Haven's largest employer, and its $400 million annual capital budget provides construction jobs for hundreds of craftspeople. 
 In 2006, the partnership between the city and the university deepened when New Haven agreed to give Yale three dead-end streets that run through campus, providing land that may be used for new undergraduate residence halls. In return, Yale pledged to spend up to $10 million on public improvements in the city, including street and sidewalk repairs and development of the Farmington Canal Greenway near campus.
 Yale's involvement in reviving the city's retail districts began in the mid-1990s, after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation foreclosed on 16 properties in the Chapel Street district, on Yale's western border. John DeStefano Jr., the mayor since 1994, urged Yale to buy the entire lot as opposed to the properties being sold individually. Yale has since bought retail properties on Broadway and in the Audubon Street commercial district. 
 ''It made sense, from the university's point of view, to create a healthy retail district for its students, faculty and alumni,'' Mr. DeStefano said. ''Our interest is for taxable properties, and Yale is a good owner. Its interests are long-term, not short-term, so they can take a longer view on their rate of return.''
 By serving as landlord, Yale has created the kind of commercial life on the edge of campus that serves the community and its students. Chapel Street is thriving with its mix of specialty boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants. On Broadway, Mr. Alexander wooed national chains like J. Crew and Urban Outfitters along with Gourmet Heaven, a Manhattan-style deli with bouquets of flowers on the sidewalk and a takeout buffet inside. They are just around the corner from Koffee Too? a local coffee shop that was jammed with students one recent afternoon. 
 These stores are among 90 in downtown New Haven that rent from Yale. Mr. Alexander, who worked for the Rouse Company when it developed Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston in the mid-1970s, said that the mix of stores, and uniform operating hours, had positioned the downtown commercial area to compete with suburban malls. For example, Yale requires its tenants to stay open until 9 p.m., to attract working couples who cannot shop during the day. 
 ''I felt that New Haven's assets and potential far outran its reputation,'' said Mr. Alexander, a member of Yale's Class of 1965. 
 Andrea van den Heever, president of the Connecticut Center for a New Economy, based in New Haven, said that Yale's support for community groups and neighborhood organizations had also helped transform the city's view of the university. 
 Ms. van den Heever noted that Yale certainly had the wherewithal to make the investment: Yale's endowment has grown to $22.5 billion from $1.1 billion in 1984, when she arrived in New Haven to help organize disgruntled Yale workers. 
 ''The Yale bashers aren't around any longer because Yale makes a point to contribute to community organizations,'' she said. ''It makes a difference in how people view the institution. It was a deliberate and smart strategy on their part.''

HEADLINE: Nation's 'First Suburb' Aims to Be Most 'Green'

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
IT was last spring, during a dinner conversation with a friend about global warming, Thomas R. Suozzi said, that he got the idea to develop the nation's first ''green'' suburb in Nassau County.
 ''It's become very fashionable to talk about global warming,'' said Mr. Suozzi, the county executive. ''But people are too busy paying their mortgages and taking care of their kids to think about ice sheets that could be melting 50 years from now. Their first reaction is: How can changing light bulbs or replacing windows in one house really make a difference? I believed that we needed a mass community movement, and we had to figure out how to do that locally.''
 Then came a place to do it: in Levittown, which is often called the country's first suburb and is celebrating its 60th anniversary. 
 Then came the way to do it: County officials would partner with eight energy, home-improvement and financial-services companies providing products, services and expertise aimed at reducing the hamlet's carbon emissions from energy use by 20 percent next year. Discounts and low-interest loans will be available for the project, Green Levittown, but residents will still pay much of the bill. 
 Bradford Tito, the county's deputy director of environmental coordination, said that the participating companies' efforts would make it affordable to install new boilers, make energy-efficient home renovations, use biofuels for heating, add solar heating and buy products that can quickly reduce home energy consumption.
 Mr. Suozzi said the site for the project was chosen because ''everybody's heard of Levittown, U.S.A.''
 ''If we can make Levittown an example of easy environmentalism and show homeowners how they can make changes to save money and improve the environment,'' he said, ''we can do an extreme makeover of an entire community that can become a model for the rest of the country.''
 The project will begin this month when canvassers employed by Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a nonprofit group based in Farmingdale, call on all 17,000 homes in Levittown. The goal is to make homeowners aware of the project, invite them to have a home audit, costing about $300, with recommendations for energy efficiency, and describe the discounts and low-interest loans available. 
 Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign, said the goal was to have 5,000 homeowners participate in ways big (installing new boilers) and small (using compact fluorescent light bulbs). ''The challenge is to help people understand that you have to spend money to save money,'' she said.
 Ashok Gupta, director of the air and energy program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York City, said that ''Green Levittown is an excellent start but needs to be matched with aggressive utility and tax incentives,'' and, eventually, stricter building codes. 
 Linda Garrett, an 18-year Levittown resident who works in the county Office for Constituent Affairs, said her first reaction to having an energy audit was negative because of the inconvenience. ''But my husband felt, why wouldn't we want to learn how to save money?'' she said. ''If we can save $1,000 a year by upgrading our light bulbs or improving our insulation, what do we have to lose?''
 Lisa Marazzo, the Garretts' daughter, who lives next door in an updated version of the original Levittown Cape Cod house, was also cautious but more positive about the project.
 ''Anything to help the environment and save money, I'm in,'' she said. ''But before we agree to anything, I want to find out more about it.''
 Mr. Tito said one place to start is the heating system. He estimated that 30 to 40 percent of the original boilers from 1947 were still in Levittown houses. ''If one was replaced, 300 gallons of fuel would be saved each year, which would amount to an annual savings of between $900 and $1,200,'' he said. 
 The challenge now, Mr. Suozzi said, ''is to get everybody excited.''

TAX-FATIGUED voters said no last week to $189 million in school construction proposals on bond issues throughout the state. While 8 of 14 school districts approved bonds, less than half the $347 million sought by school boards and administrators was approved by voters.
 The rejections continued a turnaround since 16 of 18 bond proposals were approved in April; only four of nine proposals passed in September. And in another possible sign of tax weariness, voters rejected a $450 million bond issue for stem cell research last month. 
 The communities of Elk Township, Deptford Township, Oaklyn, Hamilton Township and the Toms River and Delsea Regional School Districts voted against bond proposals Tuesday. The votes came a day before Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced his plan for school aid next year.
 ''It's a sign of the times,'' said Robert Suessmuth, interim superintendent of the Elk Township District, in Gloucester County, where voters rejected a $1.75 million bond issue by 136 to 116. ''From our perspective, there is taxpayer frustration in New Jersey, and that was compounded locally for us.'' 
 Elk Township residents were just reassessed this year and received higher property tax bills this summer, he said. 
 The bond money would have been used for renovations and improvements at Aura School, an elementary school built in the 1920s that needs repairs including roof replacement and asbestos removal.
 Michael J. Ritacco, the Toms River superintendent, also attributed the bond issue failure in his Ocean County district to an economic time when people feel stretched to the limit. ''People are very cost-conscious,'' he said. ''It's a major disappointment for our school district.'' 
 The $14.95 million bond would have financed renovations and additions for full-day kindergarten in the district of 17,600 students. Only one of the 12 elementary schools has a full-day program because of the shortage of classrooms.
 School budget and bond votes are among the few opportunities voters have to tell government to rein in spending, said Brigid C. Harrison, a political science and law professor at Montclair State University. ''When voters are feeling belt tightening in their own homes, they want government to spend less,'' she said. Bond and budget votes ''are one of the few forms of direct democracy we have in New Jersey,'' she said.
 Before Tuesday's elections, New Jersey voters had approved bond issues in 23 of 35 districts in 2007, said Frank Belluscio, director of communications for the New Jersey School Boards Association. 
 Of 49 districts' bond votes this year, voters approved 31 proposals totaling $354 million in construction. That is a 63 percent approval rate, a slight improvement over 2006 (60 percent) and 2005 (59 percent), but down significantly from 2003 (78 percent) and 2000 (77 percent). 
 ''It's always a challenge to get a big spending proposal through,'' Mr. Belluscio said. ''The economy is a factor too. When the economy is dragging, the number of budgets and bond issues passing decreases.''
 While the annual April school budget elections tend to get only about 15 percent of registered voters to the polls, bond votes usually get between 25 and 30 percent, he said. 
 But in some communities voter apathy may have brought down the bond. Superintendent Tommie D. Stringer said the $5.9 million bond issue in Oaklyn, where there are more than 2,000 registered voters, was rejected, 235 to 197. ''That screams apathy,'' he said. 
 He said he also saw New Jersey's high property taxes as another reason for rejection. ''The property tax issue is driving taxpayers across New Jersey insane,'' he said.
 In Voorhees Township, voters approved a $10 million bond issue for improvements to five schools, but there was no tax increase because debt was being rolled over, said Irene Afek, the public information director. The district spent three months meeting with community members and using e-mail messages and the local newspaper to explain the bond vote.
 Egg Harbor City voters overwhelmingly supported a $26 million bond. Superintendent John Gilly III attributed that support partly to the promise of $17 million of the money being provided by the state. 
 The district has been working on the proposal and plans for a new middle school and the expansion of an elementary school for seven years, Mr. Gilly said. The 84-year-old middle school has no library, no cafeteria, no grass playing fields, no science labs or art and music rooms. The building does not have an elevator, so some students with disabilities must attend school in other districts. 
 The district had secured money from the State Schools Construction Corporation, but could not get it without passing a bond issue. While residents were not happy about a tax increase of $156 per $100,000 of home value, they wanted to make the changes while the state would pay a large percentage, Mr. Gilly said.
 Voters approved the bond, 519 to 122. ''This is unbelievable,'' he said. ''It's just great.''

HEADLINE: At the Paper Mill, a Mr. Fix-It With a Plan

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: MILLBURN 

 BODY:
 MARK W. JONES might be described as a fixer. Evidence of his efforts is everywhere -- from the last three arts organizations he helped turn around to the impact he is already having at the Paper Mill Playhouse.
 In early November, on his first day on the job as executive director of the financially troubled theater, Mr. Jones met with Millburn town officials, who told him they needed a business plan if they were going to help bail out the Paper Mill. By Friday of that week, he had gathered the relevant data and presented a plan.
 ''It was really like having a gun at my head,'' said Mr. Jones, 60. ''The information was there, but nobody had pulled it all together and said, 'This is what we are.' '' 
 The theater's relationship with the town is critical these days, since Millburn is expected to play a significant role in helping the Paper Mill get back on its feet. Last spring, the theater nearly closed when it found itself facing a $2.8 million deficit and a stalled capital campaign. A public appeal raised $1 million, which, combined with a $3.5 million bank loan, allowed the theater to finish the season and convince subscribers there would be another this year.
 Mr. Jones said his first priority was to pay off that bank loan; at the moment, the theater is paying only the interest, money he says could be better spent elsewhere. The best prospect for doing that involves selling the theater and the six acres of land it sits on to the town, which would lease it back to the theater for a nominal annual fee.
 The town and the theater are in negotiations on the value of the property -- between $8 million and $10 million, according to Mr. Jones. Mayor Daniel Baer said the purchase, if it happens, should take place in January or February; the town would borrow the money, said Timothy P. Gordon, the township's business administrator. 
 ''It's not just a matter of throwing money at a place that needs help,'' Mayor Baer said. ''People have to understand that the Paper Mill's a very important component of our town's economic health.''
 Mayor Baer and others who have begun working with Mr. Jones see him as the right person to turn the struggling theater around. Mr. Jones ''has more than exceeded my expectations,'' said Kenneth Thorn, chairman of the theater's board, adding that the new executive director has reinvigorated board members to become involved while working cooperatively with the artistic side of the house. ''His experience in running theaters was a big selling point,'' Mr. Thorn said. ''He's managed to turn a number of theaters around and been very successful in raising unearned funds -- all the things we need.''
 Before joining the Paper Mill, Mr. Jones served as executive director of Shakespeare & Company, in Lenox, Mass., for three years. When he arrived there in 2004, that company had accumulated a $2.6 million operating deficit. By selling off half the theater's land, streamlining operations and refinancing what remained using state bonds, the company saw its first profit in 30 years two years into Mr. Jones's tenure. Before leaving, he set in motion a campaign that raised $6.2 million for a new production center. Now Shakespeare & Company is ''completely out of the woods,'' said Tina Packer, its artistic director, who attributed that largely to Mr. Jones's efforts. 
 At Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., where Mr. Jones arrived in 1989, the staff had been reduced and the indebted company planned limited performances. Mr. Jones ''quickly established a good rapport with key donors'' that allowed it to eliminate debt and mount a full season, said Paul Griswold, the company's finance director. Mr. Jones also oversaw a turnaround at the Limon Dance Company in New York City starting in 1992. 
 With his friendly demeanor and no-nonsense business approach, Mr. Jones, a native of Ewing and a graduate of Rider University, offers something of a contrast to his predecessors. For years, the Paper Mill was defined in large part by its lavish musicals and the colorful promoter of this brand of theater, the former executive director Angelo Del Rossi, who stepped down in late 2004. 
 With his departure, the theater shifted gears, bringing in Michael Gennaro as president and chief executive. His more avant-garde artistic vision -- he had previously managed the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago -- did not translate into ticket sales. Mr. Gennaro left the Paper Mill at the start of this year and is now executive director of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I. 
 In addition to working with the town, Mr. Jones plans to focus on the theater's bottom line, starting with the hiring of a new finance director, David Topchik, and replacing several consultants with permanent staff members. He is also expected to name Mark S. Hoebee artistic director; he has been acting artistic director since Mr. Gennaro's departure.

HEADLINE: Nobody Knows

BYLINE: By JAMES GRANT

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS cannot reliably forecast recessions. Nor can they detect for certain when a recession is in progress. Only after the fact do the official cyclical timekeepers identify the beginning and ending dates of a slump. 
 Though deficient in the powers of foresight and observation, economists do believe they know how to treat an economy on the brink of recession, as this one seems to be. They administer what non-economists know as the ''hair of the dog that bit you.'' 
 But booms not only precede busts, they also cause them. Bargain-basement interest rates are a potent stimulant. Borrowing more than they might at higher rates, people stretch. Businesses stock up on labor, machinery and buildings. Consumers buy cars and houses -- houses, especially, these past five years. The G.D.P. takes flight. 
 Then unwelcome facts intrude. Easy money, it seems, was an illusion. Society was not so rich as it seemed. The prosperous future for which people had collectively prepared is slow to arrive. The inflation rate picks up. Supposedly creditworthy consumers and businesses turn out to be risky. They were creditworthy only so long as lenders were willing to advance them more and more funds at those ever-so-affordable low rates. 
 Now what to do? Why, slash interest rates to coax forth still more lending and borrowing. It's the customary curative, seemingly as humane as it is politic. 
 And if recessions served no useful purpose, it might be. But recessions do. On Wall Street, they speak of ''corrections.'' What corrections correct are errors in judgment. So do recessions.
 They allow the sorting out of boomtime error. They permit -- indeed, force -- the repricing of inflated assets. In a downturn, previously overpriced businesses, houses and buildings are made affordable again. 
 Naturally, people hate these painful, salutary interludes. Nobody likes insecurity, bankruptcy and joblessness. So the Fed keeps slashing interest rates. And this balm does mitigate the suffering. Homeowners and businesses refinance their debts. Fewer houses are thrown on an overstocked market.
 Observe, however, that the great preceding illusion is undispelled. Prices have not come down as they should have. Neither has indebtedness. The architecture of the economy remains as it was. Land, labor and capital are still structured for an imagined glittering future. 
 Presently, a new upcycle does begin, but it's slow off the mark. The world's top economy seems curiously sluggish. And the economists and politicians ask, ''What happened to America's dynamic economy?'' The answer: It's wrapped in the coils of debt. 
 -- James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

HEADLINE: Climate Plan Looks Beyond Bush's Tenure

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; Thomas Fuller reported from Nusa Dua, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York. Peter Gelling contributed reporting from Nusa Dua.

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
The world's faltering effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions got a new lease on life on Saturday, as delegates from 187 countries agreed to negotiate a new accord over the next two years -- pushing the crucial debates about United States participation into the administration of a new American president.
 Many officials and environmental campaigners said American negotiators had remained obstructionist until the final hour of the two-week convention and had changed their stance only after public rebukes that included boos and hisses from other delegates.
 The resulting ''Bali Action Plan'' contains no binding commitments, which European countries had sought and the United States fended off. The plan concludes that ''deep cuts in global emissions will be required'' and provides a timetable for two years of talks to shape the first formal addendum to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty since the Kyoto Protocol 10 years ago. 
 ''The next presidential election takes place at the halfway point in these treaty talks,'' David D. Doniger, who directs climate policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council and served in the Clinton administration, said on his Web log on Saturday. ''So the U.S. will field a new team in the second half. And there are good odds that the next president will get serious on global warming.''
 But the White House, while calling the negotiating plan ''quite positive'' in a printed statement, said the problem lay elsewhere. It described ''serious concerns'' about the limited steps taken by emerging economic powers. 
 Without citing China and India by name, it clearly singled them out, saying: ''The negotiations must proceed on the view that the problem of climate change cannot be adequately addressed through commitments for emissions cuts by developed countries alone. Major developing economies must likewise act.''
 In the talks, China and other emerging powers did inch forward, agreeing for the first time to seek ways to make ''measurable, reportable and verifiable'' emissions cuts. But those countries showed no signs of agreeing to any mandatory restrictions any time soon, saying their priority remained growing out of poverty. 
 The finish to the negotiations came after a last-minute standoff in the public plenary at the end of a day of high emotions, with the co-organizer of the conference, Yvo de Boer, fleeing the podium at one point as he held back tears. 
 The standoff started when developing countries demanded that the United States agree that the eventual pact measure not only poorer countries' steps, but also the effectiveness of financial and technological assistance from wealthier ones. 
 The United States capitulated in that open session, which many observers and delegates said included more public acrimony than any of the treaty conferences since the 1992 framework. 
 The concession, though, came after a more profound shift by the Bush administration, which agreed during the two-week conference to pursue a new pact fulfilling the unmet goals of the original treaty; the pact would take effect in 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol expires.
 While many observers described the United States change as a U-turn, it was the culmination of months of movement by the Bush administration, which had for years insisted that the 1992 treaty was enough to avoid dangerous human interference with the climate. 
 In 2005 talks in Montreal, for example, the American negotiating team walked out of one session, rejecting any talk of formal negotiations to improve on that pact.
 Since then, the Bush administration has been confronted by new scientific data on climate change and by growing political pressure both internationally and domestically. 
 Still, while accepting on Saturday the need for a new agreement, the United States retained the flexibility that it had sought at the outset, fending off European attempts to set binding commitments on emission reductions. American negotiators said that was vital to gain global consensus. 
 The targets sought by Europe and others remain in the action plan -- including the need for rich countries to cut emissions by 2020 up to 40 percent below 1990 levels, and a 50 percent cut in emissions globally by 2050. But they are now a footnote to the nonbinding preamble, not a main feature of the plan.
 Andrew Light, an expert on environmental ethics at the University of Washington who was in Bali, criticized the Bush administration for insisting on those targets being sidelined, saying the United States had, in essence, rejected the foreboding climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which it had repeatedly praised in recent weeks. 
 ''We could have moved on from here with a confident range of future cuts,'' Mr. Light said. ''Instead we have to move on with the same continued uncertainty. At the beginning of the week I was really heartened by the public praise the U.S. delegation was giving to the I.P.C.C. and now I can't help but think, was it all lip service?'' 
 Some environmental groups criticized Europe for not sticking to its guns. But it appeared that, in the end, the Europeans followed a path recommended in a speech last Monday by former Vice President Al Gore, fresh from receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
 He advised Bali negotiators to look beyond the Bush administration, whose tenure ends in one year. 
 Beyond the histrionics and the politics, there were deeper reasons for the continuing clashes: in particular, the huge wave of industrialization and economic growth sweeping Asia. 
 The United States and Europe were largely responsible for taking the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted by the burning of fossil fuels, to its current concentration of 380 parts per million from 280, a level which, until the industrial revolution, was not exceeded in at least 650,000 years. 
 But the growth in emissions for decades to come will largely be driven by developing countries, where some two billion people still cook on firewood or dung and crave the comforts and prosperity that come with abundant energy. 
 According to a recent analysis led by economists at the Electric Power Research Institute, if rich and poor countries do not together divert from ''business as usual,'' the concentration by 2040 could exceed 450 parts per million, a threshold that many scientists say could set in motion harmful changes for centuries to come.
 Europe prevailed over the United States in one area, insisting that the next two years of talks proceed on two tracks: one for those countries, including the United States, not committing to mandatory limits, and a second building on the Kyoto Procotol, the 1997 update to the original treaty that requires emissions reductions in 36 major industrialized nations, but has been rejected by the United States. 
 The United States team in Bali had fought against that, demanding that a new agreement encompass the world's major polluters and have sufficient flexibility, and no hard targets, to do that. 
 But in the end the United States had to agree to two tracks to avoid a total breakdown of the talks. 
 That is important, environmental campaigners said, because it guarantees work toward new mandatory gas restrictions in 2012, when the limits under the current Kyoto accord expire. 
 It also sustains a mechanism that, in theory, the United States could join under a new administration -- if Congress becomes less insistent that the biggest developing countries move in lockstep. 
 That demand is reflected in some language in the current climate bill moving forward in the Senate, which demands ''comparable'' action from such countries.
 There were many moments of drama and theater in the negotiations, at a resort complex on the southern tip of Bali, involving 11,000 officials, environmentalists, industry lobbyists and journalists. But nothing else matched the point on Saturday, in the final tumultuous plenary, when the American team was booed for trying to block a proposal by India. 
 Kevin Conrad, the negotiator from Papua New Guinea, rebuked the American delegation. ''If for some reason you are not willing to lead, leave it to the rest of us,'' he said. ''Please, get out of the way.''
 He was alluding to remarks made by an American official, James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, last week to a Reuters reporter, who quoted him as saying, ''The U.S. will lead, and we will continue to lead, but leadership also requires others to fall in line and follow.''
 That statement had become a sore point to many delegations.
 A few more statements were made, but none of America's traditional allies came to its defense. 
 Finally, Paula Dobriansky, the lead American negotiator, spoke. 
 ''We came here to Bali because we want to go forward as part of a new framework,'' said Ms. Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs. ''We believe we have a shared vision and we want to move that forward. We want a success here in Bali. We will go forward and join consensus.'' 
 The delegates erupted in lengthy applause, realizing that a deal was finally at hand.

HEADLINE: WHERE DID SERVICE GO?

 BODY:
To the Editor: Thank you for Aboard Planes, Class Conflict; (Nov. 25) on the woes of travelers in economy class. We don't expect elaborate meals or lay-down seats, and I don't think most expect gracious service. But travelers do have a right to expect attentive treatment, space that permits medically sound space and movement, adequate and clean bathrooms and like ''amenities.'' Many wags have noted that the absence of food service represents an improvement, so that's not the issue. 
 The lack of comfort and a contempt for travelers has become the elephant in the living room, and finally that is being discussed in public. I'm grateful that the cattle car metaphor has revealed the elephant. Many of us are canceling our elective trips and longing to get back to some civilized travel. It should be possible to achieve that, and perhaps your article will help get a movement off the ground. 
 William Cutter Los Angeles
 To the Editor: If you think that flying has become a miserable experience for the passengers, imagine what it is like for flight attendants.
 I have been a flight attendant for American Airlines for close to 30 years, and I would like the flying public to be assured that the flight attendants are solidly on their side.
 I cannot begin to explain the frustration and humiliation we feel coming to work to do almost nothing but apologize for things for which we have absolutely no control.
 We would love to have back the meals, pillows, blankets, clean airplanes and leg room. And oh how we wish for on-time arrivals and departures.
 And if the working conditions are not enough to make us cranky and depressed, consider the fact that most of us have not only had our food and rest taken away, but have lost a minimum of 30 percent of our salaries as well. Everything about our work lives has changed over the last six years, none for the good. What I do not understand is why there is not more outrage from the coach passengers. Because of their suffering and the airline employees' sacrifices, airline executives have been able to reward themselves with hefty annual bonuses.

HEADLINE: Handmade 2.0

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER. 
Rob Walker writes the Consumed column for the magazine. His book, ''Buying In: The Secret Dialogue Between What We Buy and Who We Are,'' will be published by Random House next June.

 BODY:
The declaration from something called the Handmade Consortium materialized on a Web site called buyhandmade.org in late October. ''I pledge to buy handmade this holiday season, and request that others do the same for me,'' it said, and you could type in your name to ''sign'' on; within a few weeks, more than 6,500 people had done so. ''Buying handmade is better for people,'' a statement on the site read in part, and ''better for the environment,'' because mass production is a ''major cause'' of global warming, among other things. There were links to an anti-sweatshop site and a Wal-Mart watchdog site. 
 The pledge echoed the idealistic language of a tree-hugger activist group, but actually the consortium's most prominent member was the online shopping bazaar Etsy, a very much for-profit entity that bills itself as ''your place to buy & sell all things handmade.'' Etsy does not fulfill orders from an inventory; it's a place where sellers set up virtual storefronts, giving the site a cut of sales. While eBay rose to prominence nearly a decade ago as an endless garage sale for the auctioning of collectibles and bric-a-brac, Etsy is more of an online craft fair, or art show, where the idea is that individuals can sell things that they have made. How many such people can there be? At last count, more than 70,000 -- about 90 percent of whom were women -- were using Etsy to peddle their jewelry, art, toys, clothes, dishware, stationery, zines and a variety of objects from the mundane to the highly idiosyncratic. Each seller has a profile page telling shoppers a bit about themselves, and maybe offering a link to a blog or a MySpace page or a mailing list; most have devised some clever store or brand name for whatever they're selling.
 Maybe you're interested in a ''random music generator'' called the Orb of Sound ($80), built by an Australian tinkerer calling himself RareBeasts. Or a whistle made out of a tin can and bottle caps ($12), by loranscruggs, near Seattle. Or the ''hand-painted antique ceramic doll-head planters'' sold under the name Clayflower22 by a retired schoolteacher near Las Cruces, N.M. Or the ''Kaleidoscope Pearberry Soapsicle'' ($5), made by a woman in Daytona Beach, Fla., who calls her shop Simply Soaps. Or a porcelain bowl with an image of a skull on it, from a Chicago couple who call themselves Circa Ceramics. Or an original painting from an artist in Athens, Ga., who goes by the moniker the Black Apple. 
 Browsing Etsy is both exhilarating and exhausting. There is enough here to mount an astonishing museum exhibition. There is also plenty of junk. Most of all there is a dizzying amount of stuff, and it is similarly difficult to figure out how to characterize what it all represents: an art movement, a craft phenomenon or shopping trend. Whatever this is, it's not something that Etsy created but rather something that it is trying to make bigger, more visible and more accessible -- partly by mixing high-minded ideas about consumer responsibility with the unsentimental notion of the profit motive.
 On July 29, Etsy registered its one-millionth sale and is expecting to hit two million items sold by mid-December. Shoppers spent $4.3 million buying 300,000 items from the site's sellers in November alone -- a 43 percent increase over the previous month. Thus far in December, the site has had record-breaking sales every day. Only about two years old, the company is not currently profitable but is somewhat unusual among Internet-based start-ups of the so-called Web 2.0 era in having a model that does not depend on advertising revenue. It depends on people buying things, in a manner that the founders position as a throwback to the way consumption ought to be: individuals buying from other individuals. ''Our ties to the local and human sources of our goods have been lost,'' the Handmade Pledge site asserts. ''Buying handmade helps us reconnect.'' The idea is a digital-age version of artisanal culture -- that the future of shopping is all about the past. 
 STEP 1: Weave Do-It-Yourself Spirit Into a Community 
 The path that has led to Etsy begins with a motto -- do it yourself -- that implies distaste for consumer culture. That notion was front and center last year, when O'Reilly Media, best known for computer-related publications, introduced a magazine called Craft. A 
 spinoff of Make magazine (a latter-day Popular Mechanics for the hacker-tinkerer set), Craft addresses ''the new craft movement.'' The issue contained a variety of instructional projects: ''Stitch a Robot,'' one cover line read. ''Felt an iPod Cocoon,'' said another. Inside, an essay by a longtime crafter named Jean Railla argued that making something yourself is a form of ''political statement'' and a protest against chain stores that are turning ''America into one big mini-mall.'' 
 This dissonant-sounding juxtaposition -- politics and felted iPod cocoons? -- is what makes the craft thing hard to pin down. Of course Railla wasn't saying that stitching a robot is akin to a march on Washington; she was writing about a broader do-it-yourself idea that she has watched gradually permeate popular culture over the course of a decade.
 Railla, who is 37, founded a Web site called Getcrafty back in 1998, when renewed interest in traditional crafts among young women was still something of a curiosity. It wasn't as if such skills and hobbies had ceased to exist; from Martha Stewart to nationwide chains like Michaels, major businesses catered to a range of quilt makers and scrapbookers. But the new wave of crafters infused uncool-sounding domestic skills like knitting and sewing with a postpunk attitude that revolved partly around mall-rejecting self-sufficiency. Railla wrote about how to make your own soap and lip gloss -- and also about how to knit a bikini. ''I really came to it from more of an indie-rock, do-it-yourself kind of political place,'' she told me recently. ''Sort of married with making peace with feminism.''
 Getcrafty was filled with project ideas and how-tos as well as discussion forums, which played a crucial role in building the craft-as-community idea that Etsy would later tap into. ''Knitting is part of the same do-it-yourself ethos that spawned zines and mixtapes,'' Debbie Stoller, editor of Bust, a pop-culture-meets-feminism magazine, declared. Stoller wrote a series of ''Stitch N Bitch'' books, which became part of a trend toward the formation of social-crafting groups across the country. More Web gathering points emerged, like Craftster and SuperNaturale. Offline, a communal make-stuff group called Church of Craft formed chapters in several cities. 
 Crafting had attained a subculture status by 2004, when Railla hired a New York University student named Robert Kalin and some friends to redesign Getcrafty. Kalin had been studying philosophy and classics, but, he told me, he was pessimistic about the job-market value of his degree and was looking for something more entrepreneurial. While he had a bit of woodworking experience, he and his friend Chris Maguire were basically techie types; they hadn't known much about the handcrafting movement that was bringing so many young women to Getcrafty. ''We were the only guys around,'' Kalin recalls.
 Soon he had an idea for a different kind of site that this burgeoning craft community might find useful: an online marketplace. By that time, plenty of crafters were not simply doing it themselves -- they were selling what they had done. There's nothing surprising about people who enjoy doing something (playing guitar, writing poetry, knitting a bikini) wondering if maybe there isn't a way to make a living at it. But the scene that Kalin stumbled upon turned out to be brimming with entrepreneurial spirit. 
 Consider, for instance, the Austin Craft Mafia. This group of nine indiepreneurs traces its roots to a 2001 meeting of young women who hoped to leverage their craft skills into a way to quit their day jobs. Each member built her own business and helped the others do the same. They continued to offer advice and connections with others in Austin and, eventually, beyond. There are now 42 officially sanctioned Craft Mafias, in cities from Omaha to New Orleans to Anchorage to Glasgow. (The Austin Craft Mafia, like Etsy, is a member of the consortium backing the Handmade Pledge.)
 For some years now, crafters have been selling on their own sites online. Craft boutiques have opened as fast as independent book and record stores closed. And a new wave of fairs has come to life, not of the country-craft, ''Bless This Mess'' style, but venues for a younger, more indie-punk aesthetic. These happen all over the country now -- the Bazaar Bizarre in Boston and other cities, the Renegade Craft Fair in Chicago, the Girlie Show in Oklahoma City -- and each one seems to get bigger every year.
 So it's no surprise that when Kalin suggested something akin to an online version of a craft fair but infinitely large and open all the time, to everyone, everywhere, Railla thought it was a ''brilliant'' idea. She was happy to consult on the new enterprise but gives Kalin and his partners credit for spotting the business opportunity and making it a reality. To her, crafting remains more of a philosophy, and its satisfactions are in participation, not consumption. She reiterated that idea in her Craft magazine column, arguing that the practice satisfies the urge to create, values feminine art forms, provides relief from the digital world and, yes, is a form of ''political statement'' against the dehumanizing global supply chain.
 But she also understands the appeal of the handmade to those who might not have the inclination to do the making. Readers of the first issue of Craft magazine might have eagerly followed the instructions to stitch a robot. But surely others gravitated to a related article about the popularity of a style of hand-stitched robot that you could buy on Etsy. The article discussed how one doll maker's creations were so popular that every time she posted a new one, it sold within 20 minutes. It was hard to read this without wanting to visit the site immediately and see what the fuss was about. And perhaps to participate in the idea of D.I.Y., at least by buying D.I.Y. 
 STEP 2: Emboider With Webbiness 
 This summer I visited the Etsy offices, in downtown Brooklyn . The company that Robert Kalin and his pals founded now has about 50 employees. (They remain jokily cryptic about what the name they chose for their enterprise means. It has been variously suggested that it is a play on the Latin phrase ''et si'' (''and if''), or that the secret can be found in Fellini's ''8 1/2.'') I got a tour of the rambling warren, spread over about 6,000 square feet on the sixth floor of an old building on Gold Street. It had a clubhouse feel that was equal parts venture-backed start-up and D.I.Y. enterprise: Here was the skateboard ramp; there the homemade greenscreen for Web casts. I was introduced to a number of young women at work silk-screening Etsy promotional materials onto bandannas, and also to the company lawyer.
 Kalin is 27 and seems even younger, with boyish features and reddish hair. Serious in a way that could be read as either earnest or deadpan, he told me the stories behind a stuffed animal and an interesting metal sculpture on his desk, both from Etsy sellers. He then handed me a piece of crocheted bacon. In order to explain his company, he offered me a seat and reached for a book. It was a children's book, about a fish named Swimmy. He pulled his chair closer and read aloud. The upshot was that a whole bunch of little fish gang up and begin swimming in a formation that resembles one huge fish, thus warding off predators. In their formation, the fish named Swimmy assumes the position where the eye would be. Kalin closed the book. ''We want to be the eye,'' he said, in case I'd missed the point. ''Like Swimmy.''
 Tilting back in his chair, he spoke for some time, with the supreme self-confidence of the college bull-session raconteur, referencing Marshall McLuhan, beginning a discourse about the problem with central banks with the phrase, ''If you read the Founding Fathers . . . ,'' and so on. He wasn't so much making arguments as patiently spelling out the way things work. He informed me, for instance, that young people today are different, having grown up with the Web and all. He had sought guidance from his grandfather about making Etsy a reality but ignored the tedious advice about writing a business plan, figuring the site itself would serve that function. Later he wrote a ''fan letter'' to one of the founders of Flickr, the popular online photo-sharing site, and she became an investor. A founder of del.icio.us, the social-bookmarking site, invested, and so did a New York venture-capital firm. Kalin's grandfather was flummoxed.
 All of which is a familiar-enough Internet-start-up story line. I was more interested in what made Etsy seem different from so many current efforts to ''build community'' online: the luck or genius of the site is that Kalin and the other founders encountered in the D.I.Y./craft scene something that was already social, community-minded, supportive and aggressively using the Web. It seemed to me that the company's future would depend not only on the success of its sellers but also on its reputation among them. Nor could its reputation simply be for business acumen. If all Etsy did was channel D.I.Y.-ism into a profit machine, it could easily be seen as monetizing -- exploiting -- the creativity and hustle of 70,000 indiepreneurs. There was a cultural dimension, too.
 Kalin clearly understood all this. The company does not, for instance, demand exclusivity. Indeed it seems to want its sellers to market themselves aggressively on their own sites, in stores, at fairs. So in its idealized role as Swimmy, Etsy constantly holds entrepreneurial workshops (how to build your ''global microbrand''), pointing to ''best practices'' among Etsy sellers, offering shop critiques, advising how to ''write a killer press release.'' Its magazine-videocast, The Storque, often feels like a D.I.Y. business school. In addition, Kalin has hired about a half-dozen of the best Etsy sellers to work directly for the company, in jobs meant to spread their skills to as many sellers as possible. Some help run Etsy Labs, a community-centric program held at the company's headquarters, teaching craft skills.
 On some level the Etsy idea is not really techno-progressive at all. It's nostalgic. The company is host to a book club, which Kalin participates in, and when I visited, the most recent reading assignment was ''The Wal-Mart Effect,'' a book that assesses the societywide impact of that mass retailer's success. Kalin seems flabbergasted that anyone would shop at Wal-Mart to save 12 cents on a peach instead of supporting a local farmer. Buying something from the person who made it is ''the opposite of what Wal-Mart is right now: just this massively impersonal experience,'' he told me earlier. ''When you get an item from Etsy, there's this whole history behind it. There's a person behind it.'' I asked whether Wal-Mart was really the right comparison, given Etsy's eclectic, artistic merchandise, and the more workaday product mix of a big-box discounter. He brushed that aside, noting that Etsy sells clothes, which everyone needs. 
 His real point, it seemed to me, was not about Wal-Mart or any other particular retailer. It was far more expansive. If the marketplace today has become alienating and disconnected, then buying something handmade, from another individual, rolls back the clock to an era before factory labor and mass production. That's a lot of clock-turning, if you recall Adam Smith's excitement about the efficiency of an 18th-century pin factory. Really, Kalin has a problem with the entire modern marketplace. ''Everything since the Industrial Revolution has been so fragmented,'' he told me, sounding more like a character in Slacker, wasting time in a cafe, than a guy running a briskly growing business.
 Kalin is nothing if not grandiose about what he thinks Etsy can accomplish. For example, he knows that individual crafters face a problem of scale: there is only so much one person can produce. (Hence the Industrial Revolution.) So he mentions creating ''co-production'' sites across the country, where groups of crafters would band together in a co-op-style model, ideally occupying space in distressed areas and offering training to people who want to learn handcrafting skills. Handmade isn't a fad, he told me, it's a resurgence, one that is of a piece with the booming interest in organic food. In 25 years, he said, Etsy would be both worldwide and personal, a global-local marketplace, a Web version of the Athenian agora.
 The business proposition behind this extravagant vision is rather more straightforward. Etsy charges 20 cents per listing and 3.5 percent of the final sale price; this is generally lower and certainly less complicated than eBay's fee structure; it also charges up to $15 if creators want to highlight a particular item on the site's high-traffic showcase pages. More competition may be mixed news for individual artisans as newcomers keep flooding in to peddle their wares, but it's all good news for Etsy. The company makes money from successful crafters, but it also makes money from wishful thinkers who never get beyond the hobby stage. The entrepreneur who makes something by hand might face a scale problem. Etsy doesn't. 
 That said, what's surprising about Kalin is that his interest really does seem to transcend the profit motive. It's pretty clear that he not only respects the values of the D.I.Y. world and the earnest idealism of the Handmade Pledge; he also really believes in them. The quasi-libertarian certainty of the Web entrepreneur and the equally confident ex-philosophy-student discourse about the alienating nature of mass society seem contradictory. But to Kalin, they are intertwined. ''In a way,'' he said when I met him in Brooklyn, ''I see Etsy as an art project.'' And after a brief recap of art history through Duchamp, he suggested that Etsy could ''disturb'' the way people see the world, rethinking what makes their possessions important or trivial, leading us to re-evaluate the way we consume. Surely plenty of crafters see what they are up to as a mix of art and business as well -- although they may be coming at that from a somewhat different angle. 
 STEP 3: Stitch Together Ideals and Entrepreneurialism 
 This past March, I went to Pittsburgh to attend the first-ever Craft Congress, which was made up of about 60 of the best-known and most established figures on the D.I.Y./crafter scene. I had heard the agenda would include a discussion of how their movement ought to be defined and thought about by participants. This is what makes crafting feel distinct from a garden -variety consumer trend: It's hard to imagine the leading figures in, say, the premium-denim fad or the limited-edition-sneaker craze getting together to hash out what those things are really about, what participating in them really means.
 I wondered if the discussion would be translated into some sort of manifesto. Would they lay out rules for who is a crafter and who isn't? Would they determine where screen-printing on bulk-ordered T-shirts, or working with factory-made beads, falls on the continuum of ''handmade''-ness? (I had read some spirited discussion in Etsy's forums about the definition of ''mass produced.'') I was also interested in the Craft Congress because I'd heard that someone from Etsy would be there, and I wondered how the company would be perceived. 
 The congress participants (almost all were women) included organizers of fairs in Atlanta, Toronto, Washington and elsewhere, as well as crafters from all around the country. Many had met online but never before in person. The discussions and presentations, spread over two days, began with an attempt at ''defining the craft movement'' and ranged into politics and recent corporate interest in D.I.Y.-ism. But there was little interest in rule making and manifesto-writing. Jenny Hart, an Austin Craft Mafia founder, went out of her way to make the point that the congress participants should be careful not to come across like self-appointed leaders. 
 The topics of discussion often weren't ideological at all, but more practical matters like marketing tactics, taxes and health insurance. Etsy was represented by Matthew Stinchcomb, its 32-year-old marketing chief. When he met Kalin, he was in a rock band. Tired of touring, he got involved in Etsy, applying the sorts of underground promotional ideas he picked up as a musician, like creating Etsy ''street teams.'' 
 Gregarious and easygoing, he gave the Etsy pitch. ''I think there's a larger story that we are selling,'' he said, presenting Etsy's goal as recreating the marketplaces of old. Marketing has ''crass connotations,'' he allowed, but to make those one-on-one connections, sellers had to promote themselves. Later he added that the craft movement needed to keep ''providing resources for each other, so we're not all working against each other.'' In other words, he fit right in: his presentation -- like the congress in general -- was equal parts entrepreneurial seminar and subculture colloquium. 
 Somehow all the talk made that most conventional American path -- small business -- seem like an instrument of radicalism. I talked to another attendee, a 29-year-old crafter named Faythe Levine, about the motivations of craft artist-entrepreneurs. She had told me about the thrill of discovering the craft scene: ''No corporate backing -- it was people doing things, full-on D.I.Y.'' Last year she began working on a documentary called ''Handmade Nation,'' and by the time of the Craft Congress had videotaped 80 hours of interviews with crafters in a dozen cities. Some of her subjects were making a living, but some were still trying to quit dull day jobs, and others were stay-at-home moms. ''I didn't necessarily ask people if they were making stuff and selling it to be political,'' she said. But many told her that ''running a small business yourself, and trying to separate yourself from the masses -- it's a political statement in its own. That was kind of interesting, and it did come up repeatedly.''
 It's still tempting to characterize anything that looks edgy and has an online component as somehow a function of youth culture. But the age of the average Etsy seller turns out to be 34. Many crafters no doubt feel passionately about the ideals suggested by the Handmade Pledge a horror of sweatshop labor and corporate conformity, concern about the environment and would be pleased to see the broader consumer culture embrace them too. Meanwhile there is also the more salient matter of how to make a rewarding, meaningful and satisfying living without having to give up on those ideals. The women who have led the craft movement don't want to work for the Man. But many are also motivated by having reached adulthood at a time when the Man is slashing benefits, reneging on pensions, laying people off and, if hiring, is looking for customer-service reps and baristas. This is not a utopian alt-youth framework; it's a very real-world, alt-grown-up framework. 
 Listening to the discussions at the Craft Congress, it seemed to me that while there's a case to be made that this is an art movement, or an ideological movement, or a shopping movement, it is also -- and probably fundamentally -- a work movement. At one point, talk turned to corporate interest in D.I.Y.-ism, and in particular how companies like Toyota were sponsoring craft fairs. Some argued that ''megacorporations'' trying to burnish their hipster images had no legitimate role on the scene. Others suggested that corporate money could be put to beneficial uses. No consensus emerged, but toward the end of the discussion one crafter articulated the precise commerce-and-ideals dilemma of the crafty businessperson. ''If we can't have a job where we make enough money,'' she observed, ''then this movement isn't sustainable.''
 STEP 4: Sell 
 It is worth noting another element of the Handmade Pledge: ''The ascendancy of chain-store culture and global manufacturing has left us dressing, furnishing and decorating alike.'' It's a shrewd pitch, because the consumer craving for novelty, for the unique, the special, seems unquenchable. It has spawned, for instance, a number of blogs dedicated specifically to ferreting out the exciting new thing, usually with a helpful link to a potential transaction. (One of the most popular such sites, Design*Sponge, is another backer of the Handmade Consortium.) Buying something from an indie craft artist can result in a buyer-seller connection, but it can also make consumption itself feel like a creative act. This is the crucial element fueling the craft boom: People show up at the fairs, the shops and the Web sites. And they spend money.
 One afternoon last summer, a young artist based in Athens, Ga., unveiled her latest work. Emily Martin is 24 years old. She graduated from art school about two years ago and has never had a gallery show. She announced the date and time of the unveiling on her blog, so at 2 p.m. on Aug. 28, I clicked over and watched as she posted the new work to her Etsy shop: Six original paintings priced between $160 and $250, and nine hand-sewn dolls, for $37 to $65. They disappeared faster than I could click ''refresh.'' By 2:02 p.m. most had been sold, and Martin had made about $1,400 (minus fees). Martin fully expected to be working as a waitress and confining her art-making to her off hours at this stage of her life. Instead, the Black Apple, as she is known on Etsy, is a full-time artist and perhaps the site's most famous success story. 
 Martin's paintings often depict cartoonish girls with unnaturally wide eyes, and her shy voice sounds as if it were emanating from one of these innocent figures. ''You're told in art school, 'O.K., well, one out of a hundred of you is going to make a living with the training that you're getting here,' '' she said. While sweet and appealing, Martin's aesthetic is more thrift store than Chelsea gallery; she was ''really intimidated'' by ''the whole capital-A art thing.'' But at a local craft fair, someone told her about this new site called Etsy. ''The idea of a shop online, being a more democratic thing, really appealed to me,'' she says. As of early December, she had sold more than 10,000 items through her Etsy store -- mostly 8-by-10, open-edition prints priced at $13 apiece, but also postcards, buttons, hand-sewn dolls and original paintings. 
 It's a feel-good story of Webby empowerment and the triumph of a niche-culture underdog. Martin recognizes that what the Web in general, and Etsy in particular, has done for her is to make a market. It has exposed her work to more people than ever would have seen it in Athens, without any auditions for capital-A art power brokers. Just as important, though, is that her aesthetic turned out to have unusually broad appeal, and she doesn't know quite what to tell the aspiring crafter-artists who besiege her with requests for advice. ''I had no idea that my work would appeal to grandmas, 12-year-old girls, hipsters, guys buying things for their girlfriends and wives,'' she says. The real lesson of the Black Apple may be not how many Emily Martin stories there have been (not many) but how many people figure that they, too, can achieve what she has (lots).
 Inevitably, not everyone can, and it's no surprise that Etsy has detractors. Some point out that for all the talk of consumers wanting to escape mall-fueled conformity Etsy's online-mall format amplifies market-driven trends. (Images of birds, especially owls, are inexplicably popular. One crafter told me she was sick of making the same owl over and over -- but that's what her customers wanted.) Others grouse about another side effect, price pressure: The competition is so intense on the site that new crafters can't break out, and some established ones feel they cannot raise their prices. That's a particularly thorny problem if part of your sales pitch is that you've made a thing yourself; a careful artisan can't respond to lower prices with greater volume. The most extreme version of this critique practically makes Etsy sound like Wal-Mart in its ripple-effect power through the broader D.I.Y. business community.
 These aren't really Etsy problems; they are consumer-marketplace problems. An enterprise founded on its creator's passion still has to satisfy consumer demand if it's going to be a profitable enterprise. Consider another Etsy seller story, one less splashy, but perhaps more representative, than Emily Martin's. Circa Ceramics is two Chicago-based potters, Andy Witt and Nancy Pizarro. A few years ago, their work had a fairly traditional aesthetic Southwestern color schemes in stripes, flower shapes and other patterns. They sold these pieces at traditional fairs, or to business customers like coffee shops. 
 More recently they stumbled across some design blogs and learned about Etsy and the apparent demand for pottery work with an edgier look -- which the potters themselves happened to prefer. At the Renegade fair in Chicago, their booth was full of porcelain pieces of all kinds -- cups, magnets, wall-hanging tiles and so on -- decorated with images of manual typewriters, skulls, vintage cameras and bugs. It was their first time at Renegade, and they seemed enthusiastic about how it was going. Their gradual move toward the ''indie community,'' and to a customer base they describe as 25 to 35 years old, rather than 35 to 75, has been good for business. A year ago they opened an Etsy storefront, and while they weren't sure how many people would go for $30 coffee mugs ordered via mail, it turned out that hundreds would. Recently Circa Ceramics helped form the Etsy Chicago Street team. Etsy sales now represent 25 percent of their business, with orders going to customers as far away as Spain, Belgium, even Australia. 
 For Circa Ceramics, and for crafters in general, Etsy is another manifestation of how D.I.Y.-ism has evolved. Its motivation may still be the independence from capitalism that Railla wrote about. But it can also be about a form of independence economic independence within capitalism. Many of the artist-entrepreneurs opening up their virtual shops on Etsy want what Circa Ceramics or Emily Martin or the Austin Craft Mafia have achieved: Making a living from what they love to do. It's a goal that reconciles ideology and self-branding, not so much to change the world as to stake out a place in it.

HEADLINE: Frugal, Before Americans Cared

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
AMONG automaker start-ups, the efforts of Powel Crosley Jr. followed a path taken many times by idealistic industrialists: creating a car for the masses, without much regard for whether the masses wanted one or not. That single-mindedness, together with the practice of naming the car for its originator, often proved a one-way ticket to fiscal and automotive oblivion.
 Just before World War II, Crosley, the owner of a Cincinnati-based business empire that included radio and appliance manufacturing, broadcasting and the Cincinnati Reds baseball team, began making a line of tiny, economical vehicles -- transportation appliances that emphasized utility and practicality over high horsepower and flashy looks. 
 Years later, that formula worked for Volkswagen, and it may again for the Smart line when those cars arrive next year. But Crosley was virtually alone in the people's car business when he introduced his models, which used an air-cooled 2-cylinder engine in a chassis whose wheelbase was a mere 80 inches, at the 1939 World's Fair. 
 At first, it seemed that Crosley's timing was perfect. Available as sedans, convertibles, wagons and pickups, the cars became quite desirable when war broke out and gasoline rationing began. At 50 miles a gallon, a Crosley could stretch the era's basic four-gallon-a-week allotment into a reasonable 200 miles of driving. 
 Both before and after the war, Crosley's cars crossed class lines. The Mini or Prius of their day, Crosleys were embraced by the moneyed and celebrity classes. Pamela Churchill Harriman, then just 19, took delivery of one of the first 1939 models. Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Swanson, Art Linkletter and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower were all owners. But perhaps the most visible supporter was Frank Lloyd Wright. 
 In the mid-1930s Wright established a second location for his Taliesin design and architecture school, near Scottsdale, Ariz. After the war, he became fond of taking road trips from the original Taliesin, in Spring Green, Wis., to Taliesin West. Wright would generally make the trip in a Bentley, Lincoln, Cadillac or Mercedes. His followers weren't so lucky. They were banished to his fleet of Crosley Hotshots, painted his signature shade of Cherokee Red, a trip about as comfortable as crossing the country in a golf cart.
 Bob Lichty, a dealer of collector cars and an automotive historian based in Canton, Ohio, who has owned several Crosleys, has been enamored of them since driving one on his uncle's farm as a child. In Mr. Lichty's opinion, the Crosley was the first postwar compact, and possibly the only real American compact of the '40s and '50s. While other American compacts ''where just scaled down big cars, Crosleys were efficiently designed from the ground up as small cars,'' he said. ''Crosleys were just darned interesting little cars.''
 Against the herd of Detroit behemoths that swilled a seeming endless supply of cheap gasoline, Crosley fielded a line of plain, efficient small sedans, station wagons, pickups and odd designs. The offerings included a slab-sided sports car called the Hotshot, which some enthusiasts cite as the first American sports car, and a jeeplike vehicle known as the FarmOroad. 
 Crosley's innovations included the early adoption of disc brakes, but some advances proved troublesome. The four-cylinder Cobra engine used in later models, named for its copper-brazed construction, was efficient and ahead of its time with features like an overhead camshaft, but corrosion of the sheet-metal cylinder block resulted in premature engine failures. The design was replaced in 1949 with a more conventional cast-iron block. 
 Powel Crosley viewed cars as appliances, no different from Shelvador refrigerators or low-cost Crosley Pup radios. He even specified that his cars be no wider than 48 inches -- the standard size of a retail store's front doors -- so they could be sold in appliance dealerships. The cars were also narrow enough to fit two abreast in a railroad car. 
 The Crosley's extreme narrowness also figured into its advertising -- a 1951 sales brochure boasted that it was ''the safest car on the road.'' The company's reasoning was that Crosley owners were less likely to get sideswiped on a narrow road because they took up less of it. 
 Crosley Hotshots were frequently raced in the 1950s -- and are still campaigned today in vintage racing events -- giving birth to a cottage industry in performance parts to raise the output of the 44-cubic-inch, 26.5-horsepower engine. The patron saint of Crosley hot-rodders was Nick Brajevich, whose parts were sold under the Braje brand. 
 Bob Austin, general manager for communications of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in North America, is a Crosley fan of long standing. He bought his first at age 12, convincing his parents that the bodyless car was a large go-kart. Mr. Austin said he thought one reason Powel Crosley failed to establish a lasting auto empire was that he fundamentally misunderstood the psyche of car buyers. 
 In the 1950s, Americans didn't care to view cars as economical or efficient appliances. Instead, Mr. Austin said, romance, the freedom of travel and the new cross-continent highways were all part of the selling of the automobile. An efficient small automobile marketed with all the passion one musters to sell a refrigerator simply did not excite most Americans. 
 Because Crosley rejected the towering tailfins and yards of chrome that were the hallmarks of its contemporaries, it is less sought-after by collectors and a relative bargain. At collector-car auctions, a Hotshot in very good condition sells for about $15,000. A more common four-passenger convertible sold in October for just $6,720. But marketing matters: an expertly prepared wagon with faux wood panels brought $27,500 at a Gooding auction in Pebble Beach, Calif., in August 2006.

HEADLINE: A Carbon Cap That Starts in Washington

BYLINE: By JUDITH CHEVALIER. 
Judith Chevalier is a professor of economics and finance at the Yale School of Management.

 BODY:
THE United Nations conference on climate change wrapped up in Bali, Indonesia, last week without a firm commitment from the United States or China to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. While a binding global agreement would be the best way to cut back on those emissions, a more limited but still useful approach is available, and it is wending its way through Congress. 
 In its current version, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, as the bill is known, would cap American carbon consumption through a tradeable permit plan. Even among those who support tradeable permits, there is considerable debate about what level of emissions reductions is realistic. Critics also object that it would damage American competitiveness to commit to domestic reductions without parallel commitments from developing-country trade partners like China. 
 But instead of using Chinese inaction as an excuse to avoid dealing with the problem, we should consider why emissions from China are soaring. There are numerous factors, all stemming from China's rapid economic development. Yet one of the biggest is the enormous increase in China's production of manufactured goods for export. Indeed, a study by the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research in Britain estimated that in 2004, net exports accounted for 23 percent of Chinese greenhouse gas emissions.
 We know where most of those Chinese exports are headed -- to developed countries, like the United States, which accounts for about a quarter of them. A rough calculation suggests that almost 6 percent of Chinese carbon emissions are generated in the production of goods consumed here. That is the rough equivalent of the total emissions produced by Australia or France. 
 The Tyndall Center argues that carbon reduction policies should focus on carbon consumption, not emissions. That makes sense, especially in the absence of a binding global agreement.
 One goal of a tradeable permit system is to force consumer prices for goods to reflect the harm that the production of those goods causes the planet. For example, if a television were made using a high-emission process, the factory would have to buy many carbon permits, driving up the TV's price. A television made in a low-emission factory would require fewer permits, lowering its relative price. Consumers, of course, would have an incentive to choose the TV from the low-emission factory, and all factories would have an incentive to lower emissions. 
 A problem would arise, however, if a producer needed to buy permits to make televisions in a country with a carbon cap, while no permits were required in a country without a cap. The television from the country without the cap would be cheaper, consumers would prefer it, and there would be no economic incentive to cut emissions. Environmentalists call this the ''leakage problem'': just as a balloon squeezed at one end will bulge at the other, emissions caps applied in only some economies will lead to emissions surges in others. 
 A provision in the current version of the Climate Security Act links responsibility to carbon consumption, not production. This idea derives from a joint proposal by the American Electric Power Company and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The provision requires that importers of goods from countries without carbon caps obtain permits for the emissions resulting from the goods' production. While this requirement could be used to protect American jobs from foreign competition, if handled equitably, it could provide an elegant solution to the leakage problem. 
 If the United States adopted a tradable permit system that treated emissions from domestic producers identically to emissions associated with imported goods, then products that are more emissions-intensive, whether domestic or imported, would require more permits and thus be more expensive. Producers in the United States and abroad would have an incentive to reduce greenhouse gases to make their goods more competitive. 
 Of course, such a plan would have an immediate cost for Chinese producers and American consumers. Chinese production methods are now much more carbon-emission-intensive than American methods, so the plan would probably raise the average price of Chinese imports. The alternative, however, is to try to force the Chinese to adopt binding carbon caps similar to those considered in the United States. But that would also raise the Chinese imports' price. Moreover, Chinese adoption of carbon caps would apply to the whole economy and would be much more costly for China; an American carbon consumption permit system would shield the Chinese domestic sector. 
 ''The best policy -- both in terms of the environment and in terms of economic theory -- would be to have all countries take on binding emissions caps under an international agreement,'' said Nathaniel Keohane, director of economic policy and analysis at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''But we have to recognize that's not going to happen overnight.'' In the meantime, he said, the United States and other developed countries ''need to take the lead.'' He called carbon consumption caps ''a good first step.''
 ''FROM an environmental point of view,'' Mr. Keohane said, ''it would ensure that the pollution we cut here at home doesn't simply end up coming out of a smokestack somewhere else. It levels the playing field for American companies in the global economy. And it also helps us move toward a truly international system, by providing an incentive for developing countries to take on binding caps of their own.''
 The carbon consumption provision will face scrutiny under current trade agreements, but there is sound logic for including it in any emissions legislation. Most important, it would eliminate an excuse for doing nothing.

HEADLINE: You Can Almost Hear It Pop

BYLINE: By STEPHEN S. ROACH

 BODY:
THE American economy is slipping into its second post-bubble recession in seven years. Just as the bursting of the dot-com bubble led to a downturn in 2001 and '02, the simultaneous popping of the housing and credit bubbles is doing the same right now. 
 This recession will be deeper than the shallow contraction earlier in this decade. The dot-com-led downturn was set off by a collapse in business capital spending, which at its peak in 2000 accounted for only 13 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The current recession is all about the coming capitulation of the American consumer -- whose spending now accounts for a record 72 percent of G.D.P. 
 Consumers have no choice other than to retrench. Home prices are likely to fall for the nation as a whole in 2008, the first such occurrence since 1933. And access to home equity credit lines and mortgage refinancing -- the means by which consumers have borrowed against their homes -- is likely to be impaired by the aftershocks of the subprime crisis. 
 Consumers will have to resort to spending and saving the old-fashioned way, relying on income rather than assets even as mounting layoffs will make income growth increasingly sluggish. 
 For the rest of the world, this will come as a rude awakening. America's recession is likely to shift from homebuilding activity, its least global sector, to consumer demand, its most global. 
 There is hope that young consumers from rapidly growing developing economies can fill the void left by weakness in American consumers. Don't count on it. American consumers spent close to $9.5 trillion over the last year. Chinese consumers spent around $1 trillion and Indians spent $650 billion. It is almost mathematically impossible for China and India to offset a pullback in American consumption.
 America's central bank has mismanaged the biggest risk of our times. Ever since the equity bubble began forming in the late 1990s, the Federal Reserve has been ignoring, if not condoning, excesses in asset markets. That negligence has allowed the United States to lurch from bubble to bubble. 
 Fixated on the narrow ''core inflation'' rate, which excludes the necessities of food and energy, the Fed has ignored new and powerful linkages that have developed between economic activity and increasingly risky financial markets. 
 Over time, America's bubbles have gotten bigger, as have the segments of the real economy they have infected. The Fed needs to rethink its reckless, bubble-prone policy. Once the current crisis subsides, the economy will require the tight money of higher interest rates -- the only hope America has for breaking the lethal chain of endless asset bubbles.
 -- Stephen S. Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.

HEADLINE: Retire the Property Tax

BYLINE: By JOHN BRADY. 
John Brady, a former chairman of Madison's public library, is a retired executive and owner of the Web site www.Topretirements.com.

DATELINE: Madison 

 BODY:
 BY law, every five years each municipality in Connecticut must recalculate assessed property values. Here in Madison, our 2007 revaluations came out at the end of October. Thanks to a super-heated real estate market, average assessed values in town increased 39 percent. 
 As in many Connecticut towns, the revaluation process in Madison always creates winners and losers. Winners see their tax bills go down because their assessed value increased less than the average. The losers are those whose assessments were higher than average, and their taxes go up, sometimes way up. But there's a second loser: education. 
 Indeed, Connecticut has serious problems generating adequate municipal revenue to pay for things like education. Property taxes fail to adequately finance school budgets and a steady stream of state and federally mandated programs. Poorer cities simply don't have the tax base to provide adequate schools, while wealthy towns struggle as state aid is diverted to the poorest communities. 
 Last year, Gov. M. Jodi Rell tried to raise the state income tax to 5.5 percent from 5 percent to turn around Connecticut's long-term trend of declining contributions to education. Under her plan every district would get more education revenue, particularly cities that need the most help. But when the Democrats fought for a ''millionaire's tax'' instead, a partisan impasse resulted, the tax increase was dropped and education was the loser. 
 While Connecticut's officials are gridlocked, other states are tackling the issue of property taxes. Florida's Save Our Homes law, which caps increases in a home's assessed value at 3 percent, has been very popular in that state. Indeed, the predictable property taxes it creates is one reason many residents leave states like Connecticut to live in Florida. 
 The property tax is a concept whose better days are behind it. It concentrates on one asset while ignoring income. Two people in similar homes pay the same tax -- even if one lives on Social Security and the neighbor makes a huge salary and has millions in stocks. 
 The most obvious drawback of the current property tax system is that since it ignores a person's income, it causes undue hardship for retired people and those going through tough times. As baby boomers, many of whom have no defined-benefit pension plan, begin to retire in huge numbers, thousands in Connecticut will be forced out of their homes -- and most likely out of the state since affordable housing isn't easy to come by here.
 The other disadvantage of the property tax system is its impact on local education budgets, which is more complicated. In volatile real estate markets, big swings in valuations are controversial. Madison's last revaluation in 2002 resulted in 640 assessment appeals and 156 lawsuits. Commenting on the enormous economic and psychic costs of assessments, Thomas Scarpati, Madison's former first selectman, said that he ''would rather set himself on fire'' than go through another revaluation. 
 Taxpayers who have seen their taxes jump 25 percent or more in a single year are predisposed to vote no when education budgets go to referendum. Town officials understand this pressure, so they become loath to increase budgets. This in turn alienates their pro-education constituents.
 The basic problem is that the property tax does not spread the cost to a large enough economic base. After a revaluation a small number of taxpayers see their taxes go up (although their increases are frequently very high). But a surprising number of people see taxes go down or stay about the same -- and these folks are not helping to pay for the ever rising municipal budgets that are a reality all over the United States. 
 What we need to do is phase out the property tax and replace it with a municipal income tax. This tax would be set as a small percent of a person's state (or federal) tax or adjusted gross income. A municipal income tax has a number of advantages: everyone with a taxable income would contribute to the budget according to their true means. The tax base would be higher than it would be under property values. The system would be fairer, cheaper, easier to administer and less acrimonious. Most important, it could generate enough revenue to meet our town's growing needs.
 The property tax is ready for retirement. Somewhere there has to be an imaginative public official who can come up with an answer to the problem. Whether it is a simplified municipal income tax or something else, we need a solution.

HEADLINE: An Easy Trim

BYLINE: By DIANA FORTUNA. 
Diana Fortuna is the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan civic organization.

 BODY:
THE State of New York has begun preparing its annual budget using a quick start process that the governor and the Legislature approved last January. Starting three months earlier than normal, the process allows for longer and more open deliberations. The new procedures are intended to bring greater accountability to the practice of secretive last-minute negotiations over how to spend more than $120 billion of taxpayers' money.
 As part of the process, at the start of November, the governor released estimates of projected revenues and budget gaps. They present quite a challenge. A slowed economy and salary increases recently negotiated with employee unions have driven budget gaps to $4.3 billion in the coming year and $6.2 billion and $7.9 billion in the next two years. Legislators subsequently completed their version of the arithmetic. They concur that budget gaps are likely to be of this magnitude. 
 If state leaders want to avoid tax increases in what is already one of the most heavily taxed states in the nation, they will need to find savings of about $6 billion to $7 billion per year over the next three years.
 The good news is that at least $5 billion in annual savings can be generated without reducing state services. Some of these proposals will face strong political opposition from special interests. But in the end, elected officials will have to choose whether to sustain inefficient services by raising taxes and relying on fiscal gimmicks, or to exercise political leadership to limit spending to programs that serve the public effectively.
 The three largest areas of savings involve Medicaid ($2 billion in annual savings), fringe benefits for state employees ($1.1 billion) and ineffective economic development programs ($800 million). 
 MEDICAID New York spends far beyond national norms for its Medicaid program in total and per beneficiary. The state's spending per beneficiary, $7,910, is 69 percent above the national average. Yet the quality of care New Yorkers get is no better and is in some areas markedly worse. 
 New York could save money by reducing non-competitive institutional rates like those paid to nursing homes, which are higher than national norms even after adjusting for differences in the cost of living and the health of patients. The state could also close eligibility loopholes for individuals with significant personal assets, particularly those with enough money to defray the cost of their own care. And limiting how many hours of ''personal care services'' (like housekeeping services by home health attendants) the state's Medicaid program will cover would be a huge savings. 
 FRINGE BENEFITS Many state workers are now paid more than their private-sector counterparts; the generous health insurance and retirement packages developed to attract them to work in the public sector are, therefore, no longer necessary. 
 The state should restructure its health insurance to bring it in line with other public-sector employers. This means that an additional 4 percent contribution toward family plan premiums from current workers should be required. For retirees, New York should insist on a larger contribution toward premiums and eliminate repayment for Medicare Part B premiums, which cover doctors' services, outpatient hospital care, X-rays, laboratory services and other diagnostic tests. Only six states pay any part of their employees' Medicare premiums; New York pays the full cost.
 The state should also restructure pensions. Its employees and retirees have unusually generous pension benefits compared to other public and private-sector workers (with state-required contributions now costing $1.1 billion per year). The most practical approach would be to change the pension benefits for future employees by creating a new tier for them. 
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS New York's Empire Zones and Centers of Excellence, two large economic development programs, are not working. Empire Zones should be cut from the budget and the money set aside for Centers of Excellence should be reduced.
 The tax credits given away through the Empire Zone program will amount to $558 million this year. And yet, a 2004 audit by the state comptroller found that only 30 percent of recipients of these tax credits met or exceeded their employment targets, 23 percent reduced employment and the remainder fell short of their goal. Efforts to improve this program have failed, and it should, therefore, be ended.
 As for Centers of Excellence, the state has committed $586 million to this program. Of that, $342 million is intended for the State University of New York at Albany, while the remainder will be spread around less successful centers, which have not attracted essential private investment. The state should scale back the program to cover only SUNY/Albany. 
 Of course, there are a number of other moves the state could undertake: shrinking the size of the prison system to reflect the 11 percent drop in the number of inmates since 1999, increasing the work week for state employees to 40 hours from 37.5, and streamlining the judiciary system, as recommended by Chief Judge Judith Kaye.
 Even seemingly obvious changes, like going to a 40-hour work week (already the standard in most public-sector jobs) will meet fierce opposition. But New York's economy and its ability to provide jobs, depends on better fiscal discipline. 
 New Yorkers shouldn't have to pay higher taxes, lose jobs and put up with substandard services to please the special interests, and getting a handle on the state's budget is the best place to start.

HEADLINE: The Urge to Go Global

BYLINE: By KURT SCHNEIDER; as told to PATRICIA R. OLSEN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY father worked for Union Carbide on a joint venture with Nippon Steel in Japan. We moved to Tokyo in 1970 when I was 5 and stayed for three years.
 Instead of attending an American school, I went to an international school, which exposed me to different cultures. We were taught in English but took Japanese classes three times a week. I remember playing hide-and-seek in the house of a classmate whose father was the British ambassador to Japan.
 Every summer, Union Carbide would pay for the ex-pats to return to the states, but my family traveled instead. We went to India, Thailand, Egypt, Nepal and an island named Yap, near Guam, where they still used stones, with holes in them, for money. I saw a leper on a street in Katmandu in Nepal. When we traveled to the Nepal countryside, we learned that they used cow dung as a medicinal salve on wounds. 
 My first job after college was in advertising, working for Saatchi & Saatchi. At 23, I was an account executive with a 22-year-old assistant. By age 26, I was an account supervisor. I realized early that there were more ways to reach a goal than just my way. I found that the more control you give up, the more you end up getting. Give people the vision and hold them accountable, but let them do it their own way. They'll be more fulfilled and the work will be better.
 I also worked for Disney and Fox Sports Net. My biggest risk was becoming C.E.O. of Asimba, an Internet start-up that provided physical fitness training programs over the Web. The programs had won awards, but the Internet bubble burst and in 2001 the board directed me to shut the company down. I had to let the entire staff go except for about six people. 
 I arranged a purchase agreement with Weider Publishing and left on vacation with my family to the south of France. I'd dial in every night to perform due diligence.
 Then came Sept. 11, 2001. I returned and the sale fell through. I renegotiated the deal, but it ended up being a lot less lucrative for us, though we considered it a victory because of the environment at the time.
 Before joining the Globetrotters in May, I was executive vice president for marketing at World Wrestling Entertainment. That position allowed me to hone my operational skills much more than I could have in a bigger company.
 The founders, Vince and Linda McMahon, took the sport out of the smoke-filled arena of the past and created stars you could interact with on every platform. You can now buy DVDs and T-shirts and download the wrestlers' voices as ringtones. 
 I realized that the international business wasn't what it should be, so one weekend I wrote an international business plan. Vince approved it in April, and I had things up and running by August. The international business tripled. Today the program is on TV in 100 countries and the wrestlers tour internationally on a regular basis. 
 The challenge is to create a similar business model for the Globetrotters. We need to move from once-a-year live events in people's hometowns to extending the brand to a daily presence.
 We're keeping the confetti water trick and bringing back the string ball and the battles with the Washington Generals, but otherwise we've developed a new show that honors the tradition.
 The team recently did a dress rehearsal at the Harlem Armory for 2,500 school kids, and the kids loved it. It meant I got approval for the changes from the team and the coaches. We need to put the best players on the court -- they're our product.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LIVEZEY, LOWELL W.

 BODY:
 LIVEZEY--Lowell W. New York Theological Seminary announces with great sadness the passing on December 9, 2007, of Dr. Lowell W. Livezey, Professor of Urban and Religious Studies and Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project at the Seminary. Dr. Livezey directed large studies of urban congregations, using ethnographic data assembled in collaboration with colleagues and students in Chicago, Boston, and New York. He argued that the ''religion factor'' is more salient than often recognized in the economic, demographic, and spatial restructuring of modern industrial cities. 
Dr. Livezey received the B.A. from Swarthmore College and the M. Th. and D. Min. degrees from the University of Chicago School of Divinity. He spent two decades in the peace movement before beginning his second career in studying communities, meanings, culture, and social change. In 2005, Dr. Livezey became the founding Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project (EOL) at NYTS, funded through a major grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. Lowell Livezey was a person of immense insight, wisdom and compassion, of great integrity and depth, and an outstanding colleague. He embodied the values of teaching, learning and research that lie at the heart of the scholarly endeavor. He also was a friend, a caring human being, someone around whom community was easily formed. In the language that is familiar to the people of faith, Lowell simply was a blessing to NYTS. Lowell helped us all understand the life and work of the churches and especially the intellectual task of preparation for ministry more clearly. Dr. Craig Dykstra, Senior Vice President, Religion of Lilly Endowment Inc., stated that ''Lowell Livezey's work on religion and urban culture is path-breaking -a permanent contribution. His patient, generous and imaginative work with pastors and other religious leaders in Chicago, Boston and New York, as well as with scholars, will bear great fruit for many years to come.'' Dr. Livezey is survived by his wife, Dr. Lois Gehr Livezey, Director of the Globalization Project of the Center for World Christianity at NYTS. Contributions in Dr. Livezey's memory may be made to the Lowell W. Livezey Fund, Ecologies of Learning, New York Theological Seminary, 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 500, New York, NY 10115. A memorial will be held on January 26, 2008, 10:00 am, at The Riverside Church, 490 Riverside Drive, New York City. Dr. Dale T. Irvin, President Dr. Diane T. Ashley, Chair of the Board of Trustees

HEADLINE: A Loan Just for Adoptive Parents

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
FOR adoptive parents, bringing a new baby into the home can be a very costly process. Now, one national bank has begun helping such families more easily afford the financial burdens of adoption by tapping into their home equity. 
 Chase, a division of JPMorgan Chase & Company, introduced New Additions last month, a program that offers adoptive parents a discounted home-equity loan. Adoption advocates say it is the first service of its kind and will give the 125,000 families who adopt children each year in the United States significantly more financial flexibility.
 ''For families who are spending $20,000 or $30,000 to adopt internationally, it can really help,'' said Rita Soronen, executive director of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in Dublin, Ohio. ''It's very significant.''
 The Chase program works like other home-equity loans, in that borrowers take out a line of credit against the equity in their homes, borrowing money and paying it back as they would a credit card. 
 As they have with everything else in the mortgage market in recent months, banks are making home-equity loans much more cautiously. 
 Chase's New Additions product is no exception. Only those with more than 10 percent equity in their homes can qualify, and applicants must also have credit scores above the subprime level, which is typically in the low-to-mid-600 range. The maximum amount of the credit line varies with applicants' credit histories and the amount of equity they have in their homes.
 The initial interest rate varies according to a number of factors, including the applicant's credit history. Once the loan is made, the interest rate fluctuates according to the prime interest rate, which is the rate banks offer their best customers. 
 Whatever interest rate an applicant qualifies for, Chase discounts that rate by a full percentage point for New Additions customers for the first six months. 
 Earlier this month, for instance, a borrower in Rye, N.Y., with excellent credit and 50 percent equity in a $400,000 home could qualify for a line of credit of up to $160,000 at an interest rate of 7.25 percent. The New Additions discounted introductory rate would be 6.25 percent. 
 Mary Jane Rogers, a Chase spokeswoman, said the company hopes to add other benefits to the program in the coming months, like discounts on travel and international phone expenses. International adoptions can cost up to $40,000, or $10,000 more than the typical domestic adoption, partly because of greater travel and communication expenses.
 Ms. Soronen of the Dave Thomas Foundation said the Chase program was just one part of a more adoption-friendly environment at American companies. In a survey last year of 1,000 major employers, 45 percent of the companies offered financial adoption benefits, compared with 12 percent in 1990. 
 But not many financial institutions have offered special loan terms to adoptive families, Ms. Soronen said. Bank of America once featured a nonsecuritized loan for adoptive families, but according to the bank, that was superseded by its Flexible Term Personal Loan.
 The Dave Thomas Foundation, Ms. Soronen said, would help promote Chase's New Additions program on its Web site and elsewhere. More information is available online at www.chase.com/newadditions.

HEADLINE: A Wagon Survives The Slippery Slope

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
GATHER 'round, children: a long time ago, before S.U.V.'s roamed the earth, families great and small piled into something called a station wagon. 
 It was a primitive thing, often paneled in wood -- yes, it is true -- and later a man-made, nostalgic variety thereof. These pioneering wagons served Americans well, though today you young'uns would be seized by child protective services if they spotted you bouncing in back, innocent of seat belts and such notions as parental supervision.
 Younger generations can be forgiven if they see station wagons as hazy boomer memories. Some companies stubbornly roll out new wagons, but buyers mostly ignore them. Mazda recently axed its terrific 6 wagon after selling just 12,249 retail copies in 2004-7. Dodge has announced the end of its muscular but weak-selling Magnum. 
 Volvo, which built its following in the United States on square and sturdy wagons, has soldiered on even though combined sales of its related V70 and XC70 models were cut in half, to fewer than 19,000 in 2006 from 39,000 five years earlier. That decline was largely because even Volvo loyalists were switching to S.U.V.'s -- specifically, the Volvo XC90 sport utility crossover, which attracted more than 33,000 buyers last year. 
 The redesigned 2008 model may look like an Abercrombie & Fitch model to traditional Volvo fans. From its slim V-shape hood to its beveled hips, it's the most stylish Volvo wagon yet. And while Cross Country is no longer part of its name, the new wagon is as rugged as before, with all-wheel-drive, 8.3 inches of ground clearance and useful off-road abilities. 
 At 190.5 inches, the Volvo is a lengthy wagon, stretching just past the XC90 and Mercedes M-Class. Yet at just under 4,100 pounds, the XC70 weighs hundreds of pounds less. 
 Inside, a redesign brings the XC70 up to speed with other recent Volvos: the uncluttered, luxurious look renders the previous cabin obsolete. Real wood inlays on the dash, doors and gear knob are part of a $2,995 leather seating and moonroof package. 
 Handsome seats feature the excellent support and side bolsters typical of Volvo. The backseat features a genuine advance: a pair of integrated two-position child booster cushions (a $495 option) that adjust to fit children of various sizes. Adaptive seat belts easily adjust to match the raised seats, while side-curtain air bags extend farther downward to protect young noggins. 
 It's an ingenious idea. There is no need to buy booster seats, no time-consuming switching of seats between cars and no more anxiety over whether they're properly in place. Studies in the United States and Europe have found that nearly half of booster seats are unsafely installed. 
 The Volvo's nearly endless safety roster includes front seats that protect against whiplash injuries; side-impact air bags with separate sections for the chest and hips, with inflation pressures tailored for each body part; bumpers designed for compatibility with lower-riding vehicles; and a body engineered to minimize injuries to pedestrians.
 Optional features include a camera-based blind-spot warning system and a radar-beaming adaptive cruise control that can flash alerts and prepare the brakes for maximum stopping power before a crash. An optional keyfob alerts the driver if someone is lurking in the car, via an interior heartbeat detector. (Volvo calls it P.C.C., for personal car communicator, but I think of it as the paranoid car communicator.)
 There are a few minor issues, like the manual lumbar support. Tucked between the seats and center console, it is an awkward hand-wedging affair. 
 There is more than 33 cubic feet of space behind the rear seat, more than in some midsize S.U.V.'s. Fold the seat and the cargo space becomes an enormous 71 cubic feet. There's an optional power tailgate, standard floor rails, sliding tie-downs and useful under-floor storage that locks automatically with the tailgate. 
 If the Volvo has the space of a midsize S.U.V., it unfortunately also has the thirst. Its federal rating is just 15 miles a gallon in town and 22 on the highway; I saw 19 m.p.g. over all.
 On the road, the Volvo is as smooth and relaxing as an easy-listening station. But when it's time to rock 'n' roll, the 235-horsepower, 3.2-liter in-line 6 and six-speed automatic transmission are not ideally matched to the car's weight. There's decent power, but it is hidden where the typical family-wagon driver might not find it, up in the engine's high-revving rafters. Volvo says the 236 pound-feet of torque peaks at 3,200 r.p.m., but the sweet spot seems more like 4,000 r.p.m. and up. As a result, the Volvo can seem as if it is working hard even when it's not. 
 The transmission is so determined to hold a higher gear -- to protect the mileage rating, most likely -- that it fights the driver's intentions. It hunts gears on hills, resists downshifting and finally drops down two or three gears, making the engine roar like a runaway Cuisinart. The cruise control was baffled by hills, unable to hold a consistent speed. Aside from revised shift logic, the car could stand a half-liter-bigger engine and more low-end grunt. 
 But if the Volvo seems sedate on the road compared with sport wagons from Audi or BMW, it is an armor-cladded outdoorsman where the pavement ends. 
 A day after torrential rains, I guided the Volvo through wilderness about two hours north of New York City. Muddy two-track roads proved too easy; on a trickier off-road diversion, the XC70 rolled through watery chuckholes and over sharp rocks. Not only that, but pushing the button for the hill descent control lets the car walk down steep slopes without the driver touching the gas or brakes.
 At $37,490, the XC70 base price is about $550 above the XC90 and $5,000 more than the front-drive V70 wagon. My test model added $6,500 in options, including the leather package and panorama sunroof; an excellent 12-speaker premium audio system and the integrated child boosters. The total was $44,065, and that was without a navigation system or adaptive cruise control.
 That's an expensive wagon, though in line with prices for midsize luxury crossovers. And even $44,000 leaves the Volvo $10,000 to $12,000 below the base prices of 6-cylinder all-wheel-drive wagons from Mercedes and BMW. 
 Makers of crossovers are forever blathering about how these are trucks that drive like cars. Well, the Volvo is a genuine car that works like a truck, as long as you can live without a third row or an S.U.V.'s elevated view. 
 Why Americans don't see the station wagon as an S.U.V. alternative is anyone's guess. Maybe it's time to bring back wood paneling.
 INSIDE TRACK: Rational, and a bit fashionable.

THE SQUANDERING OF AMERICA 
 How the Failure of Our Politics Undermines Our Prosperity. 
 By Robert Kuttner. 
 337 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. 
 This July, when the Democrats John Edwards, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton all proposed closing a tax loophole that saves hedge fund managers hundreds of millions of dollars each year, it wasn't immediately clear what to make of it. On the one hand, it was the sort of proposal you'd expect from the party of working people. On the other, these three presidential candidates had stayed silent on the issue for months -- while raising gobs of money from wealthy financiers. Why would they turn on them now? 
 Only later did we get some hint of an explanation. The New York Times reported that Charles Schumer, the Senate's third-ranking Democrat, had spent June assuring Wall Street donors that the loophole would remain intact. This made the pronouncements a victory for everyone involved. The Democratic candidates could take the high road publicly, while their contributors could rest easy knowing those tax breaks were safe. 
 In ''The Squandering of America,'' Robert Kuttner says financial elites have too much sway over the Democratic Party -- and, as a result, over public policy. Judging from the tax-loophole episode, it's hard to disagree. 
 Kuttner, co-editor of The American Prospect and a columnist for The Boston Globe, won't wow you with the novelty of his arguments. Liberals like him spent most of the 1990s groaning about Wall Street's grip over the Clinton White House, and about the ''neoliberal'' agenda that resulted. (In his own book, Gene Sperling, once an economic adviser to Bill Clinton, recalls facing off against ''the Three Bobs'' -- one of them Kuttner -- during the bruising internecine fights of that decade.) The strength of Kuttner's latest effort is that, with seven years' distance from the Clinton era, his arguments now look emphatically right. 
 Kuttner takes on four pillars of neoliberalism: the preference for balanced budgets and modest-size government; free trade; economic austerity as a condition for development aid; and financial-market deregulation. In each case, the evidence suggests neoliberal policies were either irrelevant or downright disruptive. 
 Consider the budget. In 1993, Robert Rubin, then the president's top economic adviser, helped persuade Clinton to pursue a huge deficit-reduction package. The theory was that the bond markets would reward him with lower interest rates. It seemed to work: the package passed, interest rates fell, and the economy boomed. But two hitches would become apparent. First, the productivity gains that underlay the boom had taken root years earlier. Second, interest rates didn't actually fall much once you factored in a drop in inflation. 
 Kuttner doesn't dispute the need for deficit reduction, given all the red ink Clinton inherited from his Republican predecessors. He just takes issue with what became a fetish for balanced budgets. It led Clinton to underinvest in areas like infrastructure and research and development, which some economists, including the Nobel laureate and former Clinton adviser Joseph Stiglitz, believe slowed growth. Meanwhile, the alarming rise in income inequality since 2000, coupled with European countries' record of rapid, evenly distributed growth, suggests that a more activist government might be preferable on both social and economic grounds. 
 The story repeats itself over and over. The Clintonites spent the '90s negotiating one trade deal after another. But once the dust had settled, the laissez-faire approach appeared to have accelerated the decline of American industry. What the Clintonites (and, to be fair, this commentator) missed was that clearing aside trade barriers can leave you dangerously exposed when many of your trading partners -- especially in East Asia -- don't reciprocate. 
 Perhaps the most disturbing story involves financial markets. It's no surprise that an administration staffed with Wall Street refugees would view New Deal-era restrictions on banking and investing as excessive. What's surprising is that the Clinton White House would champion deregulation with so little regard for the consequences. One of the heroes of those years was Brooksley Born, an obscure bureaucrat who headed the equally obscure Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In 1998, Born wanted to scrutinize a financial instrument called a derivative, whose market she nominally oversaw. This earned her enormous helpings of scorn from Rubin and Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and she eventually backed down. Later that year, derivatives were at the center of one of the most spectacular financial meltdowns in history. They continue to threaten the economy to this day. 
 For all his insights into political economy, Kuttner sometimes goes astray on questions of crass politics. He says socially conservative working-class voters ''would vote for progressive candidates if Democrats gave them more of a reason to vote'' -- by which he means greater ''pocketbook benefits.'' Kuttner is right that there are legions of blue-collar workers whose economic interests should make them Democrats. But he offers no hard evidence that they'd support the party if only it moved left on economics -- as opposed to, say, right on issues like abortion and gay marriage. 
 Kuttner can be too hard on Democrats. In retrospect, Bill Clinton may not have had sound economic reasons to obsess over the deficit. But he had sound political reasons: namely, that the party's association with liberal interest groups had made voters loath to trust Democrats with the federal purse strings. Kuttner also plays down many Democrats' courageous opposition to the most egregious deregulatory efforts of the '90s -- including Clinton's veto of a pernicious anti-shareholder measure in 1995. 
 For their part, the party's presidential front-runners have learned a lot from the '90s. All three have proposed ambitious health insurance programs and savings benefits while voicing doubts about the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Still, given the influence of wealthy investors on the Clinton and Obama campaigns in particular, Kuttner is right to be worried. In May, the legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II held a 300-person fund-raiser for Barack Obama at his Greenwich, Conn., mansion. If a future Obama administration were to consider, say, reining in derivatives, could the president resist pressure from the likes of Jones? It's possible. But, like Kuttner, I'm skeptical.

HEADLINE: Reefer Madness In Iowa

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
With the Iowa campaign in wild flux -- and in the case of Hillary, acid reflux -- The Des Moines Register decides to hold a tie-breaking debate with the two Democratic front-runners.
 Carolyn Washburn, the phlegmatic editor of the paper, once more moderates.
 WASHBURN: Senator Clinton, I'd like you to start us off by explaining why your campaign has been getting down and dirty with someone so clean and articulate? 
 CLINTON: I apologized to Senator Obama. I absolutely did not authorize or condone the remarks made by one of my co-chairs in New Hampshire about my distinguished colleague's youthful indiscretions. If primary voters don't care that he did ''a little blow,'' then my goodness, why should I? Even if he had packed a straw full of the white rabbit and had a snow bunny blow it in his ear, who would care, for Pete's sake? I only wish I knew all that colorful chasing-the-dragon lingo. Senator Obama certainly has a lot of street cred, even if it isn't Main Street. We owe it to the good people of Iowa to stick to critical issues like the economy, and how to get a fiscally responsible budget like we had in the '90s, the '90s, the '90s -- 
 WASHBURN: Snap out of it.
 CLINTON: Sorry. Anyway, even if Senator Obama were still riding the snow train, I would not allow any revelations about it to sully this campaign. I'm not sure who that young man in a hoodie was that Barack was talking to outside tonight, before the debate. I'd seen the young man earlier, standing around in the shadows outside. But that's neither here nor there. Even if I had been able to see whether any money was exchanged, or who was selling to whom, I would not allow anyone in my campaign, even that scamp Mark Penn, to use the word cocaine, cocaine, cocaine -- 
 WASHBURN: Senator!
 CLINTON: Continuing in this vein, I just want to conclude by saying, both in terms of experience and illegal substances, I am vetted. I am tested. 
 WASHBURN: Senator Obama, what would your priorities be as president?
 OBAMA: I will pass a health care bill because I am not a polarizing person whose negatives are completely off the charts, and I'm certainly not threatening to drag down the whole party at a time when we should be killing the Republicans.
 WASHBURN: Are you referring to Senator Clinton?
 OBAMA: Most certainly not. I want to bring a new kind of politics to Washington that can reverse the polarizing atmosphere of the '90s, the '90s, the '90s. 
 CLINTON: Don't bogart the time, Barack. I'd like a hit. Carolyn, shouldn't there be some timing device to let my young friend know when he's going over, something that would go ''BONG!''
 OBAMA: I know what you're doing, Hillary. I wasn't born yesterday. She wants Americans to think I'm so young and green that I can only run for White House intern. It would be a stain on me to sink as low as her.
 CLINTON: I don't appreciate that crack. If you're going to needle me, Senator -- 
 OBAMA: In turn, I would like to reply that what this country really needs is change -- 
 CLINTON: Change is mine now, Senator Belushi. Bill and I stole it weeks ago. Some people believe you get change by hoping for it. Some believe you get change by snorting it. I believe you get it by working hard.
 WASHBURN: Can you both please describe the key features of what you consider to be the best education system in the world?
 CLINTON: Well, I know that some of my supporters have been spreading gossip that Senator Obama loves the madrassa system for pre-K through terrorist training camp. But there is not a gram of truth in those accusations. We shouldn't inject intolerance into this race. 
 WASHBURN: I would like to talk about the Peru free trade deal that was signed on Friday. You both missed the vote.
 CLINTON: Oh, Barack should take that one. His views on Peruvian are positively flaky.
 OBAMA: You're the flaky one, Hillary, backing up the president when he wanted to rush into Iraq and wage this trillion-dollar war.
 CLINTON: It's no wonder you didn't want to go into Iraq, Barack. There are no free bases there.
 WASHBURN: All right, you two. We're out of time. Have a Merry Christmas and -- 
 CLINTON: And I am sure that Senator Obama is dreaming of his usual White Christmas. Hitch up the reindeer! 
 WASHBURN: As I was saying, a Happy New Year.
 CLINTON: He gets no kick from Champagne ...

HEADLINE: Let the 'Starchitects' Work All the Angles

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
IT'S hard to pinpoint when the ''starchitect'' became an object of ridicule. The term is a favorite of churlish commentators, who use it to mock architects whose increasingly flamboyant buildings, in their minds, are more about fashion and money than function. 
 Often the attacks are a rehash of the old cliches. Cost overruns and leaky roofs are held up as evidence of yet another egomaniacal artist with little concern for the needs of us, the little people. (As a rule, if a roof leaks in a Frank Gehry building it's headline news; if the building was designed by a hack commercial architect, the leak is ignored, at least as news.) John Silber, the former president of Boston University, has gotten into the game with ''Architecture of the Absurd,'' a glib little book that eviscerates contemporary architects for the extravagance of their designs. 
 The more serious criticism comes from those inside the profession who see a move into the mainstream as a sellout. The pact between high architects and developers, to them, is a Faustian bargain in which the architect is nothing more than a marketing tool, there to provide a cultural veneer for the big, bad developers whose only interest is in wringing as much profit as possible from their projects. 
 There's some truth to this, of course. Santiago Calatrava's overblown design for a transportation hub at ground zero in Lower Manhattan, for example, is as much a monument to the architect's ego as a statement of civic pride. And architects don't always help their own cause. When Mr. Gehry designed a jewelry line for Tiffany's last year, many of his admirers cringed. How could a man of the people, whose own Santa Monica house -- a crude composition of chain link, plywood and galvanized metal that seemed to be a slap in the face of uptight suburban values -- ally himself with a status symbol for Connecticut newlyweds?
 But in general I find these attacks perplexing. For decades, the public complained about the bland, soul-sapping buildings churned out by anonymous corporate offices. Meanwhile, our greatest architectural talents labored in near obscurity, quietly refining their craft in university studios and competitions that rarely led to real commissions. If their work had any impact, it was in the realm of ideas, where the designs served as a cutting critique of a profession that seemed to have lost its way.
 Today these architects, many of them in their 60s and 70s, are finally getting to test those visions in everyday life, often on a grand scale. What followed has been one of the most exhilarating periods in recent architectural history. For every superficial expression of a culture obsessed with novelty, you can point to a work of blazing originality.
 Most important, the profession has become more democratic. The age of the manifesto is dead; there is no dominant style. Instead, we live in a time of competing creative voices, the best of which can offer penetrating insights into a culture that is in constant flux.
 You may not like Rem Koolhaas's Seattle Public Library, for example, but only a nitwit would argue that the architect was oblivious to the building's function. A series of mismatched slabs wrapped inside a taut, weblike skin, the form is a bold expression of the client's conflicting needs to preserve old books and also to come to terms with emerging information technologies. What's unusual about the building is that Mr. Koolhaas -- like many contemporary architects -- chose to express these tensions in his design rather than smooth them over.
 To my mind, if these architects are also getting a cut of the pie, why begrudge them? The 17th-century Baroque sculptor and architect Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini was a tireless self-promoter, a celebrity sought by popes and princes, and it didn't seem to dilute the quality of his work. Why shouldn't today's greatest architectural talents also be celebrated for their accomplishments?
 The real issue here is not the architects' egos but a significant shift in the kind of clients they serve. In the United States, the enlightened homeowners and high-minded cultural institutions that made up the bulk of these architects' commissions a decade ago have now been joined by mainstream developers like Forest City Ratner or Hines -- multibillion-dollar corporations who see an alliance with a high-profile architect as both a chance to raise their own profiles and to help push their projects through an often tricky public review process.
 At the same time, the handful of architecturally ambitious public works commissions that once existed here -- like the federal government's celebrated Design Excellence program, which produced a string of beautiful courthouses in the late 1990s and early 2000s -- has largely dried up. And even in Europe, which traditionally has invested more in the quality of public architecture, the grand cultural commissions of the 1980s and 1990s have been replaced by designs for soaring corporate towers or offices for, say, BMW and the European Central Bank.
 In this new world, no hands are clean; there are good guys and bad guys on all sides. There are endless cases of architects' being reduced to the level of decorator: convenient cultural lubricants whose main function is to help the public digest increasingly cynical developments. (The bigger the project and the more money involved, it seems, the more the architect is treated like a lackey.)
 But from the architect's perspective, working with mainstream developers is also a chance to step out of the narrow confines of high culture and have a more direct impact on centers of everyday life that were once outside their reach, from shopping malls to entire business districts.
 This is especially true as the size of the developments continues to grow. New York alone is planning to add at least 35 million square feet of commercial space over the next couple of decades, much of it concentrated at sites like ground zero and the West Side railyards. Cities are being built virtually from scratch in China and the Middle East.
 Architects have no control over a development's scale or density; nor do they control the underlying social and economic realities that shape it. But what serious architect wouldn't want to take up the challenge? And why should such an immense responsibility be turned over to hacks? Why wouldn't we welcome the input of our most imaginative talents? The point is to create an environment where they can produce their best work. 
 As it is, the results are not always what you would expect. Recently, Hines unveiled a stunning proposal for a residential skyscraper designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel. When it is built, it will be the most exquisite tower to rise in Midtown Manhattan since the Chrysler Building. By comparison, Mr. Calatrava's flashy transportation building -- the rare commission that is being designed for a supposedly well-meaning government bureaucracy, not a greedy corporate developer -- looks like a shameful waste of public funds. With a price of more than $2 billion, it will serve a handful of passengers on the PATH trains and a subway line. In early renderings of the design, the cavernous main hall doesn't even have a cafe. (Pennsylvania Station, which could use a face-lift, serves nearly 10 times as many passengers.)
 In the end, it is the public's responsibility to do the hard work of parsing the difference between superficial creations designed to cover up a hidden, cynical agenda, and sincere efforts to create a more enlightened vision of a civilization that is evolving at a brutal pace.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: IN THE MIX: Not long ago, the greatest architects would do their best work for competitions, not real commissions. Today, their designs are meant for the public eye, including Jean Nouvel's planned Midtown tower, above left, or Frank Gehry's Stata Center at M.I.T., above right, and Santiago Calatrava's transportation hub at ground zero, top.

HEADLINE: So How Do We Get to Berkeley? Spend Big on SUNY, Panel Says

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

DATELINE: AMHERST, N.Y. 

 BODY:
John B. Simpson, the president of the State University at Buffalo, incessantly buttonholes people to assert that the way to remake western New York is to remake his university, one of the state university system's four research centers. 
 ''For this area to be viable,'' he said in an interview in his art-filled office, ''the best thing they can do, the only thing they can do, is develop great research universities.''
 As the largest and most comprehensive university of the State University of New York's 64 campuses, Buffalo is a good yardstick for measuring just how far New York has traveled -- yet how short it has fallen from Nelson A. Rockefeller's vision of creating a premier public university system.
 With specialties in biomedical sciences and earthquake engineering, it is one of only two SUNY campuses, along with Stony Brook, that belong to the Association of American Universities, an elite group of 62 research universities. But even its national reputation, buzz and research dollars put it nowhere near the ranks of the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. 
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer established a State Commission on Higher Education to find ways to improve the system. In a report to be presented on Monday, the panel will recommend sweeping changes in how SUNY and the City University of New York are governed.
 The report, obtained by The New York Times, calls for significantly higher financial support for public universities from the state and from increased tuition revenues. It recommends allowing the universities to set their own tuition without state approval and to vary tuition rates by campus. The report also urges hiring 2,000 additional full-time faculty members and creating a $3 billion innovation fund for research grants in fields that can fuel economic development.
 The recommendations will test the political will to give the institutions the resources and autonomy they say they need to flourish, especially for a state with leading private universities, like Columbia and Cornell.
 ''There is this history of chafing between the public universities and the privates in New York State, and the publics have historically not won,'' said Dr. Simpson, a member of the 30-person commission.
 In his campaign last year, Mr. Spitzer asked why New York does not have a Berkeley of the East and said he wanted New York's colleges to be among the finest in the nation.
 ''We certainly don't have a Berkeley,'' said Lloyd Constantine, Mr. Spitzer's senior adviser, who worked with the commission and visited all the SUNY campuses. ''California has more than one. In a state like ours, we could certainly have a couple. Their importance is that they are great schools, and they also lift the entire system.'' 
 California and some other states have invested heavily in public research universities for decades and are not stopping for New York to catch up. Still other states, like Georgia and Arizona, have been pouring money into their public systems to try to rise in the rankings. 
 ''SUNY is a very solid state university system; it's just not a leader,'' said Arthur E. Levine, the president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, who earned a doctorate at Buffalo. ''It would cost so much money to make it into something different.'' 
 Governor Rockefeller spent millions in the 1960s to lay the foundation for what he hoped would be a nationally renowned public university system, with research campuses at Buffalo, Stony Brook, Albany and Binghamton. But the drive to create a Berkeley in Buffalo or elsewhere in the state stalled in the face of economic problems, New York City's fiscal crisis, and taxpayers' recoiling from violent student protests. The result was significant layoffs at SUNY. More recently, Gov. George E. Pataki increased capital investment but cut money for operations. 
 SUNY has grown substantially since the system was cobbled together from teachers' colleges, agricultural schools, and swamps and farmland. Today it has more than 400,000 students at its research campuses, comprehensive colleges and community colleges.
 Still, only 55 percent of college students in New York are in public institutions, compared with 79 percent nationally. Higher education draws less than 7 percent of the state budget in New York, compared with a national average of 11 percent. 
 Until now, the state has kept tuition at the campuses equalized. Buffalo's undergraduate tuition is the same as for all SUNY four-year colleges: $4,350 for state residents and $10,610 for students from out of state, compared with $8,384 and $19,620 at Berkeley. Buffalo does tack on more than $1,800 in fees. 
 Researchers say that while the relatively low tuition may be politically popular, it has not allowed any of the campuses to soar in the rankings.
 ''Typically, the SUNY board of trustees doesn't understand what a research university is,'' said Stephen B. Sample, who was the president of Buffalo for nine years before taking the same post at the University of Southern California in 1991. ''One of the challenges I had as president of Buffalo was to help the board of trustees understand how different these institutions were, that Buffalo was not just bigger, but that it was a different animal, a different kind of institution.'' 
 Buffalo, which became part of SUNY in 1962, has 28,000 students and 1,185 full-time faculty members. It sits on a bleak 1,200-acre site here and on two smaller sites in the city. 
 Some students, like Jack Niejadlik, said they liked the university and the wide variety of programs it offered but were happy to see more hiring and other improvements.
 ''President Simpson has done a great deal about making his plan visible,'' Mr. Niejadlik said. ''Things are happening.'' Dr. Simpson, recruited from the University of California Santa Cruz four years ago, has an ambitious expansion plan, with the goal of creating a world-class research center that would help rebuild the region's economy. The plan calls for new construction, and for growing to 35,000 students by 2020. 
 ''We have a huge array of programs for a very small number of students,'' said Dr. Simpson. ''If we're going to have all these programs, we're too small.'' 
 His ideas have won critical backing from business. ''Until very recently, if you listed the most important priorities for business, the advancement of SUNY would not have been on the list,'' said Andrew J. Rudnick, president of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, which represents 2,500 employers. Now, he said, there is a recognition that the university ''can be part of an economic transformation of this region.''
 But to be an agent of change, says Dr. Simpson, the university needs more autonomy. ''We get what really amounts to very little financial input from New York State, and we have no control over our finances,'' he said. ''We can't raise tuition; we can't set it. And the underlying state budget is a political football every year.''
 Still, the campus is already moving on many fronts. It is offering more freshman seminars and has created an honors college to make its undergraduate programs more attractive. It is adding professors to raise its faculty-student ratio and trying to bring in academic stars who will increase its research money. And it is developing a badly needed physical master plan. 
 Robert G. Shibley, a Buffalo architecture and planning professor who is advising the president, described the Amherst campus as ''a monument to blank walls'' and said, ''Building soul back into the campus is a major mission of mine.''
 All this takes money. Dr. Simpson's plan for growth does not carry dollar amounts. But a memorandum for the governor's office said that implementing the blueprint over 13 years would require a one-time investment of $1.6 billion for new faculty members, new residence halls and other capital improvements, and infusions of $226 million a year for additional faculty members.
 Mr. Constantine said that the numbers may seem large if seen as only for higher education, but that they are ''more realistic'' if also viewed as investments in economic development, work force development, urban revitalization and the future of western New York. 
 ''But it has to be done right,'' he added.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 21, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A chart in some editions on Dec. 16 with an article about the struggles of New York's state university system misstated the relationship between the $1 billion spent on the Tuition Assistance Program and the $3.9 billion that New York spends on higher education each year. The tuition program is part of the total, not separate. This correction was delayed for research.
