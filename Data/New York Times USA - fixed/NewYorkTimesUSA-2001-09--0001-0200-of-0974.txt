HEADLINE: Saving Harlem's Culture 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Harlem on the Cusp" (editorial, Aug. 26) correctly spotlighted the need for small-business support from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. But many Harlem residents, small-business owners and artists believe that erosion of affordable commercial space in Harlem is compromising the cultural integrity of the community. 
The diversified economic activity provided by local businesses owned largely by blacks but also Asians, Latinos and Yemeni people is essential to sustaining Harlem's unique cultural legacy. 
 Cultural impact statements must become an integral part of the empowerment zone and other community development plans. Without such review, Harlem residents will continue to have well-founded fears that the downside of Harlem's cusp is economic and cultural desolation.

HEADLINE: Q&A; 
Self-Interest vs. Altruism: Labor's High Wire Act

BYLINE:  Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University, has written extensively about the labor movement and is the author of "The Populist Persuasion: An American History." Steven Greenhouse spoke with him.

 BODY:
Q. Has the whole idea of Labor Day and Labor Day parades become obsolete?
 Labor Day parades still have a function, partly nostalgic, partly motivational. As long as some workers believe they're a group or class apart and have a self-interest different from other groups in society, I would think they'd want to talk about some of their economic concerns and celebrate some of their achievements. That was the whole point of Labor Day originally, and it still has a purpose. 

Since John Sweeney was elected president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 1995, union leaders have repeatedly boasted about a rebirth of the labor movement, but considering that the percentage of Americans belonging to unions has continued to drop, is that rebirth exaggerated?
There has been a rebirth ideologically. There has been a rebirth motivationally to a certain degree. Labor is certainly more open to other social movements -- immigrant rights, gay liberation, feminism, black and Latino movements -- than it was before John Sweeney's team took over in 1995. Having said that, there's no doubt that the structural and political barriers to labor's growth are immense, but I think labor is better positioned to grow than at any time in many years.
How relevant is the labor movement to the 86.5 percent of Americans who do not belong to unions?
It's available as an option, and that's very important. It's a tool or weapon that workers can use and say to their employers, "Maybe we'll join the Teamsters, maybe we'll join the Service Employees International Union." That creates pressure on employers to raise wages and benefits to forestall unionization. If labor wasn't there at all, if it represented just 1 percent of the workforce, rather than 13.5 percent, it wouldn't be a credible force. 
Ever since the 1999 protests in Seattle, much has been made of a supposed blue-green coalition between union members and environmentalists. Does this coalition remain an important force or has it crumbled as a result of labor-environmentalist divisions on energy policy?
The blue-green alliance is still very strong in the Northwest, in parts of California and some parts of the Midwest. Clearly there are issues in which environmentalists and some sectors of labor disagree. The fact that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. leadership and important unions like the service employees are open to this type of alliance is very important. It's important that unions are seeking ways to recruit young people and show that labor is not just for people in unions, but is out to make the world a better place. On my campus, the political activists on the left are very sympathetic to labor. They think about joining Union Summer, they support living wage campaigns. All these kids are environmentalists. There's no doubt about it.
Many labor leaders and union members will join the protests scheduled for late September in Washington during the autumn meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Do you think labor should be fighting the I.M.F. and the World Bank? 
I think their strategy has been a good one. They've questioned the priority of these institutions' investments and funding in the third world. Organized labor has demanded that international trade agreements and economic organizations work to improve living standards and working conditions all over that world. It's important that labor stand for economic and social justice. On the other hand, the leadership of organized labor has been wise in not putting on black shirts and saying, "Let's just smash these things." Clearly this economic order is going to be around for a long while, and labor can't get too far to the left or it will lose credibility and power and make itself vulnerable. 
Many government officials and business executives say the labor movement has been highly protectionist in light of its opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the China trade deal, fast-track trade legislation and allowing in trucks from Mexico. In your view, is labor protectionist?
I think labor has two stances -- one is self-interest and one is altruistic. Even in its worst times, it has always had these two faces. On one hand, the Teamsters would like to stop trucks coming in from Mexico. That would save Teamster jobs. And of course the steelworkers would like to stop cheap imports. On the other hand, many union officials sincerely believe that every worker in the world should have a decent living, health care, pensions. They feel that if those workers don't have those things, that will undercut American workers. There is always this solidarity with working people in other countries, but then there is also a strong sense of nationalism and self-interest. It's hard to disentangle the two.
Do you think the labor movement can ever regain the energy, momentum and idealism of the 1930's?
There is still a tremendous amount of idealism today, in many ways comparable to the 1930's. There's a large proportion of workers of color in unions today. Organized labor is much more open to new immigrants, women, homosexuals than it was in the 1930's. So it's more on the cutting edge demographically than when it was predominantly white and male. From 1933 to 1945, union membership quintupled, from 3 million to 15 million. That kind of growth will not happen now for a whole range of reasons. Organized labor is a creature of industrial society, and to a large degree we're getting beyond industrial society. Workers work for companies for three years at a time, instead of their whole lives; young workers think about individual solutions to issues like health care. That's a real problem for unions. It's striking to me that labor has been more successful organizing some groups of low-wage immigrant workers than workers from Microsoft or other high-tech companies. That's heartening in the social justice sense, but it's also troublesome for labor's future.
How do you plan to mark Labor Day?
I will spend it with my family, and I will tell my kids, as I do every year, why there is a Labor Day and why there should be a Labor Day. They will probably say, "Daddy, not this talk again."

HEADLINE: Factory Data A Bit Upbeat For Economy 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
A small increase in new orders for goods produced at factories in July, along with signs that the deterioration in the industrial activity in the Chicago area has ebbed, raised hopes yesterday that the sluggish manufacturing sector might be stabilizing.
 But a separate report showing that American consumers were slightly more pessimistic about the economy in August kept alive concerns that consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of economic activity, could slow. 
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that the value of new factory orders rose 0.1 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted $333.43 billion, led by orders for car parts and electrical equipment. The gain followed a 2.9 percent drop in June. 
The small increase in July orders took forecasters, who had expected a decline of 0.5 percent, by surprise.
The inventory-to-shipments ratio -- which measures how long it would take to deplete stocks fully at the current pace of business -- fell to 1.38 months in July from 1.40 in June.
And in Chicago, the local chapter of the National Association of Purchasing Management said its August index of regional business activity had rebounded to 43.5 from 38.0 in July, beating expectations for 39.8.
While that represented an improvement, economists cautioned that the index remained at recessionary levels and showed continued deterioration in business activity. A reading below 50 signifies contraction, while a reading above 50 means expansion. The index has not shown growth since September 2000, when it was at 50.3.
A separate report yesterday said consumer sentiment dipped in August, led by falling expectations for the future as corporate layoffs increased and the stock market weakened, threatening to undermine consumer spending.
The University of Michigan's August consumer sentiment index dipped to 91.5 from 92.4 in July, echoing data released earlier this week by the Conference Board. Economists forecast a reading of 93.2, down from the preliminary mid-month 93.5, the highest reading since January.

 BODY:
Americans Worked Longer Last Year Than in 1990
American workers have increased their substantial lead over Japan and all other industrial nations in the number of hours worked each year, a United Nations agency has found.
 The report found that Americans added nearly a full week to their work year during the 1990's, climbing to 1,978 hours on average last year, up 36 hours -- almost a full work week -- from 1990. Page A8. 

Dow Jones Ends Week Under 10,000
Wall Street ended a terrible week with a modest gain that was not enough to bring the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000. The Dow closed up 30.17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,949.75. The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.75 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,805.43, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 4.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,133.58. C4.

Hitachi, which expects a $1.2 billion loss for the year, joined Fujitsu, Toshiba and Kyocera in announcing major staff reductions recently. C3.

Factory Orders Rise Unexpectedly
The Commerce Department said that the value of new factory orders rose 0.1 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted $333.43 billion, led by orders for car parts and electrical equipment. The unexpected gain followed a 2.9 percent drop in June. Separately, the Chicago chapter of the National Association of Purchasing Management said its August index of regional business activity rebounded to 43.5 from 38.0 in July. And the University of Michigan's August consumer sentiment index dipped to 91.5 from 92.4 in July. C14.

HEADLINE: Master of the Mosaic That Is New York City; 
Expert Keeps Tabs on Changing Population

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The chief demographer for New York City lives in Census Tract 274, a bucolic sliver of the Bronx next to Eastchester Bay, where an earlier generation of immigrants raised their children to believe that the sky was the limit but a good son stayed close to home.
 Joseph J. Salvo lives eight blocks from the house where he grew up. He has lived in the neighborhood for almost all of his 47 years -- except for one miserable foray into the suburbs of Washington, where his wife's office was in a shopping mall and he had to drive to Baltimore for salami. 
 Dr. Salvo is the self-described homeboy in charge of tracking New York's restless eight million people, one of the most dynamic urban populations in the world. It is a population in a perpetual state of reinvention, with newcomers pouring in from Dhaka and Abuja, while others depart for the suburbs, the Sun Belt and beyond. 
His title is director of the population division of the Department of City Planning, which keeps tabs, demographically speaking, on that enormous and mutable moving target. It is an assignment roughly comparable in complexity to that of a team of meteorologists monitoring tornadoes in the Great Plains.
There are Africans on the Grand Concourse these days; where are they settling? The Arab community is growing, but how fast and from where? Egyptian immigration is up. So are births to Mexican and Nigerian mothers around Brighton Beach. There are more Uzbeks in Queens, and they're Jewish.
The phone rings constantly in Dr. Salvo's office near City Hall. Some voice on the other end begins: Hi. I got your number from so-and-so. I understand you know everything there is to know about the city.
Then the questions:
How many gay and lesbian couples are there in New York?
What cities have the most Latinos?
How far is my apartment from the East River?
In Dr. Salvo's head resides a warehouse of facts. More than half of all babies here have foreign-born mothers, he can tell you. About 15 percent of the entire population of Guyana lives in New York. A useful indicator of neighborhood change can be found in travel-agency windows: are they pushing specials to Palermo or Tirana?
In the late 1980's, Dr. Salvo's office began noticing Bangladeshis driving cabs. The numbers showed up in the city's hack-license data. By the early 1990's, Bangladesh had surfaced at 14th place on the ranked list of countries sending immigrants to New York. By the late 1990's, it was sixth. (Ireland, meanwhile, had dropped from 12th to 35th.)
The number of New Yorkers over age 85 has increased by 20 percent since 1990, Dr. Salvo can tell you. It is possible to predict park vandalism by developing a "hangout index" -- based on the number of unemployed high school dropouts, age 16 to 21, as a percentage of the population in neighborhoods in the city.
"Somebody calls me up wanting to know how many cats and dogs there are in the city," Dr. Salvo recalled recently. "Said they wanted to know how big the cat population was. Was it bigger than the dog population? I said the census didn't get that information, maybe you should call the S.P.C.A."
And?
"They got offended: 'Why the hell doesn't . . .' "
It was Dr. Salvo's division that pointed out to the Census Bureau earlier this summer, when it released numbers on Hispanic groups in New York, that the bureau had apparently miscounted tens of thousands of Dominicans, Colombians and others, at least in part because of a change in the 2000 census form.
It was Dr. Salvo and his colleagues, too, who tracked down what they said were several hundred thousand addresses missing from the list the bureau intended to use for the census. Including the people at those addresses helped push the city's population count above the eight million mark, producing a financial and psychic windfall for New York.
These days, the seven-person population division is deciphering the census data, preparing profiles of the city's 59 community districts, advising city agencies on the implications of the numbers and mapping the racial and ethnic changes that decades of immigration have helped bring about.
"It's like one big puzzle," said Dr. Salvo, a physical scientist at heart, who grew up constructing model rockets and dissecting television sets in the family basement. "And it's a grand puzzle. You want to take it apart and put it back together and figure out how it goes together."
Dr. Salvo's parents are Italian immigrants; his mother arrived in 1920, his father in 1951. The family lived in a three-family house in Pelham Bay. Dr. Salvo's father worked in construction, 17 hours a day. Joe, his eldest son, got beat up a lot for playing with chemistry sets.
Joe Salvo went to Iona College in New Rochelle, then to graduate school at Fordham. He studied the Puerto Rican migration, and at 26 he received his Ph.D. in sociology. He was seen as the ethnic kid who would not leave home; his mentors encouraged him to go to Washington, to make a career with the Census Bureau.
But leaving was heresy. "You're not going," his mother said knowingly, the moving van at the door. Dr. Salvo moved to Washington for good, and was back in a year. Having worked in the wealth statistics branch of the Census Bureau, he joined the population division in 1982 and became director in 1993.
"I have the best job in the world because I have the best subject matter in the world," said Dr. Salvo, who learned from a visiting delegation from Turkmenistan recently that his looks would blend in nicely on the streets of Ashgabat. "Right now, New York is experiencing immigration that is changing its neighborhoods, altering its environment and doing things culturally to this city in a way that we haven't seen for a hundred years."
But change makes people uneasy. That is a lesson Dr. Salvo learned in neighborhoods he knew as a child and a young adult. For years, he said, the universal language there was: "When are you getting out? Boy, the city's going downhill. See that family that moved in next door?"
During high school and college, he worked as a youth counselor in the Belmont section of the Bronx. He learned to be careful where he took the Italian kids, he said, because they would beat up black kids. He asked why, and he said he was told it was because they were black.
The answer to fear of the unknown, he now figures, is knowing. So he makes dozens of presentations a year. If his division can serve as a source of scientific information, it is his belief that people might be less likely to listen to the anxious prognostications and prejudices of their Uncle Tony.
Change comes in cycles, Dr. Salvo contended. He said the cycles were the same, the people different; but everyone wants the same things. He said the numbers showed clearly how people came here, settled in and worked, how they raised and educated their children, where they went when they moved on.
"It makes people understand that where they're living is not a strange and alien place," Dr. Salvo said. "It's not a place that somehow has become foreign to them. Because that's how people in neighborhoods interpret it. 'We're living in a foreign country.' "
He said later: "This is the cycle. It's somebody else's turn now. The process known as New York, you benefited from, and now you're all over the country. The new groups coming in, they'll benefit the way you did. And then, ultimately, they'll yield to another group."
On a recent field trip, looking for clues, Dr. Salvo rode the No. 4 train north through the Bronx to Fordham Road, then struck out on foot, heading east, then veered south down the Grand Concourse and east again on 188th Street into Belmont, once solidly Italian.
The Italian presence was still there, but visible mostly in the specialty food shops along Arthur Avenue, now a destination for suburban pilgrims in search of ravioli. That strip seemed almost an artifact amid the evidence that Albanians and Mexicans were rapidly displacing the Italians. Dr. Salvo eyeballed the playground population and checked out the Mexican grocery stores, the Mexican flags hanging in apartment house windows, and the new mosque just a few blocks from Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.
Dr. Salvo's work, he said, shares something with his hobby, ham radio. He has a 35-foot radio tower in his backyard, with which it is possible to send a signal out over the Atlantic and occasionally connect with astonishing clarity with a stranger halfway around the world.
"Ham radio and demography kind of go together," Dr. Salvo said. "They're both logical. They're both driven by scientific principles. One is, of course, a hard science much more than the other. One is much more human. That is the connection."

HEADLINE: Americans' International Lead in Hours Worked Grew in 90's, Report Shows 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A United Nations agency provided some discouraging news yesterday to Americans who believe they are overworked, finding that American workers have increased their substantial lead over Japan and all other industrial nations in the number of hours worked each year.
 The report, issued by the International Labor Organization, found that Americans added nearly a full week to their work year during the 1990's, climbing to 1,979 hours on average last year, up 36 hours from 1990. That means Americans who are employed are putting in nearly 49 1/2 weeks a year on the job. 
Americans work 137 hours, or about three and one-half weeks, more a year than Japanese workers, 260 hours (about six and one-half weeks) more a year than British workers and 499 hours (about 12 1/2 weeks) more a year than German workers, the report said. The Japanese had long been at the top for the number of hours worked, but in the mid-1990's the United States surpassed Japan, and since then it has pulled farther ahead. 
"It's unique to Americans that they continue to increase their working hours, while hours are declining in other industrialized nations," said Lawrence Jeff Johnson, the economist who oversaw the labor organization's report. "It has a lot to do with the American psyche, with American culture. American workers are eager to make the best impression, to put in the most hours."
Many economists say the numbers demonstrate that the American economic boom of the 1990's provided plenty of work for tens of millions of Americans. In contrast, the economies of Europe and Japan grew far more slowly, if at all, causing many companies to cut back on the length of the workweek.
Patrick Cleary, senior vice president for human resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said, "Clearly, for most of these years the increase in hours tracks outstanding economic performance in the United States, which translates into more income for all those workers, so we don't see this necessarily as bad news at all."
Among the reasons for the large differences between the United States and other countries are that Europeans typically take four to six weeks of vacation each year while Americans take two to three weeks. And while American employers kept adding overtime during the 1990's, in France the government reduced the official workweek to 35 hours.
Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College and the author of "The Overworked American," said one reason for the nation's longer average work year was that American workers seemed to be increasingly squeezed during booms and busts alike.
"All the direction seems to be for longer hours," Ms. Schor said. "In expansions, companies keep giving more work to their workers, and in recessions, there will be downsizing and fewer people working, but the workers who remain have to work longer hours to retain their jobs."
Many economists say the number of hours that Americans work each year may begin to level off now that many automakers and other manufacturers have reduced the amount of overtime assigned due to the economic slowdown.
Economists give many reasons for the increase in the number of hours that Americans work. Mothers with young children tend to work sooner and for more hours per week than young mothers did a decade or two ago. More Americans are salaried professionals, like investment bankers and lawyers, who often work 60 or more hours per week. In addition, many low-wage workers have two or three jobs to make ends meet.
In the best news for the United States, the report ranked the country No. 1 in the world in productivity per worker. It said that last year, productivity per American worker in constant 1990 dollars was $54,870, about $1,500 more than Belgium, the No. 2 nation. The report found that productivity per worker in the United States was $10,000 higher than in Canada last year, and $14,000 higher than in Japan.
But partly because of the comparatively high number of hours that Americans work, the report found that France and Belgium edged out the United States in productivity per hour. In France, which ranked first, workers produced $33.71 of value added per hour on average, compared with $32.98 in Belgium and $32.84 in the United States.
Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, a research group in New York, said the large number of hours that Americans work could result in burned-out workers with lower productivity.
"Our overall productivity is high because we work more hours," Ms. Galinsky said. "But our research shows there is a possible point of diminishing returns."

HEADLINE: Developer to Run Ad Campaign Questioning Arena Deal 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
One of New Jersey's largest real estate developers is planning a statewide advertising campaign that raises questions about plans for a new arena in Newark and the redevelopment of the current arena site in the Meadowlands.
 The campaign raises an issue that has been aggressively pursued by Bret D. Schundler, the Republican candidate for governor, who has called for a referendum on any arena plan. 
 The newspaper advertising campaign by the developer, Hartz Mountain Industries, is scheduled to start on Tuesday. It will run in most of the state's newspapers, said Emanuel Stern, the president of the company, which is based in Secaucus, N.J. 
Officials with the company declined to release the content of the ad, saying only that it would urge voters to raise questions with their legislators about the project.
But the ad campaign could help amplify an issue that has pitted Mr. Schundler against most of the state's political establishment and that he believes has enormous potential to resonate with voters. It also has the potential to affect an issue that could have enormous financial implications for Hartz Mountain, the owner of more than 35 million square feet of real estate in the Meadowlands.
Mr. Stern said in an interview that his biggest objection to the current proposal is that it could give exclusive rights to the Meadowlands redevelopment project to another developer without a competitive bidding process.
A special session of the Legislature is scheduled for Sept. 17 to consider amendments to the legislation championed by Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco that would allow construction of the $385 million arena in Newark. That bill, which will be considered by the Assembly Appropriations Committee when it meets on Thursday, is expected to include provisions for the even more costly plans for redeveloping the Meadowlands site of Continental Airlines Arena and for projects at Rowan University in South Jersey, which were added to address legislators' concerns that the region also receive some stimulus for economic development.
Two weeks ago Mr. Schundler addressed the Newark arena and the proposed development in the Meadowlands as a campaign issue. He has called for a statewide referendum on a project that he charged would end up increasing the state's debt. 
"We think that obviously this is an issue which involves being responsive to taxpayers, and we welcome the voice of anybody who advocates that the taxpayers have a say," said Bill Guhl, a spokesman for Mr. Schundler.
Mr. DiFrancesco's plan for the Meadowlands calls for providing hundreds of millions of dollars in state transportation improvements for the site. He also indicated that he wanted to convince a company that has proposed a massive mall on an ecologically sensitive tract of the Meadowlands to swap that land for development rights on the old arena site. 
While no formal agreement on the swap of development parcels has been reached with that developer, the Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., Mr. Stern said that he found this "sole source contract" for a valuable development tract to be "the most egregious part" of the development plan. 
"I don't have a conceptual problem with the arena moving to Newark," said Mr. Stern, whose company owns more than $500 million in Newark real estate and has city-designated development rights on a number of parcels. "What I am against is the sole sourcing of the Meadowlands site, which is one of the most valuable pieces of property in the state. There should a bidding process."
Mr. Stern commissioned a poll by Opinion Dynamics, of Cambridge, Mass., which questioned 500 registered voters about the project and found overwhelming support for a referendum on state support for a new arena. 
Mr. Stern, a longtime supporter of Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and a contributor to his campaigns, said that he knew that his advertising campaign would not make the mayor happy, but he felt that he had to speak up before the Legislature approved the plan. 
Mayor James said through a spokesman that he was "disappointed" at Mr. Stern's campaign to "undermine" the Newark arena plan.
"I am especially disappointed since the city had bent over backwards to assist Hartz Mountain in some half billion in economic development in Newark," the mayor said through his spokeswoman, Pamela Goldstein.

HEADLINE: Canada Warms to Wal-Mart; 
From U.S. Invader to Part of the Landscape in 7 Years

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Maureen Donovan of Onoway, Alberta, warmed the hearts of Wal-Mart executives last month: she was the 50th Canadian to send in a petition begging the mass retailer to open a store nearby.
 "It would be a dream come true to have a rural Wal-Mart in Onoway," Ms. Donovan wrote from her acreage near that farming village of some 800 people, an hour's drive northwest of Edmonton. Ms. Donovan, a network planner for Canada Post who described herself as a "longtime Wal-Mart customer," tossed in the suggestion that she be considered as the new store's first manager. 
 Similarly, Carol Foote, a caregiver in Miramichi, New Brunswick, a city of some 19,000 people, organized a petition for a Wal-Mart last fall in the hope that its drawing power would help lift the local economy. "Our city is not growing because there's nothing to draw people here," Ms. Foote said in a telephone interview. If people from surrounding areas came to shop at a Wal-Mart, "maybe that night they'd go to the theater before they went home." With the help of two friends, Ms. Foote collected 11,276 signatures in six weeks. 
Such pleas are evidence of a remarkable shift in attitude toward Wal-Mart Stores, the world's biggest retailer, since its first foray into Canada seven years ago.
Many Canadians originally saw Wal-Mart's March 1994 purchase of 122 down-at-heel Woolco stores as an unwelcome invasion of their shopping malls. They feared that the giant from the south would drive their favorite stores out of business and impose yet another Ugly American icon on the Canadian landscape.
Wal-Mart's 179 stores have indeed become part of the Canadian landscape. But the reason is that its popularity has far outstripped that of its rivals, propelling it into top place in the country's discount retail market.
"It's basically the same strategies -- we just execute them a little differently" than in the United States, said Mario Pilozzi, chief operating officer of Wal-Mart Canada. "We've been able to identify with our customers here."
One likely reason is that Mr. Pilozzi is himself Canadian, and came to Wal-Mart via Woolco. "When they bought the racks in our stores, they bought me, too," he joked.
The invasion of Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., and other mass merchandisers based in the United States, including Home Depot and Costco, has transformed the way Canadian retailers do business. And Wal-Mart, with its global heft and pervasive presence, has left the biggest footprint.
"There's no question that Wal-Mart has taken the lead and has had a major impact" on the industry, said John Torella, a retail consultant with the J. C. Williams Group in Toronto.
Wal-Mart Canada contributed an estimated 2.4 percent of the company's $191.3 billion in sales, and about 14 percent of all international sales, in the year ended Jan. 31. "The Canadian operation is a major success story for them," said Michael Exstein, a retailing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
Wal-Mart's move into Canada has been much smoother than most of its other foreign forays, Mr. Exstein said. One of the company's weakest links is Germany, where it has not been profitable or gained a significant share of the market since it arrived in 1997.
In Canada, "they started with what Wal-Mart does best -- information technology and logistics," Mr. Exstein said. Then, he said, "they listened to their people in Canada, and allowed them to modify things."
Wal-Mart's storefront greeters may be a little brash for some Canadians, and some customers do not like having their bags sealed as they enter a Wal-Mart store, a measure designed to discourage pilfering. But these seem to be the biggest current complaints. By contrast, the petitions, and the sales figures, show just how popular Wal-Mart has become above the 49th parallel.
The company does not disclose country-by-country sales results. But according to Kubas Consultants, a Toronto market research company, Wal-Mart Canada's sales soared 265 percent from 1994 to 2000 to the Canadian equivalent of $4.5 billion. In the period, sales at its main rival, the Toronto-based Zellers, which has 330 outlets, rose to $3.1 billion, a far more modest 46 percent increase.
Home Depot, which entered Canada the same year as Wal-Mart by buying half a dozen "big box" home improvement stores in southern Ontario, now has 73 outlets in Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. The company does not break down sales figures, but according to estimates by Hardlines, a weekly electronic news service for the home improvement industry, Home Depot Canada sales last year were $1.8 billion.
"There's a saying that when a new Home Depot opens up, five lumberyards go out of business," said Len Kubas, director of Kubas Consultants.
According to Mr. Kubas's data, Costco's sales in Canada almost doubled, to $4.7 billion between 1994 and 2000. Costco has 60 stores in Canada.
The success of Wal-Mart and other United States chains in Canada is only partly explained by their enormous purchasing power, which enables them to offer low prices. They have also brought a degree of imagination and innovation previously lacking in Canadian retailing.
Even George Heller, president of Zellers's parent, the Hudson's Bay Company, acknowledged, "You have to give the devil its due."
Wal-Mart, he said, "has definitely had an impact over all in terms of retailing in Canada -- what they do, they do well."
The typical Wal-Mart Canada store has about 125,000 square feet, though the company has been experimenting with stores half that size in smaller communities.
Until Wal-Mart became such a threat, the Zellers outlets were, Mr. Heller said, "undersized and overpopulated" with merchandise. Zellers has pushed up its average store size from 66,000 square feet in 1994 to 93,000. Still, Mr. Heller said, "we're maybe two years away from having the real estate portfolio the way we want it."
Far from squeezing out local suppliers, the American retailers have opened new horizons for Canadian goods. With the help of the North American Free Trade Agreement, "these stores have provided an outlet for manufacturers to supply stores in Canada and the United States," said Jayson Myers, chief economist at Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an industry group based in Ottawa. "If anything," he said, the manufacturers "have problems gearing up to the scale needed to meet orders from major retailers selling across the continent."
One beneficiary has been the Krave's Candy Company of Winnipeg, Manitoba, which now sells a quarter of its cashew nut and caramel candy to Wal-Mart.
"Wal-Mart has really led us to water in terms of what sells," said Larry Finnson, a co-owner of Krave's. "It's a much closer working relationship than with Zellers."
Mr. Finnson cites Wal-Mart's Retail Link, a software system that allows manufacturers to monitor sales of their products at individual stores. Krave's, with annual sales of $2.6 million, recently began selling its candy to Wal-Mart stores in the United States.
Mr. Exstein of Credit Suisse First Boston said Wal-Mart's head office had the good sense to realize that Canadian managers "had better intelligence" on the local market. According to the company's 2001 annual report, Canadian Wal-Mart Stores have "become leaders in terms of generating new retailing concepts and merchandising techniques, which have been adopted both in the U.S. and abroad."
The increasingly torrid competition has forced rapid consolidation in the Canadian retail sector. About a dozen well-known chains have disappeared in the last decade, most notably the T. Eaton Company, a venerable department store chain that became insolvent. (A few Eatons outlets still exist, but Sears Canada, which is controlled by Sears, Roebuck & Company and which bought Eaton in 1999, now runs most of the stores under the Sears name.)
Changing to attract more affluent shoppers as well, Wal-Mart, whose Canadian operations are based in Mississauga, Ontario, plans to open as many as 20 stores in Canada this year, and to expand in the country at a similar pace in years to come. 
Wal-Mart, meanwhile, is putting more emphasis on its private-label offerings, from Sam's Choice cola to No Boundaries cosmetics. These products are invariably priced below established national brands as a way of building shopper loyalty. Zellers has rapidly expanded its own brands, too, including the exclusive Canadian rights to Martha Stewart merchandise. Private label has jumped from zero to 22 percent of total Zellers sales in the last three years.
Crucial to the Americans' success is a recognition of the differences between American and Canadian consumers. According to Mr. Exstein of Credit Suisse First Boston, Wal-Mart places far more advertising inserts in local newspapers in Canada than it does in the United States, "because that's what the Canadian consumer uses as a shopping vehicle." The Canadian stores also carry a wider variety of furniture, consumer electronics and pet supplies, he said.
Annette Verschuren, chief executive of Home Depot's Canadian unit, says her company has also had to adjust.
For example, the Quebec stores load up on paint, wallpaper and blinds in summer, when Quebecers tend to move, she said, adding that the large numbers of rental units in the province means that people there move more often. And unlike their United States counterparts, most Canadian shoppers "will walk out of your store, and won't tell you what the problems are," she said, so the company has to work harder "to understand what their needs and wants are."
And some Canadians undoubtedly find it amusing that the once-reviled retail invader has even given 300,000 Canadian dollars ($194,000) to commemorate another successful onslaught: a memorial being built near the beach in Normandy, France, where Canadian soldiers landed on D-Day in 1944.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Japan's Electronics Slump Takes a Toll on Southeast Asia

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Lean times for Japan's electronics giants used to mean good tidings for Southeast Asia. Often, they foreshadowed the opening of a Japanese factory somewhere in Malaysia, say, or perhaps the Philippines.
 Thailand -- where Fujitsu took advantage of a strong yen and low Thai salaries more than a decade ago to start making computer printers and hard-disk drives at an industrial estate outside Bangkok -- was a popular choice for Japanese companies, too. And through the 1990's, Fujitsu poured plenty of investment into the factory, which went from producing roughly 12,000 hard drives a year to churning out more than a million a month. 
 Until last month, that is, when Fujitsu said it would sharply cut production not only at the disk drive factory, but also at others in the Philippines and Vietnam as it eliminates 16,400 jobs worldwide in response to deepening losses. Even as some Japanese companies are being forced to close factories at home, much the same process is occurring at their operations around the region. NEC is cutting semiconductor workers in Malaysia. Hitachi, which announced today that it was cutting almost 15,000 jobs, mostly in Japan, is closing computer monitor factories in Malaysia and in Singapore. 
On the most elemental level, Japan's cutbacks in Southeast Asia only highlight how the severe slump in demand for technology goods from the United States and other industrial nations has reverberated around the world. But the downturn in the electronics industry has also become a powerful catalyst for even more profound shifts in Asia's economic balance. One is the slow but steady retreat by Japan as Southeast Asia's largest investor and financier. The second is the rapid re-emergence of China as the region's principal rival for investment and trade.
"It leaves Southeast Asia in a very precarious position," said William C. Belchere, head of fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch in Singapore. 
Japan's own investment figures illustrate the shifts. While Japan's direct investment around the world has fallen 36 percent in the last 10 years as it has grappled with its own economic downturn, its investment in Southeast Asia has been cut in half. Yet its investment in China has more than doubled, Japan's Ministry of Finance reports, making it the top destination in Asia. Japanese electronics companies once favored Malaysia; China now tops their Asian investment rankings.
This signifies Japan's withdrawal from a role it has played almost since China went Communist in 1949. While the United States fought in Korea and then in Vietnam, it left the job of financing development in non-Communist Asia to its World War II-enemy-turned-ally in Tokyo.
Japanese investment in Southeast Asia surged further after the 1985 Plaza Accord by the Group of Seven industrialized nations spurred devaluation of the dollar against the yen, making Japanese products relatively more expensive to American consumers. Like Fujitsu in Thailand, Japanese exporters rushed to build factories where land and labor were cheaper. Sanctions by the United States against imports of some Japanese products helped put Japanese electronics companies at the forefront of the exodus to Southeast Asia.
This influx of yen helped pay for Asia's "miracle" decade, with Southeast Asia following Japan-style development, compelling citizens to save and channeling their money through bankers to finance government-sanctioned developments, with exports fueling robust gains in jobs and incomes.
That all began to unravel in 1995, when the dollar began a sharp rise in value against the yen. Japanese banks began reeling in their $176 billion in loans to Southeast Asia, creating a credit squeeze that some economists say helped touch off the financial crisis two years later.
While the crisis set in motion politically painful efforts to rely on more genuine market forces in place of the iron triangle of governments, banks and conglomerates, the Internet boom served as a temporary anesthetic over the wounds. Asia's export machine revved back into high gear, pulling Southeast Asia's economy out of recession, but leaving the region more reliant than ever on electronics exports, particularly to the United States.
"They're overdependent on electronics," said David L. Cohen, an analyst at Standard & Poor's MMS International in Singapore. Electronics exports accounted for roughly half of Singapore's economy, according to Goldman, Sachs, and slightly more of Malaysia's. Now that demand from the United States has collapsed, Singapore's economy has fallen into recession. Malaysia's economic growth slowed to 0.5 percent last quarter after bounding ahead 8.5 percent last year.
Japan's shrinking role in Southeast Asia has now become a source of political tension. In April, finance ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which groups together all 10 of the region's members, formally censured Japan for allowing the yen to decline so much, a move that helps Japan's own exports at the expense of Southeast Asia's competitiveness.
Japanese companies are clearly aware of the political dimension to their investment. "Our No. 1 priority is to develop each country's economy," said Makoto Mihara, a spokesman for Matsushita Electric Industrial in Tokyo, explaining why the company has no plans to retrench at its 58 factories around Southeast Asia. Matsushita recently posted its first loss in more than 50 years.
Like their American counterparts, Japanese electronics companies are suffering from the way personal computers, printers and many of the parts that go into them have become nearly as interchangeable as wheat or pork bellies. "They're all commodity businesses," said Hiroshi Yoshihara, an analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. "It's difficult to differentiate from competitors' products."
So Japanese companies are conceding defeat in those businesses in which their red ink is most profuse, and that means cutting production even at some of the lowest-cost foreign factories.
Fujitsu's Thai factory, for example, will stop making printers and hard-disk drives for desktop PC's, but will keep making disk drives for laptops and servers. Hitachi is bowing out of the monitor business. And NEC's layoffs at its chip plant in Malaysia are part of 4,000 job cuts the company will make as it consolidates its chip business and outsources production to a new venture with Hitachi.
That, of course, leaves room for further investments in more profitable products as Japanese companies continue to move offshore. And some economists think predictions of Southeast Asia's demise as an electronics center are exaggerated.
"These existing sites are not going to suddenly lose their competitiveness overnight," said Mr. Cohen at MMS International. 
Others see a clear shift by Japanese companies -- together with those from the United States and Taiwan -- toward China. "When they talk about moving offshore, Japanese companies talk about moving to China," said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
In the last five years, China has emerged as the largest supplier of Japanese electronic components in Asia. Even as they cut elsewhere, NEC and Toshiba plan to increase production of mobile phones in China. Hitachi is creating a venture to build air-conditioners there. And as they shut down some chip plants at home, many Japanese companies are selling their equipment on the expectation that it will be shipped to China for use there, said Jonathan Ross, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
"China's gravitational pull is too large," Mr. Ross said. "It's just going to suck in capital and skilled workers and become more and more important."
All this has persuaded the more farsighted of Southeast Asia's leaders that the region's days as mostly a platform for electronics exports may be numbered.
"Many of the things we are now doing, in time, China will do better and cheaper," Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore said in a national address last month. "We will have to stay one step ahead, and move on to new activities."

HEADLINE: The Rebate Helps. Do It Again. 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman ("Greenspan Stands Alone," column, Aug. 31) is right that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, needs help in fighting the looming recession. Congress could provide such help with additional temporary tax cuts. 
 This quarter, from July through September, millions of taxpayers are receiving $600, $500 or $300 rebates, depending on family size. Some are saving their rebates, others are spending them now, and still others will spend most of their rebates before the year ends.
Congress should immediately enact a repeat of the rebate for the next quarter. The United States Treasury has the mailing addresses ready -- new checks could go to the same addresses in the same sequence.
Most technicians advise that a larger stimulus is needed, so Congress should double the size of each check. The rebate should be repeated every quarter until the latest economic data show that a strong economic recovery has begun.

HEADLINE: Candidates Sound Out Core Republican Issues, as Well as Each Other 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from yesterday's debate of the Republican candidates for mayor, as recorded by The New York Times. The debate was broadcast on radio station WNYC-AM (820) and was carried on www.wnyc.org. It was moderated by Brian Lehrer, host of WNYC's "On the Line."

Q. Mr. Bloomberg, this debate is happening in the context of a Republican primary. You're both former Democrats. You've been open about joining the G.O.P. largely to avoid the crowded Democratic primary field. Why should a registered Republican vote for you?

MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG -- Well, I was a Democrat. The Republican Party and the Independence Party both came to me. Their leadership asked me to run as a Republican for mayor. I talked to them. I agree with the Republican leadership in this state. I agree with Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki on most things. They're inclusionary Republicans, and I felt very comfortable in running with them and representing the Republican Party, and I think I'd be a great mayor and they'd be proud to have me.

Q. You agree with them on most things.

BLOOMBERG -- Sure.

Q. Things like?

BLOOMBERG -- Well, I agree with them on how we have to have some compassion for people who are left out, how we have to have good fiscal policies and make sure that we keep taxes down, how we have to build up people rather than tear them apart and make this government work for everybody.

Q. Mr. Badillo, why should a registered Republican vote for you?

HERMAN BADILLO -- Because I have been working with Mayor Rudy Giuliani since 1993. In fact, I ran with Rudy as comptroller in 1993 and carried many parts of the city such as Staten Island. I have been also working with Governor Pataki, who appointed me, first, vice chairman of the Board of Trustees of the City University and then chairman of the board of the City University. And I've agreed with the mayor and worked with him on many areas, especially in education. But, for example, I also was on the committee that selected Bill Bratton as the first police commissioner. And I have been working to improve standards, which I believe I have done, at the City University and also to improve standards at elementary and secondary education, together with the mayor.

Q. Did either of you vote for President Bush last year? Mr. Badillo?

BADILLO -- Oh yes, absolutely. Yes, I voted for the Republican ticket.

Q. Mr. Bloomberg?

BLOOMBERG -- I have said clearly I'm not going to tell anybody who I ever voted for. I'm here to pull people together, not to tear them apart. But it's obvious that almost all of the Republican leadership in New York City has endorsed me. John McCain has endorsed me. We started an ad today where John McCain said he thinks I'd be great mayor and he's in my camp.

Q. Did you vote for Rick Lazio over Hillary Clinton?

BLOOMBERG -- I said that I'm trying to pull people together, not tear them apart. Who I voted for in the privacy of the booth doesn't matter; it's what I'm going to do once I'm mayor.

Q. Did you vote for Rick Lazio?

BADILLO -- Yes. And if you want to be the mayor of New York City, as a leader in the Republican Party, you have to say that you are a real Republican, which I am. And the problem is that Mr. Bloomberg in none of his commercials says that he's a Republican. And in fact he says it doesn't really matter. . . .

Q. Mr. Bloomberg, you made campaign donations to Al Gore for president, Bill Bradley for president, Christopher Dodd, John Corzine, Nita Lowey. What should Republican primary voters think about that?

BLOOMBERG -- I've made donations to a number of Democrats. I've also made donations to an awful lot of Republicans. I've looked to see at various times whether I thought they were the right people for the job. I've been a big supporter of the governor, and I've been a big supporter of the mayor. I've said I will support the governor when he runs next year. I think he's been a good governor. I don't think one should just automatically rule out people because of party any more than I think you have to include them. Somebody that's good or isn't good, somebody you agree with or don't agree with, you can do that independent of party. . . .

Q. Mr. Badillo, under what circumstances would you raise taxes as mayor?

BADILLO -- I would not raise them under any circumstances, because the fact is that we are the most taxed city in the country. And when, for example, Mayor Dinkins increased taxes when he was mayor, the result was that we lost 400,000 jobs and that many middle-class people left the city. If we want to help the city, if we want to keep the jobs that we have, if we want to keep the middle-class people we have, we cannot continue to increase taxes. In fact I favor reducing taxes. . . .

BLOOMBERG -- Well, I don't think that anybody can prudently promise that under no circumstances, because you really don't know the future. But raising taxes when we're going into a declining economic environment is about as bad a fiscal and monetary policy as you can possibly have. We want to encourage people to come here, to bring jobs here, to invest here. And you certainly don't want to do that. . . .

Q. Mr. Bloomberg, do you have a question for Mr. Badillo?

BLOOMBERG -- Sure. Will you join my administration if I'm fortunate enough to become mayor of the city? I'd love to have the benefit of your wisdom, and I think you could be a big plus to my administration. And I'd like to know, would you do it?

BADILLO -- Well, thank you for the offer. But, no, I would not join it. I have been already a commissioner, housing commissioner, a borough president, congressman and deputy mayor. And I'm interested in running for mayor because I think that my experience qualifies me for the top job. And that is what I really think needs to be done, because only at the top job can you make the kinds of changes in the educational system which I made at the City University. So therefore, you need to be in a position to make decisions for yourself and that's why I would not join you.

Q. Do you have a question for Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Badillo?

BADILLO -- Yes. Mr. Bloomberg, you wrote in your book, "Bloomberg by Bloomberg," that nobody should start at the top. In fact, you said you don't start English by reading Chaucer. . . . And I've said that you wouldn't send a general to fight a war who has never been in battle. What makes you think that you are qualified to be mayor of New York City with absolutely no experience?

BLOOMBERG -- Well, I -- the fact of the matter is, I do have all the experience. If you take a look, each period has a different requirement. When Rudy came in, crime was the biggest problem. His experience was as a prosecutor, not in city government. When Ed Koch came in, Ed had had only two years in city government as a city councilman but most of his experience was nine years in working in Washington. The experience you need is real-world experience. Nobody -- we don't need professional politicians. And being able to manage, being able to lead, being customer-focused, being innovative, being able to stand up for what you believe in, being accountable -- those are the skills that the mayor needs. And the real-world people that have come in, like Koch and Giuliani, have done a great job, have left the city infinitely better when they got out of office than when they came in. And I can follow them. . . .

Q. Where are you on school vouchers, Mr. Badillo?

BADILLO -- I would support school vouchers, but I don't think that they are the answer to the problem. It's a good idea to have school choice. I support charter schools. Because in having some choice, we are able to come up with ideas which we might not have thought of about how to improve the public school system. But nothing is going to replace the public school system. And increasingly overwhelmingly the issue is going to be, how do we change the public school system? And that's why I would give that a priority. The other things are peripheral issues.

Q. But yes to vouchers for private schools as far as that would go?

BADILLO -- Yeah, but it doesn't amount to anything significant.

BLOOMBERG -- I have no problems with privately funded vouchers. Publicly funded vouchers are just not going to happen in our lifetime in this city. And I agree with Mr. Badillo. You have to focus on providing the best public school education for the 1 million 100 kids that go there. I do think we should always try new things. There's nothing wrong with competition for the public school system so that they get better and they get new ideas and they feel that they have to deliver a service. . . .

Q. Is Mayor Giuliani right to be withholding money from the public schools right now? Mr. Badillo?

BADILLO -- Yes. I prepared the budget at the request of Mayor Giuliani in 1994, and I showed at that time that there was a huge amount of waste. For example, I showed that special education cost one-quarter of the budget and that the cost of special education was $25,598 per student, which is more than it would cost to send the kid to a private school in Manhattan. And the categories that they use for special education were not the categories that we approved in Congress. What was happening was that kids who were disruptive were being sent to special education and that hundreds of millions of dollars were being wasted on just that one area alone.

Q. And you were on this program at that time and there were cuts in the bureaucracy after that. And Chancellor Levy just eliminated another, what, 300 positions from the bureaucracy? Should the mayor still -- you still think the mayor should be withholding?

BADILLO -- There are more cuts on the way. I mean, the chancellor himself says that he wants to cut 1,500 positions, but he's going to do it over three years. If the positions need to be cut, why wait three years? Why not do them now? That's why the mayor wants to eliminate the Board of Education, and that's why I support the mayor on that issue.

BLOOMBERG -- There's a game being played here. The mayor is trying to force change. The only ability he has to do that is by withholding money. The bureaucracy doesn't want the change. What they always do in a case like that is, they threaten to go after the most important thing rather than the things that you want them to cut. I think in the end they'll clearly work this out. . . .

Q. Would you want Harold Levy to continue as chancellor if you become mayor?

BLOOMBERG -- Well it's much too early to tell in picking staff. And Harold Levy I know, he's an honest person, he cares very much. The results during his administration are not what we would like. He would agree with that. What you do is you have a search and you find the best chancellor that you can. If Harold Levy's interested in continuing on, he should be in the pool of people we consider.

BADILLO -- No, I would not want to keep him. He is the best example of why a business leader should not be mayor of New York City. Because the fact is that here is a man who claims to be a business leader and yet there's a cost overrun of about $3 billion in the capital budget. Which means that dozens and dozens of schools that were supposed to be built are not going to be built. And he knew about this and did not tell ----

BLOOMBERG -- Look, we can pile on Harold Levy ----

BADILLO -- Excuse me, do not interrupt, please. I did not interrupt you. He did not reveal this to the mayor or to the City Council. No. 2, he claims to have eliminated social promotion, but in fact he sent 350,000 parents letters saying that the kids would be left back if they did not pass the test. It turns out that two-thirds of them did not pass the test, and they're being promoted anyway. So therefore this is a facade, it's a mirage. And I want public officials who keep their word, and if they say that they're going to do something, they'll do it. And I would therefore not keep Chancellor Levy.

BLOOMBERG -- Blaming one guy is ridiculous. The school board knew and didn't do anything, parts of the City Council knew and didn't do anything, the group that builds all these schools knew and didn't do anything. I'm not defending Harold Levy any more than anybody else. But let's -- it's not one person. It is a whole system that is out of control, reports to nobody, and not one person. That's the trouble with politicians, they think that they can change one thing and leave the whole structure the same and get results. That's not what you have to do here.

Q. Money is obviously an issue in this race. Mr. Bloomberg, you had spent $16 million as of early August. I guess it must be over $20 million by now. Mr. Badillo, you told me before that only this week you have reached even the $250,000 in small donations required to get public matching funds. What a contrast. Mr. Bloomberg, how should people think of your campaign spending?

BLOOMBERG -- Well, I came to New York City with debts and a dream. I made all my money, and I'm spending some of it to tell people who I am and to get my message out. It's provided for under all of the laws. John McCain is campaigning for me, does an ad for me, doesn't have any problems with it. It's ridiculous to think that you can buy an election. All you can do, and if you're an outsider you have to have some money to do it, is go and tell people who you are, look them in the eye. I'm trying to go to every single neighborhood in this city and shake every hand I can and explain to people who I am, what I stand for, why they should vote for me, and what I will do after I get elected. And the money clearly helps. And I'm sympathetic to Mr. Badillo and his quest to raise money. It is very difficult, and you have this whole issue of special interests. People give money because they want access or they want influence. In my case, you don't have anybody that will have any influence or any access special from anybody else. I'm my own man, it's my money, and I have to report only to those people that I meet in every neighborhood. Not to money bundlers, not to fund raisers, not to special interests.

Q. Mr. Badillo, how do you think people should think of his self-financing?

BADILLO -- I think they should be outraged. I came to New York City when I was about 12 years old from Puerto Rico. I had no parents, I had no money, I couldn't speak the language, and I worked my way up. And I got involved in public life and I was able to move ahead because of education. And for many years, I have been working to change the campaign finance laws so that people like me can have an opportunity to move ahead and to run for major office. And what Mr. Bloomberg is doing is nullifying the campaign finance laws of New York City, which are the most liberal in the city. And the reality is that he said he is supported by the Republican Party leaders. Of course he is subject to special interests. I'm not -- I don't have any special interests because nobody have given me any real money. And so therefore I am and historically have been a truly independent candidate who takes a fixed point of view. But we cannot continue to have billionaires running for major office because that is damaging to the very fabric of democracy. . . .

Q. Considering how long you've been in politics and how many people you know, you've only barely been able to raise the $250,000 from a thousand or more donors required for the public matching funds. Is that a sign of a lack of real support out there?

BADILLO -- No, it isn't at all. It's only because people are afraid of Mr. Bloomberg's money, and I know because they've told me so. . . .

Q. Mr. Bloomberg, what do you think?

BLOOMBERG -- Nelson Rockefeller spent -- by today's standards Nelson Rockefeller spent more than anybody's probably ever spent. J.F.K. spent an enormous amount of their own money. Lots of people do that. . . .

Q. Mr. Badillo, a lot of New Yorkers who will reach the five-year federal lifetime limit on welfare this year will apply for state benefits. Should they automatically qualify?

BADILLO -- Absolutely not. I agree with Mayor Giuliani that they should be called into the jobs centers that Mayor Giuliani has established and they should be evaluated to find out why during that five-year period they were unable to find a job. And to help them to find a job but not to be getting automatic help, because if you get automatic help they'd never go off welfare. That was the problem that we had before, where we had generation after generation of people staying on welfare with no basic change.

BLOOMBERG -- The people that we're talking about generally are not those that have been able to get jobs or will get jobs. And you just can't say to them, "Well, you come in." We have to go out and outreach to them. We just -- otherwise they're going to be sleeping on the streets, their children are going to go hungry. You just can't do that. We're a compassionate society. Nobody wants to waste money, but these people need help.

Q. Automatic qualification?

BLOOMBERG -- No, I didn't say that. But we have to go out to them, not expect them to come to us.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Trying to Determine How Assets Affect Spending 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Hoping to get a better fix on how household wealth affects consumption, the Federal Reserve is trying to sort out the ways in which different assets -- stocks or homes, for example -- affect consumer spending, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said today.
 A rule of thumb used by many economists is that for every one dollar increase in a household's wealth, the members of that household increase their spending by 3 to 5 cents. The Fed has found, however, that when a home is sold, the seller's consumer spending goes up 10 to 15 cents for every dollar of capital gain, Mr. Greenspan said. 
 Such information is helpful in planning interest rate policy at a time when household wealth invested in stocks is shrinking while home values are rising. "In such circumstances, differences in the propensities to consume out of the capital gains and losses on different types of assets could have significant implications for aggregate demand," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan spoke at the opening session of the Fed's annual symposium in this mountain resort, a gathering, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, that draws most of the Fed's policy makers. Economists from Wall Street and academia also attended, along with a few foreign officials. It was Mr. Greenspan's first public appearance since the Fed cut interest rates last week by one-quarter of a percentage point -- its seventh cut of the year -- in an effort to revive the weak economy.
Rather than discuss Fed policy and the slowdown -- a topic that could stir up the markets -- Mr. Greenspan devoted his 20-minute speech to a neutral discussion of the Fed's efforts to sort out the wealth effect and its impact on spending. The Fed's seven interest rate cuts this year have been aimed in large part at encouraging consumers to spend and at sustaining home prices and home construction.
Because "consumer spending has amounted to 90 percent of income, it might appear that income is largely sufficient to explain consumption," Mr. Greenspan said. But the Fed's studies tell a different story. "Wealth by itself now appears to explain about one-fifth of the total level of consumer outlays," the chairman said.
Although dollar for dollar, capital gains on home sales appear to have a more powerful effect on spending than rising stock market wealth, the latter plays a bigger role in the end because of the huge scope of equity holdings, Mr. Greenspan said. "Household capital gains on directly held equities and mutual funds in recent years have been two to four times the size of overall gains on homes," he said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Debate Becomes Battle On Credentials 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Meeting for the first time in a debate, the Republican mayoral candidates, Herman Badillo and Michael R. Bloomberg, played up their starkly different backgrounds yesterday and defended their party credentials. Each insisted he was the right kind of Republican to lead New York City, which is overwhelmingly Democratic, at a time of economic uncertainty.
 Though neither candidate dominated the hourlong radio broadcast on WNYC-AM, Mr. Badillo, a career government official who has been overshadowed in the primary campaign, was more aggressive in trying to distinguish himself. 
 When Mr. Bloomberg talked about his vast personal wealth in the context of modest roots -- "I came to New York City with debts and a dream" -- Mr. Badillo shot back with his own humble story. 
"I came to New York City when I was about 12 years old from Puerto Rico, " Mr. Badillo said. "I had no parents, I had no money, I couldn't speak the language, and I worked my way up." 
The debate was noteworthy for Republican voters interested in hearing the two candidates interact because Mr. Bloomberg has agreed to only one other face-to-face encounter before the Sept. 11 primary.
It was held at WNYC under strict conditions. One photographer and one cameraman were permitted in the studio for the first nine minutes. After that, they were required to work through a soundproof window from an adjoining room. No print journalists were permitted in the studio, where Mr. Badillo and Mr. Bloomberg sat with the moderator, Brian Lehrer, around an octagonal table. The two candidates were separated by an empty chair.
In one of Mr. Badillo's stinging and more telling remarks, he said the tumultuous tenure of Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy should be seen as evidence that Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who owns a huge communications company but has never held public office, would be best advised to stay out of government.
"He is the best example of why a business leader should not be mayor of New York City," Mr. Badillo said of Mr. Levy, who worked as an executive at Citigroup before taking the schools job last year.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has been accused of ducking direct encounters with his rival, appeared mostly unperturbed by Mr. Badillo's assertiveness and sought to exude the confidence of a front-runner. He stuck to the familiar themes of his daily campaigning and refrained from making the kind of off-the-cuff remarks that have sometimes tripped him up and garnered negative media coverage.
Though he has been critical of Mr. Levy in his speeches, Mr. Bloomberg would not say yesterday whether he would keep him as chancellor, insisting that any good manager would give all applicants a fair review. And when given the opportunity to pose a question to Mr. Badillo, Mr. Bloomberg offered a not-so-subtle indication of where he thinks the Republican contest is headed: He asked Mr. Badillo to accept a job in a Bloomberg administration.
"I'd love to have the benefit of your wisdom, and I think you could be a big plus to my administration," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Badillo, who said he was overqualified for a job like that, spent much of the debate portraying Mr. Bloomberg, 59, as unfit for the city's highest office because he has no experience in governing. Whenever possible, Mr. Badillo, 72, injected his own resume into the discussion, relating experiences from his nearly 40 years in government and ticking off his previous job titles, from Bronx borough president to congressman.
When it was his turn to ask Mr. Bloomberg a question, Mr. Badillo kept with the theme of experience.
"You wrote in your own book, 'Bloomberg by Bloomberg,' that nobody should start at the top," Mr. Badillo said. "In fact, you said you don't start English by reading Chaucer." He then asked, "What makes you think that you are qualified to be mayor of New York City with absolutely no experience?"
Later, Mr. Badillo turned to another of his favorite topics: Mr. Bloomberg's fortune. He accused the self-made billionaire of damaging "the very fabric of democracy" by using his personal wealth to finance his mayoral campaign. In a campaign finance statement filed yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg, who is paying for his own campaign, reported spending $20 million on the primary race, more than 50 times what Mr. Badillo reported.
"We cannot continue to have billionaires running for major office because that is damaging to the very fabric of democracy," Mr. Badillo said. "Because you exclude 99.9 percent of the population, unless you get someone who's as stubborn as I am and is not deterred by the power of money."
In a message clearly intended for the narrow pool of Republican primary voters who will determine his fate, Mr. Badillo also challenged Mr. Bloomberg's credentials to carry the Republican banner, noting Mr. Bloomberg's long affiliation with the Democratic Party before he switched parties last fall. Mr. Badillo said he enjoys the support of grass-roots Republican groups that have not been seduced by Mr. Bloomberg's money.
"If you want to be the mayor of New York City, as a leader in the Republican Party, you have to say that you are a real Republican, which I am," Mr. Badillo said. "And the problem is that Mr. Bloomberg in none of his commercials says that he's a Republican. And in fact he says it doesn't really matter."
Mr. Bloomberg said that his success in private business gives him managerial skills that are particularly relevant as the city enters a period of economic change. He said he sympathized with Mr. Badillo's difficulty in raising money for his campaign, but he said a Mayor Bloomberg would not be beholden to special interests because of his financial independence. To bolster his claim, Mr. Bloomberg announced that Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has been the lead architect of campaign finance reform, had endorsed his candidacy in a new television advertisement.
And as a proven entrepreneur, Mr. Bloomberg said, he would not be trapped by the old ideas of a career politician.
"The experience we need is real-world experience," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We don't need professional politicians. And being able to manage, being able to lead, being customer-focused, being innovative, being able to stand up for what you believe in, being accountable -- those are the skills that the mayor needs."
Mr. Bloomberg had a tougher time when it came to questions by both Mr. Badillo and Mr. Lehrer, the moderator, about his Republican bona fides. Though Mr. Badillo is also a former Democrat, he first ran on the Republican line in 1993 in the comptroller's race but did not officially change his registration to Republican until 1998. Mr. Bloomberg switched late last year when he made the political calculation that he could not win in the more crowded Democratic mayoral primary.
Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg refused to disclose how he voted in last year's presidential race or in the Democratic presidential primary, when he was still a registered Democrat. He also would not say whether he voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton or Rick A. Lazio in the New York Senate race.
"I said that I'm trying to pull people together, not tear them apart," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Who I voted for in the privacy of the booth doesn't matter; it's what I'm going to do once I'm mayor."
Mr. Bloomberg used the word "compassion" several times in discussing his political philosophy -- apparently a reference to President Bush's "compassionate conservatism" -- and said it was the Republican Party leadership in New York that approached him about running for mayor.
He said that he agreed with Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both Republicans, "on most things."
"I agree with them on how we have to have some compassion for people who are left out, how we have to have good fiscal policies and make sure that we keep taxes down, how we have to build up people rather than tear them apart and make this government work for everybody," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Despite their appeals to Republican voters, both candidates flunked the ultimate test of party loyalty when Mr. Lehrer posed it. Would the loser support the winner of the Republican primary?
Mr. Badillo declined to answer, saying it was a hypothetical question. He did not mention it, but he has also petitioned the Board of Elections to create a new party for the November general election, Citizens and Labor Unity, with him as the mayoral standard bearer.
Mr. Bloomberg said he would still be in the race as a candidate on two other lines, the Independent Party and a new party he recently established, the Student First Party.
After the debate, Mr. Badillo complained to reporters that Mr. Bloomberg would not debate more often, and Mr. Bloomberg's campaign complained that Mr. Badillo had waffled on some issues. For example, Mr. Badillo said yesterday that he supported school vouchers, but he had previously said they were unconstitutional. Mr. Badillo on Thursday joined critics of cuts in school spending, but yesterday he defended the cuts.
James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Badillo, said his positions on the vouchers are not contradictory, but Mr. Vlasto conceded that Mr. Badillo "possibly misunderstood" Mr. Lehrer's question about school spending cuts.

HEADLINE: No Agreement Yet With Mexico On Immigration Plan, U.S. Says 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
After months of extensive negotiations, the White House was forced to acknowledge today that it would not reach a comprehensive new agreement with Mexico on immigration next week when President Bush meets with President Vicente Fox.
 Instead, the two presidents will endorse a general set of principles and a framework for regulating the flow of migrants between the neighboring countries, leaving aides to work out thorny details and to build political support for the measures in the next several months. 
 "The immigration issue is one that is a complex issue," Mr. Bush told reporters today, saying he was pleased with the progress of the talks so far. "The issue will require more than just the administration's involvement. It requires a willing Congress to address the issue." 
Mr. Bush views the immigration issue as a critical step in developing a stronger relationship with Mexico, which he has put at the top of his foreign policy agenda. 
A committee led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft has recommended expanding a temporary worker program that would allow some of the estimated three million Mexicans living here unlawfully to earn permanent legal residence.
But carrying out the plan is rife with problems that months of negotiations have not resolved. How does the administration do it without calling it an amnesty and seeming to reward lawbreakers? How can Mr. Bush justify singling out Mexicans and not people from other nations, even nations in Latin America where he is trying to broker a new, broader trade accord that would link the entire hemisphere?
That complicated balancing act is exactly why it will take much longer for the two countries to work out an accord, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, tamping down expectations for the state visit, as Mr. Powell and Mexican officials did earlier this month.
"There are people who are already in this country, contributing to the American economy even though they may not be legal, and they are paying taxes," Mr. Fleischer said. "As a result of their labor and their efforts, Americans are able to enjoy many aspects of life because of the immigration work force."
But the president does not want to take any steps that would encourage new waves of illegal immigrants or "put people who may be illegal ahead of people who have waited patiently, while being legal," Mr. Fleischer said.
For Mr. Bush, the visit is partly about symbolism. During his just-ended vacation at his Texas ranch, the president talked extensively about the black-tie state dinner next Wednesday with Mr. Fox. Mr. Bush considers Mr. Fox, perhaps more than any other international leader, to be a personal friend as well as a partner.
While the talks next week will address a range of other issues, including energy, trade and border safety, immigration will dominate the discussions. Mexican and American officials said they expected the two presidents to agree in principle to an expanded guest-worker program, a limited legalization plan, border safety improvements and discussions about raising the number of permanent visas for Mexicans.
An unusual coalition of business, labor, human rights and religious groups have rallied around the proposal to allow some immigrants living here unlawfully to earn permanent legal residency.
But the idea has polarized two of Mr. Bush's key political constituencies. The plan has galvanized Latinos, now the nation's largest minority and a crucial voting bloc that Mr. Bush is courting. But it has alienated many conservatives in Congress, which must approve or reject any plan.
Mr. Bush repeated last week that he opposed a blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants, like the one President Reagan enacted in 1986 that ultimately granted legal status to nearly three million immigrants from all countries. But today Mr. Bush voiced support for an expanded guest worker program.
"It's in our nation's interest that if someone's looking for a worker, that we figure out how to combine the two," he said.
There is now a small-scale, cumbersome plan that allows mostly agriculture laborers to get temporary visas. Under one proposal, a pool of new migrants employed in service jobs like those at hotels and restaurants could apply for temporary work permits with the possibility of earning permanent residency over time.
At least some of the Mexicans already in the United States illegally could earn permanent lawful status if they could certify that they had been living and working in the country for a specified time, had been paying taxes and did not have criminal records.
The Fox administration has broken down the roughly 3.5 million illegal Mexican immigrants by the year that they arrived in the United States: those who arrived right after the 1986 law, those who arrived from 1997 to 2000, and those who have arrived since 2000.
Any legalization would happen in waves, said one Mexican official, with the first group to get the first benefits. The official said negotiators were discussing certain work restrictions that would, for example, prohibit low-skilled workers like meatpackers or waiters from moving into higher-skilled jobs.
Mexico would like to have an agreement reached this year and legislation presented to Congress next year.
"It is urgent that we should have some kind of fleshed-out agreement, with numbers, with details, by the end of the year, or by the beginning of next year," Jorge G. Castaneda, Mexico's foreign minister, said on Wednesday.
Administration officials say they need time to build support in Congress. This month, six former chairmen of the Republican National Committee, including Senator Bob Dole and Haley Barbour, sent a letter to Mr. Bush urging him to support an expanded guest worker program and a limited legalization plan.
"The PR side of this and the salesmanship of this will be difficult," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a former chairman of the Republican committee who signed the letter. "But there's got to be some kind of limited legalization program."
But Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who supports a new guest worker program, has vowed that any plan legalizing illegal workers would have to pass "over my cold, dead political body." 
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican who heads the House Judiciary Committee, has said any legalization plan is "dead on arrival" without first overhauling the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
A coalition of groups that oppose increased immigration, led by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, this month began a $500,000 radio and television ad campaign in a dozen states, including Florida, Arkansas and Alabama, opposing any legalization program.
Proponents say that if the administration allows the timetable for sending the proposal to Congress to stretch out too far into next year, Mr. Bush will put Mr. Fox in a difficult bind and will lose legislative momentum.
"If Republicans don't move on this, and don't find some leadership from the White House, Democrats will seize on it," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican. "It would be almost folly to let this slip through our fingers."

HEADLINE: Educators See No Layoffs From Cutting 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Despite the warnings of significant disruptions in the school system, New York City school superintendents and union officials said yesterday that budget cuts ordered this week by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy will not require layoffs and will not affect most day-to-day activities in regular classrooms.
 Instead of having their jobs cut, hundreds of school aides, secretaries, paraprofessionals and assistant principals are being moved around to fill vacancies, officials said. Some administrators will return to the classroom as teachers. Paraprofessionals may be shifted to fill vacancies or to substitute for absent colleagues. 
 While the superintendents said the schools would suffer by shuffling the workers, the statements seem to lend credibility to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's repeated assertions that the Board of Education has too many people employed in jobs outside the classroom. The superintendents also said, however, that children, parents and teachers will notice cuts on the margins of the classroom: there will be less teacher training, and many after-school programs, including some reading tutorials, art classes and sports, will be curtailed.
Several school superintendents said that although core classroom activities were being spared, the cuts will severely curtail programs championed by Mr. Giuliani that were intended to raise reading and math test scores and to increase the rates at which students move up a grade. And some said they feared that if the economy deteriorates and more cuts are needed, schools will be in big trouble.
"As painful as the cuts may be, one thing we wanted to ensure was the integrity of the classroom," said Matthew Bromme, superintendent of Community School District 27 in Queens. "But the amount of discretionary money available to a superintendent or to the chancellor is not that much. If you cut a few dollars, you're cutting to the bone."
Mr. Giuliani continued to assert yesterday during his weekly radio program that the Board of Education is bloated and its spending could be cut without harming the classroom. He accused Mr. Levy of using "shock tactics" in describing the potential devastation of the planned cuts, and compared it to threatening to sell the Washington Monument to balance the federal budget.
Mr. Levy, however, said that the cuts were damaging both to services to children and to the morale of the staff. "This isn't gamesmanship, this is a reality," he said. "The budget shortfall will have very serious implications for the services that the Board of Education provides."
Despite the war of words over whether the Board of Education budget is being cut enough, superintendents described the $150 million in cuts as real but not devastating.
Mr. Levy said on Wednesday that more than 2,300 jobs would be eliminated through attrition and by deferring hiring. The cuts Mr. Levy has ordered come to about $174 per student, according to the board.
Mr. Bromme said he had cut his district office's staff by 30 percent, and that many of those people -- including teacher trainers and coordinators of science and special education -- would return to classrooms as teachers. The remaining district staff members, he said, would have to train new teachers and oversee programs in addition to performing their current duties.
The administrators returning to classrooms, he said, could end up supplanting new teachers.
"This is very, very bad for teacher recruitment," said Robert E. Riccobono, a former superintendent in Brooklyn who now teaches at New York University. "You will never get good people in the system if they are going to get a phone call saying, 'Remember that job? Maybe you'll have it, maybe you won't.' "
The district in Queens will cut Project Read, an after-school program for children who are behind in reading, to third grade only, from first through third grades.
The district will eliminate the jobs of 43 paraprofessionals who provide individual attention to children in kindergarten classes, which will now be staffed by just one teacher. Mr. Bromme has also eliminated after-school softball, basketball and chess in middle schools, but he said he would look for other sources of funding to restore the programs.
District 2, which extends from Chinatown and TriBeCa to the Upper East Side, has been asked to cut $3.7 million out of a $125 million budget, said Roy Moskowitz, a spokesman. Most of the schools will no longer have after-school academic programs paid for by the district, he said, and the district will not fill the positions of a liaison to parents and a technology administrator. District 2 has prided itself on its teacher-training programs, which outside reports have credited for raising test scores. But it will save $500,000 by cutting training in science, though it is sparing math and reading training.
District 1 on the Lower East Side is cutting back on test preparation in math and reading after school and on Saturdays, said Helen C. Santiago, the superintendent. It will delay the opening of after-school programs, in the hope that grant money can be found to replace tax-levy money.
Several districts said they were cutting back on supplies, such as pencils, paper and art supplies. Ms. Santiago said she had asked her staff to save paper by cutting the number of memos by half, and had asked teachers to avoid printing material from the Internet. 
Neil Kreinik, superintendent of District 28 in Queens, said he was cutting back the hours of school aides, along with middle-school sports programs.
Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a budget monitoring group, said that while the State Legislature or the City Council may yet come to the rescue of the school system, the budget problems stem from city and state budgeting decisions.
A potential bombshell is the as-yet unresolved teachers' contract, she said. Traditionally, the city has paid for the costs resulting from a contract. But this year, the mayor decided to shift 40 percent of the cost of the contract, or an estimated $180 million, to the state, meaning that that state aid is not available for other school needs. The ultimate cost of the contract remains unknown.
A $500 million tax cut advocated by the mayor and the City Council also required shifts in the budget that contributed to the school spending cuts, Ms. Connell said.
At the same time, the state budget for education has come in far lower than the city anticipated.
"School's opening," Mr. Riccobono said, "so the question is who's going to blink first?"

HEADLINE: White House Again Delays Reagan Files' Release 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
For the third time, the White House has delayed the release of thousands of documents from the Reagan presidency, including papers from senior advisers who serve in the current administration, officials said today.
 The White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, notified the national archivist today that the White House would require "a few more weeks" to determine the best means for making the records public. 
 The papers were scheduled to be released in January, but Mr. Gonzales twice informed the archivist, John Carlin, of the need for extensions. In obtaining another delay, Mr. Gonzales said he was concerned about establishing a proper precedent for complying with the Presidential Records Act of 1978. 
The law provides that documents dealing with White House aides' advice to a president must be released 12 years after the end of the administration. Ronald Reagan's papers are the first to fall under its purview.
Critics accused the Bush administration of seeking to withhold documents that might be embarrassing for sitting officials who once served Mr. Reagan, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Mitch Daniels Jr., the budget director; and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief White House economist.
The decision also affects the vice-presidential papers of George Bush, the president's father.
Anna Nelson, a historian at American University, said the delays ran counter to lawmakers' intent to make the documents public. The act grew out of President Richard M. Nixon's efforts to shield his papers from the public view post-Watergate.
"The decision not only goes against the spirit of the act, but goes against Congress," Ms. Nelson said. 
Based on the collections of other presidents, she said the papers most likely included meeting summaries, memorandums of policy decisions, briefing papers and correspondence among White House advisers.
"They know they are setting precedents," Ms. Nelson said. "Reagan is the first president under the act. And you have to remember, 12 years will be up for former President Bush in 2005. They are thinking ahead, and they are scared of what might be in those records."

HEADLINE: Is the Future Just a Tense? 

BYLINE:  By Roger Kimball; Roger Kimball is the managing editor of The New Criterion. His latest book is "Experiments Against Reality: The Fate of Culture in the Postmodern Era."

 BODY:
 GRAMMARS OF CREATION
By George Steiner.
344 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $29.95.
 It is difficult not to be impressed by George Steiner. Part literary critic, part existential elegist, he presents himself as the polymath's polymath. The erudition is almost as extraordinary as the prose: dense, knowing, allusive. In Steiner's work the suggestion of total cultural mastery, from the pre-Socratics to the postmodern, is inescapable. Readers familiar with Stephen Potter's books on one-upmanship will be familiar with the technique. Telling us that the Marxist critic Georg Lukacs once said that "not a single bar in Mozart could ever be harnessed to inhuman purpose," Steiner then asks, "Is it true of the second aria of the Queen of the Night in 'The Magic Flute'?" Would you care to hazard a guess? 
Steiner made his reputation with books like "After Babel" (1975), a long and dazzling inquiry into the possibility of translation. Most of us, noting that libraries are full of works in translation, neglect such questions. Since translations are actual, we hastily conclude that they must also be possible. 
Steiner wants to unsettle such complacency. His new book, "Grammars of Creation," is full of disquieting questions. "Does the eclipse of the messianic," he asks, "infirm the concept of philosophic and poetic creation even as deconstructive and 'postmodern' theories subvert that of the 'creator'?" It is possible, of course, that "infirm" is a misprint for "inform." It is part of the beauty of Steiner's prose that such details are irrelevant. Either way, the question is perfectly unanswerable.
Steiner has been a presence in cultural life for some three decades now. For many years, his book reviews appeared regularly in The New Yorker. They still appear frequently in such intellectual organs as The Times Literary Supplement of London. His oeuvre exhibits a remarkable consistency. The atmosphere is one of permanent, though inextricably bookish, emergency. In "Grammars of Creation," he has outdone himself by suggesting that "the future tense" is "the most deep-seated of the many crises or revolutions we are experiencing."
Steiner maintains this sense of emergency chiefly by two rhetorical props. One is the Holocaust. Steiner has dilated at great length about its intellectual and moral effects. He has been particularly loquacious about the idea that the Holocaust made language (or philosophy, literature, art) impossible. In "Grammars of Creation," for example, he tells us that "the classical and Judaic ideal of man as 'language animal,' as uniquely defined by the dignity of speech . . . came to an end in the antilanguage of the death camps." 
This use of the Holocaust not only gives the appearance of establishing one's credentials as a person of great moral gravity; it also stymies criticism. Who wants to risk the charge of insensitivity by objecting that the Holocaust had nothing to do with the "ideal of man as 'language animal' "?
Steiner's second method for maintaining the aura of emergency involves God. Or perhaps the absence of God. It is often difficult to say. That is part of Steiner's genius. Indeed, it may be as a kind of postmodern negative theologian that he really excels. He lets his readers know early and often that, like them, he has absorbed plenty of Nietzsche and Heidegger. He has absorbed them so thoroughly that he warns against subscribing to a vulgar conception of Nietzsche's declaration about the death of God. At a moment when there are so many atheists about, one must be careful to distinguish oneself. Steiner shows that he is as thoroughly disabused as the most radical skeptic. At the same time, he wants to infuse his writing with supreme existential, which means religious, pathos. So we get a lot of sentences like: "When Shakespeare finds 'bodying forth' to image the generic presence of content within form, of meaning inside act, he is analogizing directly with (where 'to analogize' is also derivative from the theological) the 'real presence' of the incarnate in the Eucharist." 
Steiner is a great master at such conversation stoppers. To take another example, he begins "Grammars of Creation" by observing, "We have no more beginnings." What can one say? We are clearly dealing with bad news here. It is characteristic of Steiner's procedure to complicate the anxiety by learned allusion: "Today, in Western orientations -- observe the muted presence of morning light in that word -- the reflexes, the turns of perception, are those of afternoon, of twilight. (I am generalizing. My argument, throughout, is vulnerable and open to what Kierkegaard called the 'the wounds of negativity.' ")
We are grateful for that modest acknowledgment, of course. But since he mentions his "argument," one wonders: what is it? Steiner early on quotes Cyril Connolly's line about its being "closing times in the gardens of the West." "Grammars of Creation" is not simply another exclamation about the decline of the West, however. Steiner is more ambitious -- or at any rate more diffuse -- than Oswald Spengler. After a few pages retailing the horrors of the 20th century, he stuns us with the remark that he wants to consider "something of the impact of this darkened condition on grammar." On grammar? I, too, was made nervous. But Steiner quickly assures us that by "grammar" he does not mean, well, grammar, but rather "the articulate organization of perception, reflection and experience, the nerve structure of consciousness when it communicates with itself and with others." 
That is part of the argument here. Another part has to do with "correlations between the eclipse of the messianic" -- a favorite phrase, that -- and the 'recession into empty phrasing' of 'God' on the one hand and the evolution of nonrepresentational and aleatory art forms on the other." 
Steiner has some astute things to say about the latter. He is certainly right to stress the deep influence of Marcel Duchamp, whom he aptly characterizes as "a high priest of the irrelevant." Yet for my money, Steiner is at his best on -- or perhaps I mean "in" -- the subject of "empty phrasing" and " 'God.' " "Grammars of Creation" had its origins in the Gifford Lectures, one of the most distinguished of all distinguished academic lectureships. William James's "Varieties of Religious Experience" is a predecessor. That fact, more even than Steiner's many examples, is a vivid confirmation of his theory that things have gone badly.

HEADLINE: Handcuffed By History 

BYLINE:  By William Bunch; William Bunch is a senior writer for The Philadelphia Daily News and author of "Jukebox America."

 BODY:
The shotgun blast that struck Lillie Belle Allen in the chest was so powerful that it blew her out of her sneakers. While she lay half-dead beside her family's Cadillac, a group of about a dozen young men fired more than 100 rounds at the car. Allen's sister, brother-in-law and parents remained trapped inside. "So many pings, so many booms -- oh, God!" the sister, Hattie Dickson, would recall many years later. "We asked Jesus to come and help us."
 This was July 21, 1969, in York, Pa., the fifth night of race riots that turned the blue-collar city into a war zone. The shooting at the Cadillac did not stop until a police armored vehicle rumbled up the street and a man stepped out. While so much about Lillie Belle Allen's killing remains in dispute 32 years later, everyone agrees on what they heard next. 
 "It's me, Charlie."
Now it is another balmy July night, in 2001, and the former police officer, Charles Robertson, is peacefully taking in an amateur baseball game in Mt. Wolf, Pa., a small Susquehanna River town some 10 miles outside of York, the city where he has been mayor for nearly eight years. Robertson, 67, is sitting in a yellow lawn chair behind the chain-link fence in center field. He is wearing a Colorado Rockies T-shirt, a white baseball cap, black shorts and beat-up tan sneakers with Velcro straps. There is no one else within 100 feet of him.
"It's not been a real pleasure now," Robertson told me earlier that afternoon when I asked him if he still goes to many ballgames. "Everybody knows me, and then everybody wants to talk to me about it." The mayor doesn't need to explain that "it" is his pending trial on charges that he was an accomplice in Allen's murder that night back in 1969, that before he appeared on the scene in the armored vehicle he had told gang members to "kill as many niggers as you can" and even had passed out bullets. "I thank them, you know, for having an interest, but you know. . . ." His voice trailed off.
So now, as I sit down next to Robertson, I try to oblige the mayor by talking about anything but the riots. We discuss his long and unsuccessful quest to bring minor-league baseball back to York, an ex-girlfriend who left him to work at the U.S. Embassy in the Sudan and the reasons that he has remained a bachelor all his life. "Sports kept me from getting married," says Robertson, explaining how he spent all his spare time coaching and refereeing. "You would go from football to basketball to baseball."
Even though his lawyers have told him not to talk about what happened in 1969 or about the murder trial -- which is expected to begin some time next year -- Robertson can't help himself. Soon, he is insisting that other than leading a "white power" chant in a park the day before the killing, he did nothing wrong. He is being picked on, he says, for political reasons. "I wonder how in hell I was the only policeman who was working that night," he says. Robertson, a Democrat, is just starting in on the Republican D.A.'s staff when the left fielder misjudges a pop fly. "There are people in the district attorney's who don't know that he-e-e-e-e-e-e-e. . . . "
Robertson loses his train of thought as he watches the outfielder shift gears and run in toward the ball. He never finishes the sentence, and for the few seconds that the pop-up hangs in the haze, it's almost as if he is able to forget all about the tumultuous turn his life has taken since May.
York, Pa., nearer to Baltimore than to Philadelphia, is a living anachronism, a manufacturing city of 41,000 that has held on to its jobs, in part because of the local Harley Davidson motorcycle plant. It has also held on to a relatively peaceful racial balance, aided perhaps by a kind of willful amnesia about those summer days in 1969. That began to change two years ago when York's two daily newspapers published a series of articles looking back at the riots of 30 years before. Among the questions raised by the papers was why no one had ever been charged in the riots' two killings (of Lillie Belle Allen and of Henry Schaad, a rookie police officer). The articles caught the attention of York County's 35-year-old deputy prosecutor, Tom Kelley, who had his staff unearth the files related to the riots and then began reinterviewing witnesses.
Among those he was most eager to talk to were members of a gang involved in Allen's murder, local toughs known as the Newberry Street Boys. But prosecutors soon learned that three of them had committed suicide over the years and that another, Mark Barr, was suffering from terminal cancer. Barr wanted to talk, though, and before he died he told investigators what he knew about the night Allen was killed. And there was more. Last April, a detective visited the rural home of Donald Altland, 51, another ex-member of the gang. Altland was a model citizen, a worker at the city sewer plant, a churchgoer, happily married with two grown daughters. But his guilt was evident when he was shown photographs of Allen's corpse. He admitted little to the detectives, but stayed up all night telling his wife how he had fired at the woman and her family. Then he drove his pickup to a fishing hole along the Susquehanna River and shot himself in the head. He left a taped confession for the prosecutors and a message scrawled on a napkin, "Forgive Me, God."
It was not long before a state trooper and a detective from the D.A.'s office called Robertson's office to request an appointment. He had not been expecting them. He had spoken to the papers for their stories on the riots, but never once, he says, considered himself in any kind of danger. Then in May of this year, as the investigation heated up, the ex-cop was taken from his office in handcuffs. At a preliminary hearing in June, Rick Knouse, a former member of a rival gang, testified that Robertson had played a key role in inciting the violence that led directly to Allen's death. (Knouse, who admitted to being one of the gunmen, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of criminal conspiracy.) It is impossible to know just how much the events of 1969 figured in the lives of the Newberry Street Boys, how many of the four suicides can be linked at all to Allen's murder. There are five surviving rioters who are now facing trial for murder along with Robertson, and among them, there are no happy stories
Robertson, it seems, came up with his own rudimentary coping mechanism. "It was about three months after the riots were over that I went to a doctor and said I was just worried about what could have happened to me -- and it could have happened to me many a time, that I could have got killed doing the things I was doing," he told me. "So he gave me a couple of nerve pills, and he gave me some medicine, and told me, 'Get it out of your mind.' I guess for 30 years I never even thought of it."
For Robertson, the intervening years have been placid. He still lives in the same place, a modest gray-shingled three-story row house at 828 Princess Street, where he was born in 1934. His home phone number, still listed in the book despite his recent notoriety, has been the same for about 50 years. When he was released on $50,000 bail, the mayor had no passport to surrender. The maelstrom of the 1960's that has now engulfed him seems to have had little impact on him when he was actually living through it; only a recent conversation over the back fence with his pony-tailed, tattoo-covered next-door neighbor reminded him that Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed the year before York's riots.
That afternoon before the ballgame in Mt. Wolf, I watched him patch his walkway, mixing concrete in a small white tub. "You know what this is?" he asked. "This is my baby bathtub. This is what I had baths in when I was a baby -- and I still use it."
When Robertson became mayor, he fulfilled his only ambition. To see him now at City Hall is to witness an old-time mayor from central casting: the conservative and slightly baggy gray suits, the tie clasp, a white-rose emblem (York is "the White Rose City") stitched to his lapel, the saggy jowls, the wire-rimmed glasses, whitish hair neatly combed back. He loves the quotidian rituals of his job, handing out $25 gift certificates to city employees or showing up at two-alarm fires. He used to tool around the city in an oversize white Crown Victoria, until he decided this summer it might remind people of "white power." He thrived in an era when the best urban leaders, like Ed Rendell in Philadelphia or William Schaefer in Baltimore, were civic cheerleaders.
When he was arrested in May, reporters sought to gain his attention, shouting: "Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!" Robertson turned to them and said: "Thank you. I am still the mayor of the City of York."
Robertson's intense pride in his job reflects the long, improbable haul he took to get there. The youngest of six brothers, he was born at the tail end of the Great Depression. Every summer, the Robertson boys caddied at the local golf course and tossed all of their earnings in a kitty that paid for coal in the winter. His father, Milford (Hap) Robertson, was a school janitor who died from a heart attack on the day his retirement notice came in the mail.
Robertson was an average student, and when he graduated from William Penn Senior High School in 1952, he says there was no money for him to go college. He may not have been college material anyway. He drifted for the next decade, spending two years as an Army medic and then getting laid off from the local defense plant. Finally, he landed a job with the York Police Department in 1962.
His career as a police officer was anything but exemplary. He spent 29 years on the force, promoted only twice, and the second promotion was short-lived. He lasted just two months as a sergeant, a stint that was, by all accounts, a disaster. Some fellow officers later said that Robertson lacked management skills, but the mayor insists he simply couldn't hack the overnight shift. "I was drinking too much coffee and couldn't sleep in the morning," he says. "And when I came home, I was throwing up all the time." In his living room, he still keeps two pictures of himself in his sergeant's uniform.
His police career was marred by other strange behavior. He was suspended twice, once for not using good judgment in cases involving minors and another time for slapping a black woman he was bringing into custody.
Despite his long police career, Robertson never had many friends on the force, preferring to spend his time around kids. He usually ate lunch, in uniform, at the cafeteria of York's middle school. "Kids never had an opportunity, when they were young, to talk to a policeman," he says. It was in the cafeteria that he met Alex Chhum, a 14-year-old Cambodian refugee who had been having family problems. Chhum ended up moving into Robertson's home. For several years, the two were often together at wrestling matches and other sporting events, and eventually Robertson became his legal guardian. Chhum is now 31, married with two kids and a stepchild, and since Robertson became mayor, he has worked in the city finance department. Chhum has dinner with the mayor every Wednesday and occasionally helps him with chores around the house.
For years, Robertson sponsored his own basketball teams in the York City Recreation League, "Robbie's Rockets" and "Robbie's Raiders," and coached American Legion baseball. Parents trusted Robertson with their children, and these relationships formed the basis of his political career. He was elected to the school board in 1975, and people who hadn't voted for years lined up on his behalf when he decided to run for mayor in 1993.
As a politician, Robertson was raw and untested. He did not even have the support of his own colleagues. "By the end of his long tenure in the Police Department, he was very isolated," concedes his political adviser and close friend, Charles Bacas, explaining that the younger officers with college degrees saw him as a crusty veteran "who did things the old way." But he made his average-guy-ness the cornerstone of his campaign. The slogan he liked to use in later races was "He's one of us." It carried the echo of his now notorious shout after the Lillie Belle Allen shooting: "It's me, Charlie." No one had to shout back, "Charlie Who?" Robertson admits that he was a racist as a young police officer. He blames something that happened back in 1949, when he was 15. His father was walking home from work with his janitor's pay ($18) when three young black men robbed him on the West College Street Bridge and beat him up. The family was traumatized. "My dad came home so bruised, everybody wanted to take up arms and go over there," Robertson's older brother, Bud, remembers.
When he joined the police, Robertson's antipathy toward black people did not make him stand out. York's mayor at the time, John Snyder, openly referred to blacks as "darkies" in a newspaper interview, and the leader of the local Ku Klux Klan chapter was an auxiliary cop. In the late 1960's, while Robertson was coaching hoops and making friends with the white teenagers over on Newberry Street, black kids knew to steer clear of the young beat cop. "He would tell us to keep walking, and I kept walking -- I didn't want to get into trouble," recalls Loretta Claiborne, a mildly retarded black woman who grew up to become a Special Olympic champion distance runner.
On July 17, 1969, York's racial tensions were already at the boiling point when a black youth who burned himself playing with lighter fluid blamed a local white gang known as the Girarders. That would be revealed as a lie, but not before the pent-up resentments of the black community turned violent. The next night, a bullet believed to have been fired by a black rioter killed Henry Schaad, a white rookie cop. He was struck on the West College Street Bridge, the same spot where Robertson's dad had been mugged. White gangs around the city prepared for revenge.
This was the situation Lillie Belle Allen stumbled into. She wasn't even from York. She and her parents -- a minister and his wife -- were up from Aiken, S.C., visiting her sister Dickson. They hadn't heard much about the riots and were on their way to the grocery store when they found themselves in the midst of an armed white gang at the corner of Gay and Newberry. When Dickson's Cadillac hit a dip near the railroad tracks, her headlights caught a second-story sniper, and she screamed, "Oh, Lord, they're getting ready to shoot." Panic-stricken, she stopped on the tracks. Allen was trying to get out and get into the driver's seat when she was cut down by gunfire. "It was just like that scene at the end of the movie 'Bonnie and Clyde,"' says Rick Knouse, who watched dozens of bullets blow out the car window and riddle the trunk and tires.
No one disputes that Robertson showed up, but witnesses disagree on just about everything else he did. The mayor insists that he saved lives by telling the shooters to hold their fire, but others -- including a fellow cop and a respected Y.M.C.A. youth counselor -- say that they saw Robertson casually chatting with Knouse and other armed men.
The questions linger. Why didn't Robertson or any of the other officers who responded arrest the youths who had just shot and killed an unarmed black woman? Why, for that matter, was no one arrested and charged with shooting the police officer, Schaad? What happened on the streets of York was viewed by everyone involved, including the police, as acts of warfare, not as violations of the law. Any arrests or trials might have disturbed the fragile peace that York embraced after the killing was over. Robertson himself explained it with brutal candor after his arrest in May. "Everyone knew who was involved," he said. "But everyone just thought it was even. One black had been killed and one white. Even."
The prosecutors soon learned that in its eagerness to move past the riots, York had given its future mayor a free pass. One of the Newberry Street Boys, Fred Flickinger, told a federal judge in a civil lawsuit back in 1969 that Robertson showed up at a white youth rally in Farquhar Park the day before Allen was killed, told the gang members to protect their neighborhoods and then led a "white power" chant. Flickinger's testimony was reported in the York papers at the time but then forgotten, and Flickinger, scorned by his former buddies, moved to Texas. But the investigators now learned that some witnesses had even more to say about the cop-turned-mayor. It was from Knouse that the story emerged about Robertson's tossing bullets to the kids hours before the shooting and urging them "to kill as many niggers as you can," an account that Robertson denies. But a former cop who was present that day also told the grand jury that Robertson passed out bullets. Said Knouse, "It felt like we had a license to kill."
Robertson's trial lawyer, William Costopolous, admits that his client "said some dumb things -- but that was 32 years ago and in the middle of riots. It's not murder." Knouse, his strongest accuser, went on a drinking binge right after Allen was killed and blacked out -- and he has battled drug addiction and depression for most of his adult life. (He is currently in jail for violating his bail agreement.) The defense has already produced witnesses who say that Robertson borrowed a neighbor's rifle and ammunition during the riots, but they were not the .30-06 bullets that Knouse says he handed out. What is more, Allen was killed by a different type of slug, not by .30-06.
Robertson was up for re-election this year and had just won his party's primary two days before he was arrested. Another term seemed likely, and if Robertson had his way, he would still be in the running. But shortly after his arrest, his two closest political supporters, Charlie Bacas and Eric Menzer, his economic development aide, came to Princess Street with a withdrawal letter. Robertson didn't want to sign, and they badgered him for 90 minutes.
"They said it was for the betterment of York, that you've got to get out," the mayor says. "I didn't even know what they were talking about. I was hurt -- these were my two best friends and my two best campaign people." Today, he keeps a copy of the letter on the easel next to his desk at City Hall, and he sounds almost befuddled as he leans back in his chair. "I'm still trying to figure out what happened. I don't get too much support from my campaign people anymore."
Toward the end of my first meeting with Robertson, I casually ask him about religion. "I'm not overboard, but I'm very religious," he says. "And I believe in prayer." Suddenly, his cheeks turn flush red, and he bolts upright in his chair. He begins to sob. "I've never got so many cards, people calling from all over the United States, praying for me. This is no little thing." Is he afraid of going to jail? "I was afraid of getting the handcuffs put on. It was a very bad thing. It was embarrassing."
Later, when I was standing with Robertson outside his house, Juan Flecha, a 21-year-old Puerto Rican neighbor, drove up in a black Camaro, stereo blasting. He looked, in every way, like the sort of brash, swaggering kid that might intimidate older people. But he greeted the mayor warmly and invited him to come out to a ballgame. Flecha, it turns out, was once a promising player, one of the many kids Robertson had been a mentor to. When Flecha's father was involved in a violent feud with another man, Robertson walked the kid to school and otherwise looked out for him. Later, he even lined up a couple of pro tryouts for Flecha. So all the controversy swirling around the mayor didn't seem to make much of a difference to Flecha. "It's like, I mean, we're not friends -- we're family," Flecha said. "It's like my dad right there."
Even with neighbors like Flecha, though, York is suddenly not the comfortable place it has always been for Robertson. When he leaves office in January, he says, he intends to move away, to a place in the mountains maybe -- assuming he has the freedom to choose where he goes. As the trial looms, he has a harder and harder time putting it all out of his mind, as he had done so easily for 30 years. Occasionally, kids who see him on the street at a distance shout, "Murderer!" When I ask him how that feels, he replies, in an almost smug tone, "I know I'm not."

HEADLINE: What Beijing Can Learn From Moscow 

BYLINE:  By Ian Buruma; Ian Buruma is the author of "Bad Elements: Chinese Rebels From Los Angeles to Beijing," to be published in November by Random House.

 BODY:
Just how much the world has changed, at least on the surface, becomes clear to me somewhere above Irkutsk, on board an Air China flight from Beijing to Moscow. My fellow passengers are mostly Chinese with a scattering of Russians. The in-flight entertainment consists of contemporary Chinese soap operas and old movies about revolutionary heroes battling various fascist enemies. But above Irkutsk we are provided with a History Channel documentary about the superiority of United States Navy destroyers. Phrases like "fighting for freedom" and "the American spirit" come gushing through our headphones as Navy helicopters release torpedoes and the guns of freedom boom. I look around to gauge Russian and Chinese reactions. Most people are fast asleep. 
 The reason for flying this route is to test a hypothesis, or rather, a commonly received opinion, which is that the Chinese are managing their transition from Communism to capitalism better than the Russians. Russia is a mess, its economy wrecked in the Yeltsin years by ideology-driven shock treatment and grasping oligarchs, its daily life made a misery by widespread corruption and criminal rackets. China, on the other hand, is believed to have learned its lesson from the Russian experience. Mikhail Gorbachev's "failure" serves as a warning to the Chinese leaders against political reforms that would diminish the party's grip on power. Bolstered by enormous amounts of overseas Chinese investment, they have concentrated on economic reforms instead. Almost nobody in China, including most party cadres, actually believes in Communism. But an authoritarian one-party state fits the Chinese tradition, and most Chinese prefer it to the potential disorder of hasty democratization. 
 This is the story I heard over and over from foreign businessmen and diplomats. China's president, Jiang Zemin, echoed their views in a recent interview. "Should China apply the parliamentary democracy of the Western world, the only result will be that 1.2 billion Chinese people will not have enough food to eat," he said. "The result will be great chaos." 
Of course, China with its huge rural population is not like Russia, which is more urban, highly educated, rich in natural resources and close to Europe. And while China's economy is far more vibrant than Russia's, a mixture of insolvent banks, ravaged natural resources, bankrupt state firms, widespread unemployment and official corruption is storing up vast problems. The question is whether the Chinese experiment with party-controlled, authoritarian capitalism is likely in the long run to be more stable than Russia's stumbling democracy. 
Beijing no longer looks like a city under communist rule. You are greeted on arrival at the superb new international airport by pictures of traditional Chinese attractions -- the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and Chinese dancers. There are no references to Communism in sight, and almost no slogans about class struggle or proletarian dictatorship. "Leadership of the party" is promoted, but in the sense that following the party is a patriotic more than a revolutionary duty. Now, even capitalist entrepreneurs are welcome to join the party.
The vast expanse of Tiananmen Square, with Mao's portrait on one side and Mao's mausoleum on the other, still looks menacing and bears the stamp of state authority. But it seems anachronistic in a city increasingly dominated by shopping malls, discotheques, international hotels, big banks and franchises of McDonald's and Starbucks. And there is a palpable nervousness that is a far cry from revolutionary celebration. Worshipers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement are arrested here as soon as they raise their arms in ritual exercise. Police are watching from every corner, in uniform and plainclothes. 
It so happens that this year of Beijing's successful Olympic bid coincides with the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The People's Daily, the official party newspaper, announced all manner of celebrations, but again patriotism set the tone: operas "expressing the Chinese people's spirit of longing for the unification of the Chinese motherland" and the like. I decide to go and see an exhibition at the new Millennium Monument of 80 years of party history. 
Groups of people, many of them in military uniform, are lining up to get in. They look bored, as if this is a duty to be endured, which, for most of them, it is. I am stopped at the door. No individual tickets are available. But I am interested in history, I say. I would like to get in. Go and talk to the official in charge, I am told. The official, a puffed-up figure in a blue suit, is suspicious. Who am I? Which organization do I belong to? Why am I so interested in Communist Party history? The idea that anyone should want to look at the exhibit seems baffling to him. Finally, after some telephone calls to a superior official, I am allowed in, accompanied by a smiling young guide and a photographer, who takes a picture every time I point at something.
The exhibition has a peculiar contemporary bias. Party history begins with Mao Zedong, his humble origins, his struggle to "liberate" China and his triumph in 1949. But then history takes a major jump. There are some photographs of industrial enterprises in the 1950's, and there is a model of the first Chinese car. But there are no references to the Great Leap Forward of the late 1950's, when more than 30 million people died of famine, or to the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's or indeed to any other political purge or man-made convulsion.
The focus, instead, is entirely on Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in the 1980's and on trade and technology in the 1990's. What is being celebrated here is not Communism but technocracy. One-party rule is justified, not by political dogma, but by economic efficiency and progress, precisely what many Western businessmen admire about China and often compare favorably with the Russian mess. 
The combination of political dictatorship and a more or less capitalist economy looks attractive to foreign investors. What could be better, after all? No unions to cause trouble, and there are none of those messy elections that make democratic systems so unpredictable. This combination is not unique to the People's Republic of China, of course. The model is Gen. Augusto Pinochet's Chile. 
It would be difficult for a Communist Party to openly cite Pinochet as an example to follow, but in private, I am told, he is much admired by people in the so-called mainstream of the party. The debate in Chinese government circles is not between political liberals and autocrats, but between those who favor the Pinochet model and "leftists" who, not unreasonably, see capitalism as a betrayal of socialist ideals. The current leadership would seem to be in the Pinochet camp.
It is possible to meet liberals in China who see things differently and argue for democratic reforms, but they are marginalized. This does not necessarily involve jail sentences anymore, or physical violence. Such methods are reserved for those who are brave or foolish enough to engage in organized opposition. Today, dissident thinkers are silenced in public by stopping them from teaching or publishing their thoughts.
One such person is Qin Hui, professor of economic history at Qinghai University in Beijing, a man of great learning and liberal views; he is no longer allowed to teach. Another is Liu Xiaobo, a famous literary critic, who spent years in prisons and labor camps for supporting the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and for promoting civil liberties. His writings are banned. A famous economic journalist, He Qinglian, wrote a best-selling book in 1998, "China's Pitfalls," about the dangers of capitalism without political freedoms. Since then she has been silenced and was forced into exile earlier this year. 
Apologists for China's one-party rule dismiss such dissident intellectuals as irrelevant or, worse, as threats to stability. Indeed, China, for all the outward modernity of Beijing, may not be nearly as stable as it looks, and there is good reason to believe that the one-party system is itself the main source of instability. 
For one thing, official corruption is endemic to the system. Without opposition, party cadres can do more or less what they like in the semicapitalist casino of contemporary China. State officials buy natural resources at fixed government prices and sell them for huge profits on the private market. Or they "privatize" state industries by dismissing workers without pay and picking the enterprises clean of their assets. Anyone who dares to protest can be swiftly arrested. The result is a mafia economy, described in He Qinglian's book, where the difference between political bosses and criminal dons is hard to detect. 
Corruption is perhaps inevitable in any transition to capitalism. Russia, obviously, is riddled with it. But systemic corruption unchecked by any political representation has already caused rebellions in China. It is what started the Tiananmen demonstrations in 1989, and why farmers and workers protest, sometimes violently, whenever they have a chance. The government knows this and launches periodic campaigns against corrupt officials. But since the main players in the mafia economy are party bosses and their dependents, such campaigns are little more than purges aimed at political rivals. They do little to enhance the cause of stable government or the rule of law; indeed, the lack of institutional checks on government power only makes things worse.
It is often claimed that economic freedoms create a middle class, which produces a "civil society," which in the long term will lead to democracy. This claim is made about China too, hence the common view that the Chinese government is right to concentrate on economic reforms first. The rise of a new middle class is plainly visible in Beijing, if crowded restaurants and discotheques are the yardstick. But every attempt to produce anything resembling a civil society is quashed -- independent labor unions, political parties, student unions, religious communities. Indeed, any organization outside party control is forbidden. 
Liu Xiaobo, the literary critic, has consistently spoken up for human rights, freedom of speech, democracy and most daringly of all, self-determination for Tibet. He did so, not only in private conversations, but also publicly, on Tiananmen Square in 1989, and later in petitions to the government. He was released from prison in 1999. 
I meet him in the coffee shop of a shabby hotel near his apartment, not far from the Millennium Monument. Like Qin Hui, Liu thinks the Russians are in many ways better off than the Chinese, not materially perhaps, but at least "they live in a democracy and can speak freely." The problem in China, he says, is not that people don't have enough to eat. The problem is that "any kind of popular initiative, not under government control, is made impossible. Workers and farmers cannot have organized representation. And as soon as a magazine or newspaper publishes something the government doesn't like, the editors are fired or the publication is shut down. What is the point of having opinions in private if they can't be made public?"
Liu Xiaobo is disgusted by the effect centuries of political authoritarianism has had on his people. As with so many Chinese intellectuals in the last hundred years or so, his political criticism has curdled into a sense of cultural despair. His recent writings are full of attacks on the Chinese character, the cowardice of Chinese intellectuals, the crass materialism of the common people. "The frightening thing about China," he says, "is that almost everyone says one thing in private and the opposite in public." Why frightening? "Because of the psychological damage," he says. "It corrupts society. It offends human dignity." 
Liu is right, but cultural despair is not the solution to China's political problems; it is a symptom of them. A one-party dictatorship cannot peacefully resolve the conflicts of interest that exist in any society, especially one as large and complex as China. First, the Chinese Communist Party reduced the problem to a crude and brutal class struggle. Then, when people were sick of Maoism, they were lulled by the promise of universal prosperity, guaranteed by a technocratic elite. Since that dream cannot come true for many, if not most people, they are now subjected to aggressive nationalist propaganda. The objective, it seems, is to disguise conflicting domestic interests with constant national campaigns to make China great, to stand up to American imperialism, to get the Olympics to Beijing, to win more gold medals and so on.
Campaigns and exhortations are a traditional form of social control in east Asia, and it is possible that the fear of chaos will prop up the one-party state for some time. But the fundamental problems of official corruption and conflicting interests remain unsolved. When all peaceful channels of opposition are cut off, violence is all that remains. 
This may not yet be visible in Beijing. But violent rebellion, especially in the countryside, where trouble is brewing once again, has been a feature of Chinese history for thousands of years. Economic technocracy cannot by itself lend legitimacy to the government. Once the people revolt, in an economic crisis, when millions could lose their livelihoods, there will be no way to contain them. Mikhail Gorbachev made many mistakes, but the least one can say about his political reforms is that they ended authoritarian rule with a minimum of bloodshed. China has yet to face that test.
As soon as I arrive in Moscow, I call Tatyana Tolstaya, the novelist and political essayist. I tell her that I have been to Budapest, Prague and Warsaw, but never to the heart of the old Soviet empire. She says: "Ah, those are European cities. This is Asia." When I ask another Russian about the lack of Internet cafes in Moscow, I am told the same thing: "This is Asia." But there are many Internet cafes in Asia, I say. "Not in our Asia" is the reply. 
"Asia" is not always a positive term. It is sometimes used as a proud badge of anti-Western defiance, to be sure, but here it means backward, inefficient, sluggish, corrupt; the non-European face of Russia. It is a form of national self-denigration, an expression, perhaps, of what a Russian sociologist has called the "experience of failure," the idea that Russia is always lagging behind the West. When Mikhail Gorbachev embarked on his political reforms in the 1980's, he was trying to save socialism, but he was also playing to a Western gallery. Like other liberal reformers before him, he wanted Russia to join the West. He basked in his Western popularity, even as many Russians blamed him for yet another experience of failure: the collapse of the Soviet Empire. 
Chinese are touchy about perceived Western superiority, too. But their nationalism is not based so much on a complex of peripheral inferiority as on a sense of humiliation, because the Middle Kingdom's weakness was exposed by 19th-century Western imperialism. Chinese nationalism has a pumped-up, grandiose quality, visible in Beijing's monumental new buildings, great national showcases of granite and glass often topped, rather absurdly, with mock Chinese roofs. Moscow has few monumental new buildings, but many old ones are being restored in an effort to reconnect with a more gracious, more European pre-Communist past. And unlike in Beijing, where Chairman Mao's destruction of the past has been almost completed by helter-skelter modernization, there is much visible history left in Moscow. 
Olga Aleksakova, a Russian architect working in Rotterdam, tells me the restoration of pre-Communist Moscow buildings is an attempt to continue cultural trends that Stalinism cut short. Hence the love affair, not only with 18th- and 19th-century architecture, which influenced Stalinist building too, but with Art Nouveau and Art Deco. Much postmodern building in Moscow is in a quasi-Deco or Nouveau style. 
We have dinner at her parents' place in a scruffy gray apartment block near the center of Moscow. Olga's father, Aleksandr Aleksakov, a designer of nuclear power stations, shows me how he copes with the inconveniences of Russian life: a home-made boiler in the bathroom provides hot water when only cold water is available, which happens every summer for several weeks. There are photographs in the hall of recent holidays in Spain.
Olga's mother, Tatyana Goloubkina, is in the insurance business, but her passion is French literature. She talks about her first trip to the West, in 1989, when she was 36. The memory of crossing at night from the darkness of East Berlin into the bright lights of the West still brings tears to her eyes. As we savor the meal of red caviar and delicious cold meats, washed down with vodka, Aleksandr remarks that life in Russia has changed so fast that young people cannot even imagine what it was like under Communism. "We forget what it was like," he says. "I never forget," says his wife. Her worst nightmare is that the borders of Russia will be closed once again. 
The relative prosperity of Moscow -- the abundance of excellent restaurants, the lively cafes, the well-stocked stores -- is of course misleading. Just as Beijing is richer than most places in China, the rest of Russia is a long way from catching up with Moscow. And the problems of Russia's struggling democracy are not always as visible as Moscow's shopping arcades. As long as the brutal war in Chechnya continues, Russians can hardly fault the Chinese on human rights, and President Putin's attempts to curb the independent press are too close for comfort to Chinese methods. 
But the main problem for Muscovites is lawlessness. One aspect of this is highly visible. Several times in one week I witnessed the same procedure. A traffic policeman pulls a car over, orders the driver to hand over his papers and charges him with a spurious traffic offense -- a corner taken too fast, a white line crossed, whatever. The driver plucks a bill from his wallet, hands it to the cop and that, usually, is the end of the affair. But if the cop is greedy, or just in a bad mood, he might accuse his victim of being a drug dealer and exact a far heavier price.
Tolstaya tells me a few things about life in Moscow. We are sitting in a little park under a statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, Lenin's secret police chief and founder of the Gulag, which for years stood guard in front of the K.G.B. headquarters in Moscow. "Nobody gets paid enough," she says, "so everyone must make money on the side through bribes or payoffs of one kind or another. People create their own rules, which actually make more sense than those that the government tries to impose."
The Communist government was also corrupt, of course, as it is in China. That is one reason Gorbachev started his reforms. What has happened since the collapse of the Soviet system is that one mafia, that is, the party itself, has been replaced by many competing mafias. I ask Tolstaya whether this has made life any easier. "Everything is easier," she says. "With one gang in charge, all initiatives were stifled. People were always depressed. Life was terrible. It is incomparably better now."
I ask Yegor Gaidar the same question. The moon-faced Gaidar, as Boris Yeltsin's former deputy prime minister and finance minister, was responsible for price liberalization and other economic reforms that caused widespread misery in the 1990's. He decided then that shock therapy was the only way to "drag the patient off his bed." Alas, in the process, the patient was stripped of most of his assets. Gaidar, who now runs a liberal policy center, is still a deeply unpopular man. He smacks his red lips in thought and says: "At least in Russia corruption is out in the open. Politicians accuse each other of all kinds of dirty stuff. Many accusations are false. But at least it is openly discussed. This helps us understand the problem and, hopefully, to deal with it."
When Yegor Gaidar was still a young economist in the early 1980's, discussing neoclassical economic theory in clandestine meetings with other dissidents ("market economy" was still a forbidden phrase), the idea that Russia would become a democracy was still a fantasy. Back then Russian reformists still looked to China as a possible model. Chinese economic policies under Deng Xiaoping were in fact more liberal than Russia's, especially in agriculture. But when Gorbachev took everybody, including the young dissidents, by surprise and called for political reforms, China ceased to be an example for liberal reformists. 
The only ones who still see China as a positive model are old Communists and the kind of people (some of whom are allies of President Putin) who like the idea of Pinochet's Chile. It is a curious phenomenon that the one thing authoritarian Russian thinkers and Chinese Communists have in common is admiration for General Pinochet. "Yes," says Yegor Gaidar, "that is still a trend. We are a young democracy. The first one in Russian history. There is a consensus about the market economy, but not yet about democracy." What would strengthen the support for democracy? Mr. Gaidar looks at me, smiles a little wistfully and says, "Life."
Sergei Tikhvinsky, honorary chairman of the Sino-Russian Friendship Association, former K.G.B. station chief in London and a diplomat in China in the 1950's, when Russia was still China's official "big brother," is the kind of man who thinks the Chinese got it right and the Russians got it wrong. I drink Chinese tea with him at his large Moscow apartment, filled with Chinese knickknacks, not all of the highest quality.
His favorite word is "efficient." Gorbachev's political reforms were "not efficient." He agrees that reforms were necessary in the 1980's, since the party had become corrupt and the Politburo was "inefficient," but keeping government control in party hands is the "efficient" way to move from Communism to a market economy. That is why the Chinese have done better. Hearing Tikhvinsky talk, I realize how close technocracy is to the K.G.B. mind. He is not a Communist ideologue, just an authoritarian who thinks that strong state control is essential for solving human problems. 
Like most Western sinologues, Tikhvinsky analyzes Chinese politics mainly in cultural terms. He admires Deng Xiaoping, because he "restored contact between Confucianism and Marxism." Classical Marxism, he says, is out of date. "You have to adjust. This is the Chinese tradition. It is very efficient." But admiration does not all go one way. "There is growing interest in China in President Putin's policies, in a positive sense."
What do the Chinese regard as most positive about President Putin? "His efforts to strengthen central control of the regions and stop separatism, that is the main thing. And the Chinese still buy many Russian armaments. That, too, is important." Not freedom of the press? I ask, a little facetiously. Tikhvinsky sputters into his china teacup in disgust. "I'm very critical of the mass media," he says. "There is nothing positive about them. The Chinese know how to restrict all the negative influences . . . crime, pornography, sex. In our country they are not yet restricted."
An old K.G.B. man like Tikhvinsky is perhaps no more representative of Russian opinion than a convinced liberal like Gaidar. But then it is hard to tell who or what is representative in Russia, or any other society, for that matter. That is why in a free society people vote and argue in public through the mass media. Most Russians may not believe in democracy in the way Gaidar does, but according to opinion polls they do wish to hang on to their new freedoms.
In this sense, President Putin's confused politics might well be representative of public opinion. Many people share his distrust of the press, his wish to end the institutional chaos of the Yeltsin years by strengthening the state, but also his desire to maintain a multiparty system. Russia could end up going back to an authoritarian regime, but that has not happened yet. And as for the Pinochet model, Gaidar put it well back in 1991: people who believe that Russia can follow the example of Chile don't know the difference between the chaotic, ill-disciplined and economically illiterate Soviet Army and the sophisticated Chilean military elite. 
Faith, in any case, is not a fundamental factor in democratic government. But it is vital in a one-party state. Since people cannot vote, they are required to express faith. What other justification can one leader or one party have to monopolize government power? And faith in the old party dogmas is just what is lacking in China today. Unless one believes that Chinese are naturally obedient to authority, this makes the Chinese system brittle. Moscow might be less efficient than Beijing. The Russian economy is still a disaster in many ways. But efficiency isn't everything. At the beginning of the 20th century, Germany was efficient, proud of its industrial prowess, less than democratic and wallowing in resentful nationalism. And we all know what happened there.
Before leaving Moscow, I call up an old China hand by the name of Vladimir Skossyrev. He is now a journalist for Vremya MN, but he was a student in China in the late 1950's. In 1992, he was back there as a reporter for Izvestia. It was an unsettling experience, he says. He felt envious, worried and strangely alienated. These feelings were especially strong when he attended the 1992 Chinese Communist Party Congress. By that time Russians had abandoned all the Communist symbols of the past. Gaidar had started his free-market reforms, the statue of Dzerzhinsky was gone from in front of the Lubyanka, the Communist coup had failed. And there, in Beijing, Skossyrev saw it all again: men in suits singing the Internationale, holding forth in the old "wooden language," mouthing the same slogans, "just as in Russia before." It was all too reminiscent of the Brezhnev era, when the Soviet Union had stagnated in a decadent torpor. He was deeply shaken. 
I ask him why he was envious. "Because the Chinese had carried out economic reforms more efficiently." And why worried? Well, he says, "we were warmly received, but everything was stage-managed. Every Chinese played his role. What worries me is that Chinese always obey orders. They never object. Every morning they are told what to do by their bosses. Now, relations with Russia are good. But there are still problems with the Sino-Russian borders. What if times change, and they want to reclaim Russian territory?"
There is a hint here of ancient Russian fears of Genghis Khan and the yellow hordes. A war with Russia is in fact unlikely. But Skossyrev is plainly wrong in his assertion that Chinese are always obedient. They are not. They can also be rebellious and anarchic. The Russians, like the people of India, at least have the institutions, however fragile and flawed, to give voice to their discontents. Russian democracy is far from perfect, and it could still come to grief. But so far it has proved more resilient than many people expected. In China, there is no institutional way for people to protest, and that is why China could easily explode one day, even as the poor, inefficient Russians stumble on.

Attendance Is Lagging At 'Destination' Parks

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
AMUSEMENT parks, like many of their stomach-churning rides, have had ups and downs this year, but none more so than "destination" parks, which attract visitors from other states and abroad.
 Besides a weakened United States economy, gasoline prices that remained at or near record highs well into summer also hurt these parks. And the strong dollar kept many international visitors away. Adding to these woes were cool weather early this summer and blistering heat across much of the nation last month. 
 "Traditionally weather is the No. 1 factor in park attendance," said Susie Storey, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. Soon after the heat wave subsided, she said, there were days of heavy rain.
Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for AAA, said that this hasn't been a robust year for theme parks, although the downturn follows a succession of record years for most of the travel industry. That has been true of the nation's approximately 450 amusement parks. From 1990 through 2000, they had record revenues each year and record attendance in nine years. Although the amusement parks association recently lowered its prediction of a 5 percent attendance increase this year, it still forecasts a 2 to 3 percent rise.
Many of the theme parks were hurting through June of this year, the most recent period for which the publicly traded parks reported their financial results. (They usually do not furnish attendance figures.) 
Cedar Fair -- which owns six amusement parks and five water parks, including Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio -- blamed much of its 4.5 percent drop in revenues for the quarter ending June 24 on a 5 percent fall in combined attendance over that period.
In the three months that ended June 30, revenues at the Disney theme parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., were flat, largely because of falling attendance. Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimated that the falloff at Disney parks through the first half of this summer was as much as 8 percent in Florida and 6 percent in California. Attendance at Universal Studios and other theme parks in those states also lagged.
Another indicator of slumping attendance is that hotel occupancy in or near those parks also fell, according to figures compiled by Smith Travel Research. Occupancy rates in Orlando this June dropped to 71.1 percent from 79.7 percent in June 2000.
A decline in attendance is also suggested by the 2.4 percent falloff in the number of airline passengers this June, compared with June a year ago. At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, near many California theme parks, passenger traffic in June was down even more, by 4.2 percent.
Those patterns reflect what Kathy Styponias, the senior entertainment analyst for Prudential Securities, described as "the dichotomy within the amusement park industry" -- that is, the vulnerability of "long distance" parks, most of whose visitors come from a radius of 150 miles or more. Visitors to regional or local parks, by contrast, usually make it a day trip.
Most of the 30 Six Flags parks in the United States -- including Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., and Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo, Calif. -- are regional parks. Bad weather early this summer kept attendance at the company's domestic parks to a 3.3 percent increase, but from July 1 to Aug. 5, attendance soared 9.4 percent over the same period last year.
Another possible deterrent is that the average theme park admission this year, according to a survey last month by Amusement Business magazine, is a record $40.23 -- $3.20 more than last year. Admission to regional and local parks is lower than at destination parks. At Cedar Point, for example, the price is $39 for adults and $15 for children, while at Schlitterbahn Waterpark Resort, in New Braunfels, Tex., about 30 miles from San Antonio, adults pay $26 and kids 3 to 11 $21.64.
A number of Southern California parks have been offering deep discounts, mostly to entice local residents. At Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim, adults who live in Southern California are admitted for the children's price of $33 instead of the usual $43, and children 3 to 9 are free. 
Strong attendance continues at many water parks, which cater mostly to local residents. "My 5-year-old granddaughter Kiersten and I have gone to Schlitterbahn just about every week," said Jill Blackburn of Wimberley, Tex., speaking of the water park less than an hour's drive away. "The admission price at amusement parks is too expensive and you have to wait in line too long for a ride."
The water park, she said, has one more advantage: "Here in Texas, if you have to choose between water and heat, you're a lot better off choosing water, no matter how crowded the park is."

Our Lies, Our Selves

BYLINE:  By John Leland; John Leland is a style reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
A couple of years ago, for professional reasons, I found myself in midair above the stomach of a man who worked for an insurance company. I stomped; the man lay motionless; I stomped again. I had enrolled in a professional wrestling school, to pursue an assignment, but also a personal obsession. At the time, wrestling was changing its focus, from the fake grappling in the ring to an intricate web of "story lines" that writers were fabricating around it, often filmed as behind-the-scenes revelations. These added a second or third layer of unreality commenting on the first. It was addicting and, in its play on the borders between truths and untruths, quite revealing. You can tell a lot about a culture by the lies it embraces. 
 The lies are piling up in interesting places these days. The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joseph J. Ellis recently admitted to having lied about serving in Vietnam; last month, Mount Holyoke College suspended him without pay for a year. The same week, a Los Angeles County judge named Patrick Couwenberg was dismissed for embellishing his record in the war. John Bayley, husband of the late Iris Murdoch, invented the title characters to his memoir "Widower's House: A Study in Bereavement. Or, How Margot and Mella Forced Me to Flee My Home," composing them from bits of real people and real sex. Even ad copy has found novel ways to dissemble. Sony Pictures invented a critic to produce bland blurbs for "The Animal" and "A Knight's Tale," fabrications not so much of essence as of source. The studio also admitted to planting shills in its man-on-the-street ads for "The Patriot." 
 We play, too, in large numbers, by inventing identities online, or accomplishing a similar sleight through older technologies. A recently noted fashion trend is to wear someone else's history on your T-shirt, bought off the rack. With a swipe of a credit card, you too can represent Lakeland Varsity Lacrosse, State Champs 1993.
Wrestling was simply ahead of its time: in an information economy, we are finding out, information is there not just to be bought and sold, but also to be made new and improved. The way to create a better product is to invent a better story behind it. 
As distortions go, these are not the lies of the Nixonian variety. They hew to the essential truths -- the widower's sexual reawakening, the course of Vietnam -- but twist the story behind the facts or the speaker behind the story. The ends can be financial or simply narcissistic. Inventing your credentials lets you be both subject and object, creator and created. Ellis, who wrote about Thomas Jefferson and John Adams without claiming to know them, can turn Vietnam into the Book of Joe, accessible to his students. And how nice that John Bayley can meet his semifictional characters and can watch them give him widower's love.
Two decades after English departments declared the death of the author, this hubbub of embellishment shows that the author is still very much alive, and often of as great interest as his or her text. We care whether the man who praised "The Animal" was a reviewer for The Ridgefield Press or a copywriter at Sony, or whether Ellis, in teaching his Mount Holyoke students about Vietnam, had been in the jungles. The persuasive wit of the Sony blurb, or the wisdom of Professor Ellis's lectures -- what we used to call the texts -- are just generic data on their own. Without a tweaked story enhancing their authorship, they lack brand appeal.
The story does not need to be flattering or to inspire trust. Bill Clinton, who built his brand on his gift for the artful dodge, just got a record $10 million advance for his memoirs, though you'd sooner expect a full reckoning from O.J. Simpson. David Brock, the formerly right-wing attack journalist, is flogging his new book, "Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative," by declaring that his first book, "The Real Anita Hill," was a pack of distortions. "I'm coming forward to tell the truth now," he told N.P.R., "and that truth is I lied." Apparently, a track record of bending the truth does not discredit these new histories; it simply adds interest.
And like other lies, it pays off. Studies show that teenagers who are better at telling lies are also more popular. Beyond that, the fabrications themselves have a kind of Darwinian staying power. Peter Frost, a researcher at Rivier College in Nashua, N.H., showed students slides of a "crime scene," then gave them a script describing the crime, but with a few key details twisted (a copy of Vogue became Glamour, a hammer became a wrench). Initially the students recognized the false descriptions as misinformation. But over time, as the memories of what they actually saw faded, the misinformation lingered or even became more vivid.
For the story creators of professional wrestling or the fictional characters in John Bayley's memoirs, this is good news. Their stories will endure; we'll remember the fake movie critic long after we've forgotten "The Animal." As for me, I've given up wrestling in favor of varsity lacrosse. Did you know I was a state champ? 

GRAPHIC: Photo (Fox Photos/Hulton/Archive) Chart: "EVEN THE ANIMALS DO IT""The ability to deceive confers a reproductive advantage to organisms that by virtue of being deceptive avoid being killed and live to a reproductive age. . . . The innate hostility of surroundings in which a large part of life is spent struggling not to become food or, conversely, is spent struggling to catch food that is reluctant to be eaten, makes deception a useful item in any organism's kit. The ability to deceive is one of the many abilities or characteristics that have made some animals better equipped to survive than others. It therefore falls into the same category as long necks in giraffes, keen eyesight in birds, fleet-footedness in cheetahs and gazelles, and the sharp tooth and claw nature is famously red in. The struggle for life has favored the better mimickers and bluffers. . . . Instinct does the job for the lower animals; intelligence does it for the higher ones." From "The Concise Book of Lying," by Evelin Sullivan

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Telling the Story of America With Masterworks

BYLINE:  By EDWARD M. GOMEZ; Edward M. Gomez is a United States corre- spondent for Raw Vision magazine.

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
AMERICANS like a good story especially about themselves. With "Picturing America," a complete reinstallation of its permanent collection of American art, the Newark Museum is now providing its own version of the national pageant from colonial times to the postmodern present. This freshly reconsidered survey of American art history is as inquisitive as it is revealing about its subject. It serves up some surprises, too.
 "From the start, we wanted to tell a story," said Joseph Jacobs, the curator of American art at the Newark Museum. "We attempted to see the art through the artists' eyes, to consider what their work meant for an emerging nation and, later, for a people examining its history and identity." 
 Since its founding in 1909, the Newark Museum has built up extensive holdings in painting and sculpture, folk art, textiles, Asian and African art, and other fields. It features a planetarium, a mini-zoo and the restored Ballantine House of 1885, the former residence of an affluent, ale-making family that has become a decorative-arts showcase.
Samuel C. Miller, the Newark's former director and current director emeritus, is credited with expanding the museum's holdings in many areas during his 25-year tenure, which ended in 1993. The last major installation of its American collection, which he oversaw nearly a decade ago, coincided with a renovation of its buildings and interiors by the Princeton-based architect Michael Graves. That presentation highlighted many of the Newark's signature treasures like "The Greek Slave" (1847), a marble statue by Hiram Powers and "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines" (1879), a tall, painted-wood figure attributed to Thomas J. White. Connoisseurship was evident in the curatorial vision that shaped that earlier installation.
"Picturing America" shows that its organizers have assimilated the critical methods and lessons of recent decades and applied them to a new showing of the museum's American works.
"We wanted to look at the work within the broader contexts of the social, economic and cultural forces that helped shape it," Mr. Jacobs said. To that end, he and collaborators like the consulting curator Holly Pyne Connor, a specialist in 19th-century American art, and the staff designer Stephen Hutchins created an exhibition that both directly and suggestively poses questions about the making and meanings of the roughly 350 works on view. Sometimes it supplies immediate answers.
Lucy Brotman, the museum's education director, whose department played an active role in the $1 million, four-year reinstallation project, said: "We tried to anticipate visitors' questions. Plus, we thought: 'What are the questions we would like them to ask?' "
Thus, in each themed gallery, one object on display is scrutinized in what the exhibition's creators call "A Closer Look." Small text cards question and briefly explain the style, history or significance of each selected item. Viewers learn, for example, that the studiously formal "Portrait of the Four Youngest Children of William Rankin Sr." (1838), painted by Oliver Tarbell Eddy, was an homage to the seated girl in a yellow dress who is seen in the picture. The youngster had died; new research undertaken on this and other works in "Picturing America" revealed that her drooping bouquet of flowers and faraway stare, among other visual clues in the image, referred to her death.
Guest scholars like Richard Powell, a specialist in African-American art from Duke University, contributed to the reinstallation project, for which numerous artworks were newly restored. Overall, labeling in the galleries emphasizes artists' biographies less and the art's subject matter more. "We found that people generally want to know what a work is about," Ms. Brotman said.
"Picturing America" unfolds chronologically. Each gallery on two floors of the museum bears a thematic title (for example, "The Young Republic" or "The Gilded Age: Materialism and Escapism, 1875-1900") that guides visitors along a journey through American art history. Succinct remarks printed on free-standing plaque-pedestals explain the subjects, production techniques, historical references and aesthetic concerns of the works on display.
Throughout the exhibition, paintings, drawings, sculptures and decorative-art objects are shown together in an integrated way. No single work seems isolated in the kind of deliberately "neutral" setting that a typical white-box museum or commercial gallery tries to affect. Instead, "Picturing America" offers rooms painted in authentic colors of the periods whose art they represent: a rich, grassy green in an early-American gallery and stagecoach red in another for works from the Gilded Age.
The red chamber is set up salon-style, with paintings above paintings in neat rows, as they would have been hung in a high-society townhouse. There, a visitor's eye drifts from Thomas Waterman Wood's emblematic portrait, from 1884, of the good burgher Daniel S. Lathrop and his wife amidst the trappings of their wealth, to an actual, Japanese-style vase of the same era. Produced at an Ohio pottery, it resembles a ceramic vessel that is visible in the picture's foreground.
ELSEWHERE, "Picturing America" evokes the look and ambience of Alfred Stieglitz's legendary 291, the gallery that the photographer founded in 1904 at 291 Fifth Avenue to show pioneering examples of modernist art. In this section, with walls half-covered in gray burlap, artists whom Stieglitz showed are represented, including John Marin, Marsden Hartley, Morgan Russell and Georgia O'Keeffe.
Arthur Garfield Dove's "Abstraction No. 3" (1910), a tiny oil painting of rotund, purplish-gray forms, is on view; one of the museum's recent acquisitions, it is typical of the unexpected examples of strong works by major artists in small, concentrated doses that turn up throughout the collection. Another is Edward Hopper's "Sheridan Theater" (1937), with its melancholy glimpse of a lone woman, seen from the back, as she peers down at a stage from the standing-room section of what appears to be a mostly deserted auditorium.
"Picturing America" is notable for certain details, like the way it makes the point, with daguerreotypes and tintypes, that the new medium of photography had done much to displace commissioned portrait painting by the time of the Civil War. (Abraham Lincoln, looking sleepy, pops up in one such image from around 1858.)
Similarly, in its gallery of 19th-century landscapes, it dares to mix depictions of nature's majestic forms -- in pottery, a woven rug, a beaded vest -- by anonymous American Indian artisans with familiar Hudson River School vistas by the likes of Frederic Church and Thomas Cole. The eloquent Acoma, Sioux and Navajo pieces help bring the spirit-rattling, European-derived tableaus down to earth.
"It's all about trying to bring the art to life," Mr. Jacobs said. Visitors seeking a comprehensive overview of American art in the New York metropolitan area can still take in the offerings of the Metropolitan, the Whitney and the Brooklyn Museums; now, though, to overlook the way in which Newark's venerable downtown museum rounds out the picture provided by the three others is to miss an essential part of American art's special story, imaginatively told.

HEADLINE: Home Builders Settle Into Their Own Place 

BYLINE:  By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
WHEN it was built in 1910, the Remington Arms Company factory with its nine-story tower in Bridgeport was the tallest building in Connecticut. The plant produced ammunition for the United States and its allies during World Wars I and II, employing 30,000 people at its peak.
 To this day, the 17 interconnected brick buildings in the factory complex dominate the East Side landscape as a lasting testament to the role the defense industry once played in the state's largest city. 
 Nowhere is the juxtaposition between the defense industry's preeminence and the post-cold-war era more manifest than at the former ammunition factory. 
Today, instead of housing America's oldest gun maker, the sprawling complex shelters a well-known housing ministry. A sign at the main entrance reads: "God's love in action: Habitat for Humanity of Bridgeport."
Last year, the Bridgeport affiliate signed a five-year lease with the Intertech Group, which owns and sublets the 987,000-square-foot complex, now called the International Enterprise Park.
Habitat is one of 39 tenants who lease space in Enterprise Park. Other tenants include cabinet makers, distributors, electronics companies, landscapers, artists and the Bridgeport Free Trade Zone.
Habitat, founded as a Christian ministry, embraces congregations of all faiths who believe in making safe and decent housing available to all people.
The Rev. Robert Knebel, who took over as Habitat's executive director in July, said that Christians, Jews, Muslims or anyone who shares the vision is welcome.
"The only kind of proselytizing that we do here is we infect people with 'habitatitis,' " Mr. Knebel said. "Our dream is to alleviate substandard housing in Bridgeport."
Before signing a lease in December 2000, Habitat occupied small warehouse spaces donated by the factory and did much of its work outside in the parking lot, Gary Hayduk, manager of the site, said.
But based on the group's substantial goals for projects in the coming years, Habitat needed more space to work year-round with a larger cadre of volunteers.
"Habitat started storing stuff in 1985 and got 15 years of free space," Mr. Hayduk said. "Now they lease space for their central warehouse, paint shop and production."
Before the munitions manufacturer pulled out of Bridgeport in 1986, Mr. Hayduk, his parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles worked a combined 200 years of service for Remington Arms. Mr. Hayduk's uncle worked in the tower where lead ingots were manufactured into gunshot.
The E. I. Dupont DeNemours Company purchased the remaining Remington Arms shares of stock in 1980 and moved its headquarters from Bridgeport to Wilmington, Del. Defense industry cutbacks and corporate consolidation led to the closure of the Bridgeport plant in 1986.
Remington Arms continues to supply ammunition to the military and sporting market from other sites. The Intertech Group purchased the Bridgeport complex in 1986 and produced shot from 1987 until 1991, through its RemGrit division, which also manufactured saw blades, lead products and shell casings, Mr. Hayduk said.
Artists especially like the high ceilings and 20-foot glass windows in some parts of Enterprise Park. Last year, Intertech sponsored an art show that attracted 500 people.
Mr. Knebel listened with interest as Mr. Hayduk described the success of the art show because Habitat is planning an open house this fall and hopes to attract an equally large number of potential volunteers and sponsors.
Habitat has set a goal of building 25 houses this year and a total of 140 houses by 2003, all financed through donations and built with volunteer labor.
Since the Bridgeport affiliate opened in 1985, volunteers have built or renovated 54 houses, all of them occupied. Another 13 are in progress and four more will be in the works this month. In terms of need, Mr. Knebel said that these figures only scratch the surface since 150 people want houses.
"Habitat is in Bridgeport because the need is greatest in Bridgeport," he said. "We are doing more than building houses. We are building lives, neighborhoods, community."
The organization makes an effort to preserve existing buildings if they have historical value, but constructing a new building is more economical, Mr. Knebel said.
Habitat is seeking to raise $2.5 million this year and $3.5 million in 2002 and 2003. Mr. Knebel said that Habitat could not single-handedly eliminate substandard housing in Bridgeport, adding that a commitment was also needed from religious congregations, the government, industry, individuals and nonprofit agencies.
Volunteers come to Bridgeport from across the nation. In August, church youth groups from Ithaca, N.Y. and North Andover, Mass., worked side-by-side in the warehouse. Earlier in the summer, a Chicago youth group helped build a house.
The majority of the 9,000 volunteers who have helped since 1985, however, come from Connecticut, Mr. Knebel said.
Habitat opened a new training division in July after merging with Youth Rebuild, a nonprofit agency that has worked since 1993 with more than 150 at-risk youths, ages 18 to 24, on over 25 Habitat houses. The trainees, referred by their probation officers or churches, earn their general equivalency diploma with the help of the program, said Gail Sullivan, the director of training.
The new division will integrate Youth Rebuild with training for Habitat families, most of whom have never been homeowners. The division will further train Habitat core volunteers, presently 65 strong, who are primarily retired people with carpentry skills who work during the week or those who help out on a long- or short-term basis, often on Saturdays.
To qualify for a Habitat house, prospective homeowners must pledge 500 hours of "sweat equity," which is pounding nails and contributing skilled or unskilled labor.
Ms. Sullivan said that it could sometimes take up to two years for families to fulfill the requirement.
Angel Hernandez, a warehouse manager, has been a Habitat homeowner for four years. He and his wife, Milagros, hold the Bridgeport record for completing their sweat equity hours in the shortest amount of time: two and a half months.
"I just kept thinking of the joy of knowing my daughter would be living in the house, and that it would be a safe place for her," Mr. Hernandez said. "Before that we were living with my in-laws, and it was very crowded.
"I spend a lot of time building other houses. I love the idea of helping other families get their home."
The actor Paul Newman sponsored the Hernandez family's house and also contributed sweat equity hours along with financial support for the construction.
To be a sponsor, an organization or individual must commit to finance part or all of the expenses and labor connected with the construction of a house.
The sponsors for 2001 include American Skandia, the Diageo Foundation, the Big Top Coalition, the Episcopal Bridgebuilders, the Lowenstein Foundation, Our Lady of Assumption RC Church and the Women Build HomeMakers Coalition.

HEADLINE: Refugee Finds His Way With Unending Work 

BYLINE:  By N. C. MAISAK 

 BODY:
IT has been nearly a quarter of a century since George Reisner fled his native Hungary for America, but he still can't talk about his escape without reliving every fearful moment. 
 It was September 1977. He was 29, a Jew in a sometimes inhospitable country, the son of an Auschwitz survivor. And he had wanted to get out of Hungary for as long as he could remember. 
 Mr. Reisner (pronounced RISE-ner) had a job pumping gas at a Shell station in Budapest. The pay was low, but he made a fair amount of money in tips and supplemented his salary by buying hard-to-find consumer goods in Yugoslavia, Poland and Czechoslovakia and reselling them on the black market in Hungary. He could well afford an expensive vacation. 
So he secured a spot on a government-sponsored tour of the United States: two and a half weeks cross-country, from Los Angeles and San Francisco to the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Washington and finally New York. And there, Mr. Reisner planned to disappear.
When he got to the airport in Budapest, he was jumpy. "I was so nervous that I was soaked with sweat," he said, placing his hand over his heart. "Once we took off, I started to relax because I figured that when we landed in Copenhagen to change planes, I would just get off and run if there were trouble."
There wasn't. Mr. Reisner reached New York without incident and put his plan into action. He asked permission to leave the group to meet a friend. He stood in Times Square and waved goodbye to the other members of his tour group as they boarded a sightseeing bus. As soon as they were out of sight, he ran back to the hotel, threw his clothes into his suitcase and left a note in his room: "Don't wait for me."
For three days, he hid out in Manhattan at his friend's, terrified that the Hungarian police would track him down. 
"The No. 1 reason I left was because I am Jewish," Mr. Reisner said. "My mother had always regretted not leaving Hungary after she got out of the concentration camp. Growing up, she told me, 'You're Jewish, and there's nothing you can do about it, but it doesn't mean that everyone has to know.' I always felt like people hated me, like I didn't belong there."
Mr. Reisner had done well in Budapest, and he thought he could prosper in the United States. "I was determined to make it here even if I had to live on the street," he said.
His determination paid off. Mr. Reisner, now 52, and his wife, Rutika, own Antiques & Jewels on Main, an antique jewelry shop that has become a fixture on Main Street in Huntington Village. In fact, the shop is like an Old World salon, where customers congregate to chat. 
"The shop is a treasure," said Dina McElroy of Huntington, who has been buying there regularly for nearly two decades. "They truly have become my family jeweler -- my two daughters have done all the jewelry rites of passage there. George has the most exquisite taste in jewelry and an eye for elegance."
But Mr. Reisner's success was not without struggle. He knew no English and only a couple of people in New York. One of them was his mother's cousin, who gave him a place to stay and found him a job as a go-fer at an antique jewelry shop on the Upper East Side.
"The hardest thing for me about America was understanding the system," Mr. Reisner said. "In Hungary under communism, the government took care of everyone, from cradle to grave. Over here, you have to do everything yourself." 
For Mr. Reisner that meant working seven days a week at the jewelry shop. "Eventually, I got some of my money from Hungary, and I started buying things for myself and putting them in the shop," he said. "When they sold, we split the profits."
It was a chance encounter in January 1980 that landed him on Long Island. He happened to run into an acquaintance in the diamond district who asked him, "Do you want to get married?" 
To which Mr. Reisner replied, "Why don't you give me her number first?"
The number belonged to Rutika Weiss, who had just opened a jewelry shop on Main Street in Huntington Village. Her parents were Hungarian Jews who had fled to Israel after losing most of their relatives in the Holocaust. They settled on Long Island when their daughter was 4.
"She didn't have much merchandise for the shop, so once we started going out, I would come out to help her," Mr. Reisner said. "I was still working seven days a week in the city, and I asked for one day off, then two days off. When it became serious, I asked for three days off, and they laid me off. That's when I decided to start my own business."
He and Ms. Weiss also decided to marry, which they did in June 1980. That, in turned out, was a bleak time in the jewelry business. There was a recession, and gold prices were going through the roof: at their peak, an ounce of gold sold for $850. "Christmas 1981, we almost went under," Mr. Reisner said. "We had had no customers, and we had just bought a house, so we had no money. We were down to the 24th of December. We made a large sale that afternoon that saved us, but it was an out-of-town check, and we were afraid it would bounce."
It didn't, and pretty soon, business started to bounce back. "We worked seven days a week," Mrs. Reisner said, no small feat while raising two daughters, Alexandra, now 16, and Joanna, 13. "Every year got better and better. We never took out any loans or borrowed any money. We did without a lot of things."
In between running the shop and traveling around the country to jewelry shows, Mr. Reisner completed courses in art history and jewelry appraisal at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University.
In 1996, using savings and money they had inherited, the couple bought the shop that houses Antiques & Jewels.
Looking back, Mr. Reiser said that he has never regretted his decision to come to the United States. "The first time I was able to visit Hungary -- it was in 1986 -- I thought: 'I've lived here, and I've lived there. And I feel like America's really my home now.' "

A Diverse Island
This series looks beyond the stereotypes that sometimes taint relations between immigrants and native Long Islanders, examining immigrants' lives and how they are being woven -- or not -- into the social and economic fabric.

HEADLINE: Albany Has Schools Guessing and Cutting 

BYLINE:  By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
HOW can school districts try to budget for the coming year when they have no idea how much money they are going to get from the state?" asked Alicemarie Bresnihan, president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association.
 Educators throughout Long Island are asking the same question as they prepare for students' return to school this week without knowing how much state aid their districts will be receiving. 
 A budget proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki back in January that would increase state aid to education by $382 million -- up 2.8 percent from last year -- was rejected by the Legislature as too low. The Legislature and the governor avoided the record book for tardy budget-making by adopting a skeleton budget on Aug. 3, but negotiations over a final budget -- one that specifies disbursements to the state's 705 school districts -- remained at an impasse as officials headed into the long Labor Day weekend. 
"This is unprecedented," said Bruce Brodsky, Suffolk County's representative to the New York State School Boards Association.
But even if a deal were struck before students return to class this week, it would come too late to affect decisions that had to be made weeks earlier about important issues like teacher hiring, class size and the implementation of a prekindergarten program.
"This process has been extremely difficult without knowing how much state aid is coming in," Ms. Bresnihan said. "Some districts are more skeptical about the state's budget and have cut from what was approved in May, while others have been more willing to gamble and have gone forward with their programs."
In the Island's wealthier districts, which receive only a small percentage of their budget from state aid, the impact is less significant and may mean a small increase in their taxes. But in poorer districts, which rely more heavily on state funding, the absence of a state budget can mean drastic cuts in programs and services, as well as substantial tax increases.
In the William Floyd School District, for example, 64 percent of the total revenue comes from the state, said Rich Hawkins, the superintendent of schools, who is also president of the Suffolk Council of School Superintendents. 
"A late budget impacts those school districts that need help the most," he said. "We have already limited our spending and eliminated equipment expenditures, but now we also stand to lose up to 18 staff members and may have to cancel plans to reduce class size for our early grades. We expect to see our class size go up, while we'll also have to make cuts in our programs or drastically raise our tax rate. At a time when the state is asking for more accountability and raising the bar for learning standards, this is unconscionable." 
In Roosevelt, which receives almost 60 percent of its budget from the state, program cuts are inevitable and the district has already set its tax rate at an increase of 11.2 percent from last year, according to Mary Brisbane, a district spokeswoman. 
To make matters worse, Roosevelt is one of four Long Island districts already on an austerity plan because its school budget was defeated twice in the spring. The other districts on austerity are Sachem, Amityville and Wyandanch.
An austerity plan caps spending at 4 percent over the prior year's budget, except to cover costs of enrollment growth and debt service. For Roosevelt, this has meant having to trim its budget by $1.4 million, to $39 million. The superintendent of schools, Horace Williams, had proposed making those cuts by eliminating the district's athletic programs and laying off teachers. But the district's Board of Education recently asked that the district find alternatives to lowering the budget, arguing that too many students rely on sports for athletic scholarships to college.
In Suffolk, the Sachem School District also faces the economic hardship of an austerity plan. After a two-time defeat of its budget, the district was forced to cut the budget by $4 million, said James Ruck, superintendent of schools. This has meant the elimination of transportation for kindergarten, a cut in equipment, supplies and materials, and a reduction in teacher training.
"This is a serious problem," Mr. Ruck said. "We're bound by the rules of austerity, but at a time of more rigorous standards, cutting out staff development puts us at a disadvantage."
While many districts throughout the Island face similar problems, there has been one significant difference between districts in Nassau and Suffolk: the timing on their deadlines for setting their tax rates. 
In Nassau, the clock has run out. By Aug. 15, districts had to set their tax rates, even without knowing how much state aid would be coming to offset the property taxes. Suffolk districts, by contrast, have until the end of this month to make that decision. Administrators are hoping that a state budget will be settled by then, preventing them from having to raise taxes.
In Brentwood, if the final state budget is not in place, the district will face with a tax increase of 4 1/2 percent, said Les Black, superintendent of schools.
"People in this community can't afford that now," he said. "School districts have our feet held to the fire. While we had to have our budgets in place by May, the state has gone merrily along its way."
A late state budget has also put many question marks on construction projects planned by the majority of Long Island districts. After many districts approved bond issues for construction to accommodate rising student enrollment and to repair and renovate aging buildings, there is no assurance that districts will get the funding that was originally projected. 
In the Middle Country School District, the community approved a $33 million bond issue for expansion of its four middle schools, to meet the needs of the projected enrollment increase of 1,000 students over the next five years. The superintendent of schools, Connie Lorthridge, said: "We held off on the bids for as long as possible, because this bare bones budget wouldn't cover the costs of our project. But we've moved ahead and are hoping that the money will come through. At the same time, we're putting on hold other capital projects of boiler repairs and overdue renovations that were planned for this year in our general budget, while we wait to hear how much money we'll be getting from the state."
A $228 million project in Sachem, passed by voters last year to reconfigure the entire district, creating more space for rising enrollment, is counting on 82 percent of its funding from the state, based on the ratio under the existing formula, said Mr. Ruck, the superintendent, who added, "We're keeping our fingers crossed that the state won't take away any money that was promised for the construction."
Aside from money issues, a staffing shortage at the State Education Department has delayed approval of construction plans, further frustrating educators.
In East Hampton, where student enrollment has jumped by 3 1/2 percent since the end of June, plans call for moving the central administration office out of the middle school and into trailers to allow more room for students. Delayed by approval from the state, the trailers are now sitting in the high school parking lot, waiting to be moved by the middle of the month.
Rising student enrollment has further affected the economics of many school districts. This year student enrollment in Long Island's school districts is estimated at 480,000, with projections that the student population next year will exceed 500,000 for the first time, said Dr. Brodsky, the Suffolk representative to the state school boards association. In 1995, the student population was less than 400,000.
"More students means the need for more services," he said. "And that translates to more money. Right now, without a state budget, many school districts are in deep trouble, through no fault of their own."

HEADLINE: New Bishop Comes Ready to Do His Homework 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
WILLIAM FRANCIS MURPHY, soon to become the fourth bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, does not presume to be an expert on Long Island or the diocese of 1.5 million Catholics he will soon lead.
 "I know nothing," he said in an interview held last week at the chancery of the Archdiocese of Boston, where he is an auxiliary bishop and a top administrator. "You are looking at a very dumb guy." 
 That is a description used by no one who knows the 61-year-old priest, a Boston native who spent 13 years working at the Vatican. When he is installed on Wednesday, he will immediately become a leading public figure on Long Island. 
By several accounts, Bishop Murphy is a gregarious, charming man, energetic and enthusiastic, a devout and learned Catholic leader steeped in church orthodoxy but committed to interfaith understanding, and a seasoned administrator who listens well and then acts decisively.
Now, at an age when others look toward retirement, at the request of Pope John Paul II he is embarking on a new job that will call upon all his reserves and talents.
He succeeds James T. McHugh, who died of cancer in December after serving as the diocesan leader for less than a year.
The installation ceremony for Bishop Murphy will take place at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre. He said farewell to Boston in a mass of thanksgiving celebrated at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross there on Aug. 9. 
Although Bishop Murphy grew up in the West Roxbury section of Boston, his years in Rome give him a European and international perspective. If nothing else, on Long Island he will have to adjust to a regional dialect, in which at its most extreme, "paahk the caah" becomes "pauwk the caw."
One of the most pressing problems he will have to address is the dwindling ranks of priests. The diocese, which has 577 priests, many of them elderly, has one of the worst priest-to-parishioner ratios -- 1 to 2,600 -- of any Roman Catholic diocese in the country. On the plus side, the diocese has the eighth-largest Catholic population of any diocese in the country and is financially among the strongest. 
As he prepares for his new post, Bishop Murphy said he would learn by listening and study. "I am beginning to do my homework," he said.
Bishop Murphy has an easy laugh and informal manner -- friends call him Bill and in the interview he slipped off his shoes while talking.
He said that one of his major goals on Long Island would be promoting interfaith understanding. Early on, he plans to seek out other religious leaders. "I want to be as collegial as I can be," he said.
In Boston, he was known as a champion of better relations between Catholics and Jews and had a close friendship with a Jewish civic leader, Leonard P. Zakim, who died of bone cancer two years ago. 
He said he would actively promote the priesthood as a vocation among young men, but in a departure from what the Rockville Centre diocese has said in the past, he declined to say there was a shortage of priests on Long Island.
"I am not going to use that term," he said. "What we have to do is show young people the opportunity for vocations in the life of the church. Young men have to be shown how wonderful and satisfying it is to be a priest." In keeping with church teachings and Catholic tradition, Bishop Murphy said he was opposed to allowing women to become priests. 
He said he was struck by the fact that the Long Island diocese had 134 parishes while the Boston archdiocese, with 2.2 million Catholics and 932 priests, had 365 parishes.
"I am sure the size of the parishes in the Rockville Centre diocese creates a tremendous challenge to a pastor trying to reach out to his people," he said. "I am not coming in with any blueprint or plan. I don't have one. I don't know enough yet. But I do think we have to take a look at that."
He said he would pay particular attention to Long Island's growing Hispanic population, which is overwhelmingly Catholic and increasingly diverse, ranging from long-established Puerto Ricans in Brentwood to Mexican day laborers whose presence on street corners in Farmingville and elsewhere on Long Island has created tensions.
"They will be aware that I am coming," said Bishop Murphy, who speaks Spanish but is not fluent in the language. He said his first parish mass would be on Thursday at Queen of the Most Holy Rosary in Roosevelt, which has a black and Hispanic congregation. 
Bishop Murphy will play a central role in setting a course for the 12 Catholic high schools and 59 Catholic elementary schools in Nassau and Suffolk. Their enrollment of about 40,000 students dropped slightly last year but has remained relatively stable in recent years, according to the diocese.
But tuition costs have been rising steadily, in part to meet salary expectations of lay teachers who now make of the majority of teaching staffs, and some families are finding the higher costs hard to meet. 
During his brief tenure, Bishop McHugh made salary increases for the lay teachers a priority but never carried out his plan to grant the raises. The schools are financed by a combination of tuition, fund-raising and parish subsidies.
Bishop Murphy said that the issue of higher salaries remained on the table, but noted that teachers in Catholic schools were paid substantially less than public school teachers in many parts of the country. 
"Obviously, if someone chooses to teach in a Catholic school, that in itself is an acceptance of an approach to education that is a mission, not just a job," he said. 
The new bishop will also preside over the corporate members of Catholic Health Services of Long Island, created by Bishop John R. McGann in 1997. The huge system, which by its own estimate provides 25 percent of all health-care services on Long Island, includes five hospitals with a total of nearly 1,700 hospital beds, three nursing homes and a variety of other medical service centers. It has 2,700 medical staff members and more than 13,500 employees. Total revenues exceeded $1 billion last year, and profits were $4 million. 
Ronald R. Aldrich, the health system's president and chief executive, said Bishop Murphy had extensive experience with a church health system in the Archdiocese of Boston. "This is a real plus for us," Mr. Aldrich said. "We feel very excited and very blessed that he is coming here."
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which provides services and housing to the poor, the sick and the elderly, may also benefit from Bishop Murphy's experience with charities provided by the Boston archdiocese that are second in extent only to services provided by the state of Massachusetts. 
Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, in Rensselaer, said that hospitals in New York faced rising pressure because of cuts in federal aid to elderly and poor patients and slow reimbursement from insurers. "The Catholic system has not been immune to that," he said. "And because they have nursing homes, they have really been hit right along the continuum of care."
In reaction to just such financial pressures, Catholic Health Services joined the Long Island Health Network, whose members include non-Catholic hospitals like Winthrop-University, Mather Memorial and South Nassau. Network members cooperate in an effort to streamline services and contain costs. 
Bishop Murphy has made it clear he would follow in the steps of Bishop McHugh, an ardent opponent of abortion.
"We fulfill God's call to bring his love to the world when we preach the truth by being unambiguously pro-life, unfailingly pro-family, unalterably pro-poor," he said in his homily at the farewell mass in Boston.
In last week's interview, he said he did not support adoption of children by gays and lesbians. "I would oppose any act of unjust discrimination against people who are homosexual, and if that happens on my watch you can be sure I will protest it," he said. "But I also think a family is intended to be a man and a woman in lawful union and their offspring, either biological or adopted."
He said that while he opposed a decision by President Bush to provide federal money for research on a limited number of stem cell lines, he applauded the president for casting his decision in ethical terms.
The debate over the use of stem cells, he said, had been "reduced to nonethical questions of technology or, even worse, economics." 
"President Bush served us well because he spoke about the ethical issues," he said. "If utility is the only measure, that is anti-human."
Last week, anticipation of Bishop Murphy's arrival was running high. "Everyone is very excited that he is coming to Rockville Centre," said Msgr. Tom Hartman, the director of radio and television for the diocese who appears on the cable television program "The God Squad" and other programs on Telecare, a diocesan station. "This is one of the best dioceses in the country with among the most educated, sophisticated and influential people, and Bishop Murphy wants to come here."
Monsignor Hartman agreed with Bishop Murphy that large parishes posed a problem. "It's a huge diocese, and it has very big parishes," he said. "Some people feel as though they don't have an intimacy with their parishes, and that they are factories. He has to recognize that they are many parishes within each parish and that people go to church for different reasons. While he may not be able to build a lot of new parishes, he could look at programs that make the parishes more personal."
Monsignor Hartman's co-host on "The God Squad," Rabbi Marc Gellman, said that Bishop Murphy's mission to promote interfaith understanding would benefit from the already good relations between Catholics and Long Island's large Jewish population.
"I really believe that Long Island is a model for the rest of the country," said Rabbi Gellman, the president of the New York Board of Rabbis and the senior rabbi at Temple Beth Torah in Melville.
He said he had learned that Bishop Murphy "regularly speaks to confirmation students about the necessity of purging any shred of anti-Semitism from their Catholic identity."
Bishop Murphy said vigilance against racism and anti-Semitism was vital. "Anti-Semitism is the most ingrained prejudice of western culture," he said.
He said he would also seek out leaders of other religions,
Al-Haaj Ghazi Y. Khankan, the director of interfaith affairs and communications for the Islamic Center of Long Island, in Westbury, said that such contacts would be welcomed. "We are for strong dialogue between the Muslim and Catholic communities," he said. "There is so much to learn about each other."
He said there were about 70,000 Muslims on Long Island and more than two million in the metropolitan area. 
The Rev. Bill Brisotti, the administrator of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal in Wyandanch, said he hoped Bishop Murphy would elevate the status of Hispanic Catholics. "They have got to rise to the next notch up," said Father Brisotti, who has worked with Hispanic Catholics for 30 years. "The 'they' must be integrated into the 'we.' " 
He said that Catholic clergy in far-flung corners of the diocese needed greater connectedness with diocesan leaders. "There is a tremendous need to encourage people out there working in the field," he said. "Right now there is a lot of frustration, and a sense that you are on your own."
Bishop Murphy prescribed prayer as the best means to surmount all problems. "We must be a community who prays," he said. "And the more we become a community of faithful prayer, the more we are going to be able to look at issues with strength and serenity, with a commitment to do what's good."

HEADLINE: First One Casino, Then Two. Now What? 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
FOR years, the tiny town of Union's biggest claim to fame has been its size. With 693 residents, it is the smallest municipality in Connecticut.
 But now this village nestled against the Massachusetts border near Interstate 84 is making headlines for a different reason: The Nipmuc Nation, a Sutton, Mass.-based tribe seeking federal recognition, reportedly has made inquiries about purchasing property in the town. Union residents fear the tribe, which has an agreement with a Minnesota-based casino management company, wants to make their town the site of the state's third casino. 
 "Everybody is up in arms over it," Selectman Nathan Swift said. 
Nipmuc officials said they have not committed to any real estate acquisitions and a spokesman insisted the tribe's focus is on Massachusetts. But mere speculation about a casino was enough to prompt Union to join a growing list of municipalities that are monitoring the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs as it considers handfuls of petitions filed by Connecticut groups seeking federal tribal recognition.
Across the state, 10 groups have announced their intentions to seek federal recognition, placing Connecticut among the top states in the country with the most number of groups bidding for recognition. Two tribes, of course, have already been successful: the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegan Indians, whose casinos generate more than $1 billion in combined annual gross revenues.
In the next two years, the Bureau of Indian Affairs could make final determinations on at least three other Connecticut-based groups: the Eastern Pequots, the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, both of North Stonington, and the Schaghticokes Indians of Kent.
If recognized, the tribes would be given special rights that have significant consequences, like putting land into trust so it is exempt from taxes and local zoning control.
But it is the prospect of more federally recognized tribes opening casinos in the state that has created controversy and skeptics, especially because half of the Connecticut petitioners started the process after the Mashantuckets opened the wildly successful Foxwoods Resort Casino in 1992. 
"There's huge money that is backing these groups for the purpose of casinos," said Preston First Selectman Robert Congdon. "It raises the question of 'is the recognition process about preserving Indian culture or is it about building casinos'."
Aurelius Piper Jr., the chief of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribal Council, who is known as Chief Quiet Hawk, is sensitive to such claims. Though the Paugussetts would like to open a casino in Bridgeport if recognized, Mr. Piper noted that the tribe's quest for federal recognition began nearly 20 years ago, long before gaming was an option.
"We never started off dealing with that issue," Mr. Piper said. "It was a matter of trying to house, educate, take care of members of the tribe, our elderly and our young and trying to live our culture and heritage." 
Established in 1978, the federal recognition process is a complicated and cumbersome task that requires tribes to meet seven criteria. Groups must not only trace their lineage to a historical tribe but demonstrate they have lived continuously as a tribe, both socially and politically, among other things.
While dozens of groups announced their intentions to seek federal recognition in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the stakes grew with the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, which permitted federally recognized tribes to have casinos if they obtain the proper approvals. 
That law enabled the Mashantuckets, who were recognized through an act of Congress in 1983, to open Foxwoods.
The casino's success gave new significance to federal recognition in Connecticut and spawned a second wave of petitions in the late 1990's. Between 1997 and 2000, five groups filed letters of intent to petition for federal recognition.
Suddenly, internationally known casino developers like Sol Kerzner, who became partners with the Mohegan Indians, and Donald Trump, who teamed up with the Paucatucks, set their sites on the state.
The infusion of gaming dollars and allegations that federal officials violated Bureau of Indian Affairs procedures was enough to prompt Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to deem the system "broken" and call for a moratorium on tribal recognition decisions until the process is reformed. 
"I have been very critical of the whole recognition process, because I think it's much too susceptible to improper influence of money and politics and needs to be more objective and more open and fair," Mr. Blumenthal said. 
Mr. Blumenthal and officials from three southeastern Connecticut towns have sued the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the United States Department of Interior in federal court earlier this year, claiming procedures were violated in the bureau's review of the Eastern Pequots' and Paucatucks' petitions.. As part of the court proceedings related to the lawsuit, a federal judge set a timetable for the review of the tribes' petitions, which received preliminary approval in March 2000. Under that order, the bureau is scheduled to make a final determination in early December.
The two tribes, which share a reservation in North Stonington, intend to pursue gaming ventures if they are recognized. 
Backed by Eastern Capital Development of Southport, the Eastern Pequots proposed building a casino at State Pier in New London but withdrew the plan in July after the New London City Council failed to support the proposal. 
Nancy Tyler, a spokeswoman for the Eastern Pequots, said the tribe is considering sites in other towns in the region, but she would not elaborate.
The Paucatucks have no firm development plans, because they said they believed it is premature to discuss proposals without federal recognition, Jon Crane, a tribal spokesman, said. But the tribe's intent to pursue gaming became clear when it joined with Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. The tribe also has a business relationship with Amalgamated Industries, a Connecticut investment company.
"Assuming there is federal recognition, you can most certainly make that assumption that a casino would be part of the plan at that point," Mr. Crane said. 
In western Connecticut, the Schaghticokes, who number almost 320 and have a reservation in Kent, said they hope to receive a final determination on their petition in 2003. 
That is the time schedule set by a federal judge who is reviewing the tribe's land claims for thousands of acres owned by Kent School, the town of Kent, the federal government and others, said Tribal Chief Richard Velky.
If recognized, the Schaghticokes intend to pursue a gaming venture somewhere in Fairfield or New Haven counties, Mr. Velky said. He would not identify the tribe's financial backers.
"This is a long affair," Mr. Velky said, noting his tribe first filed paperwork with the bureau 20 years ago. "It's not done over night and even though people think it's over gaming, this is all to do with somebody's heritage and their culture."
Like the Schaghticokes, the Golden Hill Paugussetts have filed land claims, seeking thousands of acres in Trumbull, Bridgeport, Milford and Orange.
The tribe hopes to imitate the Mohegans, who used their land claims as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the state to open a casino, Mr. Piper said. 
"The tribe wants to settle the land claims to get some land for the tribe to live on as a whole," Mr. Piper said. "And then of course we would like to pursue some socio-economic development program for which they can support themselves."
Those development plans include a casino. The tribe, which has a quarter-acre reservation in Trumbull and another 102 acres in Colchester, is interested in opening a casino in Bridgeport.
It has the financial backing of developer Thomas Wilmot, whose Wilmorite Inc. owns the Danbury Fair Mall, Mr. Piper said. 
But first the Paugussetts must secure federal recognition. The tribe is in "administrative limbo" after being denied federal recognition in 1996, only to win the right to a full reconsideration of the petition in 1999, he said. Since then the tribe has sued the bureau to force it to place its petition before others on the list, Mr. Piper said. 
The other six Connecticut groups seeking federal recognition filed letters of intent to petition after Foxwoods opened.
The Mohegan Tribe & Nation, which is based in Norwich, contacted the bureau in 1992, but had not submitted any documentation as of February, according to the agency. Officials from the tribe could not be reached for comment. 
Two other tribes, the Nehantic Tribe and Nation of Chester and the Southern Pequot Tribe in Waterford, which filed letters in 1997 and 1998, respectively, could not be reached for comment. According to bureau documents, the Nehantic Tribe has not submitted documentation and the Southern Pequots have an incomplete petition.
The Pequot Mohegan Tribe, which has about 125 members, contacted the bureau in 1999, but has not submitted its documentation. The tribal chief, Van Thomas Green, said his group is distantly related to the Mashantuckets and Mohegans. He said his tribe intended to file land claims in the Norwich area, but is against gambling, he said.
"We're not trying to get rich," he said. "Money is the root of all evil." 
The Poquonnock Pequot Tribe, which has 112 members and claims to be of Western Pequot descent, filed its letter of intent to petition in 1999 after the Tribal Council debated for years the merits of seeking such status, said Paul A. Davis, a tribal spokesman. It has yet to submit its documentation.
Based in Ledyard, the group is sensitive to claims that they are simply trying to get rich. James Avery, a member of the tribal council, said he is willing to waive rights to gambling if the tribe is recognized. He said he believed most of the tribal council agrees with him, but the entire tribe would have to vote on it.
"Something that's that important we would have to put before the entire tribal body before we said we would give up gambling absolutely," he said.
The Western Pequot Tribal Nation of New Haven submitted its letter of intent to petition in November 2000. As of February, the group, which could not be reached for comment, had not submitted any documentation. 
And then there are the Nipmucs, who received a proposed positive finding by the Clinton administration on Jan. 19. The Bush administration is reviewing the decision.
Lakes Gaming of Minnetonka, Minn., is paying for the Nipmucs' federal recognition bid. In exchange, the tribe will join with the company if it pursues gaming, according to a tribal statement. 
Woodstock First Selectman Ernest Wetzel said he believed if the Nipmucs try to build a casino they will pick a site in Connecticut, because the state has allowed tribal casinos here. But he said Connecticut needs to come to terms with the impact of gambling on the state.
"Do we want to be the Las Vegas of the East?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Greenwich Goes Hollywood, and Beyond, With Film Festival 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA G. CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
FILM buffs will get to mingle with filmmakers from Connecticut to California, as well as actors and actresses, Hollywood stuntmen and others from the movie industry when the first Greenwich Film Festival opens Wednesday for a four-day run.
 "Everyone in the world is captivated by films," said John Carley of Greenwich, the 35-year-old founder and president of the festival. 
 Mr. Carley, who works in a family-owned decorating and construction business, has attended film festivals from Cannes in France to Sundance in Utah. In planning the Greenwich event, however, he looked to the successful Santa Barbara Film Festival as a reference point. The two towns, he said, have much in common. 
"Greenwich is logistically situated to support a film festival," Mr. Carley said. "People can come into town and within easy walking distance can catch a screening, attend a reception and go to a workshop -- all in one day. If they arrive at the Greenwich Train Station, they'll step out into the middle of the festival."
Planning for the festival began about a year ago, he said, over the kitchen table of Maureen Lutz, the festival's director and a management consultant for nonprofits.
"When I was growing up, my dad would take me to the movies all of the time," Ms. Lutz said. "He would then talk about the actors and actresses as if he personally knew them." 
Mr. Carley's own interest in the film industry is an extension of his personal life. He once directed traffic in the rain for seven hours so a filmmaker friend could get the perfect shot.
"I have friends who went to film school and so I saw people who made some beautiful movies that never got viewed by the public," Mr. Carley said. "The feature films to be shown at our festival are all new and, as yet, undistributed. You're not going to see these films in the theater or on cable until next year."
Ten feature-length films as well as a number of short dramas and documentaries will be shown. Most of the films will have both afternoon and evening screenings from Wednesday through Saturday, at the Crown Plaza Theater, the Clearview Cinema and the Library Auditorium.
Among the feature films being screened is "Ghetto Dawgs" directed by Brian Averill. The film, about a young car thief who finds himself being pulled deeper into the dark world of drug dealing, dog fighting and murder, took first place at the recent Atlantic City Film Festival.
"The competition was quite decent and included a film with Peter Falk, so we were pretty excited about taking best picture," said Virgil Ranaudo of Jersey Bred Productions, one of the film's producers.
The film stars Drena DeNiro, daughter of Robert DeNiro, and Gianna Palminteri, who is Mr. Ranaudo's sister and one of the film's executive producers. Ms. Palminteri is married to the actor Chazz Palminteri, who is expected to attend the screenings of a number of different movies, according to Mr. Carley.
Another feature film, "Jack the Dog," a comedy about a photographer's adventures in truth and love that had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, has local ties. The film stars a Greenwich resident, Nestor Carbonell of the NBC sitcom "Suddenly Susan," which is now in syndication. A film having its festival premiere is "The Private Public," the story of a love triangle, directed by Dana Altman, grandson of the director Robert Altman.
The film "Revolution #9" directed by Tim McCann of Exile Productions in Piermont, N.Y. was screened previously for 100 people at the Los Angeles International Film Festival, Mr. Carley said. The film is described as a psychological thriller that examines the mental breakdown of a young man living in New York City.
More than a half-dozen workshops are planned, including a discussion of how to produce a documentary film on a shoestring that will be led by Harvey Hubbell, an independent filmmaker.
Guy Ortoleva, a lawyer and managing director of the Connecticut Film, Video, and Media Office, which is part of the state's Economic and Community Development agency, will lead two workshops: one on production incentives offered by the state and one on the legalities of filmmaking from copyright law to contracts.
"At the Greenwich Film Festival I'll have a representative with me from the Connecticut Consortium of Independent Filmmakers, which is a new trade group," Mr. Ortoleva said. "We have dozens of filmmakers in the state who may not know that someone in the next town is struggling to make a film or where there are good film crews or locations that are supportive to their filmmaking."
On Thursday evening at the Bruce Museum, a Lifetime Achievement Award will be presented to the actress Patricia Neal, who won an Oscar in 1963 for her performance in "Hud." The evening will include a screening of a short film "For the Love of May" that stars Ms. Neal. The film was written and directed by Mary McDonough of Los Angeles who played Erin in the television series "The Waltons."
"We created a special event around the screening of this film and the award to Ms. Neal," Ms. Lutz said. "Mary McDonough has lupus and proceeds from the reception and screening will benefit the Lupus Research Institute."
The award to Ms. Neal will be presented by the actress Glenn Close, who grew up in Greenwich; the two worked together in the movie "Cookie's Fortune."
The festival begins Wednesday with a reception at Saks Fifth Avenue, one of the sponsors.
Advance ticket sales have been slow, but steady, Mr. Carley said. Nearly 100 tickets have been sold for the $1,000 patron package, which includes two tickets to all events, movies, workshops and private parties. It will cost $100 for a movie pass that admits one person to all screenings and $10 for a single movie ticket, subject to availability. Admission to individual workshops costs $10 to $35, while special event tickets are $50 to $150.
Information about festival events and schedules is available at www.GreenwichFilmFestival.org. Individual tickets to all workshops and events are available at the festival's headquarters, 410 Greenwich Avenue, corner of Railroad Avenue, 2nd floor, or by calling (203) 661-4554.

History: Everything You Need to Know

BYLINE:  By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
YOU'VE forked over roughly the gross domestic product of Liechtenstein to send your kids to camp and they're back already? Was that the way it was supposed to work? 
 Not only are they back, but they're also about to resume the school year grind -- rising at ungodly hours, strapping on backpacks equaling the tonnage that Hannibal's elephants lugged across the Alps and studying cosines, logarithms, chemical valences, Latin and the other things you've found so useful as you've gone through life. 
 Which brings us to one of those subjects -- history. 
Experts see two big problems with studying history these days. First, is time. Between soccer practice, French horn lessons, SAT prep classes and the Intel Nuclear Bomb Making Competition, kids only have so much time for the Ming Dynasty and the Holy Roman Empire. And after elementary school, they get even busier. 
Second is memory. Was the generation that fought World War II really the Greatest Generation compared with, say, the blokes who fought the Thirty Years' War or the Crusades? Who knows? But since no one remembers anything that predates color television, who's going to argue with Tom Brokaw? But it doesn't mean he's right.
With time short and memories shorter, education experts are preparing a stripped-down history curriculum with more links to pop culture for the coming school year. 
So, if we just fast-forward past the perhaps Greatest Generation for a moment, a more relevant modern history course suitable for today's busy Z-100 listeners would begin with the Beatles, who were so Fab as to get a detergent named after them. Also important were Jerry and the Pacemakers, who were brilliant in merging pop music and advanced cardiac care, but who came came along about four decades too early to reach their target audience of decaying boomers with faulty tickers. We also went to the moon, and NASA sent along the man with the most American name possible, Buzz Aldrin, just to rub the Russians' noses in it.
Also during this time came hippies, the Grateful Dead and the Vietnam War, which gave us "Forrest Gump," "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon." The 70's gave us "Rocky" and disco, and historians still debate who had a bigger impact on global geopolitics: Stallone or Travolta? Richard Nixon had to quit after having sex with a White House intern named Checkers and was replaced by a man named Ford who kept falling down on "Saturday Night Live." Elvis died, cementing his reputation as the most famous person in history.
In the 1980's, MTV was born, ending the feminist movement and ushering in the babe/dude/hottie/supermodel movement that shows no signs of abating now that 9-year-olds are expected to dress like hookers. Ronald Reagan was president for a long time, and the Soviet Union, still demoralized by Buzz Aldrin, fell apart. The only thing its countries stayed good at was doping athletes in the Olypmics.
Sometime in the 80's, the great Bull Market began. During this time, everyone in America became an expert on Value Investing, Momentum Investing and the New Paradigm, which said stocks of Internet Laundromats and pop-up toaster dot.coms would go up forever. Michael Jackson replaced Elvis as the most famous person in history.
In the 90's, people continued to make money. The Titanic, this really big boat full of vacationers in old-fashioned clothes, sank after it hit an iceberg. Bill Clinton provided cable TV commentators endless material so they could shout at each other at all hours of the night. O. J. Simpson did not kill his wife. Michael Jordan replaced Michael Jackson as the most famous person in history.
The world did not end during Y2K. That allowed enough time for everyone's stocks to go back down to zero, the Supreme Court to appoint the president and Britney Spears to replace Michael Jordan as the most famous person in history. 'N Sync became more popular than the Backstreet Boys. Tom and Nicole broke up but Brad and Jennifer were still together.
No one knows what the future will bring for Jenna Bush, Gary Condit, Adam Sandler and tomorrow's newsmakers, but if we're going to cram them into the history books, chances are the Concordat of Worms, Rutherford B. Hayes and a minor Shakespeare play or two might have to go to make up for it. The kids can only learn so much.
Next Week: Quantum physics made simple.

HEADLINE: Ken Burns Taps Waterbury And Its Store of Memories 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA WEISS 

 BODY:
JOSEPH CELENTANO of Waterbury, 82, will never forget the football game he attended at the old Polo Grounds in New York on Dec. 7, 1941. After the game, it was announced that Pearl Harbor had been bombed, he said, "and everyone turned around and said, 'Where's Pearl Harbor?' "
 For Gloria Brandolini, 78, the indelible moment occurred on the Waterbury Green at the end of the war, on Aug. 14, 1945. "It was like our own little Times Square," she said. "Downtown, you could not move! Everyone just converged in the center. Tears were shed -- for who came home, who didn't come." 
 Such private memories may soon be preserved on public television. Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker, is seeking a few good cities on which to focus his next project, a documentary on World War II, and at the head of his list is Waterbury. 
"Waterbury is certainly one of our top choices," Mr. Burns said.
After the phenomenal success of his nine-part series "The Civil War" in 1990 -- with 44 awards, including two Emmys, it was more decorated than a five-star general -- "it became incredibly clear," Mr. Burns said, "that some of the ways in which the audience took to the film had to do with personally identifying with towns and individuals that were ordinary folks." So instead of tackling the full scope of the world war, he will explore how it affected American life through its impact on one or more small cities.
"We're not going to do a huge, overarching 10-part series," said his co-producer, Lynn Novick, who also collaborated with Mr. Burns on "Baseball" and "Jazz." 
"I think that if we show towns all across the country -- we distribute our interest across the geography of America -- it will be the best possible thing," Mr. Burns said. "But when we hit Waterbury, we got so excited that we began paying very close attention to it."
Why Waterbury? Despite its political travails, both past and present, it fit all their main criteria: It had an ethnically diverse population; it was conveniently located between Mr. Burns' home in Walpole, N.H., and Manhattan, where Ms. Novick, is based; and, once known as "the brass center of the world," it had a large industrial base that switched over to war production during the war.
Indeed, Waterbury-based manufacturers such as Anaconda American Brass Company, the Scovill Manufacturing Company and Chase Brass and Copper converted their operations from brass production to manufacturing cartridge clips, shell cases and time fuses for bombs. The Waterbury Clock Company (now known as Timex) also retooled to make munitions such as mechanical time fuses for bombs and gun sight units for airplanes.
The factory factor was most crucial, Ms. Novick said, "because we want to focus on not just the people who went overseas, but also try to connect that to the home front." Although many films have managed to convey either the brutality of combat or hardships endured at home, she said, "not very much has tried to really interconnect the two."
In this regard, Waterbury had one more advantage to offer their production company, Florentine Films: The Mattatuck Museum. It is in downtown Waterbury and has extensive experience conducting oral history projects. Its staff volunteered to assist with the film and has already begun interviewing local citizens.
"I'm hoping one of the things we can do is help streamline the project for them," said Marie Galbraith, the director of the museum. 
Anthony Santoro, a retired sheet metal worker, visited the Mattatuck recently to tell Ruth Glasser, a free-lance oral historian, about joining the Army Air Forces in May 1942. 
Mr. Santoro, 83, wears two hearing aids and bifocals and has deep lines etched around his mouth. But it wasn't hard to recognize him as a handsome young serviceman in a sepia-toned photo he showed of himself dressed in uniform beside his brothers Vito, who fought in the infantry, and Joseph, who also served in the Air Forces.
"This is the airplane I came home in," he said, showing a photo of "The Miss Beryl," a plane painted with the face of a shark and image of a pin-up girl. His eyes glistened as he recalled his return to Waterbury in October 1945. "My mother comes running down the stairs. What a reunion that was, three and a half years later!"
Stephen Rinaldi, 47, also visited the Mattatuck with his collection, a vast assortment of letters, photographs and other documents meticulously kept by his father. 
Family members discovered these treasures in an old trunk after Mr. Rinaldi's father, Charles, died in 1999. In numerous bulging scrapbooks, his father carefully assembled a record of his life as an Army Air Corps cryptographer. Inside, hundreds of photographs depict the distant places he was stationed, from Casablanca to the Belgian Congo. Diaries and travelogues in neat script give detailed accounts of his experiences.
Also inside are ration cards, stripes from his uniforms, and greeting cards from friends and relatives offering encouraging messages such as "'Tanks' to you, soldier! . . . The firing lines are holding up." 
"It's the best example of what the filmmakers are looking for," Ms. Galbraith said.
Mr. Rinaldi said his father had never mentioned this collection and rarely discussed the war. "The one thing that hurt him," he said, was that his father's mother died in 1944 while he was overseas and he was not permitted to return for the funeral.
If included in the documentary, such memories are destined for national exposure. "The Civil War" drew 39.5 million viewers and "Baseball," which aired in 1994, attracted an audience of 44 million.
Also available to be immortalized by Mr. Burns are members of the Crownbrook Neighborhood Association, a group of North End residents, nearly two dozen of whom met with Ms. Galbraith and Ms. Glasser to trade stories about Waterbury and the war.
For Mr. Celentano's wife, Kay, 77, the unforgettable experience was learning to drive a large truck at age 16 because, with so many people enlisted in the service, her father's bakery, Lorusso's in Waterbury, couldn't find anyone else to deliver cakes and crullers. "The men were all gone," she said.
Bill Santoro, 65, recalled participating in frequent air raid drills and city-wide blackouts. With its munitions factories and coastal location, "they figured Waterbury might be bombed," he said. Mr. Santoro was too young to be drafted, but he had an older brother stationed in Germany. His brother came back from the war. Thomas Ciarlo's did not.
Mr. Ciarlo, 74, who grew up in Waterbury but now lives in Wolcott, said his older brother, Corado "Babe" Ciarlo, was killed in action at age 21. A few months later, Mr. Ciarlo was drafted, too. Was he frightened to go?
"When you're 18 years old, you don't think of those things, really," he said. "You know you have to go, and your friends are all going, and everyone else is in there, so you just make the best of it."
Some members of that generation are now great grandparents. Many are gone. "The fact is that if we don't try to get some of these stories now," said Ms. Novick, "there may not be another chance."
She has received several calls from children of veterans offering war photographs and memorabilia kept by their fathers who are no longer living. "Those are great for us to possibly use, but it's not the same as having him here to tell us what happened," she said. "So before it's too late, we'd like to get as many people to tell their stories as possible."
Despite this sense of urgency, the documentary is not expected to air until 2005 and a decision on whether to focus on Waterbury will not be made any time soon. Mr. Burns hopes to begin work on World War II soon after his latest venture, a biography of Mark Twain, has its premiere in January. "This will be a multi-year, multi-episode affair," he said, "so I imagine by next year I will be deep into it." Yet production on "World War II" is slated to take nearly as long as the war itself.
If Waterbury is ultimately chosen, only a small crew will be on location there for a total of about 20 days, spread over the course of a year, Ms. Novick said. "So I don't anticipate a huge boon to the economy of Waterbury from our physical presence there."
Spotlighting the city in this context, however, may restore some luster to the Brass City's tarnished image. Ms. Novick has been told that Waterbury back then "was like the Rome of Connecticut," she said. "Because the factories were running 24 hours a day, people were always out. Shifts were always getting out or starting, and there were always people on the green or in town, eating, drinking, dancing, whatever, all day and all night. People would come there from other parts of Connecticut to have a good time."
Whether or not Waterbury is chosen, Mr. Burns expects to spend time in the state. His elder daughter, Sarah, 18, will be a sophomore at Yale. His younger daughter, Lilly, 14, is entering Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor. "So everything about my life, from 'Mark Twain' to my daughters, revolves around the state of Connecticut," he said.
And even if Waterbury is not prominently featured, Ms. Novick said, memories offered by its citizens are likely to be used.
She is also receptive to notable material from people with no connection to Waterbury. "What we're interested in is people who have unusual or particularly compelling stories to tell about their experiences in the war," she said, "or who had family members in the war who left behind letters, diaries or photographs that really would give a full picture of what their experiences were if they aren't here to tell us." Home movies showing soldiers at home on leave or family picnics are also welcome.
Through these personal tales, Mr. Burns hopes to illuminate the big picture.
"I think that sometimes, in our celebration of the heroics of war, we lose touch with the human cost and the human involvement," he said. He admires the way books such as Tom Brokaw's "The Greatest Generation" have allowed veterans to revisit their past and introduce others to it. "I would just like to be one of the many voices trying to collate, organize and make sense of that experience before those people pass from the scene."
Ms. Novick plans to visit Connecticut this month to meet with potential film subjects. She can be reached at (212) 662-9983 or by e-mail at ffnyc1@aol.com.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
For Schundler, a Big Rabbit To Yank Out of His Hat Now

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
So what will Bret Schundler do now?
 Two months ago, the Republican candidate for governor was basking in the glow of his masterly primary campaign in which he echoed his earlier, equally improbable mayoral victory in Jersey City by undoing Bob Franks, the party favorite. 
 Now Mr. Schundler has another uphill fight against James McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge who seems to have Forrest Gumped his way into a commanding lead in the polls by making Mr. Schundler the only issue in the campaign, and by keeping many of his own irreconcilable positions as fuzzy as possible. 
Mr. Schundler is a free-market conservative who believes the state has been too profligate with taxpayer dollars, who thinks that cronyism and self-dealing is a real problem in Trenton, and who thinks a less-regulated marketplace should be allowed to do its magic in areas like auto insurance. 
Yes, he would also like to see less choice when it comes to abortion and more choice in the matter of gun ownership as long -- he hopes people also hear him say -- as he can first build a consensus for those views.
The problem is going to be making sure people hear him.
The Labor Day weekend is here and -- except maybe for Phillies fans who have fanciful visions of playoffs in South Philadelphia -- the voters are supposed to start paying real attention to the selection of their next governor. Two months is plenty of time to play catch-up in New Jersey gubernatorial politics, so long as the space to be made up is not too great. Just think of Christie Whitman, who seemed to be sinking out of sight in the polls in the summer of 1993. 
An informal polling of political thinkers -- with an appropriate margin of error in favor of Mr. Schundler's fellow Republicans -- came up with a few predictions, or at least guesses, about what the young conservative insurgent should do.
First of all, they said Mr. Schundler would have to energize the battle for Trenton among conservatives around the country by reminding them that a victory this fall would open the campaign for control of Congress next year on a strong note.
And a Bushesque come-from-behind victory here would also add credibility to President George W. Bush's claim of a groundswell of conservative Republican support.
The Democrats will scoff, of course, but Democratic scoffing is good for Republican fund-raisers because it gets the donors' dander up. 
Mr. Schundler's fund-raising itinerary, including far-flung ventures to such places as Dallas, Nashville, and Chicago this month, suggests that he is in fact following the strategy of making his fight that of the national party as well.
And then, yes, he will go to television. For all New Jersey politicians except those named Corzine -- who starts in the spring if past experience is a guide -- the fall television push is the big chance for Republicans to redefine themselves and draw horns on opponents.
But Mr. Schundler is probably also working out an endgame for the TV campaign, that last-minute shift in atmospherics that Mrs. Whitman managed so well when she put aside her business attire and put on her famous fuzzy sweater for a stroll before the cameras with her children in tow.
No fuzzy sweaters for Mr. Schundler, please, but he has a good-looking family and they will probably get some face time in front of the camera.
Then, state Republicans would like to see Mr. Schundler wiggle off the hook of being the only issue in the campaign, where Mr. McGreevey, by skillfully and defining and misdefining Mr. Schundler's words and views, has stuck him.
He might be able to do this in two ways:
One, stopping attacking the status quo in New Jersey. Yes, the state operates in an atmosphere of low-grade corruption and mutual back-scratching, but it happens to be, after nearly eight years of Republican control in Trenton, mostly a Republican status quo. Dumping on the old ways of doing things that Mr. Schundler would like to reform only makes it easier for Mr. McGreevey to call for a change in party control.
Two, stop giving Mr. McGreevey a free ride on the issues. Mr. McGreevey says he is for teacher accountability, but he has been endorsed by the teachers union, which loathes the idea. How far would he go to get the bad teachers out of classrooms? 
Mr. McGreevey has also won the support of the state chapter of the Sierra Club by calling for the protection of open space, and the support of unions by calling for economic growth. But sewers, roads and bridges are what many of those union members want keep building And that spells sprawl.
How will he balance those two ideas?
Mr. Schundler's own championing of open space by pushing development to the older urban areas, and his notion of making union teachers compete with charter schools are both valid answers to Mr. McGreevey's positions.
In the next couple months, we'll see if the voters get to hear them.

State Grant Helps Yonkers Upgrade Wiring in Building

BYLINE:  By Elsa Brenner 

 BODY:
The Yonkers Industrial Development Agency has received a $71,500 state grant, which the city will match, to help pay for high-bandwidth telecommunications in the city-owned Nepperhan Valley Technology Center. 
The city bought the building in 1999, and hopes to attract high-tech companies. Some of the space will be used for start-up businesses.
 The vacant four-story building, most recently used by Purdue Pharma for research and development, is a former carpet factory. It is in an industrial area that was once the leading center of carpet manufacturing in the United States. 
 Alfred Weissman Real Estate has leased the building and will develop and market the site. Elsa Brenner

 Your uncle's tales may be worth recalling, now that we are faced with a glut of long-haul fiber optic lines installed by companies eager to cash in on the Internet boom. Something like 100 million miles of these lines were laid in the last two years, and the great bulk of this capacity is unused. 
 For investors who put up the estimated $35 billion to pay for all this, it has been a disaster. Many companies involved are awash in red ink, and bandwidth brokers report plummeting prices for long-distance telecommunications capacity. Even worse, such a presumably gross misallocation of capital is bad for the entire economy; had the money been directed more profitably, output and employment would be higher and everyone would be better off. Now that the economy is weakening, America is starting to look like a high-technology Gulliver, tied down by costly Lilliputian threads of glass.
But was this really such a wholesale misallocation? Will society really suffer for the misguided enthusiasm of fiber optic investors and entrepreneurs? History suggests not. Again and again, investors have gone hog wild over new networking technologies, spent a fortune to install them and found themselves with vast overcapacity and ruinous competition. Yet eventually the capacity was always used, often for purposes never foreseen when it was installed. And in the long run, the economy was the better for it.
"The turbulence in this market is entirely predictable," said Richard R. John, a communications historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He noted that the American telegraph system was unprofitable for its first 15 years, and that in the early 20th century many felt that it had too much capacity, partly because it was built to accommodate huge peak loads during business hours. At first, the telegraph network was not used for what would become a main function: managing the railroad system.
"Almost all of the big-mileage railroads, once you get west of the Missouri, were built in advance of demand," said Maury Klein, a University of Rhode Island historian. Despite serious investor losses, a staggering increase in national wealth would result. "The rail network completely transformed the West," Professor Klein noted. "It created cities where none existed, and businesses where none existed."
Long ago, the railroad historian Julius Grodinsky summed up the process in words that would apply just as well to fiber optic networks today: "The story is typical of a growing industry in its pioneering stage. Competition then and now works itself out in a similar fashion. Some businessmen gain, some lose -- but the public benefits." 
In another example, the parkways of the New York area were built to give city residents a way to reach outlying beaches and state parks. But these roads also abetted the suburban development boom and soon were filled to capacity with commuters.
There are many reasons to believe that the vast new fiber optic network will similarly call forth unforeseen new applications. Adventis, an information industry consulting firm in Boston, predicts an "inferno" of bit-burning applications once high-capacity networks overcome the last-mile bottleneck -- the delay in hooking up a high-speed Internet network to homes or businesses. If that happens, it will not be the first time that communications overcapacity turned into a shortage. When telephone numbers were first allocated, who imagined that we would ever run out? And once upon a time, a million shares was considered enormous volume on the New York Stock Exchange.
And that misallocation of capital? True, the money could do something else as we wait for all that bit-burning. But history shows that this is the American way. Many European postal systems, telegraph lines and railroads were built with government money, and sometimes with insufficient capacity. But in the United States, instead of burdening taxpayers, we sell investors the equivalent of high-priced lottery tickets each time one of these technologies arrives.
The proceeds from these speculations -- the capital paid for stocks and bonds -- may seem misspent. In the long run, the results are called infrastructure, and they are what economies are built on.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Arctic Energy Reshapes A Village

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: INUVIK, Northwest Territories 

 BODY:
IN the Arctic summer construction season, when the midnight sun only flirts with falling below the tundra, workers here are busy building a hospital, a prison, a recreation center, a housing subdivision and an apartment building, complete with an elevator, a rarity north of the Arctic Circle.
 Remote Inuvik, which is as far north of Vancouver as Mexico is south, is suddenly feeling the long reach of North America's growing desire for future supplies of natural gas. Emerging as the logistical hub for natural gas exploration and for future pipeline construction in the Canadian Arctic, Inuvik has long been a town where a lone stoplight regulates traffic in front of a Roman Catholic church shaped like an igloo. 
 In the late summer, as gas exploration rigs float their way here down the Mackenzie River, the town is bracing for big numbers of workers out on the Beaufort Sea this winter, once the ice is thick enough to support the rigs and trailer camps hauled out on skids. 
"Last year, there were over 1,000 jobs out in the delta -- this year may be 2,000," said Peter Clarkson, the mayor of Inuvik, which has 3,300 people, a mix of white settlers and Gwich'in and Inuvialuit natives. "There are more purchases -- vehicles, trucks, Skidoos. We are trying to help people better spend their money, put it into longer-term things, like home mortgages, as against the bars."
Gas was discovered here in the early 1970's. But it is North America's new energy economics that is fueling the latest boom. With about 90 percent of new power plants relying on natural gas, the United States Department of Energy predicts that American gas consumption will grow 45 percent by 2015. Although the number of American drilling rigs roughly doubled over the last 18 months, to 1,050, production grew just 2 percent in the United States in the last year, not enough to keep up with American demand, which is growing 3 percent a year. 
Not only are many American gas fields declining, but many undeveloped drilling areas, including large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico, the Rockies and the Great Lakes, are off limits to production. To meet American demand, the next great producing area is expected to be the Arctic -- with as much as 100 trillion cubic feet in the Prudhoe Bay area of Alaska, about 300 miles west of here, and about 12 trillion cubic feet offshore here, in the Canadian waters of the Beaufort Sea.
This gas, an energy development separate from the debate over producing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, is fueling talk of pipelines. Later this decade, construction of a 3,500-mile pipeline would funnel four billion cubic feet of gas a day from the Western Arctic to Chicago.
"Pipeline to Be the Biggest Private Project Ever in N. America," trumpeted a headline this summer in The National Post of Toronto. The article calculated that the pipeline project, estimated to cost $15 billion to $20 billion, would require twice the annual steel output of Japan, or enough steel to give each inhabitant of the world enough cutlery for six table settings.
A consortium of multinational energy companies with holdings in the two fields are winding up a $75 million study to determine pipeline routes. They expect to issue a report by year-end.
The Northwest Territories favors a 300-mile undersea line from Prudhoe Bay that would run north of the Alaskan wildlife refuge, pick up Canadian gas off Inuvik in the Beaufort Sea, travel through the Inuvik area, then south along the Mackenzie River to Alberta.
Officially neutral, Canada appears to lean toward this route, generally believed to be cheaper for producers. In July, a Canadian government research boat set sail to map the sea floor between here and the Alaskan border. A few days earlier, at the Group of 8 meeting in Genoa, Italy, an open microphone caught Prime Minister Jean Chretien telling President Bush, "One pipeline -- we could save a lot of money."
But Alaska is lobbying fiercely for a route that would parallel the state's existing oil pipeline and road south from Prudhoe Bay, then follow existing roads across the Yukon Territory to Alberta. In May, the governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, whose pipeline slogan is "My Way is the Highway," signed into law a bill that forbids state regulators from allowing an "over the top" route from Prudhoe Bay to Inuvik.
But even though the pipeline fight is far from settled, the money flowing here shows confidence that, one way or another, Canadian Arctic gas will be flowing to North American consumers within a decade.
"Last winter, we had 180 trucks out in rent and that wasn't enough," said Bob Stack, owner of Norcan Leasing, Inuvik's largest vehicle leasing company, where late-model pickups and sport utility vehicles were parked outside the garage.
At the end of the Dempster Highway, the town's supply lifeline to the south, Judi Falsnes, owner of the Arctic Chalet Bed and Breakfast, said, "We have been full for much of the summer -- we have been turning people away."
In a neighborhood near the hospital construction site, Lyle W. Neis, general manager of Inuvik Gas, said that with the influx of new companies, "Inuvik's rental vacancy rate is essentially zero."
On Mackenzie Road, among the polar bear post cards and racks of bug repellent at Inuvik Rexall Drugs, Gene Nikiforuk, the owner, said, "It's nice to have the extra business, but people are getting priced out of homes -- people can't afford to live here."
Mr. Nikiforuk, a pharmacist who has lived here on and off for the last three decades, continued: "Rents in the last year doubled, but the people's salaries haven't."
Mr. Clarkson, the mayor, said that before the boom, a three-bedroom home sold for about $97,000. Now, he added, that same home sells for as much as $130,000. He also said single-bedroom apartments that used to rent for $485 to $520 a month now went for $650 to $780.
WITH a labor shortage, unemployment is drying up and native people are entering job-training programs.
"We are doing our best to make sure people are ready," said Nellie J. Cournoyea, chairwoman of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, a development group. A fervent believer that a pipeline will go through here, she added, "most everyone wants to be involved in the pipeline."
The economic boom is causing a local reversal of North America's dominant trend for populations to gradually shift south.
"Inuvik certainly is booming," Larry Bagnell, the Yukon Territory's lone member of Parliament, said wistfully after a visit here in late July. Referring to his territory's 13 percent unemployment rate, nearly double the national rate, he added, "With our unemployment, Yukoners are going up there to work."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Inuvik, far above the Arctic Circle in the Canadian Northwest Territories, is getting ready for a population influx this winter. The town, above and top, has only about 3,300 people, but gas exploration rigs like the training installation at left could attract 2,000 workers. (Pat Reece); (James Brooke/The New York Times)

When Days Off Are Anything But
Are you relaxing this long Labor Day weekend? If not, you are certainly not alone.
 A new survey suggests that many American workers feel as much stress on their days off as they do on the job -- and that is partly because they are just as busy. 
 Sixty-two percent of workers say they have plenty of chores and personal obligations to tend to in their off hours, making their leisure time less relaxing and enjoyable. Forty-three percent said they spent some of their free time either on call for their offices or dealing with work issues. 
"Stress is an issue of failed leisure time more than just a workplace issue," said Thomas Riehle, president for public affairs at Ipsos-Reid, a market research firm based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that conducted the study last weekend. "Americans need to find a way to make leisure time work for them in order to reduce stress." 
The survey questioned 1,000 adults, 626 of them employed, throughout the United States; the results were released last week. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
While many working Americans may be feeling stressed, they are not feeling unfulfilled. Eight-eight percent of the workers surveyed said they were satisfied with their jobs. Only 26 percent said they were seriously considering changing jobs in the next year.
"Job satisfaction remains high because work is important to Americans," Mr. Riehle said, "and if they are dissatisfied with their jobs, they tend to do something about it rather than remain dissatisfied." 

A Downturn With a Difference
Responding to the economic slowdown, American companies said they planned to cut nearly 780,000 jobs during the first half of this year, more than three times the number in the same period last year. That is pretty scary news, yet few workers appear to be seriously concerned, according to the Council of Public Relations Firms.
Last week, the council conducted a survey of 1,013 employees nationwide and found that 72 percent of them were "not at all worried" about being laid off in this weak economy. Fourteen percent were "slightly worried," 7 percent "moderately worried" and only 5 percent "extremely worried."
 Why are they still so upbeat?
"This downturn is different," said Jack Bergen, president of the trade group. 
"Despite the layoffs and other negative economic indicators, today's workers have more confidence in their ability to move forward and find another job," Mr. Bergen said. "With high job mobility becoming an integral part of the workplace during the past decade, much of the uncertainty and fear of job changes associated with previous downturns has disappeared." 
Still, workers are not always satisfied that employers are completely honest with them when it comes to the financial conditions of their companies. Fifty-four percent of those surveyed said most companies that downsize fail to communicate clearly to the surviving employees both the need for the layoffs and the outlook for the company. Only 37 percent said their own companies' communications with them were always open and honest. 

Lunch With a View of the Office
For many corporate executives, "let's do lunch" these days may mean inviting guests to pull up an office chair and share a tuna sandwich.
As layoffs have increased, so have workloads, which means that the average American executive is often too busy to venture out for lunch.
 "They may be feeling the pressure to use every bit of time they can squeeze out of a day to meet the demand," said Allen Salikof, president of Management Recruiters International of Cleveland, which last week released the results of a recent poll of more than 4,500 executives.
It found that 68 percent eat lunch at their desks at least once a week, 34 percent at least three times a week and 10 percent every day.

HEADLINE: From a Bull and a Bear, Conflicting Forecasts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
YOU'VE heard their arguments. Whose advice -- Robert J. Shiller's or Jeremy J. Siegel's -- should you follow?
 Over the last decade, Mr. Siegel would have given investors a better return. 
 In his book, Mr. Siegel urged people to buy a broad mix of stocks, and the total market has more than doubled in value since its publication in 1994. Then, in 1999, with the Nasdaq composite index near 2,500, he presciently cautioned that many technology stocks were overvalued. He repeated the warning about a year later, after the Nasdaq index had almost doubled again and only days before it began to plummet to its current level below 2,000.
Mr. Shiller's record is more mixed. Through much of the late 90's, even as stocks continued to rise, he cautioned that their values had little basis in reality. The decline in the market since March 2000, just as his bearish book was published, has made his analysis look much better.
And what next? What do the two seers say now?
During a two-hour lunchtime discussion, both Mr. Shiller and Mr. Siegel said repeatedly that they did not like to make specific forecasts. "No one can predict the market, short run," Mr. Siegel said.
But they did offer a general framework for investors to follow. 
For those with a long time horizon -- say, 10 years or more -- Mr. Siegel's attitude has not changed much. Buy a broad mix of mutual funds with the lowest possible costs, he said. Put up to one-quarter of your holdings into funds that invest in overseas markets, including some in stable European companies. Also, invest about one-quarter of the portfolio in a fund that picks small to midsize American companies.
Some stocks -- particularly those of technology companies -- may be overvalued, Mr. Siegel said, but investors who do not need their money anytime soon are better off not trying to make many distinctions.
Almost two years ago, he sold most of his technology-heavy mutual funds. He still keeps almost all of his retirement money in stocks; his largest investment is in funds that try to match the entire United States market.
In addition to his professor's salary, Mr. Siegel makes significant money giving about 75 speeches a year to investment groups.
Mr. Shiller said stocks remained so expensive that they were likely to stay near current levels for years, much as the Dow Jones industrial average had the same value in late 1982 as it had in early 1966. "You don't have to bother with stocks at all for a while," he said. For people who cannot stand to be out of the stock market, value stocks -- those with low price-to-earnings ratios -- look most appealing.
Mr. Shiller has owned little stock since 1998. Instead, he has bought funds that invest in real estate and bonds. He is also co-owner of a company called Case Shiller Weiss Inc., which collects real estate data.
For investors who have little experience, Mr. Shiller suggests calling a Treasury Department phone number that he has memorized -- 1-877-811-SAVE -- and buying bonds that pay about 3 percent a year, on top of inflation. It is "entirely plausible," he added, that after inflation is taken into account, the Dow will be worth less in 2011 than it is today.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Getting A Kick Out of The Euro

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WITH the dollar falling against the euro and American stocks still highly valued, Richard C. Pell, the co-manager of the $500 million Julius Baer International Equity fund, says American investors should be looking abroad, especially in Europe, including Eastern Europe.
 Mr. Pell took time last week to share his views. Here are excerpts. 

Q. Should people be more interested in international stocks now than they were in 1998, 1999 and even in 2000?

A. Well, I think you always have to start with the U.S. equity market. And there are times when it may be a good buy and there are times when it may be a poor buy. And right now, despite the sharp decline in stock prices in the U.S. since March of 2000, we still view the S.& P. 500 as quite highly valued. At a current level of around 1,150, we feel it is priced to return little more than Treasury bonds in the future.
We believe there are two implications of current S.& P. pricing. First, investors should probably hold more bonds and assets with a predictable rate of return than they normally would. Secondly, we believe you want to own equities of all kinds to be broadly diversified. But we think it is a particularly good time to diversify geographically into some of the foreign equity markets that have lagged the big rise in the U.S. As we look outside the United States, we view Europe as a much lower risk proposition than Japan, the other Asian countries or Latin America. Within the emerging markets, we have a particular interest in Eastern Europe.

Q. You said you expected limited returns on the S.& P. 500. Is that true of international stocks?

A. It is quite probable that nominal returns may be lower in the European market than they have been in the past, because those markets as well have enjoyed particularly strong appreciation.
Having said that, I think that Europe has a couple of advantages. First, markets aren't quite as highly priced. Secondly, we believe that U.S.-dollar-based investors in Europe are likely to get a currency kicker over the years to come.

Q. Where are you investing in Eastern Europe?

A. We are talking chiefly about the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. It is a play on the economic integration of Europe and the possibility of these countries joining the European Union. If there is continued progress toward economic integration, interest rates will fall in these countries, pushing stocks higher. The potential return from the banks in Eastern Europe is somewhere between 500 and 1,000 percent. Having said that, it is not a low-risk investment.

Q. What are some of the banks?

A. One of them is Bank Pekao in Poland. Another large position of ours is Ceska Sporitelna in the Czech Republic. The third name is OTP Bank in Hungary.

Q. Can a retail investor buy these stocks?

A. In some cases, like Poland, you have to register with the local authorities to buy the shares. So we find a mutual fund is the easiest way for investors to participate.

Q. What do you like in developed countries?

A. A couple of things. First, we have about 5.6 percent of our fund invested in German insurance companies, chiefly in Allianz and Munich Re. We think these companies are potential beneficiaries of three major reforms in Germany. First, pension reform; second, tax law reforms; and third, eventually, we expect the development of a takeover code in Germany.

Q. Where else are you putting your money?

A. Another sector we quite like for defensive reasons is the energy sector. We have about 8.4 percent of our fund invested in energy stocks. One of our larger positions is TotalFinaElf. This is probably one of the best upstream oil companies in the world. And it also has an interesting hedge built into the company because they have a memorandum of understanding with the Iraqi government that they can develop two major oil fields in Iraq that potentially could produce about a million barrels a day of oil. That is equivalent to 50 percent of Total's current production. A second oil company we quite like is ENI of Italy. ENI is about 2 percent of our fund. Both Total and ENI are available as American depository receipts.

Q. Do you like any other sector?

A. Right now, we have a somewhat negative view on global economic activity. So we have about 14 percent of the fund invested in sectors I guess we would call hiding places, consumer staples -- like beverage companies, foods and some of the drug companies -- and also utilities.
Another company we find kind of interesting is Vinci in France. It has a substantial concessions business. So basically what they do is design, build and operate things like motorways, bridges, tunnels, airports, car parks -- and they have contracts for operating some of the projects reaching anywhere from about 15 to 80 years.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Lincoln Blackwood; 
Viva Las Vegas: A Pickup for Elvis

BYLINE:  By DAN NEIL 

 BODY:
WHAT to call the Blackwood, Lincoln's lavish something spun off from the corpulent Lincoln Navigator and the Ford F-150 SuperCrew? Is it a luxury pickup truck, a sport utility sedan or -- as the company's marketing department would have it -- a "luxury utility vehicle"? The latter would make it an L.U.V., which is positively precious.
 The Blackwood is like an automotive Rorschach test; what you call it depends on what you see in it. Given its funereal color scheme, I like to think of it as a hearse for the diminutive departed, though I know this is a minority view. 
 By any name it is the front two-thirds of a Navigator S.U.V. attached to a short-bed cargo "trunk," a carpeted 56-inch-long compartment with brushed aluminum walls and L.E.D. light bars that might have been pried out of somebody's prom limo. The cargo box is topped by a tonneau that, with some clever hinges and cams, opens and closes like a clamshell to signals from the remote key fob. The tonneau's styling includes the
crosshair badge and center ridge familiar from the hoods of other Lincolns, and this has the unfortunate effect of blurring the distinction between coming and going.
The Blackwood is ever blurring distinctions. Lincoln calls the truck's genre-bending an example of outside-the-box thinking. If only that were so. Rather, the Blackwood represents chapter-and-verse orthodoxy in Detroit, which has brought out many variations on light-duty truck platforms -- king cab, crew cab, quad cab, everything but Checker cab -- representing minimum engineering for maximum profit. You want to talk mileage? How much has Ford gotten out of the F-Series underpinnings, which in addition to the truck multitudes have seen service under the hugely successful Expedition, then the Navigator and now the Blackwood?
General Motors will soon weigh in with a luxury truck of its own, the Cadillac Escalade EXT, which will likewise share platform components with Chevy and GMC light-duty trucks, as well as with the Tahoe, Suburban and Avalanche.
Not that there is anything wrong with profit. Nor is there anything sacred about the morphologies of a pickup truck versus sport utility. But in the Blackwood's case, something has been lost in the translation: the utility. The Blackwood arrives without four-wheel-drive, a cornerstone of an S.U.V.'s appeal, never mind that buyers may not use it. The rear-drive Blackwood's sleek lines are untroubled by high-profile tires and the wheel-well clearances necessary with four-wheel drive. (The Blackwood is shod with 18-inch Michelins wrapped around lovely seven-spoke alloy wheels.)
Also, the cargo trunk is well nigh unusable. Its beautiful anodized brushed-aluminum bulkheads would be threatened by shifting cargo -- an unrestrained bag of Ping Zing golf clubs would make a mess in there -- and the tonneau cuts off capacity at a mere 27 cubic feet. My wife couldn't put a wicker patio chair in the back, so we had to cram it into the passenger compartment.
Another annoyance: Let's say a can of soup falls out of the grocery bag and rolls forward. You have to go spelunking deep into the hold to retrieve it (and hope the neighbors don't spot you with canned soup).
Finally, every glittering surface of the Blackwood, from the mirror-polished door handles and chrome-plated fuel filler door to the simulated African wenge wood trim, picks up fingerprints like the sneeze guard at Sizzler. Those integrated storage compartments in the boot? That's where you can keep the Windex.
As evidence of utility aplenty, Lincoln might indignantly point to the Blackwood's 8,700-pound towing capacity, its rear air springs, its load-leveling suspension and its Class III/IV trailer hitch. Well, I've been shopping for a good-tasting hat lately, and I'll eat it if it turns out that more than a few of the 10,000 Blackwood buyers actually use the truck for towing. The whole construction is too delicate -- in Shakespeare's happy phrase, "beauty too rich for use."
The rear gate, for instance, comprises two swing-out doors of lightweight composite. If you fail to close them in the right order (left-right) the latch mechanism could bash the door with expensive consequences.
So we have here a pickup that won't pick up. Reasonable people might ask, "Who cares?" After all, for years Americans have been buying more truck than they could possibly use. And the pickup has proved to be an exceptionally elastic concept, including everything from street-hugging low-riders to open-deck Humvees. Every summer weekend, Nascar runs racecars shaped like pickups in the Craftsman Truck Series, and the National Hot Rod Association drag-races trucks. You don't need to be Roland Barthes (or Emerson or Thoreau, for that matter) to see the pickup as a vessel into which Americans pour their cherished notions of self, individualism and independence.
But all these other iterations of the pickup actually do something. This is a truck so perverted by style and luxury that it cannot even carry the occasional lawn mower or sheet of plywood.
But can Lincoln really be held accountable? The company says its mission is to build "American luxury," and isn't the Blackwood that, in spades? In the democratic logic of a market economy, the public gets the products it deserves.
Such theoretical concerns may seem far afield from issues of horsepower (300 from a 5.4-liter V-8) and torque (355 foot-pounds at 2,750 r.p.m.) and are unlikely to trouble potential buyers, who know a cool-looking truck when they see one.
The Blackwood -- all mirror chrome, glossy paint, smoked glass and prismatic lenses -- is gorgeous, in the way that Las Vegas honeymoon suites and Elvis's jumpsuits are gorgeous. I especially like the widely spaced type that spells the name across the rear gate doors.
Even the simulated wenge wood wrapped around the cargo hold is attractive, considering that it is actually a photographic reproduction printed on adhesive laminate.
The real wenge winds up inside the Blackwood, and here Lincoln pulled out all the stops. Black on black on really black, the interior has four generous bucket seats trimmed in luscious Connolly leather, the front seats "climate controlled," with integrated heating and cooling. To have the air-conditioner blowing full blast on one's nether regions is a peculiar sensation, to say the least. You think cell phones are distracting?
The cockpit is loaded with high-end gear, much of it borrowed from the Navigator: a 140-watt Alpine stereo with in-dash CD changer and seven speakers, an optional voice-activated navigation system with superb graphics and ease of use, memory settings that recall each driver's favored settings for the seat, the mirrors and even the adjustable pedals. Other amenities include a moonroof, parking proximity alarm, overhead console and approach lights. The whole package is wrapped in an inky elegance that fits well. The assembly quality of the Blackwood is first-rate.
All this luxury raises the tonnage. The Blackwood weighs a porky 5,700 pounds, and you feel every ounce when you throw this thing into a corner. The suspension struggles to contain the shifting momentum, then gives up and goes home. The Blackwood's wallowing body roll and torpid reflexes (speed-sensitive power steering of the recirculating-ball design) mock Lincoln's assertions of sporty handling.
Acceleration from zero to 60 m.p.h. takes a little more than 8 seconds, which is pretty crisp, all things considered. But the fuel economy (12 m.p.g. city, 17 highway) is troubling, and even with four-wheel antilock disc brakes, the Blackwood decelerates like a coal train.
In short, if you liked the thrift and agility of the Navigator, you will love the Blackwood.
At $52,500 ($54,495 with the navigation system), this disingenuous pickup is genuinely expensive. When it appeared as a design study at auto shows a couple of years ago -- a time when high-tech speculators were pie-eyed with profits, and the business cycle seemed to have been repealed -- the Blackwood seemed the perfect fire extinguisher for those with money burning holes in their pockets. But a lot has happened since, and conspicuous decadence is wearing a little thin. Looking slightly absurd, Lincoln's truck arrives in black tie and tails just as the confetti is being swept up.

INSIDE TRACK: Irrational exuberance.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An automobile review of the Lincoln Blackwood on Sunday misstated the type of wood trim in the interior and the type of material that lines the cargo trunk. The interior is dark-stained oak, not African wenge; the trunk is stainless steel, not aluminum. The review also referred incorrectly to the operation of Lincoln's navigation system. Although it provides audible directions, it is not voice-activated.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The Blackwood is essentially a Lincoln Navigator with simulated wenge wood trim and a short, carpeted pickup bed with brushed aluminum sides. A navigation system lifts the price to $54,495.

HEADLINE: Meet Me at the Boutique (You Can Dust While You Wait) 

BYLINE:  By HEIDI SHERMAN 

 BODY:
LAST Thursday, after returning from a business trip that took me to Boston and back by 3 p.m., I didn't go to the office. I played hooky instead, and spent the afternoon at Hadu, my favorite dress shop in NoLIta. I didn't browse through the culottes and halter dresses. I walked straight to the rear room, threw back a couple of tuna fish sandwiches, ate about a pound of pretzels and went to work. Reorganizing the sale rack. Cleaning up the dressing room. And -- though I have no more design experience than any other New Yorker with an anthropology degree -- cutting pink leather swatches for a dress sample. I was acting as if I owned the place, even though I don't. It belongs to my friend Amy McCracken, a designer. And she doesn't pay me for my work. 
 I come often to this little store on Mulberry Street to offer my help. A bunch of my friends do, too. For our little group, this clothing boutique is a home away from home, and its 1,000 square feet a kind of family room. Hadu is where we hang out on a slow afternoon, meet before going to dinner, escape our roommates. If we were the cast of a television show it would be "Underemployed Friends" and Hadu would be our Central Perk. Besides Amy, the main characters are: Mark, a former immigration lawyer turned humor writer; Anne, an early casualty of the defunct Industry Standard magazine, who fills her days painting and writing; Dylan, a quiet, brooding independent film distributor; Oliver, a botanist from Nebraska with plans to open his own bar; and me, a travel magazine editor still doing the 9 to 5. Rather than sip lattes while bemoaning the state of singleness in New York the way they do on TV, we hang up tube dresses or reaccessorize the mannequins. 
 Most of us have been friends for about 10 years, having migrated from the University of California at Los Angeles to New York only to become victims of the economic slowdown. We've been downsized or fired, or simply grew bored and bewildered and quit our jobs to change course. We have law degrees and master's degrees, but none of us -- save Amy, with her design degree -- are using them. Someday we might. In the meantime, this unexpected pit stop on our career paths has proved surprisingly gratifying. The global economy may not need us. But Hadu does. 
It all began late last year, when Amy's lease for her dream boutique came through just as a loan to finance it fell apart. When it seemed she would have to abandon her plan, she put out an all-points bulletin to friends asking for help. Anne and Oliver invested money, and the rest of us donated time and muscle.
Amy hired a Brooklyn architect, also a friend, to help design the shop, but to keep costs down she asked us to gut and renovate the windowless ground-floor space she had leased for $3,700 a month. In the urban equivalent of an Amish barn-raising, we rolled up the sleeves on our turtlenecks and went to work.
On a Wednesday in the dreary depths of February, in an almost pagan rite of destruction, the six of us assembled to tear up the floors and hack down the walls of the dank space. Oliver, the only one with his own toolbox, served as foreman. We whacked away at ceiling beams with axes, blunt instruments I couldn't name and our bare hands. There was no heat, but Mark supplied a few cases of our favorite cheap red wine, Gato Negro, to keep us warm and in good cheer. Which may explain why we laughed when a dead rat landed on Amy's head.
We worked until after midnight and returned before dawn to clear away the evidence. In bucket-brigade formation, we passed bricks, cement blocks, slats of wood and bags overflowing with debris out the door and into a Dumpster. Though covered in dust, Anne inspired catcalls from the construction workers down the street (maybe because of the purple thong underwear peaking out from her jeans). Mark, not a fan of manual labor, complained of imminent frostbite. I griped about a hangover. We raced against the clock. We had just three hours to fill the massive bin, which was to be hauled away before 9 a.m., when, our neighbors warned us, the traffic police would make their rounds and discover our Dumpster in violation of parking, zoning and construction laws.
"I knew you were friends for life when you all woke up at dawn to shovel up the piles of tile and concrete," Amy said recently. "I didn't think most of you could wake up before noon unless there was a fire."
Oddly enough, we weren't exhausted from the hours of heavy lifting, but ready for more. We offered to come back the following week to help lay down floorboards and install a storefront window. In two months of work that felt more like play, we transformed that musty space into a sun-drenched store worthy of our friend's colorful designs.
As the store-opening deadline in May approached, we were all as nervous as Amy. To prepare for the debut-night party, she called us down to Hadu (named after her mother's real-life fairy godmother) early to explain the cash register, how to work the credit card machine and how to buzz people in the front door. We each had a task: Mark would man the bar; Anne would be in charge of finding sizes that weren't on the racks; Dylan, the most detached, would hand people pens to sign the guest book; my job was to work the register.
Nobody got paid for spending a Thursday evening helping a customer into an orange Empire-waist dress or sweeping up cups after the browsers had left. Instead, in exchange for our roles in this urban-family business, we'd get our own village center.
On summer Fridays, I can pretty much count on seeing Hadu's Ultrasuede couch and shag carpet warmed by the bodies of my old college friends, along with neighborhood regulars we've come to know. "Yesterday, eight people stopped by," Amy said the other day with mock horror. "Sometimes I have to remind all you guys that, yes, I do work here." After a long afternoon of pitching in while socializing at the shop, we pseudo-employees go home as achy and tired as if we worked there, too. Family, they say, is exhausting.
Now our little group is branching out. Oliver is designing a new bar on Broome and Forsyth Streets. Amy will design the waiters' outfits, and the rest of us will be scrubbing toilets, painting walls and pulling up stained carpets. In return, we'll get drink tickets and a port of call down the road from our living room.
At Hadu, we're all partners of a sort. For Amy, the up side of having a staff of friends is that like real family, we provide consolation when things get rough.
When neighboring NoLIta shops dropped their prices to make room for the fall season just one month after Hadu's opening, we convinced Amy to drop her prices, too, assuring her that she would still make money. And when the blue silk dress design came back from the production house with the bust disproportionately big, we girls served as new fit models so that Amy could resize the cups by hand.
Of course, sometimes, like family, we get in the way -- like the time Anne borrowed a dress from Hadu's spring collection and returned it two sizes smaller (the dry cleaner shrank it -- it's now mine); or the time one friend, who shall remain nameless, dusted the pricey bolts of pink leather with pretzel salt. But as Amy sees it, there's only one real drawback. "You guys have no problem giving me your honest opinions," she says, "and there's no shortage of them."
Yeah, I advised her to scrap the culottes she was doing for her summer line. The ones she sold so fast she couldn't keep them on the racks. Hey, what do I know, I just work here.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Take Away the Window Dressing, and Who Will Buy?

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WITH the global economy in a stall, corporate spending at a standstill and layoffs threatening to subvert consumer spending, it is no surprise that the United States stock market is feeling overwhelmed.
 But something else is weighing on stocks. That is the creeping realization among investors that the momentous earnings reported by many companies in recent years may have been digitally remastered to include a lot of hype, embroidery and fluff. 
 This is significant. Investors coming around to this view will be less inclined to trust forecasts that company executives make. Having lost faith in a company's numbers, investors will be unable to place a fair value on its stock. In the dark on valuations, many investors will shun the shares. 
An extreme reaction? Not at all. It is precisely the payback that companies deserve for embellishing their earnings. 
The quality of corporate earnings seemed a quaint concern when stocks were racing. Now, reality in company earnings is crucial. But separating reality from fantasy in corporate earnings is harder than ever. Consider the gulf between estimates of second-quarter earnings from First Call and Standard & Poor's. While First Call said operating earnings among companies in the S.& P. 500 had fallen by 17 percent from the same period last year, S. & P. reckoned that the decline at those companies was 33 percent in the quarter. 
Because companies have much leeway in what they report as operating earnings, perhaps the best way to assess the true state of earnings is to consult government figures.
While the average annual earnings growth reported by companies in the S.& P. 500 came in at around 9 percent from 1995 to 2000, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis says corporate after-tax profits grew only 5 percent annually. 
A report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a brokerage firm, supports the government's figures. The report says the 9 percent average annual earnings growth at S.& P. companies in the late 1990's was really only 5 percent if one cancels out favorable accounting for stock options and earnings boosts that companies took from stock gains in pension plans. 
Had companies deducted the cost of options from revenue, which they need not do, annual S.& P. profit growth from 1995 to 2000 would drop to 6 percent from 9 percent, the report said. Subtract fat gains from shares held in pensions, and earnings growth falls by another percentage point. 
Another stellar aspect of the technology marvel dims under the gaze of Steve Galbraith, United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He says that at many tech companies, profitability per employee grew at astounding rates in the late 1990's but is now crashing. Per-worker profits at semiconductor companies, for example, are expected to fall 77 percent this year.
This proves not only that technology is cyclical, but also that profit gains were largely a result of easy money, not of intellectual capital. "If this was somehow an intellectual-capital-driven business, there is no way you would have had this kind of degradation in profit per employee," Mr. Galbraith said. "Capital was free and they all spent it into this area."
Advances in technology were thought to have wrought a profitability miracle in the late 1990's. Now it seems the miracle was a result of a roaring stock market and accommodating capital markets. 
Experienced investors know not to confuse brilliance with a bull market. The new era version of that rule: Don't confuse profits with a bull market, either.

HEADLINE: Buy! Sell! Have a Beer! Dueling Gurus (and Pals) 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: OCEAN CITY, N.J. 

 BODY:
BOB arrived with the cold cuts. Jeremy found a chair at the lunch table that allowed him a view of both the Atlantic Ocean and the television set, tuned to CNBC. Their wives, Virginia and Ellen, sat down near them. Their teenage boys, between hanging out on the deck and going parasailing, briefly joined the adults at the table for sandwiches.
 To anyone who did not know the public personas of the two fathers, it would have looked like a perfectly typical summer afternoon at the Jersey shore. In fact, it was a gathering of the yin and yang of Wall Street. 
 Bob is Robert J. Shiller, the author of "Irrational Exuberance," the book that came out just before the Nasdaq plunge of 2000 and made him perhaps the most prominent bearish economist in the country. And Jeremy is Jeremy J. Siegel, the professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania whose bullish 1994 book, "Stocks for the Long Run," became both a cause and a symbol of the vastly increased popularity of the stock market. 
The two have become intellectual combatants, offering conflicting advice to Alan Greenspan and making frequent television appearances. Several magazines have portrayed them as dueling wise men, with Mr. Shiller saying the stock market is facing years of little if any growth and Mr. Siegel arguing that it remains the best investment around. One recent article went so far as to pose the question directly: Who is correct, Mr. Shiller or Mr. Siegel?
But behind all the apparent disagreement is a 34-year-old friendship that both men say has been the driving force for their most important work. In an academic world that rewards specialization above all else, they have pushed each other to make connections between the abstract theories of their field and the real-life events of their society.
"We become devil's advocates of each other," Mr. Siegel said.
Mr. Shiller added: "Nothing is independent between us."
The two men, both 55 and from the Midwest, met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967, when the alphabetical proximity of their names left them standing next to each other in line, awaiting a mandatory X-ray for all incoming graduate students. While at M.I.T., they spent hours together in libraries, apartments and delis, discussing girlfriends, the Vietnam War and the mathematical proof showing that there is no highest prime number. 
After each married, they took family vacations together, first in the Poconos and later here, on the edge of the broad white beaches of southern New Jersey. Their families grew close: Ginny Shiller is a clinical psychologist, while Ellen Schwartz, Mr. Siegel's wife, is a speech pathologist, and each couple has two boys between the ages of 14 and 21.
On a recent Thursday afternoon -- with perfect weather beckoning -- the economists sat down for a two-hour lunch at the beachfront house that the Siegels had rented and the Shillers were visiting.
The economists had spent the morning walking on the beach and talking about the lengths to which companies have gone to inflate their reported profits. At lunch, the two discussed their past and debated the economy's future, finding common ground but also sometimes interrupting each other to score a point.
MR. SIEGEL says the stock market has been undervalued for almost two centuries, that stocks deserve higher price-to-earnings ratios than they have had historically, because many people now understand their benefits and because the economy is less volatile than it once was. 
Mr. Shiller, though, thinks market declines like that of the last week will be common in coming years. He sees Mr. Siegel's arguments as similar to ones that have always been offered during speculative bubbles, like those in the 1920's and the 1960's. He says that there is no guarantee that the United States and its companies will be as successful in coming years as they were in the past. 
Their personalities match their outlooks. Mr. Siegel tends toward the gregarious -- a trim man who speaks quickly and often mentions the teaching awards he has won at Wharton. He keeps an almost constant watch on the market (and left CNBC on in the background for the entire lunch). A few nights before, when the families drove to Atlantic City, he happily took a seat at a $10 blackjack table and won about $60.
Mr. Shiller, a Yale professor who looks a decade younger than he is, will sometimes interrupt himself to offer a caveat to one of his own ideas. Rather than watching stock tickers, he will sometimes open an encyclopedia and start reading, according to his son Ben, 19. The man who worries about irrational exuberance does not gamble.
"Shiller is very earnest," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel winner who taught him at M.I.T. "He is almost -- and I don't say this in a pejorative way at all -- like a hayseed boy off a farm with a straw in his mouth. He's a long-jawed, serious fellow."
Still, the long run-up in the stock market during the 1990's has caused the two friends to agree more often than their public images -- Shiller the bear, Siegel the bull -- would suggest. Both think that technology stocks remain generally overvalued, despite the sharp declines of the last 18 months. Both believe that Wall Street prognosticators like Abby Joseph Cohen are too optimistic about the short-term future. Both think that most investors need to lower their long-term expectations. But both say that for people with the longest horizons -- say, 25 years or more -- the stock market is a smart investment. 
The biggest area of common ground, however, is in their thoughts about escaping the sometimes narrow confines of academia. "When you're in an economics program, you can easily get the impression that people are just trying to prove that they're smart," Mr. Shiller said. "They're not interested in writing something that's general or descriptive."
Mr. Siegel added, "We'll take from theory what we think is relevant, and we try to think of the big picture."
It was on one of their vacations, in the Poconos in 1990, that Mr. Shiller first urged Mr. Siegel to turn his research on the long-term advantages of stocks into a book. "What Jeremy was presenting, it might sound to academics as too broad," Mr. Shiller said. "But I was saying there's another kind of writing.
"You don't have to live up to some straitjacket," he added.
The book, "Stocks for the Long Run" (McGraw-Hill), first appeared when the Dow Jones industrial average was below 4,000. (It closed on Friday at 9,949.75.) Mr. Siegel elegantly summarized his thesis with a simple chart showing the long-term returns of stocks, bonds and gold. The Washington Post called the book one of the 10 best investment books of all time.
Nine years after that conversation in the Poconos, during a phone call from their offices, Mr. Siegel told Mr. Shiller to drop his plan for an updated collection of academic essays and to write instead about investment bubbles for a larger audience. Immediately after hanging up, Mr. Shiller began working on the book that became "Irrational Exuberance" (Princeton University Press), which was published in March, 2000.
When it hit bookstores -- with the Dow around 11,000 and the Nasdaq composite index near 5,000 -- Business Week said it was "by far the most important about the stock market since Jeremy J. Siegel's 1994 'Stocks for the Long Run.' "
THE bull grew up in Highland Park, Ill., just north of Chicago, the son and grandson of presidents of a family lumber company. For as long he can remember, Mr. Siegel loved numbers and tall buildings. So after being accepted at Columbia and Yale, he chose Columbia ("Isn't that shocking?" he asked, teasing the Yale professor sitting across from him) and moved to New York to study math and to be near high-rises.
The big city also allowed him to be close to something else that had captured his imagination: the stock market. "Friday afternoons, my classes ended early, and I would take the subway all the way down to Wall Street, and I would go visit and see the close of the New York Stock Exchange," he said. 
"There was no wait, you could go right into the visitors' gallery," he added, "There was no glass up, the way it is now."
"You could really kind of get much closer to the action," he said. "It gave me a thrill. I'd just do it by myself."
Mr. Shiller, smiling, interrupted: "Almost like going to church, right?"
"Yeah, it was," Mr. Siegel said. "I didn't say any prayers while I was there, but I was in New York, which was the financial capital of the world."
"It was all there," he added.
All, except for courses that inspired him. By his sophomore year, his math classes had become so abstract that they seemed to have little connection to the bustling world around him. The next year, he enrolled in his first economics class.
"At the end of the third week, I knew I loved that subject," he said. "From that point on, I knew I wanted to be an economics professor."
Mr. Shiller, befitting his more cautious personality, found his process of discovery considerably more painful. He had grown up in a suburb of Detroit, where his father was a mechanical engineer. When the time came to pick an undergraduate major at the University of Michigan, he found himself tortured by the idea of choosing a career. On the one hand, he knew he should pick one path and follow it, so as not to waste effort. On the other hand, there were so many possibilities.
"It was very hard -- as a young person, it's dazzling to think about all the different things you could do," he said. "There are a million different occupations. You can only do one thing in life, you have only one career, and you'll never know" whether you made the right choice.
To make the decision among economics, science, journalism and law, he would leave his dormitory room and take long walks around Ann Arbor. "And then my foot started to hurt and so I went to a doctor and he said, 'This is the kind of injury we see in soldiers on forced marches.' "
Ultimately, Mr. Shiller chose economics, he said, because he thought it would allow him to work on the important problems of society, like poverty and starvation. "This is where I snapped finally," he said.
Mr. Siegel added: "It's a very different course than I took."
Their courses intersected in Cambridge, Mass., in the late summer of 1967. They had enrolled in graduate school immediately after college, in part to avoid becoming eligible for the Vietnam War draft. Before students could begin attending classes, they needed chest X-rays to confirm that they were free of tuberculosis, and they lined up in alphabetical order for the procedure.
Bored, Mr. Siegel turned to the student next to him: "I said, 'Well, where are you from, and what are you in?' " Michigan and economics, came the reply. "And we started chatting a little bit, and, I don't know, we kind of liked each other right away."
THEY spent much of their time with Theodore E. Keeler, a classmate who now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley. After evenings of studying, the three would hop on Boston's trolley-and-subway system to get late-night meals of sandwiches, hot dogs, cheesecake and hot fudge sundaes at delis in Cambridge or Brookline. "It was a reward after a long day's work," Mr. Keeler said. "And we certainly had a metabolism then that could handle all of that."
At the time, M.I.T. was arguably the most exciting place to study economics in the United States. In a typical year, Mr. Samuelson recalled, more than half of the 20 students who received National Science Foundation fellowships to study economics might enroll at M.I.T. Stanley Fischer, now the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, and Robert Merton, another Nobel winner, were among Mr. Shiller's and Mr. Siegel's fellow students. 
But the two held their own, Mr. Samuelson said. "They were unusually good graduate students in a vintage crop of graduate students at M.I.T.," he said.
By and large, they were also typical graduate students. When they were not studying, their idea of fun often involved intellectual gymnastics that would cause many people to roll their eyes. Mr. Shiller and Mr. Keeler would quiz Mr. Siegel, supplying him with a ticker symbol and allowing him to show off his vast knowledge of the stock market by naming the company. Or they would consider the puzzle of why the shortest day of the year did not have the earliest sunset.
But no matter how obscure the theory in their seminars became -- and even 30 years ago, economic theory could become very obscure -- they tried to connect what they were studying to the society around them. "That's what attracted me to Jeremy," Mr. Shiller said. "He had this tremendous knowledge of the real world. And we'd be sitting there in lectures learning about how homohypalligic production runs, and then we'd come back and we would look at data."
In many ways, Mr. Shiller and Mr. Siegel are part of the academic establishment. Both have tenure in the Ivy League and have published many theoretical papers in respected journals. But they also worry that their field can sometimes become too narrow, particularly when it tries to achieve the certainties of physics or chemistry.
"In academic seminars, the guy runs a T-test," Mr. Shiller said, referring to a common statistical technique. "And then someone says, 'Well, but you don't know that the observations are independent, so how do you know that's a valid test?'
"And the seminar leader responds, 'Well, I'm using the so-and-so XZ-test.' And now that stops the seminar. No one knows this test.
"You snow the guy, and you move on," Mr. Shiller added.
After a few more minutes of such jokes, the careful Mr. Shiller caught himself. "Let's not make so much fun of statistics," he said. "I'm not saying it always happens. It sometimes happens."
As the years passed, the friends' very similar approaches to economics have led them to very different conclusions. 
When the first edition of Mr. Siegel's book appeared, in 1994, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hovered below 500, and the two men shared a general view about the market: Over history, investors had generally worried too much about stocks' riskiness, depressing their values. But those people willing to buy and hold equities had reaped a high return as a result.
FOR many years, Mr. Siegel had even convinced Mr. Shiller to hold almost 100 percent of his investments in stock.
"Stocks have been chronically undervalued assets," Mr. Siegel said.
Then came the end-of-century bull market. The S.& P. 500 more than tripled between 1994 and 2000, and following the market became a national pastime. Many more people became convinced that stocks were the best investment for the long run. They became the safe bet, not the risky one, and their newly high price-to-earnings ratios -- in the 20's and 30's, not the single digits and teens -- reflected their popularity.
That raised the question at the heart of the fundamental disagreement between the two economists: Have stocks become so expensive that they will no longer offer a good return over the next decade or so? In other words, will corporate earnings need years to catch up to today's equity prices?
Mr. Siegel thinks not. Like Mr. Shiller, he doubts that technological change will cause an increase in companies' earnings. It never has in the past, they agreed, because competition quickly eliminates any advantage it produces.
But even if profits are not in a historical boom, many stocks could deserve their newly high values, so long as the future is as bright as the past has been for American companies. And it should be, Mr. Siegel says. Workers and capital continue to flow into the United States. With low inflation, the economy appears more stable than it once was. The decline in the cost of trading and in capital gains taxes makes stocks a more attractive investment than in the past.
Add it all up, and stocks are likely to deliver a 6 percent inflation-adjusted annual return -- well below the rates of the 1980's and 90's and less than what investors say they expect, but still easily better than anything else. "If I were to tell somebody with virtual certainty that, over the next 20 years, they were going to earn a 4 percent real return on stocks, boy, would they be disappointed," Mr. Siegel said. "But you know what? They wouldn't move out of them."
Mr. Shiller countered, "It sounds like it's a close call."
That is why he is more bearish. If equities appear to offer a return only slightly better than bonds -- especially the new inflation-adjusted government bonds, which are nearly free of risk -- then the riskiness of stocks becomes less appealing, Mr. Shiller added. Given the lofty hopes built into today's prices, he thinks it more likely that the future will be disappointing than that it will be a wonderland of low trading costs, low taxes, low inflation and American dominance.
"The U.S. is the most successful economy in the world," he said. "And also the 20th century was the most successful century in the history of mankind. And it's kind of a mistake to assume that the U.S. experience in the last century has to be repeated."
EVEN if that success is repeated, Mr. Shiller added, investors will probably become attuned to stocks' riskiness again at some point, driving down their price-to-earnings ratios and hurting many investors who bought equities when they were expensive. After all, there have been previous periods, like the 1920's, in which people believed that the stock market was obviously the best long-term investment, and they never held onto the sentiment for long.
"Do you think they can learn?" Mr. Siegel asked. "Do you think they could become, quote, more rational on this issue?"
Mr. Shiller responded, "They could also become less rational because the frequency of reporting business news is creating a different ambience where you see the prices going up and down constantly."
Should that happen, and the stock market were to gain only slightly for the next decade, as Mr. Shiller thinks likely, he would then consider investing in it again. For now, all he owns is a mutual fund full of international value stocks and the Kmart shares his mother gave him. But come 2011, if the S.& P. 500 is not much higher than it is today, stocks may become as good a buy as they were in 1991.
"Even so," Mr. Shiller said, turning toward Mr. Siegel, "who knows about the future? Maybe I've been too influenced by you."

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Crisis Control at Warp Speed

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in Excite@Home, hoping that the company can stave off bankruptcy, are keeping a keen eye on how the chief executive, Patti S.Hart, assuages its agitated creditors. It might calm the investors to know how Ms. Hart once assuaged the pig farmers. 
 Shortly after college, Ms. Hart took a sales job at GTE. Among her tasks was selling hog farm security systems, which were intended to prevent pigs from becoming too hot or too cold. The trouble was, her prospective customers hardly saw her as one of their own, precipitating a serious makeover on her part. 
 "I kind of quickly went from the girl in the Navy blue suit to wearing blue jeans and a sweater and hanging out at the local coffee shop," she said. And Ms. Hart, 45, said that was when she came to understand she had a knack.
"I realized I could see a situation, and morph into what I needed to become to solve it," she said, adding, "That's how I've made my career, bringing solutions to problem situations."
The hog farm lessons aside, Ms. Hart credits her blue-collar upbringing and a grandmother's tireless work ethic with giving her the drive and the tools to soar through the ranks of the telecommunications industry. Colleagues and friends agree that she can adapt quickly to changes in business circumstances and squeeze the most from tough situations. Those skills are being sorely tested now.
Last week, an already pressing financial crisis worsened at Excite@Home, which offers broadband service and operates the Excite portal. Creditors who lent Excite $100 million two months ago demanded half of the money back immediately, saying they had not been fully apprised of the seriousness of the company's financial straits. And two of the largest distributors of Excite@Home's high-speed Internet access, Cox Communications and Comcast, said they would end their distribution agreements in June.
A week earlier, the company's auditor, Ernst & Young, put a fine point on those straits by concluding it had "substantial doubt" about Excite's financial viability. (Excite subsequently announced that it had replaced Ernst & Young as its auditor.)
People familiar with the company say it has $100 million in cash and is burning it at $1 million a day, with the losses being accrued largely by the portal.
In April, when Ms. Hart accepted the job as chief executive of Excite@Home, she might not have known the full extent of the company's problems. The company had once been mentioned in the same breath with Yahoo and America Online, but people close to the company said it had been slammed by a downturn in the advertising market and by mistakes by previous management.
"I thought I would have a large mountain to walk up," Ms. Hart said. "I'm finding that I have to run up it."
She learned to adapt early, as a teenager in a Chicago suburb. Her father worked at a Ford manufacturing plant. Money was tight, and any spending money that she and her four siblings wanted they had to earn themselves. Ms. Hart's jobs included working in cornfields, cleaning movie theaters and teaching children to bowl. (She didn't know how herself, so she just taught them how to keep score.) 
She also internalized the lessons of her maternal step-grandmother, Georgia Gleason, who lived through the Depression, "stuffed money in her mattress" and was "the hardest-working woman on the planet," Ms. Hart said. At 91, Ms. Gleason still gets up at dawn, then often takes to the kitchen to bake peach and blueberry pies. 
"This is my stock," said Ms. Hart, who said that since she was 11 she had not taken more than a two-week break from work. And she acknowledged that the pace was unlikely to change, even in the distant future.
Her free time, what there is of it, is spent with her husband, Milledge, a private investor, and their 17-year-old son, often in pastimes like miniature golf, bowling (she says she still is not good at it) and Yahtzee. When she eventually tires of the business world, she said, she intends to invest her energy in charitable and foundation work, mentoring and in helping other women in business.
As for her own career trajectory, Ms. Hart joined Sprint in 1986 as a national account manager in sales and moved up the ranks quickly. Six promotions later, she was president and chief operating officer of Sprint's long-distance business. In June 1999, she became chief executive of a high-speed Internet access company called Telocity. She took the company public in 2000, but after a strong start, market conditions soured and Telocity ran low on cash. Ms. Hart engineered the sale of the company to Hughes Electronics for $180 million.
She says that she is adept at marketing and sales and at building relationships but that she is not particularly "financially astute." ("I don't get up in the morning and crunch numbers," she said.) Her friends in the business world credit her with a fierce work ethic and with paying attention to issues like diversity and employee relations. 
"Excite is in an operating morass and Patti is a superb operator," said Leo Hindery Jr., former chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc. and its successor, AT&T Broadband. "She is gifted in several respects. She is meticulous in her attention to detail, and she is very sensitive to employees at every level."
BUT she has not been beyond criticism. One former vice president of Telocity said publicly that Ms. Hart lacked the ability to innovate, an accusation that Mr. Hindery dismissed as sour grapes. Ms. Hart, meanwhile, said she was aware that she could wind up labeled as being associated with troubled companies.
"I have to take responsibility," Ms. Hart said, adding that she does not believe she can disassociate herself from Excite's troubles. Dealing with labels is "part of being a leader," she said, even if the trouble at Excite was seeded before her arrival: "The thing that's important to me is that I can look in the mirror and say I'm acting with the highest integrity."
Ms. Hart visualizes a few possibilities for Excite. In at least one, she said, it continues as a thriving, independent concern, but she declined to discuss details.
At least one person has complete confidence in her: Ms. Gleason said she had no doubt that her granddaughter would revive Excite's fortunes.
The grandmother does have one, seemingly uncharacteristic concern: "I wish she'd slow down a little." 
But given Ms. Hart's genealogy, and her company's circumstances, that might not happen anytime soon.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
No Easy Fix For Social Security

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
THE argument over the future of Social Security divides just about everybody involved into stark ideological camps.
 To most of the liberal supporters of the current system, Social Security requires only minor fixes. Solid economic growth and a bulging trust fund will protect benefits for decades, they say. If projections prove too optimistic, they half-heartedly acknowledge, the government can tax a little more here, borrow a bit more there and perhaps ask retirees, far into the future, to accept slightly less. No big deal. 
 On the other side, many conservatives contend that Social Security's flaws are so fundamental that the government has to destroy the program in order to save it. Nothing less than the introduction of privately owned investment accounts allowing people to save for their own retirement, they say, will solve the problem. They see such accounts as necessary to supplement and ultimately replace the existing pay-as-you-go system, under which working Americans are taxed to pay the Social Security benefits of their parents in retirement.
But what if each side is only half right -- and half wrong?
That is exactly the way it looks to an eclectic band of economists who are not trapped in either political straitjacket. Social Security does have a fundamental flaw, they say, but it cannot be overcome by privatizing the system.
The flaw is relatively easy to understand: soon, there will not be enough workers to easily support each nonworking beneficiary. In 1960, more than five working Americans supported each retiree; today, for every Social Security beneficiary, there are about 3.4 Americans paying taxes into the system. The current tax rate of 12.4 percent, divided equally between employees and employers, is enough to pay retirees, on average, 36 percent of the income of the typical worker and leave some extra to pay off government debt.
But by 2030, when the baby-boom generation is expected to be mostly retired, only two Americans will be working for every retiree. If today's workers are to receive a similar ratio of benefits to wages, future workers will have to sacrifice a much greater share of their earnings.
Advocates of privatization promise an escape from this relentless squeeze: simply let workers today divert a portion of their Social Security taxes into individual accounts that can be invested in the stock market. Through the magic of compounding, those investments would generate enough cash to make up for lower payments from the regular Social Security accounts.
If only it were that easy. Privatization, says Jeffrey A. Miron, an economist at Boston University, is a false promise. Professor Miron, a conservative libertarian who is no fan of Social Security, might be expected to favor some form of privatization. Instead, he says, "it would just replace one bad system with a different bad system." 
In a recent paper, he and Kevin M. Murphy, an economist at the University of Chicago, argue that the crucial point is that privatization will have no effect on the stream of Social Security benefits that the government has promised to pay. Claims that privatization solves the impending crisis are wrong, they say, just as claims that privatization harms Social Security are wrong.
David Levine has a different background, but he is just as adamant in arguing that the imbalance in society's promises to future retirees and the resources that will be available at the time is inescapable.
"There is no such thing as a financial solution to Social Security," says Mr. Levine, a retired Wall Street economist with a more liberal perspective. Even if Social Security had been set up as a real pension system, the quandary would remain just as stark. 
BUT just because he finds privatization wanting doesn't mean he thinks the current system is sustainable, either. As a society, we have to have enough people working to generate real resources not just for themselves but also for all those who aren't, he says. But as life expectancies continue to grow, the population pyramid is inverting. 
Both he and Professor Miron say that, given the choices, perhaps the fairest answer is to raise the age at which full Social Security benefits are paid in the future. Already, the retirement age is scheduled to rise to 67 from 65 over the next few decades.
But that won't be enough, particularly as improvements in health care extend life expectancy. The average 75-year-old today is probably healthier than the typical 60-year-old was when Social Security first established 65 as the official retirement age.
America is wealthier than ever and can afford a decent retirement standard for the elderly. But one way or another, these critics say, the economy cannot support millions upon millions of healthy people not working year after year after year.

Suppose They Convened, but No One Came

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TO go or not to go? 
 The United States decided last week to snub a racism conference in Durban, South Africa, by sending only a midlevel delegation to protest efforts to equate Zionism with racism and promote reparations for slavery. In a world where international meetings often provide a forum for nations to challenge or second-guess America's dominance and interests, it isn't always easy to decide when to stay home and when to plunge in and fight. 
 "They create terrific problems for American policymakers," Lee H. Hamilton, director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said of such gatherings. "The agenda is often taken over by voices we don't agree with." 
Mr. Hamilton, the former Democratic chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said he was ambivalent about boycotting the Durban meeting, which began this weekend, though "in general, my instinct is that the U.S. should go to these conferences and make its case."
Gaddis Smith, an emeritus professor of history at Yale, said it was a "serious mistake" for the United States to absent itself from conferences where conflict awaits, or to scale back its presence. The Bush administration is demonstrating "a head-in-the-sand attitude," Mr. Smith said. "We're more likely to be a target of anti-American rhetoric if we're not there. It says the United States has something to hide."
Ever since the Senate dashed the hopes of President Woodrow Wilson and voted to reject American membership in the League of Nations, the United States has shown itself willing to shun world gatherings it distrusts. 
At times, the mere threat of an American boycott has prompted other nations to address Washington's objections. In 1980, with tensions boiling over in the Middle East, the Carter administration derailed an Arab effort to expel Israel from the United Nations General Assembly by making clear that it would withdraw and effectively paralyze the organization.
But sometimes threats are insufficient. In 1984, the Reagan administration withdrew from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, complaining that it was wasteful, poorly managed and a stage for anti-Western propaganda. The American departure put the agency under economic pressure, and Unesco's board voted the following year to tone down its activism. But the gambit failed to produce rapid reforms. After a 17-year boycott, House lawmakers this spring finally urged the administration to rejoin a much less politicized organization.
In 1992, American officials stewed for months over whether President George Bush would attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The administration opposed the two main agreements at the environmental conference -- accords to protect biodiversity and curb emissions that contribute to global warming -- but with the United States a major force in both conservation and pollution, Mr. Bush risked being blamed for singlehandedly wrecking the meeting by staying home. He decided to attend and ultimately persuaded the world leaders to water down their treaty on emissions.
In 1995, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton led an American delegation to the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women. Many Republican lawmakers had opposed the American participation, and Mrs. Clinton's attendance in particular, because of China's poor human rights record and their belief that the conference would endorse abortion. When Chinese security agents clamped down on demonstrators at the conference, Mrs. Clinton excoriated her Chinese hosts for their failure to tolerate dissenting views. 
Running through the American ambivalence toward such meetings are competing imperatives. With a commercial, political or military presence in virtually every corner of the globe, the United States has a unique stake in international affairs. To protect its interests, it secured a dominant role in the main institutions of the post-World War II era: the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
YET the American impulse has been to dismiss the international order when it is seen as running counter to the national interest or as meddling in domestic affairs. "We Americans always talk about multilateralism," said Kenneth N. Waltz, a political scientist who teaches at Columbia University. "In fact, we're unilateralists."
That perception, which is widespread among American allies as well as critics, has grown in recent months as the Bush administration has rejected the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with Russia and the Kyoto accord on global warming. Resentment has also built over the United States' failure to pay arrears to the United Nations.
The Bush administration learned this spring what happens when it ignores such rumblings: the United States itself gets boycotted.
For the first time in its 54-year history, the United Nations Human Rights Commission failed to approve a seat for the United States. The vote, which was seen as a rebuke to the Bush administration's foreign policy, left astonished American officials vowing to press for human rights from the sidelines.
But that's not the same as being in the game.

HEADLINE: How Long Can Consumers Keep Spending? 

BYLINE:  By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former labor secretary, is professor of economic and social policy at Brandeis University and author of "The Future of Success."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
The old industrial struggle was between companies and workers. The new struggle is between . . . companies and workers. But the battle isn't what it used to be. Now, it's over who's going to spend enough to keep the economy moving forward. The crunch will come if companies lay off so many employees that consumers go on a spending strike.
 Since last year, American companies have cut way back on their purchases. The economy isn't in recession only because consumers haven't cut back their spending as well. If they do, the American economy tanks. 
 A slowdown usually starts the other way around. Consumers reduce their spending because they've used up too much of their savings and can't afford or don't want to borrow more. Then companies cut back their own spending because sales are down.
This time, companies started it. They overspent in the late 90's, mostly on capital equipment and software, and then began cutting back last year at the first sign of trouble. The technology sector took the biggest hit. As profits continued to drop this year, companies stopped buying. Business investment dropped a whopping 14.6 percent in the second quarter. Investment in equipment and software fell by 15.1 percent in the second quarter, the largest drop since the comparable period of 1982. Even outside the battered technology sector, profits have been disappointing. As a result, companies have begun to target their biggest single cost -- payrolls.
Last year the economy gained 1.76 million jobs. But between March and July of this year it shed 394,000 in the private sector -- the largest monthly drops since the recession in 1991 and 1992. (We won't know what happened in August until figures come out later this week.) Since April 1998, when factory payrolls peaked, 1.2 million factory jobs have been lost. But the biggest surprise has come in the service sector. Service jobs had grown steadily for decades, recession or no recession, but since March, the number of service jobs in the American economy has not grown at all.
The job losses look even bigger when considering forthcoming layoffs. In July, companies announced that they would lay off an additional 205,975 workers, a monthly record.
Even if companies are cutting way back, the economy can still move forward as long as consumers keep spending. After all, consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity. In the second quarter of this year, consumers increased their spending at an annualized rate of 2.1 percent. That's a bit slower than in the first quarter but good enough to keep the economy going. 
But there's an obvious tension here that lies at the heart of the economy. If the job cutbacks and layoffs continue, at some point consumers are going to get worried about their own paychecks. And when that happens, they'll cut way back on spending.
This belt-tightening could happen suddenly because consumers are already deep in debt. Consumer-credit debt surged a whopping 9.3 percent last year, and it is still rising at that torrid pace. Personal debt has been growing by an average annualized rate of 8.2 percent a month since last October. Mortgage debt is way up, too. 
The interesting question is why employees have remained so irrationally exuberant. Surely not because they're getting a few hundred dollars in tax rebates or because fuel prices have eased. The easiest explanation is that the last recession is only a dim memory, so most people underestimate the risk of losing a job and hitting the wall. Almost a quarter of the current work force wasn't even old enough to have a job when the last recession blew through in 1991 and 1992. Since then we've enjoyed one of the longest periods of prosperity on record. Millions of Americans were lifted into the middle class. The rate of home ownership rose to 67.5 percent, the highest on record. Homes are Americans's biggest nest egg, and housing prices are still holding firm. So naturally there's a lot of wishful thinking that the economy will bounce back soon.
Moreover, the latest round of job cuts doesn't seem nearly as threatening as it might have years ago. By now, people are used to the idea that they might be laid off. During the 90's, the possibility of losing one's job became a permanent feature of working life. High rates of layoffs that began in the recession of 1991-92 never dropped by much. The difference was that as the economy gained speed in the 90's, people who lost their jobs could easily find new ones. Unemployment dropped to its lowest rate in three decades. But now, jobs are becoming harder to find.
Finally, after a decade of prosperity, most people have become used to a certain standard of living. They'll pull in their belts only when they feel they have no choice -- that is, when their bills grow too large or when their jobs seem at risk. 
Every announcement of more layoffs moves us closer to that moment. Consumers are already slowing their purchases of cars and other big-ticket items, according to the latest confidence surveys. If the job cuts keep up, at some point consumer confidence will take a dive, and consumers will go on a spending strike. When that happens, not even Alan Greenspan's interest rate cuts can help us.
Blather about whether the economy has "bottomed out" is meaningless. The economy might take off again, but it also might fall into a full-blown recession. It all depends on whether the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, combined with additional government spending (don't worry about the Social Security surplus, please!) encourage companies to start spending again and stop cutting payrolls before employees lose their irrational exuberance and become rationally worried.

The Slave Reparations Movement Adopts the Rhetoric of Victimhood

BYLINE:  By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
My great-grandfather John Wesley Staples was born in Bedford County, Va., on July 4, 1865. Independence Day of that year was laden with symbolism because it heralded the end of slavery through the 13th Amendment. Family legend has it that John Wesley was one of the first free Negroes born in his county. But three of his siblings were born into slavery, as was his mother, Somerville, who was known in the family as an Ethiopian.
 Slavery is nearer to us in time than most Americans understand. My eldest uncle, who turns 84 this year, has often recalled meeting former slaves when he was a boy at John Wesley's farm in Troutville, Va. Had John Wesley lived to my uncle's age, he would had seen the beginning of the civil rights movement and met the great-grandson who would later become an editorial writer for The New York Times. 
 The post-slavery South was especially brutal for elderly black people who had given their working lives to their masters and could no longer care for themselves. Freedom, such as it was, was further circumscribed during the late 19th century, when Southern states were writing Negroes out of the state constitutions, denying them the right to vote, hold office or attend school. The trend was deepened by sharecropping and other forms of bondage.
Black Americans often suppressed slave memories out of horror and shame. But the Staples family embraced its story out of pride in how well John Wesley and his wife, Eliza, managed to fare in the aggressively racist environment of the South in the late 19th century and early 20th century. My great-grandparents had the benefit of a strong extended family, allowing them to pool resources, including manpower. The Staples family protected the farm and John Wesley's wholesaling business with shotguns and pistols that were evident even at the dinner table. With no school available for black children, John Wesley and Eliza joined with their neighbors and built one in a field at the intersection of their three properties.
The teacher is listed in my great-aunt Sophronia's grade school composition book as a "Miss Marion B. Brown." She worked at the one-room school in return for room and board from the families. When John Wesley died in 1940, he left behind a literate family, a thriving farm and $40,000 in cash -- a small fortune by standards of the time. This achievement paved the way for my father's generation and mine, which included the first college-bound members of the Staples family line.
Black Americans made spectacular progress beginning in the decades after slavery, moving from cotton fields to the boardroom in just over a century. But the recent debate about reparations for slavery has introduced a different narrative in which black people are cast as a victim class seeking compensation for the suffering of ancestors. The most popular version of the reparations proposal is found in "The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks," by the Africa analyst Randall Robinson. The book has gained surprising credibility on the political left while generating a considerable backlash among moderate and conservative black intellectuals. 
Targeted compensation is legal and morally just. The state of Florida made the right gesture in 1994 when it gave college scholarships to descendants from the black community of Rosewood, which was destroyed by whites in 1923 while the state did nothing. The federal government has rightly compensated modern-day Native Americans for lands taken from them in the last century. Supporters of reparations have at least a moral case when they argue that companies that enriched themselves in slavery should attempt restitution when documents are specific enough to permit it.
But the sweeping notion that individual black Americans are owed a "debt" for slavery is a bridge too far. Black families have made and lost fortunes just as white families have. There is in addition no provable connection between 19th-century bondage and specific cases of 21st-century destitution. For these reasons, a publicly financed reparations program based on ancestry is not sustainable politically.
Such a program would logically be open to millions of people who have lived as "white" for generations but are descended from enslaved black people. The program would also be available to the descendants of black slave owners, who were far more common than many people like to admit. Black masters in South Carolina, for example, were confined to the margins of society but held many of the same attitudes about race as whites. Black masters continued to hold slaves even as the Union Army prepared for its terrible march through South Carolina.
The reparations debate is part of a burgeoning discussion about the role of slavery in American history. But by blaming history alone for modern-day social ills like poverty, illiteracy and unemployment, reparations advocates are unwittingly saying that these problems are so deeply rooted as to be unsolvable. They are also subverting the true story of black people in the United States. This story is one of extraordinary achievement in the face of gargantuan obstacles. It begins in the waning hours of slavery and continues to this very day.

HEADLINE: Study Faults Unions' Math On New Jobs For Drilling 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The number of jobs gained from oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would be far fewer than the 750,000 that many unions have said the drilling would create, says a study released today by environmental groups.
 The League of Conservation Voters and other environmental groups that oppose the Alaska drilling say the study should go far to offset the main argument -- new jobs -- that the Teamsters and other unions used to persuade 36 House Democrats to vote a month ago for the drilling, a hotly contested issue in Congress. 
 The study, by an economist with long ties to unions, is the environmental movement's latest weapon in its biggest feud with labor in years.
Many environmentalists are angry at the Teamsters and several building trade unions for playing a pivotal role in lining up enough support among House Democrats to secure approval of the drilling, a major victory for the Bush administration. 
The administration will try to persuade the Senate to approve the drilling this fall, but environmental leaders say they hope the new study will help ensure that it does not.
"Some labor unions outmaneuvered us in the House," said Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters. "But we still think we can win this thing in the Senate."
The study, done by Dean Baker, co-director of the Center of Economic and Policy Research, faulted the 1990 study that the Teamsters and the oil industry repeatedly cited to argue that the Alaska drilling would create 750,000 jobs. 
Mr. Baker's study estimated that the Alaska drilling would create just 46,300 jobs. He concluded that the earlier study, commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute, was far off in estimating that the oil from the refuge would represent 3.5 percent of world oil production. Relying on more recent estimates, his study found that the refuge would account for 1.15 percent of world production.
As a result, he said, the Arctic drilling would push down world oil prices far less than forecast by the 1990 study, which was conducted by the WEFA Group, based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The 1990 study said the low prices would give the American economy a shot in the arm, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
The 1990 study predicted that other oil-producing nations would do little to reduce output to push prices up once the Alaska drilling helped pull them down. Relying on estimates that the WEFA Group used in more recent studies, Mr. Baker concluded that other nations would cut production far more than the 1990 study estimated to offset output from the refuge. That, he said, would nullify much or all of the lower prices generated by the Arctic drilling.
Citing his prediction of 46,300 new jobs, Mr. Baker wrote, "Economic impacts of this magnitude are almost too small to be noticed, given the size of the U.S. economy."
Jerry Hood, a Teamsters official based in Alaska who is a special assistant to the union's president, James P. Hoffa, on energy policy, defended the 1990 study. "We are comfortable with the jobs number developed in that study," Mr. Hood said.
Some environmental leaders said the feud over Arctic drilling could jeopardize efforts by labor and environmentalists to work together on many issues, notably fast-track trade legislation.
"There's clearly been a rupture between the Teamsters and the environmental movement," said Carl Pope, president of the Sierra Club. "The Teamsters got away with casting the impression that all of labor favored the drilling, which it wasn't. It's going to be extremely important to the future of the blue-green alliance how the rest of labor helps set the record straight."
In recent days, the Service Employees International Union and the United Auto Workers have spoken out against the drilling.
Mr. Pope said he was surprised that the Teamsters would work so closely with the Bush administration on energy policy after President Bush took several anti-labor actions early in his administration.
"I don't understand how Hoffa says he's bitterly fighting the Bush administration on Mexican trucking, which he says is his top priority, and then he takes Arctic drilling, which should be a much smaller issue for the Teamsters, and he uses it to legitimize Bush by giving him a major legislative victory," Mr. Pope said.
Mr. Hoffa said supporting Arctic drilling made sense. "It provides jobs for Teamsters," he said. "It's a sound answer to the need for additional oil for the country."

HEADLINE: Competition's Not Pretty in Lipstick Wars 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
When a midsize chain of New York cosmetics stores declared bankruptcy a few weeks ago, worry lines around town began to deepen.
 For nearly three decades, the chain, Cosmetics Plus, had occupied a comfortable niche somewhere between the two time-tested models for buying lipstick, mascara and so forth. The first model entailed plucking a packaged product from a drugstore shelf; the second, braving the hard sell of a department store cosmetics counter. In contrast, Cosmetics Plus specialized in midlevel to upscale beauty products in stand-alone stores and appeared successful, even expanding to California. 
 But a few years ago, the first shots were fired in the lipstick wars, as retailers like the aggressively stylish Sephora barreled into the New York market. These days, selling cosmetics has become extraordinarily competitive, with inventive marketing ploys -- for example, one manufacturer has a "studio" where a customer can have makeup applied but cannot actually buy it, and other stores hold seminars, hand out dog biscuits to customers' pets or even carry a line of grooming products for dogs.
Today, there are beauty stores for every type of customer -- even women like Barbara Goldschmidt, a massage therapist in Manhattan who wears makeup only rarely. "I don't put anything on my skin that I can't eat," Ms. Goldschmidt said recently, as she and her two teenage daughters sampled products made from fruit and grains at an Origins store.
The change in cosmetics retailing actually began five years ago, when the Body Shop, a British company that made a name for itself by avoiding animal testing, entered the United States market. The threat from the Body Shop inspired the Estee Lauder Companies to develop the equally animal-friendly Origins, which sells a "comb improvement detangler" scented with patchouli oils, a product for dogs.
The influx of Body Shops also led Intimate Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, to create the Bath and Body Works chain, popular with more "girly girl" consumers.
Just as they favor blacks and neutrals in their clothing, New York women tend to wear less makeup than Sun Belt women, who wear bright colors, said Allan G. Mottus, the publisher of The Informationist, a cosmetics trade publication.
But that has not blocked the proliferation of retailers. So many cosmetics stores and spas opened in SoHo a few years ago that some people began referring to it as Lipstick Alley. One of them, Shiseido Studio, offers free classes and makeup applications but does not sell cosmetics. The idea, said Michelle Torio, the studio director, is to promote the products in a pressure-free environment.
Now the Flatiron district has become ground zero in the lipstick wars, as national retailers moved into the neighborhood to attract the young Internet workers with offices nearby. As a result, a woman feeling a sudden urge to change her lip or nail color, say, can go to any of a dozen stores on Fifth Avenue from 16th Street to 22nd Street. 
Not only can she shop in stores specializing in cosmetics, but she can also buy cosmetics at stores with other main businesses -- sampling a lip gloss called Dirty Girl, for example, at Anthropologie, a clothing and home furnishings store, or trying a "lip enhancer" called Pleasingly Plump at Victoria's Secret. Cosmetics are also available at apparel stores like Club Monaco and the Gap.
The fact that many more opportunities exist to buy cosmetics does not mean, however, that women are buying more. No one tracks overall cosmetics sales in New York, but nationally, sales increased only 3.9 percent over last year, said Carrie Bonner, a senior research analyst for Kline & Company, a marketing research company in Little Falls, N.J. This unspectacular performance has led retailing experts to predict an eventual shakeout in the market, which may have begun with the bankruptcy of Cosmetics Plus.
"The pie keeps getting cut up into smaller and smaller pieces," said Wendy Liebmann, the president of WSL Strategic Retail, a New York marketing research company that follows the cosmetics industry.
Perhaps the biggest shock wave to the industry was in 1998, when Sephora, owned by the French luxury retailer LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, opened its first United States outlet in SoHo. Using lighting to dramatic effect, Sephora aims for a theatrical experience, and refers to its sales force as cast members. It stocks traditional brands like Clarins and Clinique as well as hip labels like Urban Defense and Hard Candy. 
Beth Manhardt, 20, a student at Providence College, said she shopped at Sephora because she preferred to be let alone. "I hated having to deal with sales people," she said. "You can't try on things as easily, and they push things on you. Here, you have total freedom." 
The popularity of Sephora, which has seven stores in New York and is about to open an eighth at 67th and Third Avenue, seems to have prompted a rethinking at the department stores. At Bloomingdale's, for example, the perfume-sprayers have become deferential, if not exactly meek. Sales clerks in the cosmetics department tend to be as aggressive as ever, but these days, they immediately back off when asked to.
Industry experts, however, said these changes have yet to pay off. A slump in clothing sales has not helped. "If you're not getting apparel traffic, you're not getting cosmetics traffic," Ms. Liebmann said.
One retailer that did not respond to the new trends in cosmetics merchandising was Cosmetics Plus, a 28-year-old regional chain, with 22 stores, 18 of them in Manhattan. Cosmetics Plus had styled itself as the "American parfumerie" -- more upscale than drug stores and more convenient than department stores.
But by the late 1990's, Cosmetics Plus began looking a little tired. Instead of updating its stores, the company made an unsuccessful foray into California and dabbled in the Internet. Buying cosmetics online has little appeal for most women, analysts say, because they want to smell, touch and see the products.
On Thursday, Cosmetics Plus was authorized by the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to hold going-out-of-business sales. Other retailers may follow. Cosmetics used to be considered recession-proof. "People might not buy an $800 suit, but they can buy a $15 lipstick," said Faith Hope Consolo, a real estate broker who handled many Cosmetics Plus leases. "It makes them look good and feel good."
But retail analysts say this piece of conventional wisdom is no longer entirely true. In an economic downturn, Ms. Liebmann said, "instead of buying three lipsticks, you buy two."

HEADLINE: STATES EASE LAWS ON TIME IN PRISON 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Reversing a 20-year trend toward ever-tougher criminal laws, a number of states this year have quietly rolled back some of their most stringent anticrime measures, including those imposing mandatory minimum sentences and forbidding early parole.
 The new laws, along with a voter initiative in California that provides for treatment rather than prison for many drug offenders, reflect a political climate that has changed markedly as crime has fallen, the cost of running prisons has exploded and the economy has slowed, state legislators and criminal justice experts say. 
 After a two-decade boom in prison construction that quadrupled the number of inmates, the states now spend a total of $30 billion a year to operate their prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. And with voters saying they are more concerned about issues like education than street violence, state legislators are finding they must cut the growth in prison inmates to satisfy the demand for new services and to balance their budgets.
"I think these new laws are pretty significant, with legislators taking politically risky steps that would have been unthinkable even a couple of years ago," said Michael Jacobson, a former corrections commissioner for New York City who is now a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
"When the spigot stops, you are forced to look at the items that have grown the most, and inevitably, in every state, it is corrections," Professor Jacobson said.
With several states re-examining their criminal laws, including New York, Alabama, Georgia, New Mexico and Idaho, these changes are likely to hasten a decline in the number of state prison inmates, which began to fall in the second half of last year for the first time since 1972, the experts and lawmakers say.
Perhaps the most significant changes, the experts say, occurred in four states that this year dropped some 1990's sentencing laws that required criminals to serve long terms without the possibility of parole. The four are Louisiana, Connecticut, Indiana and North Dakota.
Iowa passed a similar law last spring, giving judges discretion in imposing what had been a mandatory five-year sentence for low-level drug crimes and certain property crimes, including burglary.
In May, Mississippi passed a law making first-time nonviolent offenders eligible for parole after serving only 25 percent of their sentences, instead of the 85 percent required under a law enacted in 1994. Since the earlier law went into effect, the number of prison inmates in Mississippi jumped to 37,754 this year, from 10,699 in 1994, according to state figures.
And West Virginia, which has had one of the fastest-growing prison systems, enacted a law to reduce the number of inmates by giving money to local counties to develop alternatives to prison, like electronic monitoring of people on probation and centers where probationers would report each day.
"These may be small states, and the new laws are not comprehensive reforms, but it is very significant that these are not just liberal Northeastern states," said Nicholas Turner, director of the State Sentencing and Corrections Project at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York, a research organization that is working with a number of the states to reduce prison costs and explore options instead of prison. "What has happened this year in these states implies a lot about a change in the political culture."
Some lawmakers and lobbyists say such a shift is looming in New York, where Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed softening the state's notoriously tough Rockefeller-era drug laws, and the Democratic-controlled State Assembly has insisted on even more far-reaching changes.
Perhaps the most surprising change has come in Louisiana, which has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the nation and has long had a reputation for brutal prison conditions and wide racial disparities in who is sentenced to prison.
Louisiana's new law, strongly supported by Gov. Mike Foster, a conservative Republican, and the state district attorneys' association, eliminates mandatory prison time for crimes like burglary of a residence, possession of small amounts of drugs, Medicaid fraud, prostitution, theft of a firearm and obscenity. Since Louisiana imposed mandatory minimum sentences six years ago, its prison population has increased by 50 percent, to 38,000 from 25,260, and was projected to grow to 46,000 by 2004. Under mandatory minimum sentences, state expenditures for prisons have soared 70 percent, state figures show.
"This is an attempt to bring under control a system that was bankrupting the state and was not reducing crime," said State Senator Donald R. Cravins, a Democrat who was one of the law's prime supporters. 
The situation had reached a point in Louisiana, Senator Cravins said, that "we had half the population in prison and the other half watching them," while the state spent $600 million a year on corrections and was facing a budget deficit.
"We were pouring money into a bottomless pit, but we couldn't address the real causes of crime like the lack of early childhood education," he said, a particular problem in Louisiana, which has the lowest per capita income in the nation.
Not everyone has supported the revised laws. Some legislators have been accused of being "soft on crime" and prosecutors have complained that scrapping mandatory minimum sentences takes away one of their best tools to get street criminals to plea bargain and trade information about other criminals in exchange for lesser sentences.
Stephen Mallory, a former deputy director of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics who is now chairman of the department of criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi, opposed his state's new law restoring eligibility for parole for first-time nonviolent criminals. 
"It's a joke," Professor Mallory said, because "anyone in law enforcement knows these are not first-time offenders. There is a strong likelihood that they've committed 30 or 40 crimes before and just finally got caught."
The change in the law will be costly for society, Professor Mallory said. "If you turn out someone who is a real career criminal, you will save $30,000 in prison costs, but he will do $100,000 worth of property and emotional damage in more crimes."
But State Representative Michael P. Lawlor, a Democrat who is chairman of the Connecticut House judiciary committee, says he sees another advantage to the new laws, including the one sponsored by Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, that ends a decade-old system of mandatory prison terms for nonviolent drug offenders. He said the changes would help reduce huge racial disparities in who goes to prison.
Nine out of 10 people in jail and prison in Connecticut for drug offenses are black or Hispanic, Mr. Lawlor said, but half of those arrested on drug charges are white. Part of the problem, he said, is a Connecticut law that established a mandatory sentence for selling or possessing drugs within two-thirds of a mile of a school, day care center or public housing project. 
The result, Mr. Lawlor said, is that 90 percent of cities like Hartford or New Haven are within these areas, and so poor and minority people who live in these areas end up in prison for any drug charge.
"I think this is the most significant change in criminal justice policy we have made in more than 10 years," Mr. Lawlor said. "Two or three years from now you are going to be able to look back and see the new law has made a tremendous impact on who is in prison."
And there are more states where change may soon come. The sponsors of the California referendum that was approved by voters last November mandating drug treatment instead of incarceration for first- and second-time offenders convicted of drug possession, are pushing to get a similar initiative on the ballot in Florida, Ohio and Michigan for the 2002 election.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about the easing of mandatory sentencing laws in some states misstated the number of prisoners in Mississippi, where parole eligibility was changed for nonviolent first-time offenders. It is about 19,000, not 37,754.
A related article about proposals to overhaul New York's drug laws referred incorrectly to the state's classification and punishment of some drug crimes. The top category of drug crime is a Class A felony; Class B is the third-highest.
Class B, the most frequent charge under the laws, applies to the sale of drugs in any amount, the possession of a drug between one-eighth of an ounce and 2 ounces, or the possession of any amount with the intent to sell it. The minimum sentence for a Class B felony is 1 to 3 years, not 15 years to life.

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
RESIDENTIAL real estate agents in New Jersey are still bubbling, reporting buoyant housing prices, apparently unnettled by scattered reports of cautionary signs. In contrast, midyear reports about the commercial markets -- industrial, office and retail -- provide a bit of a reality check. They also cast a bit of a pall.
 A recent report by the real estate services concern Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey Inc. referred to a "generally declining overall picture" in the commercial market, despite basic health in the first six months. The report added that "the strong grip of the national economic slowdown is defining the forecast for the second half of the year." 
 Grubb & Ellis Research of Fairfield, N.J., reached similar conclusions, saying, "It appears that the wind has dissipated from the sails of the Northern and Central New Jersey office market, as we drift aimlessly on the open waters in mid-2001." 
GVA Williams of New Jersey analyzed statistics and trends in crucial submarkets and issued a sort of left-handed compliment. "New Jersey has not felt the effects of the general economic slowdown as severely as some other parts of the country," the midyear report said. "Demand will remain strong compared to other markets as long as there continues to be no speculative overbuilding."
Layoffs, mergers and acquisitions are generating higher vacancy rates for office space. A spate of retail bankruptcy filings -- including Bradlees, Grand Union and Lechters -- has disrupted the retail market. If there is any sector staying afloat, the midyear reports indicated, it is the industrial market.
One positive development noted in the reports was Volkswagen of America's long-term lease for 928,000 square feet of distribution space off Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike and relatively close to the Port of Newark and Newark Airport. Volkswagen is expected to occupy an entire facility now under construction in Cranbury Township. 
The office market, in contrast to the industrial sector, is being hit hard, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Following are some of the major blows:
* Rising unemployment (3.6 percent in January, now 4 percent).
* A dragging telecommunications industry, including thousands of layoffs at Lucent Technologies.
* Increasing supply of sublease space as companies contract and fold.
* Rising vacancy rates in Manhattan, meaning less demand in New Jersey.
At 10.5 percent, the average vacancy rate for sublease space is the highest since year-end 1998, the report says. Vacancy rates for Class A space in northern New Jersey are 11.9 percent, up from 5.9 percent a year ago.
In Parsippany, Class A vacancy rates climbed to 22 percent, up 14 percentage points over last year. 
Franklin Township reported the region's highest overall vacancy rate, covering all classes of space, 15 percent, and that is poised to climb. Merrill Lynch is about to move to offices in Hopewell, and this will put an additional 700,000 square feet on the market in Franklin.
On the other hand, in Newark, the city's revitalization efforts are helping to maintain relative stability. The overall vacancy rate is 12.4 percent, up slightly from last year's 11.1 percent, but better than the 10-year high of 17.8 percent in 1995.
The market in central New Jersey is also holding up well. Class A vacancy rates are down, to 8.4 percent, from 10.7 percent a year ago. 
"The pharmaceutical sector is strong," said Jonathan S. Meisel, a senior director for Cushman & Wakefield. The pharmaceutical company Aventis leased 417,288 square feet near Route 78 in Bridgewater earlier this year; Cendant, the travel, rental car, real estate and finanacial services business, leased 386,079 square feet in Parsippany. Other brokers and developers noted UBS/PaineWebber's lease for 1.1 million square feet on the Hudson waterfront in the Newport Office Center VII in Jersey City. 
Still, the number of leases statewide of more than 100,000 square feet is down. Cushman & Wakefield reports 7 large leases during the first half of the year; there were 25 at midyear last year. 
GVA Williams's report asserts the office market has entered a period of "neutral absorption" when an equal amount of space is being leased and being made available. Other reports describe a flood of sublet space but consider it an opportunity because it could force landlords to reduce rental rates. 
The retail sector, according to Grubb & Ellis Research, is suffering from a slowdown. "A year ago, the New Jersey retail market was defined by strong retail sales coupled with a growing, stable economy," the Grubb & Ellis midyear report said. "Many retailers were pursuing aggressive expansion strategies to take advantage of prolific sales volumes."
"Practically overnight, we have reversed direction," it concluded.
Grubb & Ellis reports a rise of bankruptcy court filings as well as store closings. Last spring, Federated Department Stores converted most of its 24 Stern's stores to Macy's or Bloomingdale's. Five Stern's stores closed.
Some large retailers are taking advantage of available space to expand. When Bradlees closed, Home Depot, Kohl's and Wal-Mart bought 35 of the 105 Bradlees stores in New Jersey. Kohl's used the same strategy last year to enter the New Jersey market, acquiring many Caldor stores, after that chain went out of business.
Bankruptcy filings are also occurring among supermarkets. Grand Union filed for protection from creditors earlier this year, and C & S Wholesale Grocers acquired 170 of 180 Grand Union stores in New Jersey for an estimated $301.8 million, Grubb & Ellis reported. The wholesaler reportedly plans to keep some stores open as Grand Unions and sell the others to several chains -- including Pathmark, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection itself.
Other chains are hoping to enter the market or expand, according to Grubb & Ellis, and the midyear prediction is for saturation of the retail market, more bankruptcy filings and more closing.
Despite the reports, retail development continues. Various real estate service companies have issued statements each month about leasing agreements they have arranged or about new construction projects.
Grubb & Ellis, for example, has fully leased the 66,000-square-foot Fort Lee Towne Centre, which is nearing completion.
In Edgewater, a 185,000-square-foot retail center is being built. In Woodcliff Lake, near Exit 171 of the Garden State Parkway, work has begun on 13 acres for a 120,000-square-foot shopping center. In Woodbridge, final approval has been given for plans to develop 25 acres into a Lowe's Home Improvement.
THE industrial market remains generally robust, with only about 5 percent of the total space available, according to NAI/James E. Hanson Inc., a commercial broker in Hackensack. 
But Cushman & Wakefield reported that the slowing economy is beginning to be felt in the industrial market.
Cushman & Wakefield's senior director, Frank Caccavo, said, "Constraint on future industrial development and a dramatic decrease in the number of manufacturing jobs statewide are rapidly changing the landscape of industrial inventory."
Cushman advised caution but also noted a bright side. Construction, it said, continues statewide, with projects ranging from 204,000 square feet to nearly 960,000 square feet expected to be completed by January.
In addition, more than 3.7 million square feet of industrial space was leased in Middlesex County in the first half of the year.
North/Central New Jersey continues to attract research and development centers for pharmaceutical and high technology companies; several are shopping for laboratory space.
NAI/James E. Hanson thinks the market in Central New Jersey is particularly strong, citing the development of the distribution hub at Exit 8A. But farther north, in Bergen and Hudson Counties, Hanson's midyear statement noted, outdated plants predominate -- and will require refitting.

As Work and Life Blur, Office Furniture Goes 24/7

BYLINE:  By ALASTAIR GORDON 

 BODY:
THERE is an iconic photograph from the 1950's that shows I.B.M. offices, with row after row of secretaries and desks, an apparently endless grid of regimented, soul-blistering cubicles symbolizing the corporate mind-set of an earlier generation. These days, that conventional office layout is largely outmoded, a vestige of the command-and-control management model of the corporate Dark Ages. 
 The concept of the workplace has adapted to the changes in the economy, technology and the way people live. With laptops, the Internet, cell phones and faxes, the workplace can be anywhere and everywhere, and boundaries between work and personal space have blurred. 
 And as the economy has weakened, and as many people have found themselves suddenly downsized, more of them are venturing into the uncertain waters of self-employment and entrepreneurial start-ups, often adapting their home spaces into work spaces or moving into raw, industrial interiors with no apparent amenities. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says about 12 million workers in the United States now fall under the designation "workers with alternative arrangements." 
Clearly, the office no longer consists of the old icons -- the steel filing cabinet, the cubicle, the conference table. Big furniture companies like Knoll Inc. and Herman Miller have begun to respond to the new work attitudes with softer, curving forms that embrace rather than alienate the worker.
"Work has become transportable and ubiquitous, almost a state of mind," said Paola Antonelli, curator of "Workspheres," a recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan that explored new horizons in the workplace. "Work is where you are." 
The exhibition, which ran from February through April, included new products in cell phone technology, personal computing, work stations and furniture -- products that might be found at any up-to-the-minute showroom. 
But it also included provocative developments in the nomadic office. A team of Belgian and French designers created L'echarpe Communicante, or communicating scarf, a cuddly thing containing a communication system with phone, computer screen and keyboard. Wrap it around your face and you can tele-communicate as you saunter down the boulevard. And Hella Jongerius, a Dutch designer, developed a line called "My Soft Office" that included a bed with a computer screen in its mattress and a keyboard and mouse embedded in a "smart pillow."
"The ultimate symbol of rest and relaxation, of dreaming, doing nothing, sleeping, and making love has been fused with work," wrote Ms. Jongerius, describing her vision.
While the exhibition presented an optimistic, if at times naive, embrace of the new paradigm, a few designers responded to the darker side of the borderless office. Jennie Pineus, a Swedish designer, fabricated cocoonlike structures from white fabric and steel ribbing, intended to provide privacy and shelter from a stressful, intense work environment. Her "Cocoonchair" can be pulled about the body for moments of quiet reflection or napping. Her "Headcocoon" is a more portable version that can be worn anywhere, fitting over the head with small breathing holes and looking something like a beekeeper's mask. 
While such extremes may seem absurd, the integration of work and personal life is accepted by a new generation. "Younger knowledge workers believe there is value in this -- in integrating everything and having no boundaries," said Madelyn Hochstein, the president of DYG Inc., a firm in Danbury, Conn., that specializes in market forecasting. "They think it's sexy."
Her company has worked with several large corporations, including Ford Motor and Kraft Foods, forecasting social trends. For Knoll, DYG conducted field research on the changing workplace. Through focus groups and surveys it zoomed in on a group in its mid-20's, which Ms. Hochstein calls the "whatever generation." 
"If you're a business and you want to attract these bright young people, you have to recognize that the traditional boundaries between work and social life have disappeared," Ms. Hochstein said. "The whatever generation wants social integration. They have parties in the office at 2 p.m. They sleep in the office. It's become as much a home as a workplace and vice versa -- their homes have become workplaces." 
BOTH Knoll and Herman Miller have introduced lines aimed at younger companies that may have to adapt quickly to changing economic conditions and do not have the luxury of long-term space planning that more established companies enjoy. The new products are flexible, lightweight, designed to be sold over the Internet and easily shipped and assembled. And their cost may be within the reach of many fledgling businesses.
In Herman Miller's new Red line of office furniture, basic desk components start at around $300. The Red Rocket desk, for example, is organically shaped, looking something like the profile of a peanut. It comes with an adjustable-height pod to support a computer monitor and an extensive menu of accessories, like lighting fixtures and extra shelves, that clip or screw into the main framework. Instead of the standard file cabinet, there is something called a "soft storage cart," covered in fabric. 
"The new economy is about the individual," said Eric Chan, 46, a designer who helped to develop the line. "Everyone is now allowed to do whatever they want. Companies are trying to attract the best brain power and the work environment they offer is one of the big incentives."
Another variation, the Red Grasshopper, is a soft, adaptable system that has the look of NASA space equipment. Desks and storage units are wrapped in thick, protective padding. The Grasshopper uses what the company calls "soft docking" -- different components nuzzle together without precise connections. Parts can be easily moved and reconfigured. 
"Office furniture is no longer about being a status symbol," Mr. Chan said. "Everyone's a free agent now. Technology has become so mobile that everything is possible. People don't need to feel that they're working in an office. It should be fun. Why should they sit at a mahogany table? The Red system looks more like they're surfing or camping, not just sitting in a cubicle at work." 
At Knoll, Christine Barber, director of the workplace design team, explained the idea of its new line this way: "There's a backlash, a revolution against the right angle. The younger generation wants a sense of community, more visually stimulating and less monotonous work environments. They want to work as a team, not as a cog in the machine."
Ms. Barber helped to guide Knoll through a rethinking of the modular office unit. In place of the file cabinets and cubicles of the "Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" era, Knoll is gambling on a new system called the A3. The company went outside the conventional industrial design world and hired Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture, architects and partners at Asymptote Architecture in Manhattan who are known for their digitally-minded projects and are as comfortable designing Web sites as they are buildings. Their designs for the new trading space and Web site of the New York Stock Exchange brought them to the attention of Andrew B. Cogan, Knoll's chief executive.
Karen Stone, director of Knoll's interior design division, said, "Their approach was spatial and environmental as opposed to object-driven."
INSPIRED by airplane interiors and camping equipment, the podlike A3 unit is made from tubular steel framing covered with stretchy mesh fabric. It wraps around the office worker with womblike curves. While providing some privacy, the A3's translucent envelope provides a sense of visual continuity. The A3 can be used alone in an open loft space or as part of a grouping in a more conventional office space.
Like many aspects of corporate America, the workplace has been changing so quickly that design companies have had to compress their normal development cycles.
"You can't wait that long anymore -- it's about speed," Ms. Barber said. "We have taken a seven-year product development cycle time and condensed that down to two years because we must respond instantly to market requirements." 
The research and development phase for the A3 began in late 1999, and the prototype was unveiled in June at the NeoCon furniture show in Chicago. It should be available to the public next March.
While a more elastic work zone may offer unprecedented levels of freedom, there is a down side. Like a needy dog, the office can now follow workers everywhere. Although the Red and A3 systems may use padding or stretchy fabric to soften the edges, the tyranny of the 24-hour-work day is undeniable. It is a state that some workers now call "24/ 7," "e-mail jail" or being "in the blur." 
"It's like velvet handcuffs," said Eric Kuhn, a consultant to an international public relations firm who now lives in Paris and works on a global time clock. "The digital era has taken 9 to 5 and turned it into a constant flow of connectedness that becomes extremely demanding." 
So while a pillow keyboard or scarf communication system may appear to be on the outer fringes of plausibility, the concepts may not be far from the truth -- conjuring up a future of eternal diligence where the worker never gets a break, even during sleeping hours, but rather is eternally chained to the humming demands of technology. Very comfortably, though.

HEADLINE: Dogfight forDollars On Capitol Hill 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE video shows a flair for the dramatic.
 A crowd anxiously watches a pilot climb into a sleek, futuristic-looking jet. The engines whine, the plane rises slowly like a hulking prehistoric bird and the onlookers explode, cheering with joy and relief. 
 The trailer for a new Tom Hanks film? Try the latest promotional video for Lockheed Martin's experimental plane, the X-35 -- better known as the Joint Strike Fighter. 
The video is part of an extravagant Lockheed promotional kit that includes CD-ROM images of test flights, glossy photographs and a videotape of the aircraft breaking the sound barrier. And that is just one piece of a multimillion-dollar lobbying, advertising and marketing campaign aimed at beating its competition, Boeing, for what could be the most lucrative military contract, worth more than $200 billion. 
"This is the future for both Lockheed and Boeing," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. "The stakes are huge."
Lockheed is hardly the only military contractor mounting an aggressive campaign here. The season for lobbying by the military industry is in full bloom, and contractors are inundating Congress with Power Point briefings, shuttling officials to test sites and factories, hiring top-drawer lobbyists and showering lawmakers with campaign contributions.
The reason for all the activity is a confluence of major decisions expected this fall:
* The Pentagon is scheduled to award contracts not only for the Joint Strike Fighter, but also for the DD-21 destroyer, which could be the most important shipbuilding program of the next two decades. 
* The Pentagon must decide whether to block either General Dynamics or Northrop Grumman from acquiring Newport News Shipbuilding, the nation's only builder of aircraft carriers.
* As soon as Congress returns on Tuesday from its summer recess, it will begin what is expected to be a contentious debate on the size of the Pentagon budget for the 2002 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. The first hearings are on Wednesday, and many Democrats are pushing to trim President Bush's proposed $33 billion increase. Though the increase would be the largest since the mid-1980's, many industry officials had hoped for more from a Republican president.
* By the end of this month, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld will complete the Quadrennial Defense Review, mandated by Congress, that will set the size and shape of the armed forces, provide a template for future budgets and help determine the fate of an array of billion-dollar programs.
* Also this month, the armed services will begin outlining their budgets for the 2003 fiscal year, the year when Mr. Rumsfeld has vowed to make major decisions on weapons programs. And because of the rapidly declining federal surplus, he is expected to require the services to find cuts to help pay for their favorite systems.
"There is no question that we probably cannot afford every weapon system" in development, President Bush said in late August. "This administration is going to have to winnow them down."
The outcome is vital to a host of major companies, including United Defense, Northrop Grumman, TRW and Raytheon. Not surprisingly, they have been furiously working the marble corridors of Capitol Hill and the pale yellow hallways of the Pentagon to keep their programs alive and well. Recent lobbying reports indicate that military contractors are likely to spend nearly $60 million on lobbying this year, less than the communications or banking industries but more than lawyers and labor unions combined. Of that total, Lockheed and Boeing together account for more than $10 million.
In recent weeks, their work has ranged far and wide.
One day in June, one of the Joint Strike Fighter prototypes at Lockheed passed a crucial test, lifting off and landing vertically. The company immediately dispatched a video of the event to CNN.
Within 24 hours, Boeing completed a similarly complex maneuver with its prototype, the X-32: taking off on a shortened runway, then hovering and landing vertically. The company quickly sent a video to CNN, too. 
But the next morning, CNN began running a segment on the Joint Strike Fighter that used only the Lockheed video. Phones began ringing and managers started screaming in Boeing's Joint Strike Fighter test office at the Naval Air Station in Patuxent River, Md. 
"My hair was turning white by the minute," recalled Denny Kline, communications director for Boeing's Joint Strike Fighter. He spent hours on the phone cajoling CNN clerks and producers to find the Boeing videotape, which was eventually spliced into the report.
SO it goes in the hottest competition for Pentagon dollars in many years. 
On Oct. 26, the Pentagon is scheduled to choose, in a winner-take-all competition, between Lockheed and Boeing proposals for the fighter-bomber, which would replace aging aircraft in three services: Air Force F-16's and A-10's, Navy F-14's and F-18's and Marine Corps Harriers. 
To the winner would go the bountiful contract to deliver nearly 3,000 of the jets by the end of the decade to the United States and Britain, which has been a partner in the program.
Along with it would go the promise of thousands more sales to other allied nations, like Turkey, Norway and Israel. And after all the planes are delivered, the maintenance, spare parts and training contracts could be worth hundreds of billions more.
The loser, many military experts and Wall Street analysts predict, may be forced out of the tactical fighter business by the end of the decade, when production of other fighters, like F-22's and F-18's, winds down, leaving only the Joint Strike Fighter.
The Pentagon has argued that the winner-take-all system will lead to lower costs and better designs. Some military officials, however, are now concerned that the armed forces will be left with just one supplier of fighter jets by 2010 and are advocating that the work be split between the two companies. But it is not clear that the bidders would even accept that arrangement, and for now, the department plans to award the contract to just one team. 
As if the fierce competition was not enough, Boeing and Lockheed have also worried that Mr. Rumsfeld may scale back or delay the program, as has been recommended by some influential military analysts. 
The concept of the Joint Strike Fighter, as developed by the Clinton administration, was for a relatively affordable workhorse plane with advanced stealth technology and electronics. At about $35 million a plane, the Joint Strike Fighter would cost one-fifth the price of the more sophisticated F-22.
To control costs, the Pentagon proposed using essentially the same aircraft for three services, with modifications to suit each one. The Navy would get a plane with longer wings that could land on carriers, the Marines one that could hover and land vertically in tight spots and the Air Force a version that would use conventional runways. The ability to share designs, parts and technological skill among the services would reduce costs sharply, Pentagon officials have said. And they contend that selling the planes to NATO and Asian allies would make it easier for the United States to conduct joint military operations overseas.
Talk within the industry and the Pentagon of the program's demise has diminished in recent weeks, as the Bush administration has called for spending $1.5 billion on the program for the coming year, enough to continue development. But that has not slowed the pace of promotion.
Over the summer, both companies shuttled reporters, Congressional aides and Pentagon officials to witness test flights at the Patuxent River base and at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Lockheed was so concerned that Boeing's prototype was receiving more attention at Patuxent River, an hour from Capitol Hill, that it briefly considered bringing its Marine Corps prototype east from California this summer. 
In the past year, both companies have bolstered their already large lobbying stables with big names. Lockheed retained Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, who has close ties to the administration. Boeing has hired Rudy de Leon, the deputy secretary of defense in the final months of the Clinton administration, to run its Washington office.
Although Mr. De Leon is barred from lobbying on military matters for one year, he was seen recently patrolling the hallways outside a House Armed Services Committee meeting, where he said he was renewing acquaintances.
The companies have also waged a battle of newspaper advertising in Washington, heralding every new testing advance with full-page glory. "If we've done this once, we've done it a thousand times," a Boeing ad boasted in The Washington Post on July 9, referring to short takeoffs and vertical landings by its Marine Corps version. Lockheed has parried with ads almost daily in The Post, highlighting the successes of its program. "Proof through performance," many of the ads say.
And with the help of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, both have worked hard to enlist support from Congress, particularly lawmakers from Texas, Missouri, Washington and California, where thousands of Joint Strike Fighter jobs are in the offing. One of the strongest selling points on Capitol Hill is that parts for the plane would be built in more than half the states. Boeing has also promised to build a $250 million assembly plant near Lambert-St. Louis International Airport; Lockheed contends that winning the contract will save 7,000 jobs in Fort Worth. 
"We've spent a good deal of time on Congress, making sure they understand the message on why J.S.F. is important," said Charles Thomas Burbage, a Lockheed executive vice president who is general manager for its Joint Strike Fighter program.
When President Bush was elected, many military industry officials quietly cheered. The industry had contributed nearly $9 million to Republican candidates last year, twice as much as to Democrats, in the hope that a Republican administration and Congress would bolster military spending sharply.
Battered by a decade of post-cold-war downsizing and consolidation, many people in the industry had hoped for a return to the heyday of the Reagan administration, when Pentagon spending on new weapons was double the $60 billion procurement budget of last year, measured in constant 2000 dollars. 
"We believe the backdrop for the sector looks good, and significant increases in the Pentagon's budget will continue well into the next decade," a report by Schwab Capital Markets predicted in January.
But things have not turned out so rosy. The slowing economy and President Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut have sharply squeezed the federal surplus, leaving little money for significant military spending increases for years to come.
And though the Bush administration has called for a $33 billion increase in 2002, above the current $296 billion Pentagon budget, most of that growth would go toward health care, salaries and spare parts -- not the expensive jets, ships and tanks that military contractors produce.
"There is a more subdued environment now than investors had hoped for," said Byron K. Callan, an aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch.
At the same time, the administration's talk of "skipping a generation" of weapons technology -- moving more toward robots and remote-controlled systems -- has created deep anxieties among makers of current-generation ships, jets and howitzers.
Some companies, of course, are hoping for sweeping changes that would divert dollars from traditional programs into high-technology systems, like space-based lasers, unmanned submarines and digital battlefield communications equipment. And missile defense contractors, led by Boeing, are counting on the administration to push for huge spending increases on their programs to fuel profits.
But full-scale production of many of those systems remains years away. And military contractors cannot reap large profits from research and development. The big money is in the production of heavy conventional weapons like ships and aircraft -- and those are the programs the industry is pushing hardest.
"This is an industry that has to be nurtured and sustained," said Lawrence F. Skibbie, a retired Army lieutenant general who is the departing president of the National Defense Industrial Association, a trade group representing 900 military contractors. "We just can't ignore it and then every 10 or 15 years when there is an emergency say, 'Let's produce something.' " 
In June, James P. McCarthy, a retired Air Force general who was chairman of a Pentagon panel assessing weapons programs, sent a chill through the nation's shipbuilding industry when he announced that a proposed next-generation destroyer, the DD-21, was not "truly transformational" -- the code word for favored weapons programs in the Bush administration.
Officials at the Bath Iron Works in Maine and at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi, the shipyards competing for the DD-21 contract, sprang into action. They called allies on Capitol Hill like Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, urging them to respond. And they found a sympathetic member of the panel, Stanley R. Arthur, a retired Navy admiral, to counter General McCarthy's remarks. "I certainly consider DD-21," Admiral Arthur said in a statement, "to be transformational."
WITHIN days, General McCarthy issued a statement clarifying that he was not advocating that the program be canceled or delayed. It was a hard-fought, if small, victory for the shipbuilders in a trying year for the $30 billion DD-21 program.
"We went to members of the press and said, 'This is wrong,' " a shipbuilding industry official said. "We also made sure the issue was raised on the Hill, so it wouldn't go unchallenged. But it's a difficult thing."
With the Navy having shrunk to 316 ships today from more than 500 ships in 1990, shipbuilding has been one of the most battered of the military industries. For Bath, owned by General Dynamics, and Ingalls, recently acquired by Northrop, the DD-21 program was to be the future. Yet it hangs in the balance.
The ship is intended to carry more Tomahawk cruise missiles and bigger guns than any current destroyer, to be stealthy enough for missions near shore and to operate with just one-third the crew of a typical destroyer. The Navy has proposed buying 32 of the $750 million ships over the next two decades.
"DD-21 is being designed to be the most capable, most survivable ship ever to sail the oceans of the earth," read a full-page ad that the Northrop team placed in The Washington Post in July.
That is the message trumpeted by lawmakers from the shipbuilding states in letters, Congressional hearings and private meetings with Pentagon officials.
"If you give the fire-support mission and the leap-ahead technologies of DD-21 thorough consideration, you will agree this nation needs to have available the capabilities promised by the DD-21 program," said one letter to Mr. Rumsfeld, signed by a bipartisan group of nine senators, including Ms. Collins; Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the minority leader; and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Their efforts have helped persuade the administration to seek more than $600 million to continue design work on the DD-21, but the program's long-range future remains cloudy.
In June, the Pentagon delayed selecting a contractor until Mr. Rumsfeld finishes his review, raising new doubts about its fate. The program has yet to win the undivided support of the Navy itself, where some commanders would rather spend the money on new aircraft carriers, submarines or fighter jets. 
The key to survival, industry officials said, will be to have the Pentagon award a contract, allowing initial construction. Then jobs will open up in more districts, broadening the ship's support on Capitol Hill.
Almost from the day that Mr. Rumsfeld took office, it became conventional Pentagon wisdom that a mobile artillery system known as the Crusader would be canceled. It was too heavy, too expensive and did not belong in the faster, lighter force the Army is trying to build, its many critics said.
But thanks in part to an aggressive counteroffensive by the Crusader's well-connected manufacturer, United Defense, and its allies in the Army and Congress, the program shows signs of surviving. 
When, for instance, one of Mr. Rumsfeld's review panels recommended canceling the program last spring, the Army came back swinging, inundating Mr. Rumsfeld and his aides, news reporters and Congressional officials with briefings on why it must have 480 Crusaders at a cost of $11 billion.
"It is a critical requirement," Lt. Gen. Paul J. Kern, the chief acquisition officer for the Army, said in a recent interview. "Our soldiers are very good, very well trained, but we're outgunned."
Such arguments are very compelling on Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers are loath to attack the top priorities of the armed services. And United Defense, owned by the Carlyle Group, an investment firm led by Frank C. Carlucci, a defense secretary under President Reagan, helped its cause by persuading a powerful ally, Representative J. C. Watts Jr., the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, to press Mr. Rumsfeld about the Crusader.
"It still has opponents at the highest levels of the Pentagon," said an aide to Mr. Watts, who represents the Oklahoma district where the Crusader would be assembled. "But Rumsfeld is aware of its Congressional support."
CONCEIVED in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the computerized Crusader, with its 155-millimeter cannon, is intended to fire shells farther, faster and more accurately than any artillery gun in existence. One Crusader will do the work of several of the Army's current artillery systems, United Defense says.
"The best deserve the best," boasts a a company advertisement.
But the gun is also bulky: the Army ordered United Defense to slim down the Crusader, which rides on tracks, and its resupply vehicle to about 80 tons, from 110 tons.
The Crusader is United Defense's main new program, and the company has nurtured a close alliance with the Army to keep it alive. Artillery soldiers, for example, were intimately involved in early design phases, recommending improvements to the steering mechanism, the placement of video displays and the location of maintenance panels.
Like the Crusader, the V-22 Osprey offers a good example of how difficult it can be to cancel a program that has strong support from all three legs of the "Iron Triangle": the military industry, senior uniformed officers and Congress.
After two crashes last year killed 23 marines and raised sharp questions about the Osprey's safety, cancellation of the $40 billion V-22 program seemed imminent. Its future became even darker when the Marines disclosed in January that maintenance records had been falsified, suggesting that the Osprey -- already delayed and over budget -- was being rushed into production. 
On top of that, Vice President Dick Cheney had tried to cancel the Osprey while he was secretary of defense under President Bush's father.
Yet the Marines have never wavered in their dogged assertion that the Osprey -- which can hover like a helicopter and cruise like a airplane -- was essential to their combat strategy. No helicopter could fly as fast or as far, senior Marine Corps officers argued time and again.
The Osprey's supporters have faced a major problem getting their message out: neither the Marine Corps nor the manufacturers, Boeing and the Bell Helicopter unit of Textron, wanted to lobby too strenuously for the program, out of concerns of offending the dead marines' families, industry officials said. So it fell to the program's advocates on Capitol Hill, led by Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, to carry that load.
Mr. Weldon, whose district is near an Osprey plant, revitalized a defunct coalition of Osprey supporters in Congress and helped organize a Capitol Hill conference extolling the commercial and military uses of tilt-rotor technology. Among the speakers at that conference were Gen. James L. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, and senior Bell and Boeing executives.
The effort has paid off: the Pentagon has asked Congress for $1 billion to buy 12 Ospreys next year, though it has delayed full production while safety features are added.
In his zest to support the program, Mr. Weldon even attacked a European company, Augusta Westland, when it tried to promote its EH-101 helicopter as an alternative to the V-22 several months ago. 
"The Marines know what they need, and no marketing effort by another company will make a difference," Mr. Weldon said in an interview. "This is not some contest to see who can hire the most lobbyists."
BUT while programs like the V-22, the Joint Strike Fighter, the DD-21 and the Crusader may receive money in the 2002 defense budget, their long-term futures are likely to remain in doubt for months, possibly years.
The shrinking budget surplus will make it almost impossible for the administration to build a missile defense system, develop "leap ahead" weapon technology and buy all the jets, howitzers, helicopters and ships that the armed services have requested. Inevitably, some programs must be cut or delayed, analysts say.
Still, it is also unlikely that any program will be killed outright; that is not the Pentagon way. Typically, unwanted programs are kept in development, stretched out over many years and gradually starved of resources. Given enough time, even the most dogged contractors will give up on programs that have no future. 
"Like old soldiers, big programs don't die," said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a military policy organization based in Arlington, Va. "They just fade away." Until then, the stakes are enormous.

Amid BuildingBoom, Wariness on Stocks

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
WHILE much of the economy has sagged this year, home building has been a conspicuous exception. 
 Seven interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have helped to keep mortgage rates low. Supply has barely kept up with demand, prices have risen, and builders have generated healthy profits. Shares of publicly traded builders have soared while the broad market has declined. 
 But home building has always been cyclical, and some investors are worried that the good times are almost over. Builders reported that July orders for new houses rose a mere 3 percent, compared with 10 percent in June. Home prices in Denver, Austin and San Francisco have weakened.
Still, several analysts argue that investing in building companies makes sense now. "I'm not trying to argue there's not cyclicality, but my whole point is, that's not the point," said Jim Wilson, an analyst at Jolson Merchant Partners in San Francisco.
He bases his optimism on his belief that mortgage rates will remain low, that tight supply will keep prices high and that immigration will fuel sales.
He recommends D.R. Horton, a company based in Arlington, Tex., that has had earnings growth for 23 consecutive years. Horton, which now trades at $25.24, has become one of the nation's largest builders by acquiring companies all over the country. "It can purchase everything at lower prices -- lumber, faucets, tools, labor," he said.
John Stanley, an analyst in New York for UBS Warburg, who is upbeat about the industry, said: "Consolidation is the primary story here. Not that the market is growing by leaps and bounds, but that a management is very ambitious and has a good track record of making acquisitions."
The top 10 builders account for 17 percent of the United States market, double the share eight years ago, and Mr. Stanley said he expected consolidation to continue. The largest builders have a national reach and are better able to weather local downturns. 
He recommends KB Home of Los Angeles, which trades at $32.37. Its stock has been hurt by fears that it is overexposed in Northern California. 
But Bruce Karatz, the chief executive of KB Home, said, "We're not just California." Last month, the company acquired Trademark Home Builders of Jacksonville, Fla. The company also operates in the southwestern and central United States and, through a subsidiary, in France.
Mr. Stanley also favors the Centex Corporation, a Dallas builder with wide geographic reach that provides financial services, pest control, lawn care and security. Centex's financial arm has given it "two earnings pistons, instead of one," he said.
Some analysts, however, are wary of building stocks. Barbara Allen, senior analyst at Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Inc., an investment research firm in New York, said, "There is just too much optimism in the face of a slowing economy." August orders for new homes are expected to be weak, she said, and shares may decline as a result. 
The builders are bracing for that possibility. "Our foot is both on the brake and accelerator at the same time," said Stuart Miller, chief executive of the Lennar Corporation of Miami. 
Builders' stocks, on average, have traded at price-to-earnings ratios of 5 to 8, compared with the mid-20s for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Some analysts say home-building shares are being punished for poor performance during cyclical downturns.
NVR, a builder in McLean, Va., that is another favorite of Mr. Stanley, has been buying back its shares and now trades at $$161. He noted that NVR, whose business is concentrated around Washington and Baltimore, has a return on equity in excess of 70 percent this year. 
Ivy Zelman, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said the sector was undervalued. Ms. Zelman buys when a stock's price-to-book ratio -- its share price divided by shareholders' equity per share -- is near 1, and sells when it is near 2. She favors Pulte Homes in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. and KB Home.
Despite the strengths of individual companies, Ms. Zelman said, the stocks tended to trade in tandem, and "there's negative sentiment swirling out there."
Stephen Kim, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said: "These stocks are too cheap, and over the long haul, you probably will make money on them. But over the next couple months, no."

HEADLINE: Appraisers Take Measure of Uncertainty 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
SHORTLY after 8 a.m. one recent workday, as an endless stream of cars headed toward New York City on Interstate 684, Anthony Bucciero was in high spirits as he headed in his Jeep Cherokee for the northern Westchester County hamlet of Goldens Bridge.
 He was energized not merely because he was headed in the opposite direction of the rush hour traffic but also because he was on his way to do something he greatly enjoys -- appraising houses for banks and mortgage companies to determine their value. "I've been doing appraisals since 1988, and I've never grown tired of it," said the 33-year-old Mr. Bucciero. 
 Yet Mr. Bucciero is also aware that the real estate appraisal industry that he has known these 13 years is being transformed. The biggest transformation -- or threat, as many of the nation's 85,000 appraisers view it -- is the recent harnessing of computers to online databases, resulting in speedy valuations often without a formal appraisal. 
For the last nine years Mr. Bucciero has owned his own business in North White Plains, Epic Appraisals. On a typical work day he is in the office around 7 a.m., then off to do two appraisals before returning to the office to wrestle with paperwork, then home in time for dinner.
With a staff of 12, including five women, Epic has one appraiser each in Rockland County, Putnam County, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, as well as two on Long Island. Mr. Bucciero does a lot of appraisals in Westchester, and some of Epic's other appraisers help out in the county. While Epic also appraises office buildings, stores and other commercial property, the company's financial pillar is residential appraisals. The value of a property as established by an appraiser determines how much loan officers and underwriters will lend an applicant for a new mortgage or for a refinancing.
Computerized valuation systems have the potential to shave millions of dollars nationwide off the costs of home ownership each year, but appraisers argue that they are a shortcut filled with potential potholes for homeowners.
Such systems have existed in some form for about a decade. But it took improvements in the technology and the adoption of proprietary models by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the nation's biggest buyers of mortgage loans from banks and other lenders, to increase the trust in Automated Valuation Models, or A.V.M.'s. 
These systems provide valuations by collating such information as the age, size and most recent selling price of a house and updating the information according to how much prices on comparable houses have risen or declined since the last sale.
Greg A. Dennis, the president and chief operating officer of LandSafe Appraisal Services Inc. in Plano, Tex. -- a subsidiary of Countrywide Credit Industries in Calabasas, Calif. -- said the automated valuation models can analyze a couple of hundred "comparables," as basically similar houses in basically similar neighborhoods are called, in 30 seconds or less. In fact, he added, "The A.V.M.'s were developed in response to the lender's demand for speed."
With the electronic valuations, Fannie Mae no longer requires every new house in a subdivision to have an individual property appraisal. For some other valuations it requires only a "drive by" appraisal -- that is, a look at the property from the street. "When we can confirm that the sales price is reasonable for that property and location, we may not require an appraisal," said Mark T. Simpson, director of Fannie Mae's single-family mortgage business.
This April, Freddie Mac began authorizing the use of fully automated appraisals for the first time. After determining market value, its automated underwriting Loan Prospector software allows homeowners with good credit ratings and a down payment of at least 20 percent to skip a formal appraisal on loans up to $275,000, although the homeowner or lender can still request a standard appraisal. 
But with a Loan Prospector valuation available for $50 or $200, depending on the borrower's downpayment or credit, and with Freddie Mac estimating that electronic appraisals will save borrowers $500 million a year in appraisal fees, it is not hard to imagine which appraisal most borrowers and lenders are likely to choose -- even though traditional appraisers contend that the automated valuation models have many limitations that can be overcome only by a full on-site walk-through.
AS if the size and muscle of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac markets were not trouble enough for the traditional appraiser, a number of real estate and loan companies are also working to develop electronic systems, and some, like LandSafe, already have them in place. In March through May of this year, the most recent quarter for which it has data, LandSafe performed more than 100,000 automated valuation models a month, more than twice as many as it did a year earlier.
All the valuations were done in conjunction with automated underwriting, which analyzes such things as an applicant's credit and collateral in determining whether to make the loan, and prequalification, which takes into account income, assets and liabilities. None of the valuations were done in lieu of a traditional appraisal. 
With such technological tools available, it is no wonder that Tom Motta, president-elect of the 19,000-member Appraisal Institute in Chicago, recently said, "We're clearly in a new economy, and when things change, you either have to deal with it or find another business to be in."
Mike L. Austin, the president of the American Society of Appraisers, with almost 6,000 members, said there would always be a need for appraisers who do traditional appraisals. But like Mr. Motta, he is not brimming with confidence about the future. "The various appraisal societies have either stable or declining memberships," he said, "and even those whose numbers have gone up now have a lot of part-time appraisers." 
Mr. Bucciero said he had no intention of finding another business to be in, but neither is he oblivious to the challenges posed by computer technology.
As he pulls up to his first house of the day, a one and a half story contemporary home on 4.5 acres, he said of the computerized models: "They can do a lot of things fast, and they're especially good for urban areas, where houses are close together. But we're the only people going out to look at every single house and looking at it as if we were prospective buyers." 
Many other appraisers feel the same way. 
Taylor Beerbower, who founded Mulberry Street Appraisals in Fairfield, Conn., said that while the computers are making inroads, without walking through a house there is no way to see whether there is an alarm system, how many bathrooms there are or what the bedrooms and closets look like. "Even a system that's equipped to handle a lot of tract houses in the same neighborhood and built at the same time," he said, "will more than likely miss the changes that they've probably undergone in the past 40 or 50 years."
Still, while Mr. Beerbower has little faith in electronic appraisals, he does not shun modern technology. On the contrary, he employs an assistant to drive him to and from the jobs while he loads into his laptop the notes he will put into his appraisals. 
Appraisers acknowledge that they, too, occasionally miss details in a house, for example, misstating the number of square feet. "Sometimes it's because there are a lot of lousy appraisers just as there are lots of incompetents in every profession," said Ken Russ of Realty Appraisal Inc. in Nutley, N.J.
A visitor would not get that impression from tailing Mr. Bucciero during his inspections. After taking photos of the house and street with his digital camera, he measures the outside of the house with a roller tape, a device that resembles a child's push toy with a digital counter. Meanwhile, he is also observing the deck, the lawn, the gutters and roof, before beginning his tour of each room -- even climbing the pull-down stairs that lead to the attic.
During his 45 minutes at the property, he jots down dimensions and notes for the report that he will submit to the lender, in this case a mortgage broker in Purchase, N.Y. That report, usually 10 or more pages, plus the photos, will include the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report, a standard two-page form filled with details about the property, including such things as real estate taxes, the driveway surface and the condition of patio, porch and fence.
"Many owners confuse appraisers with home inspectors," Mr. Bucciero said. "We don't get into the condition of the mechanical equipment or appliances," he said, "but if we see a puddle near a boiler or what looks like a leaky oil tank, we'll suggest that the lender have an inspector go out." Because of the confusion, many homeowners think that getting an appraisal means they get a home inspection with it, he said.
Elaine Schrittwieser, an Epic appraiser working mainly in Putnam County, and one of a growing number of women in what until about a decade ago had been an almost exclusively male domain, said that although it usually takes two to four days to write up a detailed appraisal for the mortgage company or bank, "a lot of people want to know the amount of the appraisal right then and there."
And heaven forbid if the appraiser comes up with a assessment below what the owners think their property is worth -- even if, as often happens, Mrs. Schrittwieser said, "You point out to them that the closet you see in the house you're appraising is not the bedroom that they claimed it was."
Inflated expectations are, of course, unique neither to Putnam County nor to New York state. "I've had mortgage companies say to me, 'How dare you appraise that house for such-and-such,' " said Larry J. Sharpe, an appraiser who also owns Sharpe Realty in Newark. "I've also had calls from buyers, mortgage representatives, underwriters, realtors and the owners' lawyers calling to complain," he added, "and they're all singing the same song." 
The appraisers, however, say the complainers are singing off tune, confusing them (or more likely, trying to confuse them) with the difference between the appraised value of a property and the selling price -- the latter a purely arbitrary amount that a buyer is willing to pay.
"That's how you often wind up with the buyer or lender saying to the appraiser, 'If Joe Doaks wants to pay more than the house is worth, who are you to say no?' " Mr. Sharpe said. "He wants that house, and let's say he's willing to pay 10 grand more, maybe 10 grand's nothing to him. So they climb all over you."
Mr. Sharpe and other appraisers say that argument would be valid as long as the real estate market continued going up. "But when the cycle comes to a halt," Mr. Sharpe added, "you wind up in a fix like back in the 1980's when a lot of houses went into foreclosure, and the lenders took a big hit." 
With only the slightest hint that he's joking, Mr. Bucciero said, "One of the things you run into all the time is every homeowner thinking he has the nicest house on the nicest block in the nicest neighborhood." If your appraisal does not reflect that, he added, "Some of the owners go ballistic." One way they or the lender or the broker show their dissatisfaction is by "neglecting" to pay for the appraisal.
With interest rates low and the value of houses still high, some homeowners have been refinancing their mortgages, thereby lowering their monthly payments and taking cash out of the property. In the three months that ended on June 30, according to Freddie Mac, 57 percent of its loans were for mortgage refinancing, up from 52 percent in the first quarter. 
Many appraisers draw the line at cooperatives, however because, Mr. Bucciero said, "the sales of co-ops are not public information, there's no recorded deed, and in Manhattan there's no Multiple Listing Service to get the information about sales." There are no deeds because owners of co-ops own shares in the corporation that owns their building, along with the right to occupy their apartment. 
The business of appraising has seen significant changes in recent years. When Mr. Bucciero decided in 1988 to switch from being a foreclosure inspector for a bank in Connecticut to become an appraiser with a company in Pelham, N.Y., there were no requirements. "The company trained us," he said, "but soon afterward you had to be licensed." 
Licensing grew out of the savings and loan industry collapse, which led Congress to require that real estate appraisers meet certain standards, to be spelled out by the states. Mr. Austin, the president of the American Society of Appraisers, said the 50 states have roughly similar requirements, including on-the-job apprenticeship and classroom study. 
The visit on which an appraisal is based can last for less than 20 minutes for a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom house to an hour or more for a big old Victorian. And while the national appraisal cost averaged $334 last year, according to Freddie Mac, it probably averaged $400 in the tristate area. But, depending on the size of a property and the time needed for an inspection, the cost can reach $1,000 for the multimillion dollar houses and condominiums that have dotted Manhattan and the suburbs during the last decade. 
"It sounds like a fast, easy way to make a few hundred dollars," Mr. Bucciero said. "But people don't realize the time taken up by research, writing up the reports and returning again and again. If it's a construction loan, where lenders parcel out the money as the work progresses, it's not unusual to go back seven or eight times to update the appraisal."
As he prepared to drive across the county to Croton-on-Hudson to look at a house for a mortgage banker in Newburgh, in Orange County, Mr. Bucciero added: "But I'm not complaining. I can't think of anything else I'd rather do for a living."

HEADLINE: The House That Rudy Built 

 BODY:
Mayor Giuliani may dismiss Andrew Zimbalist, who has made exhaustive studies of the impact of professional sports on cities, as "Castro's economist" (Nicholas Dawidoff, Aug. 12). But it's Giuliani who sounds more like the dictator when he explains why New Yorkers weren't asked whether their taxes should build ballparks for the multimillionaires Fred Wilpon and George Steinbrenner: "Because they would have voted it down." 
Last time I checked, that was the way a democracy worked.
 I attended a Cyclones game in Coney Island. It's a lovely little park, and the prices are great. But how anyone thinks 30-odd home games a year are going to revitalize an area as economically depressed as Coney Island is beyond imagining.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Racial Admissions; 
The Path to Diversity? Different Differences

BYLINE:  By DAVID J. GARROW; David J. Garrow is Presidential Distinguished Professor at Emory University School of Law.

 BODY:
A FEDERAL appeals court ruling last week striking down the University of Georgia's use of racial preferences in its freshman admissions program once again places the issue of affirmative action at the forefront of America's legal agenda. If Georgia appeals, and if the Supreme Court chooses to hear the case, the resulting decision could well be the court's most decisive statement on race since its landmark 1978 ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.
 But even if the case is not heard by the high court -- and there are many reasons why it may not be -- last week's unanimous opinion from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit should, if properly understood, fundamentally alter the debate about the use of racial preferences in college and graduate school admissions. 
 The university admitted its first African-American students in 1961 and began meaningful desegregation only in 1970. In 1989 the federal Office of Civil Rights ruled that Georgia had completed the necessary remedial steps and that "no additional desegregation measures will be required." The university is thus unable to invoke its own history to justify a reparative motive for its use of racial preferences, and is left to defend its program only as a means of ensuring a diverse student body. 
The linchpin of the argument that student racial diversity is a "compelling" interest is the opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the 1978 Bakke case, which struck down a racial quota system used by the University of California at Davis. "Ethnic diversity, however, is only one element in a range of factors a university may properly consider in attaining a heterogeneous student body," he declared.
Justice Powell said that an admissions process using race must "consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant." To focus "solely on ethnic diversity," he held, "would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine diversity."
But that, according to last week's ruling, is exactly what Georgia's program did. The university used a numerical computation in which all nonwhite applicants were awarded an extra half-point, significantly boosting their chances for acceptance. The admissions director testified the half-point figure had been chosen from "out of the blue." 
Writing last week on behalf of the appeals panel, Judge Stanley Marcus, a New Yorker whom President Bill Clinton promoted from trial judge in 1997, found that Georgia's racial bonus "does not even come close" to meeting Justice Powell's standard. 
"Individuals who come from economically disadvantaged homes," Judge Marcus wrote, "individuals who have lived or traveled widely abroad; individuals from remote or rural areas; individuals who speak foreign languages; individuals with unique communications skills (such as an ability to read Braille or communicate with the deaf); and individuals who have overcome personal adversity or social hardship -- none of the characteristics that make these kinds of individuals 'diverse' are taken into account."
 BUT he also emphasized that his view of diversity has never been endorsed by any Supreme Court majority. Justice Powell's opinion controlled the outcome in Bakke, but it was signed only by him. 
"The status of student body diversity as a compelling interest justifying a racial preference in university admissions is an open question," Judge Marcus wrote, and "is one that, because of its great importance, warrants consideration by the Supreme Court."
Supporters of affirmative action, worried that the Georgia case's weaknesses will yield a decision ruling out racial considerations entirely, are calling upon the state's attorney general, Thurbert Baker, and Gov. Roy Barnes not to appeal. 
Affirmative action proponents would rather see significant rulings emerge from two pending cases, both of which challenge admissions programs at the University of Michigan. One involved the use of a racial bonus in undergraduate admissions; a federal trial judge upheld it last December. The other concerned racial advantages in law school admissions; a different trial judge ruled in March that it was unconstitutional. Appeals of both will be heard by a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati on Oct. 23. The university, with no history of racial segregation in its admissions practices, will, like Georgia, be advancing only a student diversity argument.
Affirmative action questions are certainly on the minds of the nine high court justices, since on Oct. 31 they will hear for a second time a case challenging limited racial preferences in a federal transportation contracting program. Whether it be the Georgia case this fall or the Sixth Circuit's ruling on the two Michigan programs in 2002, the time when the high court will have to weigh in on the constitutionality of racial preferences in university admissions is inexorably moving closer.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/John W. and John C. Thompson; 
Thompson Plumb Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
IN 1993, John C. Thompson, a newly minted M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, returned home to Madison, Wis., to help his father build the family money management business. He did almost everything from answering telephones to keeping the books. 
 "I was willing to do whatever it took to help the firm," said Mr. Thompson, now 32, "even when it meant driving four hours to River Falls, Wis., to talk to truck drivers about their 401(k) plan." 
 A year later, he became co-manager of the family's new $4 million mutual fund and helped his father, John W. Thompson, now 58, build it into the $165 million Thompson Plumb Growth fund. 
"We're looking for good growth companies selling at lower prices, anticipating some improvement in the business fundamentals that would allow the price-earnings multiple to expand and earnings to increase," the older Mr. Thompson said.
The fund returned 21.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Thursday, taking secondplace among 774 large blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc. The category returned 4.1 percent, on average, versus 4.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500. For the 12 months through Thursday, the fund returned 29.9 percent, versus declines of 24 percent for both the category and the S.& P. 
The fund's adviser, Thompson Plumb & Associates, also runs the $75 million Balanced and $25 million Bond funds, plus $1 billion for institutions and individuals. The "Plumb" in the name is Thomas G. Plumb, a co-founder of the firm and manager of the Balanced fund.
The Thompsons use no computer screens to select the 65 or 70 stocks in the Growth fund from United States companies with market capitalizations above $1 billion. Instead, they review financial news services, read Wall Street research and attend conferences, looking for established, growing companies.
Specifically, they want companies with minimum returns on equity of 15 percent to 20 percent a year, on average, over 5 or 10 years and gross profit margins of at least 50 percent. "High margins indicate a lower level of competition in the field that the company operates in," the father said, adding that profitability could result from strong brand names, lower costs or technological advantages.
The managers often focus on companies with established consumer brands. Those stocks account for about 40 percent of the fund's assets, double the weighting that the S.& P. 500 gives such companies.
"Multiples are low, but we're still seeing good improvements in the growth rates of many consumer brand companies," the son said. "Many of them are multinational, and they would get a big boost to earnings should the dollar weaken."
To value a company, they establish historical ranges for the price-to-earnings ratio based on the 5- to 10-year history of the company and its peers. They buy shares at the low end of the range and sell when they approach or exceed the high end.
Many of their stocks are acquisition targets -- about 10 of the portfolio companies were acquired in the last 18 months. "We want to see a lot of earnings in the stocks that we buy," the father said. "Our stock selection criteria are the same as a company would use to buy a competitor or to make fold-in acquisitions." 
The fund owns shares of the Acxiom Corporation, a Little Rock, Ark., provider of data to direct marketers. Acxiom says it tracks 100,000 data sources covering every birth, death and real estate transaction in the country. The younger Mr. Thompson said the company has made an accounting change affecting when Acxiom recognizes revenue. 
"It will create a big lull in their revenues over the next 12 to 18 months," he said, "but it will help them in the long run." The company could be an acquisition target, he said, because of its desirable technology and relatively low price. The fund bought shares at $15.50 in October 1999; they are now at $12.74.
The fund's biggest position, at 4 percent of assets, is Coca-Cola, originally bought in August 1999 for $61.On Friday, it closed at $48.67. 
"It's the most recognized brand name in the world," he said. "They're going to benefit from expanded worldwide wealth. Soft drinks are still considered luxuries in China and the developing countries." 
He said he believes that earnings have stagnated partly because of continuing economic difficulties in Asia and the strength of the United States dollar, but he expects improvement when the dollar eventually weakens.
The fund also likes Merck, the drug company. "It's got a triple-A balance sheet," the elder Mr. Thompson said. "You can't get much better than that." 
Merck's earnings have grown at an annual average of 15 percent for 20 years, he added. Its shares have declined as patents have expired for drugs like Vasotec, used to treat hypertension, and Pepcid, for ulcers. That does not faze him, he said, because of new products, like Vioxx, an arthritis drug. "Merck and Coke will show earnings growth in a weakening economy, when the S.& P. companies have negative earnings." 
They first bought Merck shares at a split-adjusted $16.40 in November 1993; they now trade at $65.10

Damaged By the Dow

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
In late 1999 -- about the time when George W. Bush first announced his tax-cut plan -- I had lunch at a beer-and-pizza joint, the sort of place that has a TV over the bar where the patrons can watch ESPN. But the TV wasn't tuned to ESPN -- it was showing CNBC. I thought to myself, "This will end badly." And it has.
 The Dow first passed 10,000 in 1999. Although the index briefly dropped below that milestone in early 2000, that decline didn't really count -- it was a perverse side-effect of truly irrational exuberance, as investors deserted the boring old Dow for the Nasdaq. Last week, on the other hand, was the real thing: a broad market decline carried the Dow past 10,000 in the wrong direction. The era of the stock-market bubble has now well and truly ended. 
 But what a mess that bubble has left behind!
By now the direct economic impact of the bubble is a familiar story. During the years of booming stock prices, which were closely linked to euphoria about the "new economy," businesses invested frantically, sinking vast sums into information technology. Now, of course, many of those businesses realize that they invested far too much. And the overhang of excess capacity is likely to keep business investment depressed for years.
That's not an encouraging thought. But the direct economic consequences of the bubble are only half the story. The bubble also had a dire effect on our national politics.
After all, it wasn't an accident that the Bush tax plan was proposed just before the bubble popped. There was an intimate relationship between stock-market mania and tax-cut mania, a relationship that ran in both directions. 
On one side, in the late 1990's the right-wing media were enthusiastic stock boosters. The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, in particular, was extremely fond of crank theories about stock valuation, as long as they pointed upward. Remember "Dow 36,000"? And anyone who pointed out that such theories rested on fuzzy math, and suggested that the stocks could not be counted on to deliver high returns forever, was clearly a dangerous leftist -- after all, the stock market is the purest expression of capitalism, so anyone who doubts that market must be anti-capitalist, right? 
But the more important causation ran the other way: the stock bubble, alas, provided an environment in which deeply irresponsible policy proposals temporarily looked plausible.
It's important to realize how much of the late lamented budget surplus was the result of the bull market. Tax rates didn't increase between 1994 and 2000, but tax receipts as a share of G.D.P. surged, largely because of the extra taxes paid on all those capital gains. The result was a false sense that there was plenty of money in hand, that big tax cuts would fit comfortably into the budget. And the Bush tax plan was formulated when such delusions were at their height.
Now reality has started to sink in. Unfortunately, though the new realism may have come soon enough to prevent a disaster on Social Security -- for Mr. Bush's other signature policy proposal was also based on the delusions of a bubble economy -- it has come too late to prevent a disastrous tax cut.
Of course, you might wonder why Mr. Bush himself didn't have second thoughts -- why he thought that the exact same tax plan he proposed in the feverish bull-market days of late 1999 was still appropriate in the post-bubble economy of 2001. And his officials surely knew that tax receipts were dropping like a stone even as they were reassuring a docile Congress that everything was just fine.
But one thing we have learned about this administration is that it never responds to altered circumstances by changing its plans; all it does is change the sales pitch. So the tax cut was relabeled as a recession-fighting measure, a task for which it is peculiarly ill-suited. For that matter, the administration hasn't given up on Social Security privatization, either. Now that it can no longer entice people with visions of stock-market sugar plums, it has decided to scare them with imaginary crises instead.
In any case, immense damage has already been done. The stock-market bubble led to bad political decisions as well as bad business decisions; and we'll be paying the price for many years to come.

HEADLINE: A Primary Choice: Mark Green 

 BODY:
Nearly eight years with Rudolph Giuliani have helped New Yorkers appreciate what their city needs -- and needs to avoid -- in the next mayor. He has to be a leader, capable of taking the heat and pushing doggedly for his goals. He must hold onto the success in lowering crime and boosting business while reaching out to those who have been left behind. He should also be able to step outside his own ego to forge coalitions and listen to critics.
 Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, Public Advocate Mark Green, Comptroller Alan Hevesi and Council Speaker Peter Vallone are all mid-level Democratic officials who want to move up to a high-profile and high-pressure post. During the campaign, the city has watched to see who appears to be growing into the new role, handling himself with the confidence and dexterity it takes to run America's most challenging city. In the Democratic primary, Mark Green has shown the most evidence that he is evolving into a man who could be a successful mayor. 
 During his long career in politics, Mr. Green has demonstrated some, but not all, of the qualities New York City needs in its chief executive. He has always had political courage, and he does not buckle under fire. He was unafraid to take on Senator Alfonse D'Amato when other Democrats quailed at an unwinnable race. In his role as consumer affairs commissioner and later as public advocate, Mr. Green took on the tobacco industry, long before it was a safe target. He also, of course, battled frequently with Mr. Giuliani, spending years as the mayor's least-favorite Democrat until Mr. Hevesi took over the title a few weeks ago.
Mr. Green's opponents have argued that he does not have enough executive experience. But running New York City is a job so big that there may be no adequate training. Certainly as a federal prosecutor, Mr. Giuliani did not run an organization as large or as complicated as the one he took over when he was elected. Edward Koch had never managed anything more complicated than his Congressional staff. As voters, all we can do is look for the candidates who seem to have the leadership, toughness and intelligence to take command. Mr. Green scores high on all those qualities.
When the campaign began, our concerns about Mr. Green lay in other directions. We worried about his reputation for abrasiveness, for failing to listen to people he regarded as less well-informed or intelligent than himself. We wondered if he had the political finesse to reach a goal through negotiation rather than by calling a press conference. But as a candidate for mayor he has been extremely deft. By parading through the city arm in arm with former Police Commissioner William Bratton, he sent a reassuring signal about his commitment to controlling crime. Mr. Green has been in the forefront of the fight against police misconduct. Now he raises hope that his administration might be able to achieve the much-desired blend of safe streets and community-friendly law enforcement.
One of the most important jobs of the next mayor could be to weather an economic downturn, controlling costs while encouraging business growth. Mr. Green's early work toward ending mob control of commercial trash hauling -- an issue Mr. Giuliani carried into the limelight -- is a good example of how he is not afraid to tackle the entrenched interests that create unnecessary costs of doing business in the city. The city's other top priority is improving education. The candidates generally agree that teachers should get a large salary increase in return for more productivity and accountability. But Mr. Green's unusually cool relationship with the teachers' union might give him an advantage at the bargaining table.
Mr. Green is still not going to win the congeniality award in this race -- that prize would go, hands down, to Mr. Vallone. Mr. Green has an Al Gore-like difficulty in appearing comfortable while campaigning. In a city full of natural politicians, Mr. Green has always been the one who wears a suit while shaking hands on the beach. But what he lacks in ease he makes up for in effort. His statistics on number-of-churches-visited and number-of-neighborhoods-toured sometimes seem like overkill, but they do assure us that Mr. Green would be a mayor who would go anywhere and talk to anyone. Whether he will always pay attention is another question, and if Mr. Green succeeds in becoming mayor, his first challenge will be to improve his listening skills.
Republican New Yorkers may wish that they, too, had the opportunity to vote in a closely contested primary featuring several qualified candidates. But the Republican contest is a mismatch, pitting Michael Bloomberg, a candidate with a bottomless well of money, against Herman Badillo, who has been struggling to attract enough donations just to qualify for city matching funds. Because of the imbalance in this race, we believe a more appropriate time to assess the Republican nominee is once the final campaign begins and the city can get the more complete picture that real competition provides. 
On the Democratic side, both Mr. Vallone and Mr. Ferrer have surprised people by the strength of their bids for a place in a runoff, which will occur if no one receives 40 percent of the vote on Sept. 11. Mr. Vallone has the right to be proud of the job he did leading the Council from its days of powerless ineptitude into a more active role in government. If we could suspend the term limits law for one individual, it would be to keep Mr. Vallone on as Speaker. But he is not necessarily the best candidate for this higher office. He still tends to describe what he would do as mayor in terms of his relationship with the members of the Council, which is only one fraction of the job.
Mr. Ferrer has done well in the mayoral debates, and his attempt to forge a coalition between Hispanic and black officials has finally begun to bear fruit after a number of false starts. Formerly a centrist establishment Democrat, Mr. Ferrer is now running from the left, as the champion of the "other" New York. That was a good place to start. But Mr. Ferrer has so far failed to move to the next level, to show how he could take the outrage of the poor and the concerns of the working and middle classes to forge a united vision for the city. 
Alan Hevesi went into the primary as the favorite of many government insiders, who believed his work as comptroller and longtime state assemblyman made him "Most Experienced, Best Qualified," as his campaign boasted. Mr. Hevesi does have a most impressive resume, and he has also been the most convincing candidate when it comes to financial forecasts for the future, an area where Mr. Vallone in particular seems overly optimistic.
Despite all his years in office, Mr. Hevesi was relatively unknown to most voters when the race began, and his attempts to introduce himself have gone badly. His high-tech discussions of the budget went over peoples' heads. Reports surfaced about his relationship with campaign contributors that showed Mr. Hevesi might be lax about avoiding the appearance of conflicts of interest. Lately, the courtly Mr. Hevesi has mutated into the campaign's angry man, attempting to out-Giuliani the mayor himself in name-calling. But for all his slips, Mr. Hevesi has sound instincts on the economic and social problems facing the city.
Both Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green have spent decades thinking seriously about how to best run New York City's government. Given two candidates with such impressive records, our support goes to the one whose campaign has shown the most promise for still more growth and innovation in the future. In the Democratic primary for mayor, our choice is Mark Green.

How Low Can You Go?

BYLINE:  By Steve Garbarino

What's the lowdown? If recent trends in fashion and furniture provide any sort of bellwether, we as a nation are boosting our fragile self-esteem by making everything around us, as R.E.M. sings, "low, low, low."
 As the current economy dictates that we tighten our belts, pants -- as in bluejeans -- have dropped to levels so low that you need a bikini wax to wear them. 
And belt loops? Fuhgeddaboudit. Both pros and dilettantes are simply cutting them off. 
 Meanwhile, as evident at the recent Furniture Fair in Milan, custom furnishings have sunk to ground zero. Indeed, Nick Dine's Ravioli pillow-couch for Dune (pictured, center) looks as if it was yanked right out of a Triumph Spitfire. 
How low can we go? While mainstream glossies have flirted with cover girls showing their most nether of regions (see Jennifer Lopez's lacy lingerie shot on the June cover of Vanity Fair), it took the British magazine Dazed & Confused to actually show the unthinkable.
According to Agatha, who designs custom leather pants for the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Britney Spears, Joan Jett and Jennifer Lopez: "If you're a chick, you don't want to see jack. You have to wax. But if you're a dude, you can show . . . oh, a tiny bit."
On the flip side, Amri Leever, a 27-year-old transplanted Floridian and custom-jeans designer of the lowest common demoninator, asserts that "the new cleavage" is now best seen from the rear. But she points out: "Low isn't for everyone. You should always follow the overhang rule. If something is hanging over your belt loops, keep it covered -- unless you're going to Biker Weekend in Daytona Beach." Steve Garbarino

HEADLINE: Chinese Firm Is Punished By the U.S. For Arms Sale 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 

 BODY:
The Bush administration imposed trade sanctions today on a major Chinese arms manufacturer after failing to persuade the Chinese government to stop exports of missile technology to Pakistan.
 A senior State Department official said that the decision came as China continued to break international guidelines intended to control sales of missile parts and technology that are essential for weapons that can carry nuclear warheads. 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell raised the issue in talks with the Chinese leadership in July. His concerns were at the center of detailed negotiations in Beijing late last month between a State Department delegation and Chinese officials. 
Last week, Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton called on the charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, He Yafei, and told him it was still possible to avoid sanctions if the Chinese took some action against the exporters. The Chinese manufacturer, China Metallurgical Equipment, a private corporation with close ties to the Beijing government, had transferred missile parts and technology, not whole missiles, the administration's announcement said. 
The sanctions come as relations between Washington and Beijing have warmed somewhat after a rocky start at the outset of the Bush administration. But it appeared that the sanctions would not cause a major rift, and it was still possible, the senior official said, that the sanctions would be waived later. 
The sanctions, which prohibit American companies from doing business with the Chinese company, are likely to be more symbolic than substantive in the broader trading relationship. 
"The goal is to stop their missile cooperation with Pakistan, and if they stop, we could waive the sanctions," the senior official said today.
President Bush is scheduled to visit China for the first time in October, and preparations are under way by both sides to make the trip as smooth and friendly as possible.
Sanctions were also being placed on the organization in Pakistan, the National Development Complex, that received the Chinese technology. 
As the administration has tried to deal with the Chinese sales of weapons technology in the last few months, it has also been debating whether to suspend issuing licenses for American telecommunication companies that place their satellites on Chinese rockets.
American aerospace companies are pushing the Bush administration to allow China to launch American-made satellites or satellites containing American parts. Any such launch requires a presidential waiver. President Clinton granted numerous such waivers, in part to reward China for curbing its sales of missile-related technology. 
But a French company whose satellite contains American parts, Astrium SAS, has recently dropped a deal involving a Chinese rocket because of American indecision, said a report this week in Space News.
Loral Space & Communications, an American satellite company, has two satellite deals pending with China, one of which has been in limbo since 1999. Loral has been unable to gain a presidential waiver while investigations were under way into assistance Loral provided China after a Chinese rocket containing a Loral satellite crashed in 1996. 
For months Loral has been in negotiations with State Department officials to try and reach a civil settlement, American officials said. The discussions, they added, include the possible payment of a multimillion-dollar penalty by Loral and changes in the company's export procedures.
A White House spokesman had no comment today on President Bush's position on issuing waivers.
As for the sanctions, they should come as no surprise to the Chinese, the senior official said. Beijing knew the details of transfers from Chinese Metallurgical Equipment to Pakistan, if for no other reason than the United States told them, the official said. The corporation, he said, was not operating outside the bounds of the Beijing government.
During negotiations with a team of Clinton administration experts last November, the Chinese agreed to limit missile exports that were in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The regime, which restricts sales of specific missiles and missile parts, was signed by 32 countries, but not China. 
Over all, the Chinese are "less active traders and proliferators than they used to be," the senior official said. But they are still not in compliance with the control regime, he said.

Comverse Technology Announces Drop in Profits
Citing the global slowdown in business spending, which he called a recession, Kobi Alexander, the chairman and chief executive of Comverse Technology (Nasdaq: CMVT), said Tuesday that the Woodbury company's profits dropped 20 percent in the second quarter, to $50 million, compared with $62.5 million in the same quarter last year.
 Unlike many high-tech companies, however, Comverse reported that sales increased during the quarter, by 18 percent to $345 million, compared with $292 million for the second quarter of 2000. 
 In the quarter, the company took $22 million in charges associated with layoffs and investment write-downs. In May Comverse announced layoffs of about 400 employees, or 6 percent of its work force.
Mr. Alexander said in a statement, "We remain well-positioned as a leader in our major markets, and believe that these markets offer attractive opportunities for long-term growth."
Comverse, an Israeli-American company that also has offices in Tel Aviv, manufactures wireless telecommunications software and other products for sale in over 100 countries.

HEADLINE: What We Work for Now 

BYLINE:  By Jerome M. Segal; Jerome M. Segal, a senior research scholar in public affairs at the University of Maryland, is the author of "Graceful Simplicity."

DATELINE: COLLEGE PARK, Md. 

 BODY:
Despite all our concerns with self-fulfillment, most Americans work to earn money, just as their forebears did 100 years ago. The relative costs of necessities have changed, and so has a fair definition of what is necessary. But even with all our economic growth, and even with some items much cheaper than they once were, families still spend about four-fifths of their budgets for core needs, just as their counterparts did a century ago. Perhaps there should be some national introspection about how much we have really gained.
 Certainly, we have escaped the overwhelming tyranny of food. In 1901, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in major industrial cities, the biggest expenditure item for families was food -- half of spending in low-income families and a third in more affluent ones. In 1999, food took only 15 percent of household spending, and more than a third of that spending was for food prepared away from home. For food from their own kitchens, Americans now use up only 9 percent of their budgets. They can cover that with a little more than a month of work -- probably the lowest level of work effort for food in human history. Even households in the lowest fifth of income use only 18 percent of total spending for food. 
 Something similar has happened with clothing. In 1901 it took 10 to 15 percent of the family budget, and now it takes only 5 percent.
What, then, are Americans spending their money on? A common stereotype of the pampered consumer might suggest that large amounts are going for toys and luxuries, but I found while conducting studies for Redefining Progress, a public policy organization in Oakland, Calif., that this is a misconception. Electronic gadgets, for instance, have a small place in consumer spending -- 2 percent in 2000. Entertainment takes less than 6 percent.
The largest expenditure item now is housing. Bringing together renters and owners, shelter, including utilities, takes 27 percent of our spending, compared to a very similar 25 percent in 1901. Although our homes today are much more luxurious, safe neighborhoods with good public schools remain out of reach for many.
The big growth category is transportation. In the earliest studies of consumption, transportation wasn't even a separate category; it took only 1 or 2 percent of spending. But then came the automobile, and now we devote more than 20 percent of our spending to transportation. Just to cover that, the average American family works from New Year's Day to March 14. No society in history has worked so much just to be able to get around.
A car may once have been a luxury, but as cities and suburbs have spread out, stores have disappeared from neighborhoods, and work and school have ceased to be within walking distance, nearly all Americans have become car-dependent. And with most women in the formal work force, many families have two automobiles -- not really as a matter of choice, but as a basic need.
Another work-related item virtually unknown a century ago is day care. Self-sufficiency budgets, calculated by many states to determine families' costs for basic needs, allocate 25 to 30 percent of a low-income household's spending for day care.
Though education remains only a minor category of spending -- 2 percent -- this is just on average. For families with children in college -- and college is now required for far more jobs than in the past -- this expense can be staggering.
So in a century of growing incomes and changing lives, what has been gained? While the energies of Americans are expended to obtain different items than they were years ago, what remains constant is the emphasis on the basics.
In 1901, 80 percent of spending went for food, housing and clothing. In 1999, 81 percent of spending went for food, housing, clothing, transportation and health care. A century of economic growth has certainly brought some genuine progress, but it is less clear-cut than we sometimes think.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Public Education's Inspired but Rocky Road

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
"Agitate, agitate, agitate," was the motto of Horace Mann, the 19th-century school reformer. During his tenure as Massachusetts secretary of education, beginning in 1837, he visited a thousand schools in six years and recorded his horrified reactions to the conditions he found. One school was so dangerous, he wrote, "the mice have forsaken it."
 Public education in America has always been a fractious enterprise, and complaining about it is part of our heritage. The start of each new academic year is heralded with dire predictions about the public schools and alarming visions of cutbacks, shortages and bureaucratic ineptitude. But the system is also amazing, constantly reinventing itself to absorb changes in the country's population, economics and social and political theories. The public schools have been wonderful, they've been terrible, but they haven't been stagnant, and they aren't going away. Almost 90 percent of American children are educated in them, at a cost this year of $330 billion. 
 School is starting again, so not surprisingly it's the subject of several television documentaries. It's a good crop, which includes "Kindergarten," HBO Family's charming 13-part series of half-hours, and "School: The Story of American Public Education," PBS's comprehensive and excellent four-hour survey course, which begins tonight. In addition PBS is presenting "The First Year," a 90-minute documentary that follows five new teachers through their first school year; replays of "American High," the cinema verite series it took over from Fox; and a variety of school-related programs on local public television stations. Meryl Streep, who played a teacher in "Music of the Heart," introduces many of the PBS programs and narrates "School."
Aimed at young children and their parents, HBO's "Kindergarten" takes an affectionate, hopeful approach, combining observations of the children's activities with interviews that are invariably cute or poignant. The 23 children in Jennifer Johnson's kindergarten class at Upper Nyack Elementary School in New York State seem to be having an ideal experience. They love their teacher, whom they describe, accurately, as "pretty" and, with apparent accuracy, as "happy all the time." They confront problems, like missing their parents and dealing with cranky classmates. But comforting resolutions are the norm. When one child confesses, looking ashamed, that he doesn't brush his teeth in the morning, Ms. Johnson thanks him for his honesty. "What a brave thing to do," she says.
The five young teachers featured in "The First Year" on PBS (shown in New York on Friday at 9 p.m. and elsewhere on Thursday) aren't happy all the time. Their postings are at tough Los Angeles schools, where the students' problems are often grim and resolutions not readily forthcoming. Davis Guggenheim, the film's director, takes an unvarnished approach that records without dramatic flourish the frustrations and rewards of teaching. For a while the documentary feels flat and somewhat chaotic, as the camera moves uncertainly from a teacher facing fidgety ninth graders in a "cultural awareness" class to an earnest kindergarten teacher doing stretching exercises with his charges.
But it becomes clear that while dramatically unsatisfying at times, the grainy approach of "First Year" underscores this particular reality, which is itself chaotic and gritty. Entertainment isn't the point. The kindergarten teacher, who seems especially sweet because he is a big man and so tender, doggedly tries to obtain special speech therapy for one of his students, a sad-looking boy who can barely make himself understood. The boy's parents aren't especially cooperative, and neither is the school bureaucracy. Speech therapists make appointments and break them. Another young teacher, who comes from a family of teachers, is dismayed when one of his students sketches him as a rat sitting on a toilet. A third tries to find a permanent room for her 38 students and is told a school isn't considered overcrowded unless 30 percent of the teachers have floating classrooms like hers.
Which portrait is true? The sunny picture of public school we see in "Kindergarten" or the grim view from "The First Year?" What kind of system allows for such divergence and inequity?
PBS's "School" answers this question with remarkable thoroughness and intellectual energy. Produced by sisters-in-law, Sarah Mondale and Sarah Patton, and directed by Ms. Mondale, the series is unabashedly pro-public-school but not uncritical. The producers have accumulated a mountain of information, archival clips and filmed interviews with witnesses and experts, and fashioned it into a compelling narrative. They explain how the system was shaped by individual determination and mass movements. They examine the role of religion, race and political movements in the development of public education, as well as the interaction of courts, legislatures and plain old politics. As the giant mechanism of public education has heaved and sputtered along, and an incredible amount of progress has occurred. 
The series periodically provides helpful comparative statistics on blackboards. We see that average school attendance in 1776 was less than 82 days, while now it is 14.5 years. In 1950, 13.7 percent of African-Americans above 18 had high school diplomas, compared with 77.6 percent today. 
The series recalls the heroism of black children who desegregated schools and of young women who went West to scruffy frontier towns to become teachers. We see how often a step forward crushed somebody's toes. So when schools were desegregated, many black teachers found themselves out of work. We're reminded that the battle between traditionalists and progressives didn't begin yesterday but more than 100 years ago. We learn that Gary, Ind., isn't just a song lyric in "The Music Man," but once was the home of the most progressive school system in the country. A hundred years ago Gary's public-school children, many of whose fathers were mill workers for United States Steel, had swimming pools and zoos right at school, where they also learned carpentry and sewing and acquired manners for afternoon tea. 
The Gary experiment, captured on film, looks cheerful and productive, but New York's attempt to adopt the plan failed. The curriculum's emphasis on nonacademic as well as academic subjects was regarded as part of a scheme to turn out cheap labor for large corporations. A mayoral race turned on opposition to progressive education, and New York students got back behind their desks and focused on learning proper language and good citizenship. The idea was to Americanize immigrant children, quickly and thoroughly.
The documentaries start at the beginning, when the school system sprang out of pretty much nothing. Nicholas Lemann, author of "The Big Test," observes that government-financed education is not part of the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence or any other founding principle. "It was a new, radical, crazy-seeming idea," he says. It got even crazier and more radical as new waves of immigrants had to be absorbed, and the schools became the fire under the melting pot, until the notion of a melting pot became offensive. Then the schools were called on to help groups respect their separate heritages while offering a sound education and constantly redefining what a "sound education" is. 
At one time people were certain that children had a good education if they knew what their torment in hell would be if they sinned. In 1927 an I.Q. test considered this a valid true or false question: "We seldom desire food when we are very sad." After World War II educators were obsessed with instruction on hygiene and family life, until they became obsessed with creating astronauts and rocket scientists. Now testing is the White House mantra. Tomorrow it will be something else.
This program should be required homework for policymakers who make pronouncements on what schools should or shouldn't be.

HEADLINE: Entrepreneur Is Quiet About His Past And Gets New Start in Net Surveillance 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Twice, Irwin Meyer has sailed on big ideas to some degree of fortune.
 The first time was in 1977, when he found a struggling play based on a comic-strip character and helped turn it into the unlikely Broadway hit, "Annie." It earned him a Tony Award for co-producing the best musical of the year. 
 The second time was in 1999, when he discovered a technology that could scour Internet chat rooms for rumors, innuendo, opinions or lies about a particular person or company. He created a company to offer the service to any business worried about its image -- and its stock price. 
To win the trust of investors and clients, Mr. Meyer boasted of his Tony Award, and of the years he spent as a television and commercial producer in Hollywood. What he did not mention was his conviction for tax fraud, which put him in a federal prison for four months in 1982.
Some of the people who wanted to become involved with Mr. Meyer and his Internet technology took the time to check his background, though it did not stop them from working with him. Others said they looked but did not find his conviction. Many, however, were too eager to join the Internet gold rush to do much more than read the incomplete biography that Mr. Meyer submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission as a routine part of running a publicly traded company.
Mr. Meyer said he did not make a point of mentioning his conviction nor try to hide it. "I don't wear a sign," he said. "Everybody who's ever worked with me knows about my background."
The story of Mr. Meyer's reinvention as an Internet entrepreneur is emblematic of the paradoxes of the technology boom. It may have seemed that a bunch of 24-year-olds were "leveraging" the Internet -- to use the vernacular that helped start so many dot-com companies -- to take over the business world. But the larger truth is more nuanced and stranger than the notion that Daddy Warbucks invented the New Deal. And now that the boom times are over, Mr. Meyer has a mess on his hands.
At 66 years old, Mr. Meyer comes across like a college drama teacher, theatrical and assured. His approach is: Listen, I'm gonna explain something to you. And he can be very convincing, given the right audience.
When Internet stocks began their run-up, Mr. Meyer was in California and decided to shift his focus from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. In 1999, he used his foundering movie-production company in Los Angeles to create a new-economy start-up and began casting about for something to do.
He first dabbled in satellite Internet access, buying a company called eSat, but switched to Internet image-management after merging with another company, Infolocity. He changed the name of his company -- initially the Ventura Motion Picture Group, then the Producers Entertainment Group and most recently the IAT Resources Corporation -- to the jazzy-sounding NetCurrents Inc.
The company would use technology developed by Infolocity to monitor Internet chat rooms on behalf of companies willing to pay for the service. At the time, the Internet was so sexy and stock manipulation so worrisome that clients, including big names like Oracle and Office Depot, began to line up. Then the Kroll-O'Gara Company, the world's most prominent investigation company, signed an exclusive global alliance with NetCurrents to offer enhanced Internet intelligence services to corporations.
NetCurrents' heady early days are but a memory now, and so are many of its clients. It is hard to sell image-protection services to companies that cannot even afford many of their employees anymore. NetCurrents' stock, which traded for as much as $11.94 a share in March 2000, now sells for less than 11 cents. So few people want to buy it that Nasdaq has removed the stock from its market, crippling the company's ability to raise additional cash to cover losses and repay debts. NetCurrents said in its most recent filings with the S.E.C. that it had laid off all its sales representatives and technicians.
Mr. Meyer now spends his days looking for someone to invest more money in the company -- and searching the Web for anyone who might be criticizing it, or him.
The company has already sued one man, Victor Holtorf, the former chairman of one of its subsidiaries, for making disparaging remarks about Mr. Meyer on online message boards. They have since settled the suit, though Mr. Holtorf, who still owns stock in the company, said NetCurrents had not met the financial obligations of the settlement. He would not specify the obligations.
Mr. Meyer has overcome financial obstacles before. For example, he and his partner, Stephen R. Friedman, had some difficulty raising their $250,000 contribution to the budget for "Annie," according to a 1977 Washington Post article on the show, though they eventually came up with the money.
At around the same time, the two men shared in sales commissions totaling $4 million, government records say, by selling more than $20 million in tax-sheltered limited partnerships in a coal mining operation. Among the partners who bought in were celebrities like Elvis Presley, Margaux Hemingway and the singer Alice Cooper. Mr. Presley, for example, paid $505,000 and deducted $2.6 million from his taxable income for 1976.
But the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint against Mr. Meyer, Mr. Friedman and others on Sept. 21, 1978, contesting the partners' rights to any coal under a piece of property around Gillette, Wyo. The federal government owned 95 percent of the rights, and that fact cast doubt on the profits and tax benefits that Mr. Meyer and his partners had promised the investors, the S.E.C. said.
In 1980, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Friedman were indicted in a federal criminal complaint based on the coal mining partnerships. Both men eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to assist in the preparation and filing of false income tax returns and were sentenced to prison. Mr. Meyer entered Federal Prison Camp Allenwood in Montgomery, Pa., on March 1, 1982, and was released on July 16, 1982.
The "Annie" company disassociated itself from the two men, and Mr. Meyer's lawyer, Martin R. Gold, said at the time that his client was "finished in the entertainment business," according to the archives of United Press International.
After regaining his freedom, however, Mr. Meyer moved to California, where he spent 16 years producing commercials and television programs. His company received production fees for the program "Dave's World" and for the movie "What's Love Got to Do With It?"
When Mr. Meyer turned his attention to the Internet, the most important part of his transformation was to buy Infolocity, a company run by James J. Cerna Jr., who is listed as an inventor of the technology used by NetCurrents.
To promote the company's services, Mr. Meyer appeared on the CNBC program "Power Lunch" in March 2000. "We have found in recent months, and I guess growing on a daily basis, an enormous amount of information and misinformation coming across the Net," he said on the program. Three days later, the company said it had closed a private placement of its stock, raising $8.5 million.
Before the summer was out, Mr. Meyer's reinvention as an Internet fraud expert received an impressive stamp of approval when Kroll-O'Gara teamed up its Risk Consulting Services division with NetCurrents -- in the process, receiving warrants to buy 5 percent of NetCurrents' stock.
At the time, there was no mention of Mr. Meyer's conviction for fraud, but Jules Kroll, chairman of Kroll-O'Gara, said in a recent interview that his company knew about it.
"We did exhaustive due diligence on the company, technology, directors, management and in particular the somewhat colorful history of its C.E.O.," Mr. Kroll said. "You can imagine, given what we do for a living, it was an issue for us."
He added, "I do believe in redemption, under certain circumstances."
Mr. Meyer said that he told Mr. Kroll about his jail term.
"It would be foolish of me to go into business with the world's largest investigation business that has a division that checks people's backgrounds and assume that they're not going to check my background," Mr. Meyer said.
But others did not learn of the conviction until long after they went into business with him.
Mr. Cerna said that his lawyer had investigated Mr. Meyer's background and never found the conviction. "To get in the position he's in now, he's found a way to hide it," Mr. Cerna said. "You would think, in the spirit, he should disclose that. We had no intention to get involved with anyone that has a history of fraud."
Several customers also said they were unaware of Mr. Meyer's conviction, though they said they were pleased with the service.
"It was immensely valuable to us," said Jennifer Glass, a vice president at Oracle. "We would get a heads-up on rumors and general sentiment about Oracle within the online community."
Ms. Glass and Lauren Garvey, a spokeswoman for Office Depot, said, however, that NetCurrents had discontinued its service to them without explanation.
Mr. Meyer said that he felt obligated to his shareholders. They want him to do what he has always done when he found a new business idea, like the little orphan girl, the tax shelters and the Internet security blanket.
"They're looking for me to secure another round of financing," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 12, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Sept. 3 about the career of Irwin Meyer, who set up NetCurrents Inc., which monitors the Internet for remarks about a specified person or company, referred incorrectly at two points to his past activities. One of Mr. Meyer's companies, the Producers Entertainment Group, agreed to acquire a company called eSat, but the deal was never completed; Mr. Meyer did not buy eSat. While Mr. Meyer was president of Ventura Entertainment, it acquired a company that produced television commercials. Mr. Meyer himself did not produce commercials. Mr. Meyer raised concerns about the article in an e-mail message to The Times several days after publication. This correction was delayed for research.

HEADLINE: Canadian Bank Earnings Beat Expectations 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Despite a rocky quarter, Canadian banks reported earnings last month that, while not matching recent years, topped analyst estimates in all but one case. 
 "There was a wariness going in" to the reporting season, said Robert Follis, an analyst at Scotia Capital, because of downturns in the economy in Latin America and the United States. 
 "We were waiting," he said, "to see how that could have translated into the banks' credit quality." 
Five of the seven major banks posted higher results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, despite weak market conditions. 
On average, the banks had 11 percent growth in profits from the previous year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
The Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest and the only one to miss estimates, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Bank of Montreal, the National Bank of Canada, and the Laurentian Bank of Canada all had improved quarterly profits. 
Toronto-Dominion Bank, the second largest, reported flat profits, while the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was the only bank to report a decline in quarterly earnings. Both banks still bettered expectations. 
Canadian Western Bank, the smallest chartered bank, reports quarterly results this week. 
"I would characterize the quarter as good," said Kevin Lampo, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "Asset quality did not show signs of deteriorating like prior periods and even though investment and merchant banking type activities declined, we saw healthy consumer and midsize business lending that offset those weaknesses." 
An early announcement by the Bank of Nova Scotia, which identified problem loans and nearly tripled its credit loss provisions in March, highlighted worries about deteriorating credit quality. A surprise increase in loan loss provisions by Toronto-Dominion Bank in June squarely focused attention on the issue. 
But investors and analysts applauded the results, sending bank stocks shooting higher and, in the case of the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Candian Imperial Bank of Commerce, touching new yearly highs. 
Fourth-quarter results will be linked to the North American economic outlook, analysts said. Further erosion in corporate profitability and continued weakness in capital markets could mean the banks will see a quarter of lackluster revenues. 
But, following eight months of interest-rate cuts by central banks in both Canada and the United States that were aimed at spurring an economic rebound in North America, most analysts predict a sturdy fourth quarter for the banks.
"The big question," said Donald Chu, an associate director at Standard & Poor's, "is what's going to happen stateside and whether or not we're going to have contagion (crossing) into Canada. And, if we do enter into a recession, how deep and how long will it be?"

HEADLINE: Elections Will Help Chart Course for Taiwan and Its President 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Taiwan's embattled president, Chen Shui-bian, scored a rare coup last month when he supported relaxing certain restrictions on investment and trade with the mainland.
 Still, Mr. Chen's prospects for effectively governing this factionalized island or developing any consensus over policy toward Beijing remain murky. The ousted Nationalists are plotting Mr. Chen's downfall, former President Lee Teng-hui is reasserting himself as a self-styled messiah and Beijing continues to ignore Mr. Chen's calls to open talks. 
 Now all the parties are looking toward parliamentary elections set for Dec. 1 as a key to the final two years of Mr. Chen's term as president, and possibly to Taiwan's future stance toward the mainland.
"This won't just be a midterm referendum," said Chu Yun-Han, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. "It will actually decide the profile of the next cabinet." He said there was a real possibility that Mr. Chen would be forced to cede major power to his enemies in a coalition government. 
Mr. Chen won a temporary lift with his handling of his 120-member economic advisory panel. He had charged the group with finding ways to reinvigorate Taiwan's badly listing economy. The Nationalists, who had worked unceasingly to isolate Mr. Chen, were cornered into participating in this game of his design, even allowing him to put his stamp on their proposals. 
The panel's recommendations also gave Mr. Chen the cover he needed to fend off factions in his own Democratic Progressive Party that favor Taiwanese independence and are wary of deeper economic ties with the mainland.
Mr. Chen refuses to support the ideal of "one China" that Beijing demands, in effect at gunpoint, contending that Taiwan is a renegade province of China. But he has also tried to move toward the center, abandoning talk of independence, which would elicit military threats from the mainland, alarm the United States and scare his public. 
But most of Mr. Chen's initiatives, foreign and domestic, have been stymied by a divided government. He was elected in a three-way race in 2000 by a minority of voters, while the long-ruling Nationalists retained a majority in the Parliament. 
The Nationalists, led by former Vice President Lien Chan, and the second major opposition party, led by James Soong, a breakaway Nationalist, hope to improve their positions in the December elections. They want to force Mr. Chen into a coalition government in which he would give up much of his power to choose the cabinet and to set policy. 
Mr. Chen's party, D.P.P., in turn, hopes to increase the proportion of seats, now just 30 percent, it holds in the 225-member Parliament. 
"After the elections, we're likely to see a coalition of some sort," said Joseph Wu, a political expert at National Chengchi University in Taipei. "The question is, will the D.P.P. gain enough seats to dominate a coalition?"
Enter Mr. Lee, the former president. He formally remains a member of the Nationalist Party and is not expected to run for office himself, but he has thrown his "spiritual support" to the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a new party founded to push his agenda of an independent Taiwanese identity.
While Mr. Lee retired in disgrace after the 2000 elections, blamed by many Nationalists for dividing and betraying his party, he remains popular among native-born Taiwanese. Now he is campaigning for the Solidarity Union, hoping to draw out those in the Nationalist Party who share his abhorrence at the more accommodating policies toward Beijing being pursued under the leadership of Mr. Lien. Mr. Lee says the new party's winners will ally with Mr. Chen to give him a majority and stabilize the country. 
Along the way, Mr. Lee, 78, has given ample evidence of what his critics call a "messiah complex." On Saturday, he said at a Solidarity Union rally that "I want to retire but the father has a good-for-nothing son and so I have no choice," an unsubtle reference to his successor as Nationalist leader. 
Mr. Lee has tormented his erstwhile Nationalist colleagues with his disdain, and has all but dared them to expel him. But the party has avoided that, fearing a public backlash.
But Mr. Lee's re-emergence has been a mixed blessing for Mr. Chen. Analysts say the new party is apt to draw more voters from Mr. Chen's own party than from the Nationalists. And judging from Mr. Lee's statements, his new group could be as much an albatross as a savior for Mr. Chen. One of Mr. Lee's goals is to torpedo the very economic overtures to Beijing that Mr. Chen has embraced. 
"Going to China is like committing suicide," Mr. Lee told the cheering throng. If Mr. Lee's new party does add vital support for Mr. Chen, tricky new questions will arise, noted Steven M. Goldstein, an expert on Taiwan politics at Smith College. 
"How would these two big egos, Lee and Chen, ever work together?" Mr. Goldstein asked. Beijing's response, too, could be worrisome. In the minds of mainland leaders, Mr. Goldstein noted, "these are the world's two worst people."

. . . But a Good Cigarette Is a Fantasy of Flavor

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUDUS, Indonesia 

 BODY:
It was one of those precious moments that seem to prove that life has meaning, a moment of inspiration -- perhaps divine inspiration -- that makes all the hard times seem worthwhile.
 "All of a sudden, out of the blue, I had it," said Djoko Herryanto, a chemist whose mission it is to find the most delicious mixture of spices to enhance the taste of Indonesia's sweet-smelling clove cigarettes. 
 "Until this day, I don't know," he said. "Did this idea come from my technical knowledge? Or did it come from 'wahyu,' a divine inspiration, a flash?" 
Indeed, his new creation does seem beyond the imagining of ordinary men.
"A taste of banana mixed with cheese and sugar sauce together with chocolate, all toasted together," he said, still breathless when he thinks about it. "That's the flavor that came to me -- Bam! -- sweet, nutty, caramelic, fruity, everything!" 
A blend of flavors like this may seem hard to imagine in a cigarette, but tens of millions of Indonesians are smoking sticks of candy like this every day. The clove cigarette, it turns out, is a great deal more than tobacco and cloves. It is a complex, infinitely variable symphony of scent and flavor. 
Usually about two-thirds tobacco, one-third clove, the Indonesian smoke known as a kretek also contains one more, often secret, ingredient: its sauce, or saus in Indonesian.
This is where divine inspiration comes in: cinnamon, pineapple, licorice, coriander, litchi nut, coffee, strawberry -- whatever delights the senses, sometimes in natural flavorings but usually (and more economically) in artificial flavors.
"If you just put in tobacco and clove, it would taste funny," Mr. Herryanto said. "The blending is like making music -- how to make the smell and the taste, the positive and the negative flavors, all come into harmony."
Indonesia's 210 million people -- mostly its men -- smoked 200 billion kreteks last year. There are some 2,000 brands, produced by about 500 companies ranging from tiny family-owned enterprises to some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the nation.
Two big producers, Sampoerna and Gudang Garam, are among the few major Indonesian enterprises that not only survived the economic collapse of the past four years but prospered. Their owners are the only two Indonesians left of a dozen who were counted among the world's richest people before the crash. 
Clove cigarettes are so popular in Indonesia that only one smoker out of 10 prefers standard cigarettes, known here as whites. It is one of the few markets in the world where American tobacco companies have failed to prosper.
"Whites are boring," said Baedowi Maroef, the director of the mid-sized Jambu Bol kretek factory here in the birthplace of clove cigarettes. And how else could it be for someone who has smoked kreteks all his life. Some brands even dip their filters in saccharine, making them even more like smokable candy.
When he is too sick to smoke, Mr. Maroef said, he holds his kreteks up to his nose and sniffs them.
Among other things, kreteks offer one of Indonesia's few guarantees of employment. Most are hand rolled and it takes about 200,000 women around Indonesia, working with incredible speed, to keep up with demand. One of the larger companies, Djarum, once held a contest, which was won by a woman who rolled 12,000 in a day.
That is nothing, Mr. Herryanto said, compared with a rolling machine in the United States, which can produce 16,000 cigarettes in an hour.
It is good work, said a roller named Rukayah, 42, her hands flying like lightning as she spoke, "because if I weren't doing this, I wouldn't have a job."
Twenty-six years on the job have given her funny dreams, she said. "Sometimes I dream that I'm locked in here with my friends, still rolling kreteks, and I can't stop," she said.
Developed in the 1880's to minister to coughs and asthma -- they were first sold in pharmacies -- kreteks were originally wrapped in corn husks, a monsoon-season boon to farmers because that made them waterproof.
Today clove cigarettes are a signature of Indonesia. The whole country sometimes seems to smell of them. In the congested cities, even automobile exhaust is sweetened by the scent of clove.
And they are intimately entwined with Indonesia's history.
"What is that you are smoking, sir?" asked a diplomat, according to an oft-told tale, addressing Indonesia's first ambassador to Great Britain 50 years ago.
The ambassador, Agus Salim, was ready with his riposte: "That, your excellency, is the reason for which the West conquered the world!"
Indeed. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was the cloves of the Moluccas and the nutmeg of the Banda islands -- worth more than their weight in gold -- that drew European explorers and colonists into the South Seas.
"In this respect, clove may be seen as having played a central role in Indonesia's past and in the history of the world in general," writes Mark Hanusz in a new coffee table book called "Kretek: The Culture and Heritage of Indonesia's Clove Cigarettes" (Equinox Publishing, 2000).
In an introduction to the book, the writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer notes, "You can always tell a kretek smoker by the holes in their clothes -- caused by the crackling of the cloves."
A chain smoker since his boyhood, Mr. Pramoedya describes his love of the clove cigarette, saying, "When I moved to Surabaya, I picked up two new habits that would continue to this day -- smoking kretek and wearing shoes."
In a taste test, Mr. Herryanto, the chemist, offered a sniff-and-smoke comparison of several delicious-smelling brands. It took his expert nose to tease out the flavorings from the aroma of cloves.
Wismalak Diplomat. Sweet, strong, fruity, mostly plum, with undertones of strawberry and pineapple.
Gudang Garam. Less fruity, more spicy and fragrant with cinnamon, coriander, star anise and lovage.
Sampoerna Mild. A sweetened Marlboro with its chocolate undertone, plus clove and rum.
Nothing seems to happen in Indonesia without kreteks. Fat or slim, filtered or straight, fruity or spicy, they are everywhere. Few people seem to associate them with illnesses like lung cancer.
Asked to describe the quintessential setting for a good smoke, Mr. Maroef smiled a faraway smile. "Most obviously, almost inevitably, after meals," he said. "Or in any relaxed situation, like when you're sitting on the toilet."
His colleague at Jambu Bol, Abdul Aziz, said kreteks also go well with sports, like tennis.
Come again?
"Well, it's difficult to explain," he said. "But after playing tennis it feels really good to have a smoke."

HEADLINE: In America; 
On the Way to Nowhere

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The celebrated boom of the late 1990's was little more than an illusion to millions of young Americans who remain undereducated, unemployed and dangerously disconnected from the nation's social and economic mainstream.
 The boom gave us a period of extraordinary economic growth and reduced unemployment to levels not seen since the late 1960's. And yet there are nearly five million people in the 16-to-24 age group who are both out of school and out of work. 
 For them, every day's a holiday. And that is not good news. These out-of-work and increasingly out-of-hope young people are coming to be known as the "nowhere kids." Trouble follows them with the persistence of night following day. They drink. They do drugs. Many of them commit crimes. And they create children they are unable to adequately care for. 
These young people live their troubled lives beneath the radar of most public-policy planners. They are jobless, but most of them are not even counted as unemployed. To be officially "unemployed" you have to be actively looking for work.
Jack Wuest, who heads the Alternative Schools Network, an organization in Chicago that offers education and employment assistance to inner-city youngsters, said of this hard-core, hard-to-reach group:
"Most lack basic job skills as well as solid literacy and numbers proficiencies, and they are neither working nor looking for jobs. They are not in vocational training. They are not in manufacturing. They are not part of the information age. They are not included in the American conversation."
A nationwide study of labor-market conditions for youngsters 16 to 24 was commissioned by the Alternative Schools Network and carried out by a team of researchers led by Andrew Sum, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston.
"During 1999," the study found, "only 54 of every 100 young adults lacking a high school diploma or a GED certificate were employed, versus 75 of every 100 high school graduates and nearly 89 of every 100 four-year college graduates." Among black high school dropouts, only 23 percent held full-time jobs.
Good economic times were not enough to lift dropouts out of the unemployment trough. The study said that young adults with limited formal schooling, especially those from ethnic-minority and low-income communities, "faced substantial barriers to employment even in a national full employment labor market environment."
Black and Hispanic youths were more likely to be out of work and out of school than white youngsters. During 1999, 13 percent of white 16- to 24-year-olds were idle, as opposed to 21 percent of blacks and Hispanics in the same age group.
The study added, "These counts of disconnected youth are conservative, since they exclude the 350,000-360,000 men, ages 18-24, in the nation's jails and prisons."
The study also said, "Since many of the 20-24-year-old disconnected women are mothers, their absence from both schooling and labor market activities increases the risk of their children being poor, placing the future generation of children at greater risk of poverty and dependency."
That's the bad news. The worse news as far as employment is concerned is that the population of 16- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. -- after declining from the early 80's to the mid-90's -- is expected to grow at an above-average rate for the next decade. Much of the increase will come from the very groups that at the moment are struggling in terms of education and employment, especially blacks, Hispanics and young immigrants.
Government leaders do not appear to be paying close attention. But, trust me, you do not want to see a big national surge in out-of-work and out-of-school young people. Especially when they will be joined on the streets over the next decade by large numbers of men released from prison.
Programs that used to provide support in the form of training and job placement for teenagers and young adults have fallen out of favor and been drastically cut over the past several years. And federal money for summer jobs for disadvantaged kids -- an important and well-regarded initiative -- is all but a memory.
We have a choice. We can pay closer attention and choose to do right by these millions of youngsters. Or we can sit back, ignore the growing problem and reap the long-term consequences.

HEADLINE: As Princeton Changes, a Black Community Fears for Future 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Albert Hinds's earliest recollections are sunk into a single city block a century past.
 "I was born on the corner of Quarry and Witherspoon, my first church was on the corner of Quarry and Witherspoon, and my first school was the Witherspoon Street School for Colored Children," recounted Mr. Hinds, who turns 100 in April. 
 With his long local history and sharp childhood memories, Mr. Hinds seems as good an emblem as any for the deep roots Princeton's African-Americans have driven into the gently sloping few acres of homes, churches and small businesses bounded by John Street on the West and Witherspoon on the east, just a few minutes walk from the great university across Nassau Street to the south. 
But Mr. Hinds's remembrances of an area of town known as the John-Witherspoon neighborhood are brighter than his vision of the future. Academics, researchers and businessmen continue to pour into Princeton, raising rents and tempting property owners in John-Witherspoon to succumb to higher and higher offers on their homes. At the other end of the economic scale, hundreds of immigrant workers, most of them Hispanic, have crammed into houses in the neighborhood, drawn by Princeton's booming service industries.
"We've been pushed, pushed, pushed," Mr. Hinds said. "How much more can they push us?"
The "they" in his complaint may be market forces more than greedy landlords or poorly enforced housing rules, but Mr. Hinds knows the results without being told the numbers. According to the latest Census figures, Princeton lost 15 percent of its black residents during the 1990's. Blacks were the only group whose population fell as the borough's total grew to 14,200 from 12,150. At the same time, the number of Hispanic residents grew by 55 percent. Similarly, black home occupancy declined by a quarter, while Hispanic occupancy doubled.
A decade of boom has put pressure on black neighborhoods in any number of desirable communities around the country, perhaps most especially in the prosperous suburbs surrounding New York City.
Stamford, Conn., despite a population increase of 8 percent from 1990 to 2000, had a 7.3 percent drop in its black population; Summit, N.J., grew by 6 percent but lost 20 percent of its black residents; Mount Kisco, in Westchester County, grew by 7.5 percent but its black population declined by more than a quarter.
The trend has aroused special concern across racial and class lines in Princeton, in part because the town has a troubled history of segregation and displacement of blacks that people here are eager to live down.
Princeton has historically had a Southern flavor, perhaps best expressed by Princeton University's previous tradition as a suitable school for the Southern gentry who were loath to expose their sons to the abolitionism and radicalism at Harvard or Yale in the 19th century. Indeed, as many Princetonians died fighting for the South and for slavery as for the Union during the Civil War.
"Princeton is popular through the South because it is the one eastern school which does not enroll negroes," says a letter from a member of the class of 1928 that is posted on the Princeton Historical Society's Web site.
The university did not grant its first degrees to blacks until 1947, and then only to three men admitted under a wartime training program. Princeton's public schools remained segregated until the following year, and the university did not begin to admit blacks in real numbers until the president, Robert F. Goheen, pushed open the doors in the 1960's.
By then, Palmer Square, a collection of shops under slate-shingled roofs, had already displaced hundreds of black families and closed the John-Witherspoon neighborhood off from the more upscale Nassau Street, where stores for Rolex, Talbots and Laura Ashley now greet students passing through the university's gates. Later projects threw up a wall of apartments and parking decks that today block the view toward downtown from the head of John Street.
And much of Princeton is worried about the fate of its remaining African-American community.
"We're talking about a free black community that dates at least into the 17th century and possibly before, that has been a thriving community whose members are very invested in this town," said Maureen Smyth, assistant director of the Historical Society of Princeton. On the society's Internet site, Web pages about John-Witherspoon are more visited than any except ones on Albert Einstein.
One group troubled by the growing gentrification is Princeton Future, which came into being last year during the debate over the fate of the handful of downtown tracts still open to development.
"It's a matter of creep," said Sheldon Sturges, president of Sturges Publishing, a Web-based teaching concern, and a co-chair of Princeton Future. "The community is under pressure from parking creep, commercial creep, traffic and overcrowding."
"This is the last affordable housing in town, and the people here see their social links deteriorating," said Yina A. Moore, a transportation specialist who is on the Princeton Future board and lives in John-Witherspoon. "Houses are being taken over and that is eliminating opportunities for people to move back in."
But while gentrification may push up rents and taxes, it also rewards longtime owners who take high prices for their homes. The arrival of a few dozen well-off white families has not been nearly as upsetting to Mr. Hinds and some of his neighbors as overcrowding by immigrant workers who stream in and out of old homes that have been divided into tiny rental apartments.
The evidence is everywhere -- in increased volumes of garbage waiting for pickup, in the now common sight of men showering in back yards after a day's work, even in the refrigerators on front porches that, Mr. Sturges said, probably indicate the presence of illegal restaurants for immigrant workers.
Jim Floyd, who 30 years ago was the first black mayor of the surrounding Princeton Township, picks his words carefully when discussing criticism of his Spanish-speaking neighbors.
"The neighborhood has deteriorated because of this overcrowding and the failure to maintain garbage cleanup and enforce zoning laws," Mr. Floyd said. "Now we have this loud music, the cars driving back and forth all night. Culturally or ethnically, these occupants feel that they are having a good time, but sometimes we have to ask them to keep the noise down."
Perhaps because the efforts of Princeton Future have so far produced few results, Mr. Floyd said he placed little faith in the group. Mr. Hinds is also skeptical.
"I don't see them stopping whatever is going to happen to this neighborhood," he said. "And whatever happens to this neighborhood, it won't be good."

HEADLINE: BellSouth's Down-Home Strategy; 
Local Telephone Service Has Become a Haven For Cautious Company

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The oak furniture. The neckties and starched shirts. The hushed banter of secretaries outside large corner offices. And the steady, predictable stream of profits generated by the dominant local telephone company in the Southeast.
 At its corporate headquarters in a nondescript high-rise here, it seems as if BellSouth remains untouched by the frenzied changes that have shaken the telecommunications world in recent years. 
 Among the seven regional Bell companies that emerged from the 1984 breakup of AT&T, only BellSouth is still, primarily, a regional phone company. A mere five years ago it was the biggest of the Baby Bells. After a wave of mergers and takeovers in the industry, however, BellSouth has been eclipsed, currently ranking No. 3 of the four remaining Bells. 
And yet, by forgoing national expansion to focus on local service in the same nine states where it has operated the last 17 years, BellSouth has found the local telephone business a haven in the storm that has ravaged so much of the rest of the telecommunications industry. Indeed, BellSouth's stumble two years ago, when it tried and failed to acquire the long-distance company Sprint for $100 billion, is now looking a lot like a lucky break. 
"We are essentially holding our own relative to other players," said F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth's 59-year-old chairman and chief executive, a reserved Florida native with an engineering degree from M.I.T. and a career-long Bell worker. "We've made it a priority to maintain a strong balance sheet in uncertain times."
BellSouth's low-profile conservatism appears to be paying off. Telecommunications giants like WorldCom and AT&T lost billions in market value in the last year as fierce competition, especially in the long-distance business, eroded market share. Sprint's stock has tumbled more than 31 percent in the last year.
BellSouth's stock price has held steady the last 12 months, closing at $37.30 on Friday. And yet, among the Bells, only Verizon Communications -- now the largest of the group, with local telephone operations in 31 states -- has outperformed BellSouth, rising more than 13 percent in the same period. The second-largest Bell, SBC Communications, has slipped almost 5 percent in market value the last year. Qwest Communications International, the fourth of the surviving Baby Bells, has slumped nearly 59 percent.
In fact, BellSouth might have fared even better if it had not been hurt by plunging currencies in Latin America -- the one place where BellSouth has diverged from its stay-at-home strategy by investing heavily in wireless networks.
Mainly, though, BellSouth is a beneficiary of the relatively slight impact of local telephone competition in the United States to date. Although the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was supposed to stimulate competition at the local level, entering that market has proved to be dauntingly complex and costly. Even giants like AT&T have had trouble making money from entering the local phone business, and many a smaller company has died trying.
BellSouth says its rivals control 12 percent of the telephone lines in its region -- 24 percent of business customers and 5 percent of residential lines. Some small competitors, however, like IDS Telcom of Miami, suggest that BellSouth's figures are overestimates, which BellSouth denies. IDS Telcom said BellSouth may be overstating the extent of competition so that BellSouth can make the case that it should be allowed to enter the long-distance business. 
According to the Federal Communications Commission, 300 or so small companies known as competitive local exchange carriers, or CLEC's (pronounced SEE-lecks), compete with BellSouth on the local level. Together, they control about 8 percent of the total lines in the region. But many CLEC's, facing a financing drought, are having trouble expanding their market shares. BellSouth said the F.C.C. figures, which are several months old, included measurements in states like North Carolina and Florida, where new competitors or other local phone companies like Alltel already control a large part of the market.
Although BellSouth's conservatism has paid off for its core local business, the company is by no means old fashioned. Mr. Ackerman, for example, has equipped nearly all his managers with Blackberry pagers so they can wirelessly send and receive e-mail messages throughout the day -- including notes from the chief executive. 
In fact, the managers' attention to the devices during a reporter's visit often made it difficult to conduct a normal conversation, so intent was their focus on communication within the company. But the message was implicit: BellSouth's emphasis is efficient expansion rather than growth through consolidation. 
Still, BellSouth's expansion strategy faces several challenges. Chief among them, perhaps, is the effort to compete with cable companies in signing up customers for high-speed, or broadband, Internet access.
It is a race in which the cable industry's lead appears to be lengthening. Already in the United States, according to the Yankee Group research firm, there are about seven million cable-modem subscribers, compared with 3.3 million subscribers to the telephone company alternative service, known as digital subscriber line, or D.S.L.
And cable's lead may be growing faster. Richard A. Bilotti of Morgan Stanley estimates that cable accounted for 64 percent of new broadband subscribers in the second quarter, up from 59 percent in the first quarter.
BellSouth, meanwhile, had a drop in net D.S.L. additions in the second quarter -- to 78,000 from 88,000 in the previous quarter -- fueling concern that the company may not be able to reach its goal of 600,000 D.S.L. subscribers by the end of the year. BellSouth says its target is still within reach, even though the company recently raised prices for its business D.S.L. services to $79.95, from $59.95.
"When you see BellSouth raising D.S.L. prices, it's a sign that the rollout may have been more expensive than originally expected," said F. Drake Johnstone, an analyst at Davenport & Company. "It's worrisome for the long-term goal of catching up with cable."
BellSouth and the other Bells are aggressively seeking to compete with companies that provide fast Internet access over cable networks, through their support of the so-called Tauzin-Dingell bill, sponsored by Representatives Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and John D. Dingell of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee.
The Bells say the bill would put phone companies and cable companies on equal footing. And BellSouth, whose coverage area includes Louisiana, has been especially supportive of the bill and, in particular, Mr. Tauzin. Mr. Ackerman, BellSouth's chief executive, and 38 other BellSouth employees made contributions to Mr. Tauzin's political action committees in 1998 and 1999, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.
BellSouth faces another challenge. To win permission to enter the long-distance market, it must convince regulators that it has done enough to opened its local network to competitors.
So far, though, regulators and competitors have not been overly impressed. In July, the Georgia Public Service Commission fined BellSouth $7 million for not meeting standards in handling orders from competitors for switching customers. And regulators in Florida and Alabama are looking into complaints of anticompetitive practices at BellSouth. Competitors complain, among other grievances, that BellSouth misleads customers by blaming the CLEC's for service disruptions, even when BellSouth may be at fault.
"We don't have a fighting chance with BellSouth," said Keith Kramer, a senior vice president at IDS Telcom. "They're throwing everything they have at us to make us fail."
BellSouth says it is doing its best to treat the CLEC's fairly. And the company says it is optimistic that, despite its recent run-in with regulators in Georgia, it will receive approval this month to provide long-distance service in the state. That would allow BellSouth to enter the market by the end of this year. Other states will follow next year, the company predicts. 
At a local carrier service center here, one of three such facilities where BellSouth processes orders from CLEC's, 380 employees take orders from companies like IDS. So far, the company has hired more than 3,000 employees and invested about $1.6 billion to take orders from competitors on the local level. BellSouth says it processes 35,000 orders from the CLEC's every day. 
"On an operational level, BellSouth has improved in the last few months in terms of efficiently allowing us to sign up customers," Royce J. Holland, chief executive of Allegiance Telecom, a CLEC based in Dallas, said in an interview. "But in other ways, like overcharging us on leases and deposits, they're the masters of the stonewall."
In the last quarter, BellSouth's earnings declined 8.6 percent, to $973 million, or 52 cents a share, from $1.06 billion, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter rose 9 percent, to $7.37 billion, largely because of benefits resulting from increased data operations and from its formation last year of Cingular Wireless with SBC Communications, to create the nation's No. 2 cellular phone company after Verizon Wireless. 
The main reason for the earnings decline was the company's exposure to economic problems in Latin America, where BellSouth has operations in 11 countries.
In a classic example of the downside of currency risk, BellSouth's per-share profit was reduced 5 percent after the weakening of several Latin American currencies. Most investments in the region in licenses and infrastructure were made in dollars, but revenue in depreciating local currencies reduced the dollar value to BellSouth. 
Factoring out the currency problems, however, margins in the region climbed 33 percent in the second quarter. In fact, the company has been praised by big investors for having the most organized and extensive international strategy.
"The short-term blip in Latin America," said Mr. Johnstone, the Davenport analyst, "is something that comes along with gaining a foothold in emerging markets."

Macedonians Plead For a Wider NATO Role
As NATO soldiers travel through Macedonia, it is becoming clear that there is a gap between their limited mission and the expectations of people on both sides of the ethnic conflict. NATO says that it has come only to collect arms from ethnic Albanian rebels, not to protect civilians. But since the soldiers arrived last week, nervous civilians living among bitter ethnic tensions are asking them to do just that. A1

Tense School Days in Mideast
In Jerusalem, the new school year began with the Israeli police on high alert for a Palestinian terrorist attack, perhaps on a school building or a school bus. In the West Bank, Palestinian children passed through multiple Israeli checkpoints. A6

Tensions At U.N. Race Meeting
Israeli and American officials warned that they might walk out of the United Nations conference on racism, accusing Palestinian and Arab delegations of using the conference as a platform to smear Israel. Their remarks came after human rights groups presented a report assailing Israel as "an apartheid regime." A6

Putin Assesses Bush Team
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in an interview with a Finnish newspaper, says he believes that President Bush has a strong reliance on a powerful circle of aides that is still struggling over its priorities, especially in regard to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. A3

Europe's Summer Sensation
On the Continent, usually immune to snickering over gossip, photographs of two prominent politicians have created a stir. The judgment of Germany's defense minister was questioned after he publicized snapshots of himself and his countess fiancee and used government aircraft for their rendezvous. And reportedly nude photos of the French president at his summer home are causing talk. A3

Migrants at Channel Tunnel
A group of about 100 would-be asylum seekers apparently attempted a mass dash toward the Channel Tunnel from France, the French police said. It was the third attempt in a week by groups fleeing a Red Cross migrants' compound for Britain. A7

Talk of Talks Between Koreas
North Korea offered to resume talks with South Korea, as it awaited the arrival of China's president, Jiang Zemin, for two days of talks. North Korea broke contact with the South in March after President Bush suspended talks with the North, saying he was skeptical of being able to verify any agreements. A4

High Stakes for Congress As It Debates Bush Budget
Congress returns from its recess this week and President Bush from his ranch to face a vanishing budget surplus, a limping economy and a long list of competing spending priorities -- in other words, a recipe for a bruising political collision over spending and taxes. With the Senate in Democratic hands by one vote and the House narrowly controlled by Republicans, the stakes are enormous. A1

Reno Is Near Decision on Race
Janet Reno does not seem to mind that her phone rarely stops ringing or that reporters and photographers are driving all over her golf-course-green lawn in Miami on what might otherwise be a lazy Labor Day weekend. Ms. Reno, the former United States attorney general, created this stir when she unexpectedly announced in May that she might run for governor of Florida when the president's brother, Jeb Bush, is up for re-election next year. So far, Ms. Reno has not tipped her hand, but in a weekend interview she suggested that she might announce her decision soon. A10

Drug Agency's New Chief
The new director of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Asa Hutchinson, hopes to make the fight against club drugs like Ecstasy a priority. Club drugs, he said, are harder to intercept than some other drugs because they come in pill form and are easier to conceal. Mr. Hutchinson, a former Arkansas congressman, does not play down the law enforcement side of his job, but he is quick to underscore the need for drug education and rehabilitation, especially for nonviolent offenders. A10

A Term Limit Pledge Broken
Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota is raising money and barnstorming the state, preparing to run next year for a third term -- one that he promised repeatedly not to seek. With a Republican in the White House and control of the Senate up for grabs, "now is not the time for me to walk away," he said. His decision to violate his term limit pledge has given the Republican Party what it believes is its best opportunity next year to knock off an incumbent Democrat and take back the Senate. A12

Shark Attack Kills Boy
A 10-year-old boy died a day after he was bitten in the leg by a shark while surfing at Sandbridge Beach in Virginia Beach. It was the first fatal shark attack in the United States this year. A13

A Ruling on Campaign Spending
A federal district judge in New Mexico has upheld Albuquerque's highly unusual limit on campaign spending in mayoral elections, rejecting one candidate's argument that he has a right protected by the First Amendment and by the United States Supreme Court to spend unlimited amounts of his own money. The case could offer the Supreme Court a vehicle for revisiting its conclusion in a 1976 campaign finance case that spending limits are an unconstitutional infringement on the right of political speech.

HEADLINE: Notions of New Economy Hinge On Pace of Productivity Growth 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Rising prosperity still bathed the nation a year ago when Alan Greenspan opened the annual symposium of Federal Reserve policy makers in this mountain resort with a confident boast that the strong gains in worker productivity that seemed to underlie the robust expansion of the 1990's would continue.
 That contention appears to haunt him today. The nation's boom has collapsed despite the faith of Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the ever-greater efficiencies of the information age would keep on raising profits, incomes and employment at a healthy pace. Instead, the nation is barely skirting a recession, stock prices have fallen, the budget surplus is shrinking and the new economy is losing its charm. 
 Adding injury to insult, the government just last month took the accelerating productivity figures that Mr. Greenspan cited so proudly a year ago and revised them downward. Instead of growing at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in 1999 and 2000, productivity -- the amount that a worker produces in a hour -- grew at a significantly slower rate of 2.6 percent a year during the best years of the economic boom. 
"He must have an awful lot of egg on his face," Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
But don't tell that to Mr. Greenspan. With the Fed's leadership once again gathered here for this year's symposium, the message remained upbeat for the 100 or so experts from government, academia and Wall Street who were invited here. Most expressed their confidence that the vast changes wrought by computer technology are providing a solid foundation for long-run prosperity.
And despite the new figures casting doubt on some of those views, the general mood was that the new economy -- promising strong growth with little inflation -- would endure once the current slowdown ends.
"The preponderance of evidence suggests a continual increase in productivity growth," Lawrence H. Summers, president of Harvard University and Treasury secretary in the administration of President Bill Clinton, declared in an interview here, reaffirming Mr. Greenspan's optimism a year ago.
Mr. Greenspan himself sat through the conference sessions in silence, but he has made clear to other Fed policy makers that he still believes that the productivity miracle is alive and well.
Still, the latest government figures gave ammunition to critics who have long argued that the rapid productivity gains reported in the late 1990's were more of a mirage caused in part by unsustainable business investment. That also led to a spurt in growth that temporarily forced companies to use labor more efficiently.
Much is at stake in this debate. The optimists think that the productivity growth rate will stay above 2.5 percent annually over the long run. The pessimists, by contrast, think that the improvement has been more mundane, more like the 2 percent that the government now says is the average annual rate since 1990.
The impact of that seemingly small gap is enormous. Productivity is the principal contributor to economic growth. It determines whether corporate revenue is rising fast enough to increase wages and profits. When there is enough revenue and profit from productivity, companies are under less pressure to raise prices, so there is less inflation.
Similarly important, the government's projection that it will accumulate a $3.4 trillion budget surplus between now and 2011 relies on a rate of productivity growth of at least 2.5 percent. A more modest gain of 2 percent would mean that the surplus would be roughly $800 billion lower, according to Dan Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Crippen, in a telephone interview from Washington, noted that $800 billion is enough to pay for all of the nation's military expenses for two years and to cover prescription drugs for the elderly for more than a decade. "Probably the biggest uncertainty in our projections is whether the increase in productivity is sustainable," he said.
Mr. Greenspan has argued that an accelerating rate of productivity growth is the chief explanation for the boom that started in the mid-1990's as American companies increased their investments in computer-based information technologies, including the Internet. The productivity growth rate measures the increase in output from each hour of work. From that increase, companies are able to generate higher revenue, adding to profits and to wages for workers without having to raise prices. Profits and wages did in fact rise for nearly five years. The prosperity was real.
But now that the boom has collapsed into sluggish growth, productivity's contribution to that prosperity is uncertain. The revised productivity figures suggest that temporary factors -- an exuberant stock market, excessive business investment, a surge in debt-financed consumer spending, for example -- all played important roles. The Fed's conference here was the first high-powered challenge to a growing view that the new economy lacks staying power.
"There is a lot at stake," said Martin N. Baily, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics and a former chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, who presented a paper at the conference. "Profits will not be as strong, and with less profits business investment in the new technologies will not be as strong and the stock market won't be strong."
There were some skeptics here. One of them, Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist and consultant, says that Mr. Greenspan, having committed himself to the idea of accelerating productivity, cannot easily get off that horse without frightening the markets.
But Mr. Kaufman's dissent was distinctly in the minority. Mr. Summers, co-author of a paper presented here, spoke for the majority, and so did Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who served for a while as President Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser.
"The key question is whether productivity at 2.5 percent is going to continue," Mr. Feldstein said at the final session, summarizing the conference's findings. "My answer is yes. You cannot know this just by looking at the data; you have to look at the economy itself. The information revolution is going to keep us going."
The main argument for those who are optimistic about productivity centers on the belief that hundreds of thousands of companies outside the high-technology sector are still in the process of incorporating the new technologies and changing their practices. They think that these companies have considerable room to improve their efficiency.
But a few experts worry that the efficiencies might be slow in coming. "I cannot say that the optimists are wrong," Mr. Baily said. "I can only say that if I were planning the future, I would count on only 2 percent."
The overall economy can grow and generate prosperity only as fast as the work force itself grows and each worker increases his or her output. The working-age population is expanding at barely 1 percent a year, so most of the nation's gain in prosperity must come from productivity.
Mr. Greenspan has spoken of a potential growth rate of 3.5 percent to 4 percent a year. His critics -- those who doubt that the computer-based technologies are all that special -- see 3 percent, or slightly less, as the limit for economic growth.
Whatever the truth, embracing the higher figure gave Mr. Greenspan justification to hold down interest rates even as the economy surged -- and to cut rates quickly as the slowdown developed. After all, why turn off the boom to fight an inflationary threat that may never materialize?
"There is no question," Mr. Baily said, "that if you believe in the new economy, it lowers your estimate of what inflation will be. That has given the Fed the freedom to act aggressively in cutting interest rates, and the freedom to keep rates down when the upturn finally comes."
But what if those assumptions prove too optimistic? The Congressional Budget Office produced the budget-surplus projections that the Bush administration has cited to justify its $1.3 trillion tax cut. Those who want to privatize a part of Social Security would tap the surplus to help pay the costs.
So far, in making its projections, the budget office has tilted toward the Greenspan camp. It assumed, in its latest revisions announced last week, that productivity would grow at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the next 10 years, down only slightly from its earlier projection of 2.7 percent, but well above the 1.4 percent average rate of productivity growth from 1973 to 1995.
"Last January, we bought into some aspects of the new economy," Mr. Crippen said. "We did not buy into all of it. Historically speaking, our assumptions are not abnormally high."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about the debate over productivity of the economy attributed a phrase erroneously to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. While Mr. Greenspan's statements have implied that he believes the economy can achieve a maximum growth rate near 3.5 to 4 percent a year without rising inflation, he he has not publicly specified rates.

HEADLINE: Putin, Sizing Up Bush, Says the Retinue 'Makes the King' 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin said this weekend that he believes that George W. Bush has a strong reliance on a powerful circle of aides, but that this circle is still struggling over its priorities, especially in regard to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
 In an interview with a Finnish newspaper held Saturday before Mr. Putin's departure for Finland today, the Russian leader was asked to evaluate the first seven months of the Bush administration. He said he found his American counterpart "a comfortable and substantive partner," but at the same time added that he had come to believe in the "correctness of the expression that it is the retinue" of aides "that makes the king." 
 "Of course, it is he who makes the final decision," Mr. Putin added, according to a transcript of the interview issued by his press service, "but we have a feeling that his team has not determined some priorities yet." 
Only when they do, he added, "will our dialogue take on a substantive character." 
The Russian leader seemed to confer a negative judgment on the quality of consultations that have been under way since the two leaders met in Slovenia and Genoa this summer. Moreover, his remarks indicated that Russian officials sense that the debate in Washington over how to proceed with missile defense is still under way and may undergo further change as the White House contemplates a battle in Congress over funding for a $60 billion project whose effectiveness has been intensely debated. 
An influential Russian legislator said here tonight that Russian officials have been urging Mr. Putin to take a "more measured tone" in speaking publicly about Mr. Bush's plans on missile defense.
"Frankly, I do not think it is in our interest to stir up an excessive dust storm on this subject," said Vladimir P. Lukin, a deputy speaker of the Russian Parliament and former ambassador to Washington. Whatever Washington does, Russia's nuclear deterrent will remain unaffected by American missile defenses for at least 10 to 15 years, he said, "so we have no need to be hysterical."
"It is the American authorities who are interested in destroying this treaty," Mr. Lukin continued, "They must deal with the problems this creates with their opposition in Congress, with their allies, with China as it increases its nuclear buildup; it is your problem how to avoid stimulating an arms race with India and Pakistan." 
And, he added, "if they have the money to build the most excessive response to the least probable threat situation, that's O.K." 
Since his first meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Putin has met with each of Mr. Bush's principal advisers: Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who accompanied Mr. Bush to Slovenia in June; Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security aide who traveled to Moscow in July; and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who visited here in August.
Russian officials complained during the summer that they were confused by the variety of statements from Washington on whether the Bush administration plans to negotiate a new strategic accord to replace the ABM treaty and to cut nuclear stockpiles further, or whether it is preparing to act alone. 
Last month, a senior State Department official, John R. Bolton, traveled to Moscow and said in a radio interview that Washington wanted Russian agreement to amend the ABM treaty by the time Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin meet in November in Crawford, Tex. Without such an agreement, Mr. Bolton said, the United States reserved the right to withdraw under terms of the treaty. 
But Mr. Bolton asserted the next day that Washington was not laying down any deadlines. Two days later, Mr. Bush stepped in and said the United States "will withdraw from the ABM treaty on our own timetable at a time convenient to America," but he added that he had no "specific timetable in mind."
Speaking to the Finnish interviewer, Mr. Putin expressed concern that the United States under Mr. Bush might be taking the position that "America is so strong that it does not need any negotiations and any agreements." He said this represents the "most extreme" and "toughest" approach to international relations.
Despite those concerns, Mr. Putin said Russia would not overreact if the United States did decide to withdraw from the ABM treaty. Moscow would continue to work in its foreign policy to rebuild its economy while maintaining "good-natured" relations with its neighbors and main partners. He added that "we, for sure, consider the United States one of them." 
If the United States decides to abandon the treaty approach, Mr. Putin said, "Well, what is to be done? If this is the way, we can only throw up our hands. But even in this event, we will not whip up any hysteria."
In the case of NATO's planned expansion, to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the Russians did lobby vigorously against the increase, only to look powerless when they lost the argument. In the interview on Saturday, Mr. Putin coined the new watchword of the Russian leadership -- "calm."
Over the last several days, both Mr. Putin and his minister of defense, Sergei B. Ivanov, have repeated this mantra in public statements, refraining from warning that Russia could react to a missile shield by putting multiple warheads on a new generation of its missiles.
With the new tone, Mr. Putin appeared to be speaking to a European audience, framing Russia's position as reasonable, consistent and stable, while suggesting that the Bush administration was teetering on recklessness.
"You said that Europe is somewhat concerned about the relations between Russia and the United States," Mr. Putin told the Finnish journalist Saturday. "I would like to calm you down. Russia, at least, is not doing anything that would complicate the international situation."
"We don't violate any of the obligations that we undertook," Mr. Putin said. "We are told that something got obsolete like 1972 ABM treaty. It's not what we say, it's what we are told. We disagree that this treaty is obsolete; nevertheless, expressing good will, we are ready for negotiations."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS RETURNS TO LARGER STAKES IN BUDGET DEBATE 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Congress and President Bush return from vacations this week to face a vanishing budget surplus, a limping economy and a long list of competing spending priorities -- in other words, a recipe for a bruising political collision over spending and taxes.
 With the Senate in Democratic hands by one vote and the House narrowly controlled by Republicans, the political stakes are enormous, especially if a result of the debate is a budget that continues to spend Social Security taxes instead of using them to pay off the federal debt. 
 "No one expected the surplus problem and the Social Security problem to appear this quickly," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader. "Two or three months from the tax cut and here we are already." 
"The way this is resolved will have a lot to do with the next election," Mr. Gephardt said. "People's perceptions could well be formed in this period, with regard to next fall." 
As talks between Congressional leaders and Mr. Bush get under way this week, Mr. Gephardt and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, want the president to revise his budget request to take into account new projections of a much smaller surplus.
But Speaker J. Dennis Hastert has other ideas: making the new 10-year tax cut permanent, pushing for a cut in the capital gains tax and extending the existing tax credit for industrial research and development. A senior Republican aide said that when Mr. Hastert meets with Mr. Bush this week, he would raise these possibilities as ways of countering any further economic weakness.
Complicating the outlook in Congress, which is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday, are sharp differences between the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate over education, trade and energy, which are at the top of the White House's domestic agenda. Disputes also linger between the House and the Senate over campaign finance and health care.
But the immediate quandary is how to pass all 13 bills to finance next year's government programs. That task, which is supposed to be completed this month, has been immeasurably complicated by new estimates showing that Congress has available billions of dollars less than it once expected, unless it dips into the Social Security surplus. That is something both parties had promised not to do.
President Bush said last week that he wanted Congress to direct its immediate attention and the dwindling money first to his two priorities: education and a $18.4 billion increase for the military. But Republicans and Democrats said that it would be impractical, indeed nearly impossible, to take up those two issues first at the exclusion of the rest.
The military spending target looks particularly vulnerable, especially because Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has not completed his sweeping review of Pentagon policies and programs. "We are looking at a funding request to fund a defense of the past and not one of the future," said Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who leads the House Budget Committee. "That is not what was suggested or promised. It has a much higher hurdle to cross."
Lawmakers are also debating whether they can afford other proposals, including an energy plan proposed by Mr. Bush and approved by the House that contains $33 billion in costly tax credits, a proposed farm bill that continues crop subsidies that were to be phased out, some kind of prescription drug benefit for the elderly and assorted other tax breaks that will expire if not extended.
"There isn't anything left over," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. "The combination of an economic slowdown and the tax cut has scooped off the table everything we needed to deal with our long-term problems. It is a huge dereliction of duty."
The Bush camp has continued to say that budget targets can be met and that the picture is far from dire.
"We're dealing with historic, gigantic surpluses under any of these numbers," Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said today on the NBC news program "Meet the Press." 
"We're not talking about cutting spending for next year," Mr. Daniels said. "Spending in the president's budget would go up over $100 billion to strengthen the economy, education and security, and we can do that, consistent with growing -- not shrinking -- surpluses, and it would be misleading to suggest otherwise."
But Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, called that view "divorced from reality, and it is so wrong on the fundamental facts that he put forward that it really underscores the nature of the confrontation that's about to take place."
While Mr. Kerry said it would be unwise to raise taxes or cut spending during an economic downturn, he added, "You have to put everything on the table, and the first step is for the president to be prepared to say, 'We may have misjudged how much money we have available.' "
Republicans, while acknowledging that the surplus shrank unexpectedly fast, said the tax cut was doing precisely what it was intended to do. "Republicans are achieving the goal of leaving Democrats with less money to spend hand-over-fist with before Congress adjourns this year," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader.
But it also made it harder to balance the budget over the coming years without using some money from Social Security taxes, which by agreement have been earmarked recently for reducing the national debt.
Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the government would have to spend $9 billion of the Social Security surplus this year because general tax revenues fell short as the economy softened and taxpayers received a rebate from the new tax bill.
Next year, the projections are only a bit better. Congress is already on a course to spend $661 billion in the 13 spending bills for the 2002 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Aside from Social Security surpluses, there would only be $9 billion more for anything Congress wants to do next year that is not included in current plans, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.
Some Republicans in the House say they must keep their promise not to use the Social Security surplus for everyday government spending, even though analysts agree that it has little practical effect. "My personal view is that any amount of new spending, even defense spending, is not doable in the House if it threatens the Social Security trust fund," said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri who is the chief deputy whip. "We don't have to grow the government at twice the rate of inflation."
Splitting the difference between military and education spending may be a way to satisfy both sides. 
On education, the House and Senate are still at odds over when to take action on failing schools and how to best track improvements in students' academic performance. But the biggest battle is expected to be over money. Mr. Bush requested an increase of $669 million for education in his budget. But the House wants to increase the $18 billion education budget by $5 billion, and the Senate wants to increase it by $16 billion.
Similarly, just before the recess, the House passed a bipartisan bill to overhaul the managed care system. While the bill resembles the Senate version, considerable differences remain over the scope of lawsuits. "It has not been worked out," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who leads the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
In addition, Mr. Hastert expects to move quickly on a bill that would give Mr. Bush more flexibility in negotiating trade agreements, something the president considers a priority. The Senate, however, is not enthusiastic. "When are we going to do that?" asked Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the second-ranking Democrat. "Is it more important than a patients' bill of rights or education? Forget about it. Do it next year."
The Senate will hold hearings on its energy plan, but the outcome, if there is one this year, is not expected to reflect the House version, which includes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and dozens of expensive tax breaks for the oil, coal and gas industries.
The Senate also has little interest in moving on a bill that would increase federal financing for charities run by religious groups. The House has already passed a bill for Mr. Bush's religion-based initiative.
The farm bill may be another casualty of the budget wars, with even the White House saying money must be found before the bill can be pushed through.
A prescription drug benefit for older people also appears imperiled this year, although Democrats and Republicans say $300 billion has been set aside for the next 10 years for that program and other changes in Medicare.
Mr. Kennedy said Senate Democrats would push hard for a $1.50-an-hour increase in the minimum wage, but Republicans want the wage increase to go hand-in-hand with tax credits for businesses.
And in the House, supporters of a bill to overhaul the campaign finance system still hope to force the legislation onto the floor by collecting 218 signatures from members, a fight Republicans would like to avoid. The Democrats have said they are only a dozen or so votes short.
To avoid that kind of power play on the budget, Democrats say Mr. Bush should make the first move and get the negotiations started with some concrete proposals. "The president has got to get engaged," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. "If he does, it doesn't have to be unpleasant."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
House to Focus On NetAccess And Competition

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Shortly after Congress reconvenes tomorrow, the House will take up a complex bill that raises two simple, essential questions about the nation's digital future. In the effort to deliver high-speed Internet service to consumers, what is the ideal number of competitors? And should the government make that decision?
 In recent years, the battle for high-speed, or broadband, access has been dominated by two technologies. One is digital subscriber lines, or D.S.L., which use telephone wires. The other is cable modems, which use cable television lines. Despite the development of satellite and land-based wireless systems, the broadband media world will continue to be ruled by phone wires and cable lines for many years. 
 Cable lines are essentially under the sole control of the cable companies that own them, companies like AT&T and AOL Time Warner. 
The question posed by the House bill is whether the Bell local telephone carriers, companies like SBC and Verizon, should essentially have sole control of Internet access over phone lines or whether competing companies should also have a fighting chance to use those local connections.
The bill appears to have a reasonable chance of passage in the House but much stronger opposition in the Senate.
If the bill became law, it would be difficult for competitors to build a sustainable business delivering high-speed Internet service to consumers over telephone networks. Congress would basically have determined that the consumer broadband market should be a competitive duopoly of cable operators and the Bell companies, with a small role played by satellite providers.
If the House bill fails, on the other hand, the Bell companies will continue to be obliged to share many parts of their networks with outside companies. Because cable companies are generally under no such obligations, the Bell companies will continue to face costs and regulatory hurdles that cable providers do not.
The issue is really that simple: should the nation's broadband future be determined by a clean fight between two big combatants or by a messy battle among many potential competitors?
The bill in question is known as Tauzin-Dingell, for its two principal sponsors, Representatives Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and John D. Dingell of Michigan, the committee's ranking Democrat, both longtime supporters of the Bell companies' aspirations. In pressing for the bill, the Bells have adopted a time-honored technique: try to convince Congress that there is a problem and then convince Congress that the bill will solve it.
But neither assertion is quite true.
The foundation of the Bells' case is that broadband Internet access is not being introduced quickly enough and that what they describe as the slow pace of broadband deployment is hurting the economy.
In a speech two weeks ago in Aspen, Colo., before the Progress and Freedom Foundation, Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon's senior vice president for public policy and external affairs, cited the growth of a number of new communications services, including the Net.
"Trouble is, the rate of adoption of these technologies has slowed dramatically, along with the growth of the economy itself," he said. "So what's flattened the slope of the curve in 2001? The answer is the lack of widespread deployment of broadband technology."
He added, "At the very moment when the U.S. economy is mired in a high-tech slump, broadband is still in the 'beta' phase."
But in fact, broadband is already beyond the beta, or test, stage. By the end of this year, about 17 percent of the nation's Internet-linked homes, or more than 10 million homes over all, will be using broadband, according to analysts. That figure would be up from close to zero just four years ago.
The Bell companies argue that this is slow growth. But listen to what Bell executives have to say about the pace of competition in the local telephone market, which was opened to outsiders five years ago.
"The F.C.C. says that nationwide, competitors have taken about 8 percent of the lines," F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth's chairman, said in an interview last week, referring to the Federal Communications Commission. "It's moving along at a very rapid clip."
Can 17 percent penetration of broadband be slow if 8 percent penetration of local phone competition over a comparable period is rapid?
It is hard to detect a crisis in broadband deployment. Verizon itself says that almost half of its roughly 60 million lines are capable of carrying D.S.L. and that it plans to invest $4.7 billion this year alone in high-speed data services.
The real crisis for the Bell companies appears to be that they are lagging the cable operators in winning broadband customers. By the end of the year, cable operators will have about 7 million broadband customers, compared with about 3.3 million D.S.L. subscribers, according to the Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston.
It is true that under current law the cable companies do not have to open their networks to competitors, while the Bell companies do. But that is not the reason for the disparity in cable broadband and D.S.L. subscriptions.
To begin with, the big cable companies took a lead of at least two years in widely adding Internet broadband technology to their systems. Moreover, for some arcane technical reasons, cable modems by most accounts are a superior product, faster and far more reliable than D.S.L. for most homes.
The technical gulf is clear, and on condition of anonymity, Bell executives acknowledge its existence. Those disparities are why the Bell companies want to extend optical fiber deeper into their networks, closer to the customers' homes, in hopes of approaching technical parity with the cable operators.
One of the central provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was that the Bell companies must sell direct access to parts of their networks to other companies. The core of the Tauzin-Dingell bill essentially says that as the Bell carriers extend optical fiber into their networks, other companies will not have the right to buy direct access to those new Bell lines. For many if not most outside D.S.L. companies, losing that ability would be tantamount to being put out of business. (Even under the current ground rules, D.S.L. companies are going out of business nearly every week.)
The Bell companies argue that if they make investments to improve their networks, they should not have to "unbundle," or sell direct access to, the new parts of those systems to outsiders. Many people in Washington see some merit in that argument. In the late 1990's, the F.C.C. agreed to exempt SBC and Verizon from unbundling requirements for their data systems, as long as those companies placed their data operations in separate subsidiaries. 
That arrangement, however, was overturned by a federal court last winter. So now, with the Tauzin-Dingell bill, the Bells are trying to win an unbundling exemption that is far broader than the F.C.C. had granted, and without setting up the separate subsidiaries.
Passing the Tauzin-Dingell bill would change the nation's digital landscape. In the name of embracing market forces, Congress would be determining the design.

HEADLINE: Hints of Change in Myanmar 

 BODY:
Recent weeks have brought signs that the repressive military junta that has ruled Myanmar since 1988 may be reconsidering its stranglehold on the country's democratic forces, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner. Washington and other governments should encourage this process, but must maintain economic sanctions against the junta until the generals agree to end their tyrannical rule. 
 Last week, a United Nations special envoy, Razali Ismail, visited Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, for four days of meetings with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and military leaders. Regrettably, the junta's leader, Gen. Than Shwe, declined to meet with Mr. Razali. But the opposition and the military have been talking since last fall, and last week two senior leaders of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were released from house arrest. Nearly 200 N.L.D. members have been freed since the dialogue with the military began. But more than 1,500 people remain jailed for political reasons, including 29 N.L.D. members of the parliament elected in 1990 but never convened. 
 The military is being pushed toward dialogue by the feeble state of Myanmar's economy. International aid and foreign investment have been drastically curtailed since the 1988 coup. The economic pressure has triggered a debate within the junta, and some members now argue for compromise with the N.L.D. and the country's non-Burmese ethnic minorities. To be meaningful, such a compromise would have to include liberating Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and releasing all imprisoned N.L.D. members. The party must be allowed to function freely, with new democratic elections scheduled and the junta pledging to abide by the results. There must also be an end to forced labor, which remains widespread in Myanmar. 
Unfortunately, Japan seems unwilling to wait for such steps. It recently announced a resumption of development aid and is now weighing a grant of more than $20 million to modernize a power plant that serves military as well as civilian needs. The prospect of resumed foreign aid can be a useful incentive for further steps by the junta. That aid should not be granted prematurely.

Lowering the Risk of Bacterial Meningitis

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
Bacterial meningitis is not a common disease, striking about 1 person in 100,000 in the United States each year. But for several reasons, it causes alarm far out of proportion to the number of people affected. 
 First, it is highly contagious, spread by direct droplet infection -- a cough or sneeze, a kiss or even a drink from a contaminated cup, although not by casual contact or breathing the air where an infected person has been. Second, it has a high fatality rate -- up to 15 percent despite treatment and as much as 50 percent without treatment -- and can rapidly assume a fatal course that cannot be reversed by antibiotics and other treatments. Third, many who survive it are left with lifelong health problems, like learning disabilities, mental retardation, hearing loss, kidney failure and limb amputations. 
 But it is the fourth reason that accounts for much of the fear and anxiety: a disproportionate number of victims are children or young adults, with the greatest number being college freshmen who live in dormitories. 
A nationwide study in The Journal of the American Medical Association this month revealed that, while college students had a lower rate of severe bacterial meningitis than the general population of those ages 18 to 23, the rate among freshmen in dormitories was more than three times as high, or 5.1 per 100,000.
A second new study in the same journal examined all 295 cases of bacterial meningitis that had occurred among those ages 15 through 24 in Maryland in the last decade. Dr. Lee H. Harrison of the University of Pittsburgh, who directed the study, reported that although a vast majority of victims were previously healthy, nearly one in four of them died, a fatality rate more than four times as high as that found in people younger than 15.
Now, as universities are reopening their doors to full-time students, it is important to learn more about this disease, its early symptoms and appropriate treatment, and especially how most cases can be prevented through vaccination.
Federal health officials recommend that every college student be told about bacterial meningitis and made aware of potential protection from a vaccine that could prevent up to 85 percent of cases that occur in the college years. Many schools offer the vaccine through their campus health services or at special clinics.

Tricky Disease
Meningitis, an infection of the membrane surrounding the brain and the spinal cord, has many causes. Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and is much less likely to cause severe illness or death; most people who get it recover on their own, perhaps with supportive treatment and sometimes an antiviral agent.
Bacterial meningitis, commonly caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis and referred to as meningococcal meningitis, is sneaky. It typically starts like influenza: the sudden onset of an intense headache, fever, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and malaise. But unlike the flu, a stiff neck and intolerance of lights are frequent symptoms of the disease. Also unlike the flu, meningococcal meningitis within hours of the first symptoms can progress to delirium, coma or convulsions and invade the bloodstream, setting off a bodywide infection that attacks organs and can cause circulatory collapse, a hemorrhagic rash and gangrene.
So at the first suspicion of meningitis in any person, the case must be treated like a medical emergency, with immediate hospitalization. The diagnosis is made by examining the fluid obtained through a spinal tap. A crucial step is to identify the particular "serotype" of the causative bacterium and its susceptibility to antibiotics.
The more common serotypes in teenagers and young adults are A and C. The available vaccine protects against these and against types Y and W135. There is no vaccine for Type B, which more often afflicts young children. They are routinely protected against the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in this age group, Hemophilus influenza b, by the Hib vaccine that is administered to infants and toddlers.
In the past, bacterial meningitis occurred in epidemic fashion among military recruits in boot camps, where young men from many areas shared germs new to their fellow recruits. But in recent decades, all recruits have been routinely immunized and the disease has become rare in this population. Bacterial meningitis may occur more often in college freshmen who live in dormitories because they are likely to be in close contact and exposed to a spectrum of germs to which they are not immune.
Dr. Harrison's study, as well as several previous studies, identified several factors that appeared to increase a person's risk of getting meningococcal meningitis. Of special relevance to high school and college students is cigarette smoking, including passive smoking, and alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking. In an interview, he said smokers coughed more, increasing the chances of transmitting the infection to others, and that drinkers often shared glasses.
Dr. Harrison also said, based on an earlier study, that college students were hardly the only young people at increased risk of developing severe bacterial meningitis. The highest risk he had found was among 17-year-olds, most of whom would be in high school.
Adding to the problem of preventing bacterial meningitis is that some people become carriers of the infection; they are not sick themselves but can transmit it to others, leaving the source of the infection a mystery.

Prevention by Vaccine
For several reasons, there has been a delay of decades in recommending that all young people be immunized against the most common strains of bacterial meningitis. The vaccine, designed to protect against four strains of the N. meningitidis bacterium, is far from perfect. Because some strains are missing, it does not work in all of those who receive it, and it remains effective generally for only about three years. Still, if everyone received the vaccine, the phenomenon of herd immunity could greatly reduce the chance of infection among those at greatest risk, especially those who live for several years in close quarters.
A second factor is cost. Each immunization costs about $75, and as a public health measure it is difficult to justify mass immunization for such a rare disease. But, as Dr. Harrison noted, complex economic and other factors are involved that more than warrant protecting adolescents and young adults.
The disease is a major reason for litigation and widespread panic, he said. The occurrence of just one case in a school setting, for example, provokes a costly public health response involving immunizations, antibiotics to those potentially exposed, and a follow-up of all contacts.
Dr. Harrison, among many others, supports the two-year-old recommendation of a federal health advisory panel that college freshmen be informed about the disease and the availability of the vaccine, which is safe and effective against most of the strains that infect college students. College students can still get the needed protection; the vaccine takes effect within a week or two, and the peak incidence of bacterial meningitis is from November to March.
People already on campus would be wise to check with college health services for information about vaccine availability. Some colleges are routinely immunizing freshmen at no cost to the students.
At the same time, an improved vaccine against the C serotype is being used in Britain, and several pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop a similar product to protect against the remaining serotypes.

HEADLINE: Novel Franco-American Artistic Exchange 

BYLINE:  By PAULA DEITZ 

 BODY:
In 1801, during the Napoleonic era, the first 15 provincial museums were officially created in France. A museum like the Palais des Beaux-Arts at Lille was given 46 paintings from the Louvre and Versailles to add to its collection of works salvaged from churches and convents in disuse after the revolution. It then became part of the national system of museums that to this day report to a central director in Paris.
 The procedure has worked smoothly for 200 years, and connoisseurs of art know that to see particular masterpieces in the national collection, one must travel to Bordeaux or Lyon or Lille, just as in this country, visits to museums in Cleveland, San Francisco or Dallas are required for a complete education in the arts. 
 Now a major exchange program is under way to extend the reach and scope of regional museums in both countries and to enable art lovers on both sides of the Atlantic to see outstanding works that might otherwise be overlooked. On Oct. 10, "Made in USA: American Art 1908-1943, Between Nationalism and Internationalism," the first major Franco-American exhibition, will open in Bordeaux at the Musee des Beaux-Arts. 
The exhibition, which was curated by Eric de Chassey, a French historian of American art at the University of Tours who has obviously brought an innovative approach to the subject, includes 70 paintings, along with works on paper and photographs, gleaned from American and French museums as well as from private collections. This will be the first exhibition in France of this American period. It will feature works of American Impressionism, the Ashcan school, the Dada movement and the Precisionists, among other modernist movements. From Bordeaux the show will travel to Rennes and Montpellier. In 2002-03 a show of sacred American Indian art will tour France, and in 2003-04 masterpieces of 17th-century French painting will travel to Cleveland and Portland, Ore.
This focus on outstanding works in French and American regional museums germinated in the minds of Elizabeth Rohatyn and her husband, Felix G. Rohatyn, the former United States ambassador to France. Very soon after their arrival in Paris in 1997 during the Clinton administration, Mr. Rohatyn realized he was not just ambassador to Paris but to all of France, and he undertook to open consulates in five provincial cities, three of which were governed by mayors who had been prime ministers. He suggested to his wife -- a former board chairman of the New York Public Library and a former vice chairman of Channel 13 -- that she propose a parallel cultural initiative. 
The idea came to her while the couple were traveling back from Lyon on the TGV, the high-speed train: why not forge a link between French provincial and American regional museums that would produce exchanges and exhibitions based on their joint collections? 
Now back in New York, Mrs. Rohatyn announced the program called Frame (French Regional American Museum Exchange) at a reception last spring at the French Cultural Service in New York sponsored by the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute. She recounted the experiences of directors and curators from 18 museums (nine from each country) at their first seminar in Lyon, who began as proud protectors of their own turf and ended up, as she described it, by "falling all over each other."
The differences in organization are considerable -- the French are controlled by a central government administrator, the Americans by individual board -- and Mr. Rohatyn, in an aside, compared this initial confrontation to "Napoleon meeting entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley." Of course many of the Americans were also meeting one another for the first time. 
The participants developed a program of back-to-basics exhibitions from the walls and storage of smaller museums accompanied by fine scholarly catalogs, an antidote to the gigantism that has developed elsewhere in the museum world. With a total of 1.5 million objects from their combined collections, these museums hope to gain visibility internationally through their art rather than through building programs.
Since Frame's formation in 1999, directors and curators have been meeting in and touring member museums together on both sides of the Atlantic to study the collections in preparation for future exhibitions. Working closely with Mrs. Rohatyn during the initial stages, Francoise Cachin, the former director of the French National Museums, selected nine museums representing regions undergoing major economic and cultural development. 
The museum at Lille, for example, is at an important geographic crossroads, two hours from London on the Eurostar to Brussels and an hour from Paris on the TGV. Its museum is considered second only to the Louvre. The imposing 1891 Beaux-Arts building facing a main square was recently renovated by the architects Ibos and Vitart.
The Lille museum's director, Arnauld Brejon de Lavergnee, oversees an array of European old master paintings, drawings by Raphael and a medieval collection in underground cryptlike galleries. New Yorkers had a major view of these treasures, including Peter Paul Rubens's "Descent From the Cross," in a 1992 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In his catalog introduction on that occasion, Mr. Brejon de Lavergnee pointed out the obvious: that a museum in the French provinces was not provincial in the English sense of the word. 
"The choice of American museums was based on different criteria reflecting the range of their origins as either state, municipal, university or private institutions," said Sybille Heftler, one of the French coordinators, who is also director of the Foundation for French Museums, an organization that had already been promoting relations between French and American museums. Richard R. Brettell, who teaches aesthetics at the University of Texas where he directs a center for museum studies, advised on the ultimate American selection, also taking into consideration the ability of directors and curators to speak French.
"As in any international forum, there have been difficulties and relationships to smooth out along the way," explained Mr. Brettell, who is now Frame's American coordinator. In the end, he stressed, resolving these differences has strengthened everyone's determination that the organization would succeed.
The American museums have been given the kind of access to the French system hitherto available only to major museums and, at the same time, are learning to cooperate regionally in this country themselves. The French museums are learning about the great cultural diversity of American collections, which range from antiquities to contemporary art (as well as about American-style fund-raising).
While 19th-century and post-World War II American art is well known in France, during their visits here, the French curators and directors were surprised by the range and quality of earlier 20th-century American art, and the Bordeaux show was a result. 
In addition to major exhibitions like "Sacred Symbols: Three Thousand Years of Native American Art," and "Masterpieces of 17th-Century French Painting" the group will also mount smaller shows to elucidate the work of individual artists.
One exhibition, "The Master of the Embroidered Foliage," will highlight an altarpiece from Lille, a circa 1500 triptych with the central panel of a Madonna and child leafing through a book. The title refers to a Netherlands artist, so identified by the art historian Walter Friedlander because of the floral designs of the tapestries and rugs he paints into the background. The altarpiece will be joined by two similar panel paintings of the Madonna and child by the same artist from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, both Frame museums, along with two additional panels known to exist in museums in Edinburgh and in Bruges, Belgium. Thus, art historians will have the rare opportunity to compare these works and to puzzle over details of iconography.
During a recent interview in Paris, Francine Mariam-Ducray, the new director of French museums, remarked on how rapidly Frame's level of cooperation had produced results, not only with exhibitions but on the technical plane of conservation. She also expressed the hope that in time American curators would actually come to work in France. On this same occasion, Rodolphe Rapetti, the chief curator of France's artistic heritage and, with Mrs. Heftler, the other French coordinator of Frame, reflected on how despite public support no museum exists without private generosity, and this attitude extends to the Frame participants as well.
Ironically, on a visit to the Cleveland Museum of Art, the French discovered the well-known and imposing 1824 portrait of Count Jean-Antoine Chaptal, the founder of French museums under Napoleon, by Antoine-Jean Gros. But in the spirit of this new collaborative venture, Mr. Rapetti allowed, "We are not going to claim it for France."

HEADLINE: For the Kursk, a Risky Resurrection 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 

 BODY:
For nearly 400 days since two mysterious torpedo room explosions ripped open the nuclear submarine Kursk, causing the deaths of all 118 Russian crewmen, the 505-foot vessel has been nestling into the sediments on the bottom of the Barents Sea.
 Periodically, Russian warships on guard above the wreck have thrown live hand grenades into the water, to ward off any prying foreign submarines that may be interested in scavenging the Kursk's weapons, codes or electronics. 
 Now, a fleet of high-tech salvage vessels is taking over from the warships. If all goes according to plan -- and little has so far -- a Dutch lifting barge called the Giant 4, tethered by eight anchor lines, will raise the Kursk from the seabed later this month using 26 computer-controlled hydraulic jacks in an operation that, its designers say, can be accomplished in 12 to 16 hours.
But the raising of the Kursk, one of the largest and most complex salvages ever attempted, is fraught with dangers. The crews must avoid disturbing the Kursk's twin nuclear reactors and jostling its lethal payload of unexploded torpedoes and 22 supersonic cruise missiles, still snug in their 30-foot launching canisters. Each carries a warhead packed with nearly 1,000 pounds of high explosives. 
Russian officials say the risks are outweighed by their duty to the perished crew as well as the Arctic environment. In November, during the first examination of the interior of the submarine by Russian divers since the Aug. 12 explosion, 12 bodies were recovered, but perhaps 100 more remain entangled in the wreckage of the control room or locked in the rear compartments, where sailors fled the onrushing sea, then waited in darkness -- some writing farewell notes to loved ones -- for the rescue that never came.
President Vladimir V. Putin, criticized in an emotional encounter with the families of Kursk crew members for the navy's inability to stage a rescue, returned to the Kremlin and told Russia's leading submarine designer, Igor D. Spassky, that the sub had to be lifted to pay tribute to the crew and to give proper burial to the bodies that could be found.
"He promised that to the relatives, and our president is from a category of people who keep their word," Mr. Spassky said in an interview at the Rubin Design Bureau in St. Petersburg last week. 
Looking on is a nervous Europe, where there are always fears of another Chernobyl-style radiation spill. Big salvage projects can produce big disasters. In 1974, when the Hughes Glomar Explorer latched onto a Soviet Golf-class submarine that sank in 17,000 feet of water northwest of Hawaii -- part of a secret recovery scheme conceived by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Navy -- the stresses of the lift broke the submarine apart, sending large pieces crashing back to the bottom.
The Kursk will be raised from relatively shallow waters, less than 350 feet, but the Kursk weighs nearly 10 times as much as a Golf-class submarine. And if Kursk breaks apart and spills the highly radioactive contents of its reactors in the Barents Sea, the results will threaten one of the most productive fishing grounds in the Arctic.
"This is a big, supermodern military object which has 22 supermodern missiles on board with big warhead charges -- not nuclear -- but powerful charges, and two reactors, and all this in the center of an area which is in economic use in shallow waters," Mr. Spassky said. "I cannot conceive that such an object could be left on the ocean bottom."
Even recoveries from shallow depths can be tricky. The United States Navy recovered the submarine Squalus after it went down in 243 feet of water off Portsmouth, N.H., in May 1939, but the recovery vessels dropped the boat twice before getting it back into port, where it was renamed the Sailfish and served in World War II.
"This is the biggest lift ever made from the seabed," points out Malcolm Dailey, the senior contracts manager with the Dutch heavy lift and transport company Mammoet who is directing the Kursk lift. But even so, he seemed to be full of confidence last week that -- weather permitting -- it will be done safely.
"Our idea is to peel the Kursk off the bottom," said Mr. Dailey, 49, a Briton who now lives in Houston. "The sub is laying at a five-degree angle and her bow is stuck into the mud that is the consistency of chewing gum." In the year since the sinking, the mud has risen nearly 10 feet around the bow.
Standing on the deck of the Giant 4 the other day as it prepared to depart Amsterdam for the Arctic waters near Kursk, Mr. Dailey said that while he worried about radiation accidents and torpedo and missile explosions during the lifting of the Kursk, his biggest worry was how to break the suction force of a 17,000-ton ship stuck in the mud. Explosions are one thing, but "mud is mud," he said. The slimy bottom sediments may make the hull seem as if it were glued to the earth.
Moreover, Mammoet must ensure that it does not pull harder than the hull of the Kursk can withstand. One great unknown is what hidden structural damage the Kursk suffered along the hull, its ribs, frames and bulkheads when the second and most devastating explosion went off with the force of 10,000 pounds of TNT and produced a shock wave as powerful as an earthquake of 3.5 magnitude.
Much of Mr. Dailey's strategy is focused on the first three to four hours of the lifting sequence when he will raise only the tail of the Kursk, then slide a cable underneath the hull that two auxiliary ships on the surface will pull along the keel trying to separate the Kursk from the mud.
"This is to create a gap to get water between the submarine and the soil so she will want to come up and we can minimize the breakout force," Mr. Dailey said. 
This "breakout force" is his nightmare. In the worst case, the lifting barge would pull with thousands of tons of pressure against the Kursk only to have it suddenly pop free of the bottom, surge upward like a yo-yo toward the barge, then fall back to the bottom, yanking the barge with a tremendous whiplash that could damage or destroy the lifting equipment.
Working with Mammoet are Smit Tak, a marine subsidiary of Smit International and Halliburton Subsea, a Norwegian subsidiary of the American energy and construction giant formerly headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. Mammoet won the contract on the strength of its pledge to raise the submarine this year; the company said only bad weather could excuse failure.
The preparation for raising the Kursk has taken months, and a complex choreography of engineering tasks must be executed in the next few weeks, or the threat of Arctic storms will shut down operations until spring.
"Good weather is a rare thing in this region," said Timur B. Amirov, the engineer who commissioned the Kursk from the Severodvinsk shipyard in 1994. Working in double shifts, Severodvinsk workers this summer built the two submersible pontoons that will slide under the port and starboard sides of the Giant 4 after it has lifted the Kursk. The extra flotation will help with the transport of the Kursk to a drydock at Roslyakovo 150 miles away.
Russian and European divers, meanwhile, working from mid-July to the end of August, cut 26 holes in the Kursk's hull to provide lifting points for the expandable plugs that will be lowered from the Giant 4 and inserted into the hull.
The engineers had two options to lift the Kursk, cranes or hydraulic jacks. Mammoet opted for jacks, which can lift a greater load, with more than two dozen of them spread along the submarine's hull.
The lifting lines are actually bundles of 54 steel cables attached to the plugs that, once inserted into the submarine, will expand hydraulically and wedge themselves under Kursk's ribs for the lift. 
No holes were cut in the Kursk's sixth compartment -- where the twin 190 megawatt reactors sit, still generating a low level of heat -- because the reactor containment vessels are so close to the hull that the huge lifting plugs could not be inserted without damaging them. 
Each of the 26 lifting units will bear about 750 tons of the Kursk's weight. Tests conducted at Russia's Krylov Institute in St. Petersburg demonstrated that each bundle of cables could actually bear at least 2,000 tons each -- nearly triple the load that should be necessary to do the job -- before the testing device broke. 
Before the lift, the most important task is slicing off a 45- to 50-foot section of the Kursk's destroyed bow, where torpedo fragments and even complete warheads could be hidden in the debris.
"In the area where the slicing of the compartment will take place, I can say with confidence there are no torpedoes left," said Rear Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff for the northern fleet. "But there may be torpedoes in the other corners of the first compartment, which are littered with metal debris. That is why we take serious security precautions." No divers will be in the water during the cutting.
So much of Kursk's bow is destroyed, and so much mud has settled in the first compartment, that Mammoet's engineers feared it might break off during the lift, or start shimmying in a way that would destabilize the lift. The Russian navy plans to raise the bow section separately next year as part of its investigation into the explosions.
Still, the cutting could be tricky and already has caused delays.
The cutting tool is actually a huge chain saw of abrasive cylinders strung on a cable stretched between two suction moorings and operated remotely by Smit Tak engineers.
The moorings are really just giant pipes that stand on the bottom and then suck themselves into the seabed mud as water is pumped out of their interior. 
The saw is operated remotely between the moorings in a back-and-forth motion controlled from the MT Carrier barge that Smit Tak towed to the Barents Sea. Last month, however, the MT Carrier was forced to retreat to Kirkenes, Norway, for modifications when tests showed that the Kursk's hull -- a sandwich of high-tensile steel and sound dampening material -- was tearing up the cylinders on the chain saw, threatening to break the carrying cable. The solution was to add spacers between the cylinders.
After more tests on the saw, the cutting operation could begin this week. When the Giant 4 barge arrives from Amsterdam, the stage will be set for the lift.
A Global Positioning System accurate within a meter will be fixed on the front and rear of the barge to help the crew keep it precisely over the Kursk.
As the 26 lifting units are attached to the sub by divers, echo sounders and radiation monitors will be mounted on the Kursk to provide a real-time stream of data to the computers aboard the Mayo, the support ship that will serve as a command center for the lift.
That's where Mr. Dailey will be, surrounded by a fleet of civilian support ships and Russian warships charged with responding to dozens of contingencies that might arise if something goes wrong.
If Mr. Dailey succeeds in coaxing the Kursk out of the mud, engineers on the barge will test the load on each of the 26 jacks to determine the weight of the Kursk minus its bow. They will also try to locate its center of gravity, a critical calculation so as to avoiding stresses that could cause the hull to snap and to keep the boat level in the ascent.
As the estimated 15,000 tons of steel and machinery rise, the barge will continue to ride up and down on waves up to 10 feet high, but the jacks and the Kursk will stand in isolation from the motion of the sea surface. They will be able to do so thanks to computer-driven "heave" compensators on the barge. The heave compensators operate like huge shock absorbers mounted under the lifting jacks, which are suspended high above the deck of the Giant 4. The shock absorbers are filled with liquid nitrogen, chosen because it is not explosive and is quick to respond to the motion of the sea.
"Oil is too slow and air will explode in some circumstances," Mr. Dailey said.
It will take 12 to 16 hours to travel a little more than 300 feet from the bottom to a submerged position directly underneath the Giant 4, whose underside has been modified to conform to the Kursk's contours, with shaped sockets cut out to receive the tail fin and conning tower of the Kursk like a glove.
"If all of the systems they have lined up work as they are designed to work, then it ought to work out nicely, but like any other engineering feat, there are likely to be some glitches," said J. Brad Mooney Jr., a retired rear admiral who in 1964 was the test pilot for the bathyscaph Trieste II more than 8,000 feet down into the Atlantic to find the United States nuclear submarine Thresher, which had sunk the year before. 
The Kursk will be squeezed with 2,000 tons of pressure against the Giant 4 and the contoured supports welded on its hull to hold the Kursk in place for the 150-mile ride into port, where the sea and current will create some of the most complex and dangerous "hammering" forces between the sub and the Giant 4 as they are towed at four knots.
Two routes have been selected for this risky passage. One, in open sea, would take less than two days. A second, hugging the coast and passing behind Kildin Island, could take much longer, if the Giant 4 has to evade Arctic storms and high seas.
Finally, when the Kursk, lying hidden under the sandwich of barge and pontoons, prepares to slide into drydock at Roslyakovo, just north of Murmansk, the submarine will be raised high enough to be visible.
Once the Kursk is in drydock, Giant 4 and the pontoons will detach and slide out, leaving the Kursk like a silent leviathan for the post-mortem of the Russian navy. 
The first task will be the removal of the bodies still aboard.

HEADLINE: Recovering Japan's Wartime Past -- and Ours 

BYLINE:  By Steven C. Clemons; Steven C. Clemons is executive vice president of the New America Foundation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Celebrations this Saturday of the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Treaty of Peace, which established the postwar relationship between Japan and the world, will focus on Japan's emergence as a pacifist market economy under the tutelage of its conqueror and later ally, the United States. Little attention will be paid to questions of historical memory or of liability for Japan's behavior during the war. The 1951 treaty, largely through the efforts of America's principal negotiator, John Foster Dulles, sought to eliminate any possibility of war reparations. This undoubtedly cemented Japan's alliance with the United States and helped its economic rebirth. But Dulles's and Japan's strategy also fostered a deliberate forgetfulness whose consequences haunt us today.
 Dulles had been a United States counsellor at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, with special responsibility for reparations. He had opposed, without much success, the heavy penalties imposed by the Allies on Germany. These payments were widely seen as responsible for the later collapse of Germany's economy and, if obliquely, for the rise of Nazism. After World War II, Dulles feared that heavy reparations burdens would similarly cripple Japan, make it vulnerable to Communist domination and prevent it from rebuilding. It was crucial to Dulles that Japan not face claims arising from its wartime conduct. The San Francisco Treaty has been used to this day, by Japan and America, as a shield against any such claims. 
 Nonetheless, when he had to, Dulles allowed an exception, one that has remained largely hidden. The signatories to the San Francisco Treaty waived "all reparations claims of the Allied Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals in the course of the prosecution of the War." But recently declassified documents show that Dulles, in negotiating this clause, also negotiated a way out of it.
Dulles had persuaded most of the Allied powers to accept the treaty. One major nation that refused to sign was Korea, because of its enmity against Japan for colonizing the Korean Peninsula. India, China and the Soviet Union also declined to sign.
For a brief while it appeared that the Netherlands would do likewise. Only days before the treaty was to be signed, the Dutch government threatened to walk out of the convention because it feared that the treaty "expropriated the private claims of its individuals" to pursue war-related compensation from Japanese private interests. Tens of thousands of Dutch civilians in the East Indies had lost their property to Japanese companies, which had followed Japan's armies to the Indies. They wanted compensation, and they had political power in Holland.
European opinion mattered to Dulles, who feared that a Dutch exodus might lead the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand to drop out as well. On the day before and the morning of the signing ceremony, Dulles orchestrated a confidential exchange of letters between the minister of foreign affairs of the Netherlands, Dirk Stikker, and Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida of Japan. Yoshida pledged that "the Government of Japan does not consider that the Government of the Netherlands by signing the Treaty has itself expropriated the private claims of its nationals so that, as a consequence thereof, after the Treaty comes into force these claims would be non-existent."
Article 26 of the treaty states that, "should Japan make a peace settlement or war claims settlement with any State granting that State greater advantages than those provided by the present Treaty, those same advantages shall be extended to the parties to the present Treaty." This is why the letters had to be confidential: they preserved the rights of some Allied private citizens, in this case Dutch citizens, to pursue reparations.
Such an agreement, if publicized, could have opened the way for other claims -- reparations was a huge and emotional issue after the war. These letters were not declassified until April 2000, by which time most potential claimants were probably dead.
In 1956, the Dutch did successfully pursue a claim against Japan on behalf of private citizens. Japan paid $10 million as a way of "expressing sympathy and regret." Japan had been slow about making its deal with the Netherlands, and the United States had to remind the Japanese that, as a declassified State Department document puts it, the United States had "exerted considerable pressure on the Netherlands representatives with a view to their signing the Peace Treaty," and "one of the arrangements was assurance that the terms of the Yoshida-Stikker letters would be honored."
A year before, the British noted two other instances in which governments had made deals with Japan for reparations: a settlement with Burma that provided reparations, services and investments amounting, over 10 years, to $250 million; and an agreement with Switzerland that provided "compensation for maltreatment, personal injury and loss arising from acts illegal under the rules of war."
The British Foreign Ministry elected not to take any action on behalf of British nationals -- and chose not to publicize the information. The United States concurred, with one official commenting, "Further pressure would be likely to cause the maximum of resentment for the minimum of advantage." Nonetheless, the Stikker-Yoshida letters and the Burmese and Swiss agreements could all be used to make Japan, under Article 26 of the San Francisco Treaty, offer similar terms to the treaty's 47 signatories.
The price Japan might have paid, in 1951 or later, as atonement for its crimes would, presumably, have been high. Perhaps Dulles's public policy was best. But it may also be that Japan, and even the United States, are paying a different sort of price for the amnesia and secrecy that both countries chose after the war. An American group of former prisoners of war, for example, has pledged to protest the conferences and commemorative galas. These veterans are pursuing financial relief for having been enslaved in wartime by Japanese corporations, notably Mitsui and Mitsubishi. The P.O.W.'s have already lost one case in California. The judge, Vaughn Walker, decided that because of the success of the San Francisco Peace Treaty and of Japan in becoming a strong ally and partner of the United States, the waiver of individual rights to pursue private parties in Japan was justified. This has been the argument in the dozens of suits brought in Japan and a smaller number of cases in American courts. And the argument has so far prevailed.
Judge Walker did recognize that Japan's reparations deals with some countries might present the opportunity for the signatory nations of 1951 to bring their own claims, as provided for in Article 26 of the treaty. However, "the question of enforcing Article 26," he wrote, is "for the United States, not the plaintiffs, to decide."
The failure to support war claims is one of the reasons Japan is still struggling with other nations over its history. The Germans -- at least, West Germans -- have engaged in five decades of public debate about Hitler and the Holocaust. And Germany and other European countries have accepted the need, for their governments or their corporations, to pay reparations for crimes very similar to those committed by Japan and Japanese companies in the same period.
The Japanese, however, have not witnessed the court cases and public debates that would help shape a shared understanding of history among Japanese and their neighbors. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visit last month to the Yasukuni shrine -- which honors the souls of Japan's war dead, including the souls of war criminals -- and the relentless efforts of some Japanese textbook writers to minimize Japan's wartime aggression against Korea and China have further aggravated regional tension over Japan's official history. Because Japan is so ill at ease with debate about its past, other nations understandably distrust a more powerful Japan.
What we know only today is that the State Department arranged a deal that arguably allows Americans and others to pursue personal claims against Japan or Japanese firms -- but tried to keep the agreement quiet. The State Department even filed briefs in the California court against the former American prisoners of war. Of course, it was the State Department that once advanced the claims of Dutch citizens. 
Japan clearly deserves criticism for its inability to debate its past openly. However, the United States, as evidenced by the emerging controversy about the terms of the San Francisco Treaty, has also played a role in Japan's historical amnesia. By withholding documents on American foreign policy, the United States has contributed to a failure of memory that will continue to have consequences for all of us.

HEADLINE: More Trust on Both Sides of the Border 

BYLINE:  By Vicente Fox; Vicente Fox is president of Mexico.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
When I arrive at the White House tomorrow, I'll be bringing something new in my briefcase. It won't be another petition; it won't be another complaint; it won't be another request of the sort that many Americans have become wary of. What I bring is simple yet significant: trust.
 I realize that trust is not a concept that usually springs to mind when Americans think about Mexico. For years, the United States operated on the assumption that Mexico was governed by liars and thieves at worst or, at best, by technocratic authoritarians. Meanwhile, Mexico has long harbored suspicions about its neighbor to the north and acted accordingly. Bad blood and distrust ran deep on both sides of the border, making collaboration on many issues difficult if not impossible. The time has come to make trust the keystone of our agenda. 
 Over the last few years much has changed: the United States and Mexico are no longer just uneasy neighbors. The North American Free Trade Agreement has created an economic partnership, based on shared goals and shared responsibilities. The border is no longer the scar that Carlos Fuentes described in "Gringo Viejo," but part of a North American identity.
More important, democracy has been brought about in Mexico by its people. I won the election in 2000 because I recognized the profound changes that had already taken place and because Mexico was ready to reject the past.
Political reform in Mexico is seeping into all structures of the federal government and out to the state and local levels. The way political power is exercised has begun to change dramatically. The relationship between government and Mexican society is being rebuilt on the basis of accountability and the rule of law. Relations between the government and the media are based on greater transparency and openness. Our government is guided by a system of checks and balances between the different branches of government that curtails presidential power. 
Mexico's democratization can lead to relations with the United States that are based on trust and common goals, where differences of policy can be resolved without rancor. Greater trust explains the important progress we have made over the past few months on many issues. 
Foremost among them is migration, an issue on which Mexico and the United States have agreed to agree. The current situation requires far-reaching policy reforms on both sides of the border. Addressing the situation of the more than three million Mexicans currently in the United States without legal status is one of the central issues in the negotiations currently underway between our governments, along with significant increases in legal entries, a seasonal or guest worker program, and even a shared border-control program. 
Dealing with the migration phenomenon will bring great benefits in both the short and the long term. Working and living conditions would improve for Mexican workers in the United States, disincentives would be created for workers crossing the border without documents and, with the right regional development programs, the Mexican work force could be given economic incentives to stay home, bringing about growth in my country. 
President Bush and I are committed to reaching an agreement that will be fair and humane -- and realistic. We both realize that migration is not simply a problem to be dealt with, but an opportunity to be seized. Migrant labor bolsters the American economy, while migrant remittances fuel the Mexican economy. 
We must also make progress on other items of our bilateral agenda, including counternarcotics cooperation. Our governments need to be united against drug traffickers, whose actions pose such a great threat to our societies. 
We need to improve intelligence and information sharing, and to end counterproductive measures like the annual drug certification process by which the United States unilaterally determines which countries are cooperating in the fight against drugs. Since the beginning of my administration last December, cooperation between our governments has allowed us to extradite an increased number of fugitives and to deliver significant blows to all drug trafficking organizations in Mexico.
Greater trust will also allow more productive forms of interaction in our hemisphere. Mexico and the United States can jointly work to broaden and deepen human rights and democracy in the Americas. Although we will not always see eye to eye, our growing partnership will allow us to disagree constructively on regional and global issues like the proper way to engage Cuba at a moment of change.
Previous Mexican governments lacked the legitimacy and the vision to transform Mexico's foreign policy and to improve the United States-Mexico relationship along these lines. Now is the time to put forward a number of issues that affect both countries and to push decisively for new bilateral understandings.
Tough decisions will have to be made by both governments, and they need to be made now. If we lose momentum, we will lose the opportunities at hand. Mexico is willing to tackle the difficult choices that lie ahead and fully hopes that the United States will meet us halfway. This change in attitude and policies will require trust and fair play. Trust has been sown, and now it needs to flourish.

HEADLINE: U.S. Missteps Wasted Investments in Central Asian Economies, Critics Say 

BYLINE:  By BIRGIT BRAUER 

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
As Communism crumbled, the United States set up investment funds to foster start-up companies and other ventures in fledgling market economies. But many of those efforts were undermined, financial experts say, when Washington appointed individuals with little business experience -- politicians, lawyers and academics -- to make investment decisions.
 A case in point is the Central Asian-American Enterprise Fund. Through a string of bad business decisions, and possibly fraud, the fund has lost as much as $80 million that it received from American taxpayers, resulting in discussions within the United States about shutting it down, said a government official familiar with the fund. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating several of its transactions, the official said. 
 Another person associated with the fund, Donald Nicholson, who headed its program in Uzbekistan until early 2000, said, "Out of the $110 million spent by the time I left, I would estimate that probably $80 million have been lost, both honestly and otherwise."
Stephen J. Solarz, a former Congressman from Brooklyn, headed the fund until last year. He and a lawyer for the fund, Michael S. Sommer, said in separate interviews that some of the losses were so questionable that the fund's board referred them more than a year ago to the Justice Department and the United States Agency for International Development, which oversees the fund.
"We brought these potentially improper transactions to the attention of the Department of Justice and U.S. A.I.D. and the fund has been fully cooperating in their investigation," Mr. Sommer said.
With $150 million in seed money, the enterprise fund was created in 1994 to invest in small- and medium-sized businesses in five Central Asian republics. Investing wisely was not an easy task anywhere in the former Soviet Union. But the fund's record is particularly bleak.
Of the $111 million that the fund spent, a large share went toward salaries for fund employees and high overhead expenses, the government official said. The fund's own operating costs ate up 40 to 50 percent of total outlays, whereas investment funds in developed markets usually spend only 2 to 4 percent.
The list of failed business undertakings is long. Among them is a $5 million loss for a brick factory in Uzbekistan that was not built, Mr. Nicholson said. There were also many cases of overpayments to suppliers, often through dubious intermediaries, he added. 
One money-losing proposition involved a $5 million spinning mill purchased from the agency that was charged with selling off plants and equipment from East Germany. When the equipment arrived in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, it turned out that it could not spin cotton, the country's leading crop, but only synthetic fibers, and was unusable.
The fund also lost money in Turkmenistan when it bought an intravenous-solutions company in Europe for $5 million. Mr. Nicholson, who had joined the fund at around the time of that decision, said the company was worth no more than $2.5 million and its annual capacity was far too large for the Turkmenistan market. He immediately stopped the deal and resold the company, incurring a $3 million loss.
In Kazakhstan, the fund invested about $1.6 million in a proposed dry mortar plant that was never built, said a person involved with the fund, an episode that led to a drawn-out court battle.
Another questionable transaction involved the purchase of an Almaty apartment building two years ago with the fund's money. The cost and the reason for buying it were not clear, the same person said.
Mr. Nicholson said he had informed the fund's board of such troubling investments, which led to the F.B.I. investigation. "The magnitude of questionable activities kept growing," he said. "There was no way I would feel comfortable." But how many of those actions resulted from bad business decisions or malfeasance is hard to judge, he said.
A government official in Washington familiar with the inquiry said it was unclear whether there had been criminal intent or wrongdoing. The investigation, first reported by The Wall Street Journal last December, has moved slowly because of the difficulty of locating some of the people involved, the official said.
Many experts believe that the fund's failures lie mainly in the board's lack of knowledge about business and particularly the local business environment. Also the fund made mistakes by recruiting people in America who were inexperienced in international dealings, Mr. Nicholson said. Unfamiliar with emerging economies, those people frequently overestimated the markets and misjudged local companies, he said.

HEADLINE: Market Fallout: Year-End Bonuses Are No Longer Routine 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
As senior executives review their companies' results for the year, they are facing an ugly reality. Given the economic downturn and the poor performance of the stock market, many employees, particularly managers, will probably receive drastically lower bonuses at the end of the year or early 2002.
 Companies are now deciding whether to tell employees and their shareholders months ahead of when they would normally find out, according to compensation consultants. Already, Ford Motor, Sun Microsystems and Media General have warned some employees not to expect bonuses. 
 "I think there are a lot of companies that will get out in front," said Scott Olsen, a practice leader at Towers Perrin, a human resources consulting firm. He said that in addition to making sure employees know what to expect, a company can signal its commitment to keeping costs in line.
In recent years, bonuses based on a company's performance have become a growing part of employee compensation. On Wall Street, which has long been associated with large bonuses, there are already rumblings about deep cuts in an effort to control expenses. Charles Schwab has said its employees are unlikely to see anything in the way of cash bonuses this year. Media and technology companies also rely heavily on bonuses.
Because of the strength of the economy and the stock market in recent years, employees have come to rely on the extra income and have adjusted their lifestyles, said Edward E. Lawler III, a business professor at the University of Southern California. 
What companies may not have done, Mr. Lawler said, is help employees manage their expectations and plan for the time when they would take home far less.
But some companies are choosing to retain bonuses to motivate workers, and few companies will probably reduce all bonus pay, consultants said. Many plans are designed so that individual performance, aside from how the company might be doing, is still rewarded. 
"We're just trying to find a balance," said Lee D. Roberts, the chairman of FileNet Corporation, a software company in Costa Mesa, Calif. When a change in its bonus plan meant that employees would not get bonuses this summer, FileNet chose to go ahead and pay them under the original plan so they would have time to adjust. Mr. Roberts is concerned that abolishing bonuses will hurt morale and his ability to keep talented employees. "We're not about fixed assets," he said. "We're about people."
The announcement that there will be nothing extra will probably not come as a surprise to those affected, consultants say, given the current round of layoffs at various companies. Many are aware of how poorly their companies have been performing. "People understand and expect this even before it's announced," said Dale Klamfoth, a workplace consultant with Drake Beam Morin in New York. 
With four months left in the year, many companies are still in the middle of deciding about bonuses. "We're talking about 2001 performance," said Ed Freher, a senior executive compensation consultant at William M. Mercer, a human resources consulting firm. "Most companies have not made up their minds." 
But there is pressure to eliminate expenses wherever possible. By having the flexibility to cut bonuses when performance is poor, companies have another tool to bolster earnings. "It's the swing variable," said Ira T. Kay, a practice director for Watson Wyatt Worldwide. "The employees understand, and it's fair to shareholders."
But the effect on the economy is less than clear. In previous downturns, layoffs provided a fairly immediate hit to the economy. A loss of discretionary pay may filter through the economy much more slowly. 
"There should be much more of a lag effect in taking money out of circulation," Mr. Lawler said. 
As much as $30 billion is paid each year in variable employee compensation, according to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
Some compensation consultants say salaries may also be affected. To reduce expenses or avoid layoffs, some companies have told their employees to take a cut in salary. In May, Agilent Technologies cut the pay of employees by 10 percent for the rest of the year. 
Though a survey last month by WorldatWork, a nonprofit professional compensation association, suggested that salaries would rise by about 4.5 percent next year, there are numerous cases of no salary increases and in fact pay cuts, said Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation for Salary.com, which tracks compensation.
The executive suite is not likely to be spared. At Ford, Jacques A. Nasser, who received a bonus last year of nearly $8 million, is among the 6,000 managers at Ford who will not receive a bonus in 2001, nearly half of his compensation last year. 
The compensation of chief executives rocketed during the stock market boom. But many should receive stock packages worth significantly less as well as lower bonuses after this year's weak performance, consultants say. Companies will probably not increase the number of shares awarded to make up for lower share prices, and directors will probably exert considerable pressure to limit the pay of executives.
"This is the time where the symmetry of the pay model will be proven either true or false," said Mr. Kay of Watson Wyatt. 
Compensation consultants point out that this is how these plans are supposed to work. "If the bonus doesn't go down or even hit zero, it isn't a variable plan," said Mr. Coleman of Salary.com. "It's more of an entitlement."
Companies emphasized that part of the motivation was not to surprise employees. At Media General, which told 3,200 of its 8,000 employees that they would not receive a holiday bonus, employees had come to expect extra pay, even though they knew it was not guaranteed.
"You don't want to wait until the day before Thanksgiving to say that there's not going to be a Christmas bonus this year," a company spokesman, Karl Rhodes, said.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Break From the Rat Race for a Union Organizer

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
SPEAKING of Labor Day, there are easier jobs than being The Rat. 
 First off, there is this problem of being a streetwise 15-foot-tall inflatable gray beast with fierce red eyes, prominent white fangs and claws poised in a fighting stance. There is the undeniable reality, too, that The Rat is full of hot air. 
 In fulfilling its year-round mission of embarrassing nonunion construction contractors, The Rat endures more rain, snow, sleet and gloom of of night than a letter carrier. Not to mention the challenge of New York's Labor Day parade this Saturday, when The Rat rides up Fifth Avenue on a very slow float under a very hot sun. 
"Yet it never complains," says Anthony Esemplare, whose job it is to deploy The Rat for the 9,000-member Construction and General Building Laborers Local 79. 
In its role as champion of the city's construction unions, The Rat will have its own Labor Day float, clutching American flags in its claws. But its life is hardly constant adulation. The Rat has been deflated accidentally when its gasoline-powered generator has unexpectedly cut out. And there has been unkindness. More than once, it has been viciously stabbed. In fact, after a still unsolved slashing, Mr. Esemplare recalled, The Rat "was confiscated by police and held for interrogation in 1 Police Plaza." 
Mr. Esemplare has been a Local 79 union organizer for the last five years, after working for 11 years as a manual laborer on construction sites. It is now Mr. Esemplare's lot to inflate (7 minutes, thanks to a portable gas generator), and deflate (15 seconds) The Rat. It folds into a red duffel bag that he stores in his black Explorer. 
Not only is he guardian of the patch kit, but he also serves as maintenance guy. "I give him a manicure once a month," Mr. Esemplare says, "and I wash him down in my backyard." 
To see The Rat in action is to see Mr. Esemplare as the Pied Piper. So Friday, 200 construction workers have turned out for duty at a nonunion construction site at the northeast corner of 17th Street and Avenue of the Americas.
More than 200 union hardhats from neighboring construction sites are chanting, clapping and jeering in protest. And here is Mr. Esemplare, exhorting them, striding between The Rat and the blue police barricades that pen the demonstrators. Everyone at the rally knows Mr. Esemplare. "He gets the people out," says Kevin Carmody, an 18-year member of Local 79 who lives in Riverdale, "and then he gets them going." 
For construction workers, The Rat is "a rallying point and a symbol," says Anthony Silveri, business manager of the Mason Tenders District Council, which oversees Local 79. "We have no problem with the guys working these jobs, they're just trying to feed their families or send money home. Our problem is with the contractors who are exploiting them, giving them substandard wages and no benefits." 
At this point, though, a secret must be revealed: there is more than one rat. In fact, on Friday, a total of six construction-worker rats are up and battling across the city. 
Mr. Esemplare insists that Local 79 introduced the first inflatable rally rat to New York five years ago. Other area unions are fielding their own, so that as many as 35 inflatable rodents are working the region.
The King Rat could be a 30-foot inflatable that is often reserved for high-rise sites. Rats cost $3,500 to $7,500 -- depending on size -- and, for Local 79, are made by Big Sky Balloons and Searchlights Inc. of Plainfield, Ill. 
WITH his salt-and-pepper, high-and-tight crew cut, the 40-year-old Mr. Esemplare -- stocky, 5-foot-6, and known to all as Dino for his crooning -- could possibly be mistaken for Billy Joel. 
He was born in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn, graduated from Chelsea Vocational High School in Manhattan, and believes "I was blessed by the organizing angels." Meaning his career was ordained after his late father, Thomas, a Teamster, took him to his first union meeting at the age of 8. Now his 19-year-old son, Anthony Jr., has his union card at Local 79. 
Yesterday, Mr. Esemplare said over the phone that he was celebrating Labor Day as its founders intended: at home (in Staten Island, at a cookout with his wife of 21 years, Maria). Labor Day was down time for The Rat as well. "The rats get off weekends and holidays," Mr. Esemplare said, "because they work so hard during the week."
Indeed. On Friday, unexpected winds and looming thundershowers have added several degrees of difficulty to inflatable-rodent management. Inflation accomplished, the hardhats rally round, and Dino starts crooning the venerable call-and-response that has been a staple of union actions, and Labor Days, for generations:
Everywhere we go, 
People want to know,
Who we are, 
So we tell them:
We are the union,
The mighty, mighty union!

HEADLINE: Giving Web a Memory Cost Its Users Privacy 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
One day in June 1994, Lou Montulli sat down at his keyboard to fix one of the biggest problems facing the fledgling World Wide Web -- and, as so often happens in the world of technology, he created another one.
 At that moment in Web history, every visit to a site was like the first, with no automatic way to record that a visitor had dropped by before. Any commercial transaction would have to be handled from start to finish in one visit, and visitors would have to work their way through the same clicks again and again; it was like visiting a store where the shopkeeper had amnesia. 
 At 24, Mr. Montulli was the ninth employee hired by what would come to be known as Netscape Communications, and was already known as a programmer of exceptional skill. So he quickly came up with an ingenious idea to address the problem and hammered out a five-page document describing the technology that he and co-workers would design to give the Web a memory. 
The solution called for each Web site's computer to place a small file on each visitor's machine that would track what the visitor's computer did at that site. Mr. Montulli called his new technology a "persistent client state object," but he had a catchier name in mind, one from earlier days of computing. When machines passed little bits of code back and forth for such purposes as identification, early programmers called the exchanged data "magic cookies." Mr. Montulli would call his invention, a direct descendant, a "cookie."
It was a turning point in the history of computing: at a stroke, cookies changed the Web from a place of discontinuous visits into a rich environment in which to shop, to play -- even, for some people, to live. Cookies fundamentally altered the nature of surfing the Web from being a relatively anonymous activity, like wandering the streets of a large city, to the kind of environment where records of one's transactions, movements and even desires could be stored, sorted, mined and sold.
Since then, cookies have become nearly ubiquitous -- and that has many people upset. A recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling organization, found that 67 percent of Americans identify online privacy as a big concern -- far more than those who identify fighting crime (55 percent) or building an antimissile shield (22 percent).
Yet while public anger has grown over invasions of privacy both real and imagined, momentum in Washington to restrict the use of cookies and other high-technology tools for monitoring Internet users' activities has slowed. 
In Washington, at least 50 privacy-related bills are awaiting consideration, though the current leadership in the House has focused its attention on privacy invasions by government, not by private business. President Bush's recently appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Timothy J. Muris, is just preparing his first statement on the commission's direction on privacy, to be delivered next month.
Whether willingly, begrudgingly or unknowingly, however, most Web users have already traded a slice of their privacy for the convenience that cookies bring to the Web. Most people accumulate cookies unknowingly; a search on the average Internet user's machine will turn up dozens, or even hundreds, of the small files.
Thanks to cookies, a customer shopping at a site who walks away from the shopping cart before buying can come back later to have the site ask if he wants to complete the order. Cookies also allow sites to show advertisements tied directly to the parts of the site a visitor has seen, so that someone visiting a health-oriented site who reads information about diabetes drugs might see an advertisement for a newly approved medication for the condition.
All these functions can be performed without knowing the name of the visitor because the anonymous, unique identifier included in the cookie is enough. But if a Web site owner can combine that identifier with personal information, say from having visitors register with the site, then the cookie becomes a powerful mechanism for personal tracking. 
"Before cookies, the Web was essentially private," said Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School who studies the ways that software code and public policy collide. "After cookies, the Web becomes a space capable of extraordinary monitoring."
Most business Web sites now use cookies (including the sites of The New York Times Company) and most use them responsibly, privacy experts say. But many in business fear that privacy concerns could put a further drag on the hobbled high-technology economy. "The danger to the digital economy's longevity is not from the bursting of the dot-com bubble," said Richard H. Brown, chief executive of the technology giant EDS, in a recent speech.
He cited examples like Toysmart, a company that offered to sell its customer records as part of its bankruptcy settlement -- potentially including children's names and addresses. "Those effects are minuscule compared with those inflicted by breaches of trust," Mr. Brown added.
Still, cookies are not going away, said Koen Holtman, a Dutch computer scientist and privacy advocate who has fought to limit the expanding abilities of cookies. 
Web users "can't really live with cookies because of user-tracking issues," he said, "but also can't live without them because that would lose them some important functionality or reliability."
Mr. Montulli's first description of cookies can still be found on Netscape's Web site. The document describes how a relatively few bits of text can perform tasks like identifying a visitor, tracking the items he is preparing to buy and setting a date for the cookie to be destroyed. In a whimsical example drawn from Saturday morning cartoons, Mr. Montulli displayed a cookie that might be set on a customer's computer by the fictional Acme Corporation:
Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E _COYOTE; PART_NUMBER= ROCKET_LAUNCHER_0001
The document was technically thorough. But one word appears nowhere within it: privacy.

Microsoft Takes Notice
The engineers did build in a few privacy precautions, however. Cookies did not identify the user by name. Instead, each site issues a unique ID number to each visitor's computer. Mr. Montulli said that he also considered and rejected an idea for creating a single ID number that a person's browser would use in all Web explorations; while convenient, it would be, he knew, a privacy nightmare. "We didn't want cookies to be used as a general tracking mechanism," he recalled.
But, Mr. Montulli said, he had also planned for cookies to be a flexible tool -- like all Netscape creations. "We were designing the next-generation communications system," he said, and the designers of revolutions don't think small.
"We wanted people to be able to use it for other uses" besides shopping carts, Mr. Montulli said, including "things we hadn't thought about."
By 1995, as Netscape's browser introduced millions of people to the wonders of the Web, another company had taken notice of its success and wanted in on the game. Microsoft aimed at the market for Internet browsers and servers and began a concerted effort that became the focus of the federal antitrust suit against Microsoft.
But when it came to keeping track of online shopping carts, Microsoft decided not to reinvent the wheel, said Michael Wallent, the head of the company's browser efforts. The company's entry in the browser wars, Internet Explorer, largely incorporated Netscape's cookie system as a "no brainer," Mr. Wallent said.
"I don't think anyone ever thought that cookies were anything that could be excluded in the browser and have that browser become a success in the marketplace," he said.
Like Netscape, Microsoft kept its cookies under the table: cookies were designed to be exchanged silently, without alerting the user. With other Web browser functions, like encrypted communication, an icon appears on the computer screen when the technology is in use. Mr. Wallent explained that privacy was not, at the time, a central consideration because the Web "was a very different place."
"While privacy was an issue, it was much less of an issue than you see today," he said.
Although they were not obvious to the average computer user, cookies were quickly noticed within the technology community. Members of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a group that evolved from the time of the Internet's predecessor, the Arpanet, to become the standards-setting body for the ever-evolving worldwide computer network, started in April 1995 to discuss cookies.
Despite Mr. Montulli's prowess, the technology was less than robust. Simon St. Laurent, the author of "Cookies," a technical work, said of Mr. Montulli's original version: "It kind of works, but it's definitely concocted overnight." Discussions began among Internet experts about the kinds of things that Internet engineers fret over, like ways to make the system more secure and reliable. Within the discussion, some were pressing for consideration of privacy issues.
And so, in 1995, a group was formed to come up with proposed standards for cookies and their uses; it was led by David M. Kristol, a scientist at Bell Laboratories whose outside interests included the intricate interplay of chamber music. He estimated that the job would take a few months.
He worked on it for nearly six years.
Like all such groups, the work was public and carried out largely through online postings and e-mail. Mr. Montulli was an active participant -- at least at the beginning. "I remember saying that it was very important that if we made any changes at all to the way things work, that it needed to be a more forward-compatible kind of thing: the old stuff should still work, and people's general idea of cookies will stay the same."
The members of the working group agreed: although they wanted to improve on cookies technology, they realized that whatever recommendations they came up with should work a lot like the current cookies, or the effort would be wasted.
Increasingly, the group became concerned about the ways that cookies might be used to violate consumer privacy. Mr. Holtman, the Dutch computer scientist, issued a warning to the group in December 1995 that would turn out to be prophetic.
Although cookies can only be read by the site that created them or a related site -- another of Mr. Montulli's early privacy measures -- Mr. Holtman realized that companies could, by agreement, place cookies across a network of related sites, and that those cookies could be used to track users.
"Someone is bound to try this trick," he wrote, "and it will, when discovered, generate a lot of bad publicity for the whole Web." 
What Mr. Holtman did not know was that companies were already planning to exploit this wrinkle of the Web. Before long, large Internet advertising companies like DoubleClick and Engage were displaying ads across thousands of sites, using a common cookie across the network that allowed the company to recognize a visitor wherever he wandered on the Web. The innovation allowed these companies to rotate the ads the user sees from site to site.
DoubleClick's Web site says that it "allows marketers to deliver the right message, to the right person, at the right time." The concern of privacy advocates, however, was that these "third-party cookies" could also be used to build a detailed profile of a Web user's habits.
If a Web surfer visited a large number of sites about AIDS treatment, for example, and if that data were tied to information that identified him -- say, registration at one of the sites -- an insurance company could, conceivably, collect the cookie data from an ad network and use it in a quiet decision to decline an application for a policy. (Advertising networks insist that they do not sell data for such purposes.)
Third-party cookies were precisely the kind of tracking mechanism Mr. Montulli had tried to prevent through his privacy measures. He describes it today as a surprise -- and something of an embarrassment. "That's the one 'gotcha' we had," he recalls with chagrin.

A Hot Media Topic
By 1996, the existence of cookies and third-party cookies was becoming a hot topic in the news media and in online forums; Mr. Montulli and Netscape altered the company's browsers to distinguish cookies coming directly from the site being viewed from third-party cookies and to give consumers some control over them, allowing them to turn off all cookies or just the third-party variety. Microsoft, too, implemented some cookie control tools over time. But by default, browsers were set (and are still set) to accept such cookies automatically unless the user told the software not to -- which meant that a great majority of people ended up accepting cookies unknowingly from nearly every site they had visited.
The Internet Engineering Task Force was pursuing a different tack, however, recommending in 1997 that browsers be set to block any cookie that did not come directly from the site being visited.
Mr. Kristol said that the response from the advertising companies, which were by then well established, was: "This is terrible. This will destroy our business." Each argument caused further delay -- time in which the advertising companies became more powerful and the market crystallized around the two leading browsers. 
Mr. Kristol was not surprised, then, that neither Netscape nor Microsoft took to heart the recommendation that browsers block cookies unless instructed not to. He acknowledged that there was little he could do to persuade companies to adopt the voluntary standards. "There's no Internet police going around knocking on doors and saying, 'Excuse me -- the software you're using doesn't follow I.E.T.F. standards.' "
By then, Mr. Montulli said he had drifted away from the process, saying that the working group had, in fact, called for the kinds of technical changes that companies would not comply with. "I was hoping we'd get some kind of incremental improvement" out of the working group, he said -- ideas like the cookie control mechanisms he was working into new versions of the browser.
"But what the new standard required," he said, "was that you start over."
To Mr. Montulli, the conflict came down to the differences between pure researchers like Mr. Kristol and commercial engineers like himself. "The cold reality of the software business is you have to ship something that's good enough and get it out there," he said. "That's the way you ship software, and hopefully make money. If you wait forever trying to make something perfect, you may never ship."
In an article that Mr. Kristol prepared for Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, the journal of the leading computer science professional organization, he said several factors kept him on his somewhat quixotic task. On one level, "I simply wanted to see the effort through to an appropriate completion," he said. But in his paper, Mr. Kristol -- who recently retired from Bell Laboratories -- writes, "Feeling I was being bullied" by the industry "made me more determined to persist, and I didn't like to see an attempt to bully the I.E.T.F., either."
If nothing else, the effort raised the visibility of the issues underlying cookies, Mr. Kristol said. Thanks in part to his group's work, he said, companies can't violate consumer privacy, or even appear to, without attracting unwelcome attention.
He cited the controversy that arose when DoubleClick announced in 1999 that it had bought Abacus Direct, a company that maintained a database of the buying habits of 88 million catalog shoppers, and planned to match and merge some of the data that it was collecting online with the offline data from Abacus. The resulting data trove would portray millions of consumers' habits at a level of detail unparalleled in its intimacy.

A Public Outcry
Public outcry over the plan was fierce, and the Federal Trade Commission began an inquiry into the company's practices. DoubleClick abandoned the plan, and the Federal Trade Commission dropped its inquiry. DoubleClick's chief privacy officer, Jules Polonetsky, said, "Companies are learning from the missteps of the past year, and are obligated to bake privacy into the infrastructure of their new products lest they face the wrath of the critics."
Mr. Montulli, now 30, has since gained a measure of fame -- not just as the inventor of the cookie, but also as one of People magazine's runners-up for "sexiest man alive" in 1999. He says that he has dialed back from the 120-hour work weeks at Netscape -- a punishing life that contributed to the breakup of his marriage to the daughter of Netscape's founder, Jim Clark, in 1997.
He left Netscape in 1998, a millionaire many times over thanks to the company's high-flying stock. He helped to create epinions.com, a site for comparison shopping, but has since left that company as well.
Ask about his latest achievement, and he talks about climbing Mt. Shasta with his girlfriend, Ashley Dearruigunaga -- and, at the summit, asking her to marry him. ("At 14,162 feet, I figured she couldn't say no," he said.)
When it comes to cookies, he says that he is satisfied with the way things have worked out. Even though he does not favor the use of third-party cookies, he calls the existence of third-party cookies "the best possible error," because "the only way it could be exploited is by someone who is extremely public, who is extremely large and who has a very long reach" -- a company, in other words, that cannot afford a public relations fiasco, he said.
Over time, the views on cookies from privacy advocates have evolved. Richard M. Smith, the chief technology officer for the Privacy Foundation, a think tank in Denver, said that he now believed that most cookies were benign.
"My first reaction was, 'Oh they're terrible!' Over the last year and a half as I've looked at the Internet and how it works, it would be very difficult to have the Internet without them."

About the Series
Over the next two days, articles in this series will examine public opinion about online privacy and how companies have tried to profit from it, and also how the privacy issue is being dealt with in Washington.

Japanese Stocks Fall to a 17-Year Low on Profit Warnings

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 3 

 BODY:
Tokyo stocks plunged to a 17-year low today after profit warnings by high-technology companies. The dollar was higher against the yen.
 European stocks also dropped on concerns about corporate profits, pushing the Dow Jones Europe Stoxx 50 Index to a 23-month low. 
 The Nikkei index started higher today but soon moved into negative territory amid uncertainties over both the Japanese and United States economies. Sentiment deteriorated sharply after downward earnings revisions on Friday by technology giants, including Hitachi and Sanyo Electric.
The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei index extended its losing streak to five straight sessions, shedding 303.83 points, or 2.8 percent, to finish at 10,409.68, its lowest close since Aug. 14, 1984, when it ended at 10,360.92. 
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the exchange's first section lost 31.94 points, or 2.9 percent, to close at 1071.73. The index closed down 10.91 points, or nearly 1 percent, on Friday.
Japan's unemployment rate is at a record high of 5 percent, and a report scheduled for release next Friday is expected to show gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the quarter ended in June after growing a revised 0.1 percent in the first quarter, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
The rise in the yen is weighing on Japanese exporters that rely on a strong dollar to keep their products competitive in overseas markets. The dollar moved narrowly against the yen in thin trading because of the Labor Day holiday in the United States. The dollar ranged between 118.70 yen and 119.35 yen in today's trading. The euro was traded at 107.96 yen, down from 109.21 yen late on Friday in Tokyo. --------------------

European Shares Fall
By Bloomberg News
In Europe, the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 average dropped 43.48 points, or 1.2 percent, to 3,593.67, yesterday. All but two of the 18 industry groups in the 600-member Stoxx index declined.
"It's all bad news coming out of European telecom companies," said Gerard Piasko, chief global strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking in Zurich. 
"This is the main reason why the European stock market has dropped below March lows," he added.
Last month more than 435 billion euros, about twice the value of BP P.L.C., was wiped from the market capitalization of the companies in the Dow Jones Stoxx Europe Index, which fell 5.57 points, or 1.8 percent, to 309.24 today.
Deutsche Telekom, Bayer and Swatch posted their biggest monthly drops ever as the 600-issue Stoxx Index slumped 6.1 percent.

PERSON: Capt. Jack O. Bennett 

HEADLINE: Capt. Jack Bennett, 86, a Berlin Airlift Hero 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Capt. Jack O. Bennett, a retired American pilot, died on Aug. 26 in Berlin, his adopted hometown, where he was celebrated as a hero of the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49. He was 86. 
 The Berlin government credited him with making the first flight, on June 23, 1948, of the effort that broke the 11-month Soviet siege of the divided city. Captain Bennett flew a Douglas DC-8 loaded with potatoes, the first of 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and other supplies delivered by the time the Soviet Union decided to back down 11 months later. 
 "Bennett, like so many of his fellow pilots, put his life on the line during the blockade to ensure the existence and freedom of Berliners in the face of the Soviet threat," a spokesman for the city, Albert Eckert, said. "Bennett embodies the change in the relationship between Germany and the United States that took place."
The crisis was one of the most perilous of the cold war. It erupted after the Western powers -- Britain, France and the United States -- decided to form a single economic unit of their German zones of occupation and to introduce the newly issued mark in their sectors of Berlin.
The Soviet Union declared the four-power administration of Berlin null and void and cutting all rail, road and water links through East Germany to the city.
No pilot flew the tricky route into Berlin-Tempelhof Airport more often than Captain Bennett. He logged two to three flights a day, for a total of 650 round trips.
"Raisin bombers," as the Berliners called them, landed around the clock at intervals of just under a minute, delivering 4,500 tons of food and goods a day and totaling 278,000 flights. But to Captain Bennett, the real heroes of that astonishing logistical achievement were not the pilots. "It was a chance to fly as often as we wanted," he said in an interview. "We were no heroes. Those were all the ones who operated the radar system and let us land safely."
Jack Bennett was born in Ebensburg, Pa., He started flying at 14. He graduated from Pennsylvania State University and studied aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He first went to Berlin in 1937 to continue his studies at the Technical University with a Rockefeller Foundation grant. 
After the war, he returned to Germany as a civilian pilot based in Frankfurt and flying the Berlin route for American Overseas Airlines and then for Pan American World Airways, until retiring in 1974.
Surviving is his wife, Marianne.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Sept. 4 about Capt. Jack O. Bennett, who piloted the first supply plane of the Berlin Airlift in June 1948, misidentified the craft. It was a Douglas DC-4; the DC-8 did not enter commercial service until the mid-1960's. This correction was delayed for research in military and commercial aviation archives to resolve conflicting information from experts and publications, some of which listed it as a DC-3; American Overseas Airlines and McDonnell Douglas are no longer in business.

U.S. and Israel Walk Out Of U.N. Racism Conference
The United States and Israel left the United Nations conference on racism in Durban, South Africa. Their action was prompted by proposed conference language condemning "the racist practices of Zionism" and describing Israel's treatment of Palestinians as a "new kind of apartheid." Emergency meetings were convened to redraft the charged language in the hope of averting other walkouts. A spokesman for the European Union, which raised concerns about the language, said its diplomats would help in its redrafting. A1

From the moment the United States delegation arrived at the meeting, their marching orders were clear: engage actively in behind-the-scenes talks to moderate the conference's tone toward Israel, and do little else unless that effort succeeds. A8

The walkout by Israel, which had been attacked by a coalition of rights groups as "an apartheid regime" guilty of "ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide" against the Palestinians, thickened the pall over already troubled efforts to cobble together an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire. Four bombs went off in various areas of Jerusalem. No one was seriously injured, but the blasts led to new clashes, leaving 2 Palestinian men dead and about 30 wounded. A8

U.S. Research on Germ Warfare
The United States has been engaged for several years in secret research on biological weapons that some officials believe tests the limits of the global treaty banning such weapons. Government officials said the research mimicked major steps a state or terrorist might take to create a biological arsenal and was intended to understand the threat better. A1

Mexico Leader Faces the Reality
President Vicente Fox of Mexico arrives in the United States today for a state visit. In an interview, he discussed his realization that he could not deliver on his promises as quickly as he wanted. A1

Mexico took over nearly half of the country's sugar mills in an effort to save a dying industry that had been subsidized for decades. Officials said they would expropriate 27 of Mexico's 60 privately operated and deeply indebted sugar mills, and then either shutter or sell them. A3

A Shakeup in South Korea
South Korea plunged into a political crisis today after all cabinet members and senior presidential aides resigned in the wake of a National Assembly vote for the dismissal of Lim Dong Won, South Korea's unification minister, who has been in charge of the government's "sunshine policy" with North Korea. South Korean opposition leaders have complained that the government is getting little in response for its aid and overtures to the North. (A3)

Macedonia Peace Moves Ahead
Parliament resumed debate about constitutional and political reforms that are crucial to the country's peace plan for ending an insurgency by ethnic Albanian rebels. A preliminary vote is expected today. A4

The Right Plans Effort On Supreme Court Choice
A coalition of socially conservative groups begins a $2 million campaign this week to press President Bush and the Democratic-controlled Senate to fill the next Supreme Court vacancy with an opponent of abortion rights. The campaign comes amid the first signs of stress in the relationship between Mr. Bush and the social conservative movement over his decision to allow federal financing for some stem cell research. A1

Bush's Labor Gap
Interviews with dozens of union members at Detroit's Labor Day parade and at a Teamsters' picnic indicated that President Bush faced an uphill battle in his new campaign to win the hearts and minds of union members. They pointed to a long list of Bush positions that they oppose, including any privatizing of Social Security, the revocation of ergonomics rules, and his push for fast-track trade legislation and increased access for Mexican trucks to American roads. A16

President Bush, speaking to gatherings of union carpenters in Green Bay, Wis., and Teamsters in Detroit, expressed concern about the economy, which he described as "anemic at best" over the last year, and warned that there were still "some problems on the horizon." A16

Gore Noncommittal on 2004
Al Gore brushed aside questions on his political future at a campaign rally for the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis. But he repeatedly mentioned his narrow defeat to George W. Bush and asked the crowd what they thought of the country's direction under Mr. Bush's leadership. A15

Reno Hopes to Unseat a Bush
Janet Reno will announce today that she is entering the Florida governor's race, a longtime associate said with her permission. Ms. Reno is expected to be the favorite as she enters the Democratic primary campaign in a bid to challenge the Republican incumbent, Jeb Bush, next year. A15

A shark attacked a couple wading off North Carolina's Outer Banks, killing the man and leaving the woman in critical condition. The death came two days after a shark killed a 10-year-old boy in Virginia. A12

Older Drivers and Safety
A study by an insurance industry group found that drivers 70 to 74 years old were twice as likely to die in accidents as drivers 30 to 59. To help older drivers avoid and survive accidents, the report recommended bigger letters on road signs and seat belts designed to be easier on fragile shoulders and ribs. A17

The Navy Corrects the Record
New evidence has persuaded the Navy to rewrite the record of the sinking of the submarine chaser Eagle in 1945, within sight of the Maine coast, killing 49 sailors. Instead of a boiler explosion, the official cause will now be listed as a torpedo from a German submarine. The change means that those who died or were wounded will receive Purple Hearts. A15

No Wonder the City Never Sleeps, Says a Chorus of Noise Complainers

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Most New Yorkers, especially those who live in Manhattan, probably engage, from time to time, in a conversation about noise. It might be a long-distance phone call, from someone back on the farm, or from one of those obscure cities that gets a high rating for livability in magazine surveys.
 "Hello?" the caller will scream, perplexed. "Where are you? The Gaza Strip?" 
 "No," the New Yorker will yell back, also perplexed. "I'm in my apartment. Why?" 
Oh, no reason. Just the background symphony of ice cream trucks, jackhammers, teenagers, sanitation vehicles, cars outfitted with trunk speakers but not mufflers, and the man who wishes, by way of boom box, to express his joyous presence on the corner. Only the six-week, 7 a.m. house party -- the landlord calls it renovation -- in the apartment next door, the rush-hour rumbling of the Metro-North train tracks past the kitchen window, the piteous bleating of MetroCards passing through turnstile scanners. And those are just the noises to which New Yorkers are accustomed.
Residential growth and boom-time construction have brought new noises to the city. Between Jan. 1 and July 31, the mayor's quality-of-life phone line, one of several numbers people can call to complain about noise, received 71,295 complaints, with more than 80 percent of them related to noise. (The second most frequent complaint? Blocked driveways.) 
For many community boards, noise is a top priority, and the Manhattan borough president's office has convened a Construction Noise Task Force and a Helicopter Noise Coalition. Experts say that noise can harm people's health, increase their stress levels and compromise children's ability to learn. But as noise complaints are on the rise, there is little evidence that enforcement is keeping pace. 
In 1997, the City Council increased penalties for violations of the noise code, but made it no easier to enforce regulations that require a police officer, for example, to witness a car alarm going off for more than three minutes before ticketing the vehicle. According to the mayor's management report, 4,866 noise summonses were issued by the police in the fiscal year 2000, and 2,142 noise complaints were issued in the first four months of the fiscal year 2001, an increase. 
But at the Department of Environmental Protection, which is responsible largely for stationary noise problems like nightclubs and sidewalk cafes, violations dropped from 1,650 in the fiscal year 2000 to 1,200 in the fiscal year ending in June 2001, even as complaints increased.
Geoffrey Ryan, a spokesman for the department, cautioned that many people might complain about a single problem, and that the department encourages nonlegal resolution of certain kinds of complaints. He said the number of inspectors, 39, had remained the same, though Saturday night hours had been added. The department is also reviewing the city's 30-year-old noise code and will recommend ways to update it, he said.
But a more comprehensive approach is needed, said Arline L. Bronzaft, a noise expert who has served on the city's Council on the Environment for three mayoral administrations.
People in Queens who live in the mind-numbing roar of increasingly trafficked flight paths must appeal to the Federal Aviation Administration. The permits that let repairs to the city's water mains thunder all night in Lower Manhattan, a neighborhood that has become more residential, are granted by the city's Department of Transportation. Helicopter noise is supposed to be reported to a phone line at the Economic Development Council, but the line's voice mail seems always to be full.
"There should be a coordinating office," Dr. Bronzaft said. "People have talked about a noise czar."
In every community, the sources of noise are different. North Staten Island has manufacturing zones; northwest Brooklyn has cafes spilling out onto every sidewalk and endless new construction. 
According to a breakdown provided by the Department of Environmental Protection, the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side lead the city in noise complaints. On the West Side, said Penny Ryan, the district manager for Community Board 7, an influx of big stores has made commercial air-conditioning units the top complaint (they are also the top noise complaint to the environmental department over all). The department, Ms. Ryan said, will send out an inspector to measure the sound level, but because a business owner has 30 days to fix the problem, noise can drone on and on. 
If stationary noise is difficult to silence, transient noise like horn honking can be impossible, she said. "A block can request signs, but once they're up, you have to have a police officer witness the horn honking, write a ticket and go to court." The Police Department could provide no statistics on summonses for car alarms, motorcycles lacking mufflers, or honking.
Several community leaders complained that the police cannot issue noise violations because many precincts are not equipped with, or not trained to use, a noise meter.
Downtown, one precinct has begun a program to train officers in noise metering, according to Alan J. Gerson, a member of Community Board 2 and a City Council candidate, and another is training officers to recognize loud motorcycles even when they are parked. Thomas Antenen, the chief spokesman for the department, said that he could not verify the special programs, but that each borough had noise meters that precincts can request.
Kenneth M. Moltner, the chairman of Community Board 8 on the Upper East Side, says the main noise problem is simply lack of civility. "We're one of the fastest cities to honk when the light changes to green," he said.
But one person's sound is another person's noise. Business owners that try to cooperate, like D.B.A., a bar on First Avenue in the East Village, face groans from their customers when the bar staff closes the back patio at 10 p.m. on a Saturday night. Club owners complain that the night life that has made the city famous is near extinction.
And some noise complaints result from neighborhoods in flux.
Betty Braton, the chairwoman of Community Board 10 in Queens, which includes Howard Beach, South Ozone Park and South Jamaica, said that complaints of yard parties were on the rise, partly because the Indo-Caribbean population in the district has a tradition of holding weddings outdoors. "There are cultural differences which will go away in time," she said.
Some residents cautioned that a low number of complaints does not necessarily translate to a quiet neighborhood, saying they were simply used to it. 
In fact, a recent stroll through Harlem and East Harlem, the Manhattan neighborhoods that seem, measured by complaints, to be the quietest, seemed to reveal just as many noisy cars, radios, train whistles and block parties as anyplace else.
"We have an equal number of problems," said David Givens, the longtime chairman of Community Board 11, adding that the board had consistently asked for noise meters for the local precincts without success. "The only reason why the number of complaints may not be as high is that many of the people in our community don't trust the system. And they don't believe that they are going to get results."
Perhaps surprisingly, not all people find incessant noise something to scream about. Shedene Lindsay, 21, and Dorlin Reyes, 31, are awakened each morning at 7 a.m. by construction on their block of 124th Street in Harlem, where buzzing saws herald the revival of yet another brownstone. But they have yet to complain. "It's noise for a good cause," Ms. Lindsay said. 
Sometimes, she added, the Studio Museum in Harlem, which has also been revivified by a new curator, Thelma Golden, holds parties, pumping beats out of the back of their building across the street. "But," Ms. Lindsay said, "we just jam to the music right along."

HEADLINE: In Queens, a Spirited Race For Its Borough Presidency 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
Carol A. Gresser, a candidate for Queens borough president, broke her foot recently on the campaign trail. During four hours in the emergency room, she told anyone who would listen that she was running for office -- and why.
 In the race for a spot that is up for grabs at a time when Queens is awash in political contests, every moment counts. As primary and general elections portend a seismic political overhaul in the borough, where virtually every city-level politician is leaving office because of term limits, the campaign for borough president at times seems lost in the shuffle. 
 The contest among three Democrats -- Ms. Gresser, a former Board of Education president, and two longtime City Council members, Helen M. Marshall of western Queens and Sheldon S. Leffler of eastern Queens -- has been neither feisty nor fraught with mud-slinging.
The Republican candidate, City Councilman Alfonso C. Stabile, who represents the neighborhoods of Ozone Park and Howard Beach, is running unopposed in the Sept. 11 primary, but most are expecting the victor of the Democratic primary to take the November election.
Among the three Democrats, Ms. Marshall and Ms. Gresser have the best financing and the most substantial endorsements in a race that for the first time in decades has been a real contest. Claire Shulman, who cannot run again because of term limits, has held the seat since 1986, when she was elected with virtually no competition. Ms. Shulman succeeded Donald R. Manes, who committed suicide in 1986 amid a municipal corruption scandal.
Ms. Marshall, 71, a former teacher, is the handpicked candidate of the Queens County Democratic Organization, and she has also won the backing of Ms. Shulman. The endorsements could decide the election, and Ms. Marshall would be the first African-American elected to the borough presidency, although she has not focused on her ethnicity, campaiging heavily instead -- like her opponents -- on the theme of improving the borough's public school system.
For her part, Ms. Gresser, 64, has picked up her share of endorsements, including ones from the editorial board of The New York Times and several local labor guilds, including law enforcement unions. She is perhaps the highest-profile candidate of the three.
Mr. Leffler, who turns 59 this week, is a Harvard-educated lawyer elected to the City Council in 1978 from the 23rd District, which covers Little Neck, Douglaston, Bayside, Bellerose, Floral Park, Queens Village and Hollis. He is considered something of a maverick on the Council. The prime sponsor of 42 laws enacted since he was elected, including one that mandates recycling, Mr. Leffler portrays himself as the candidate best qualified to maximize the power of the presidency, which is more of a bully pulpit than a platform for policy making.
"I've gotten a lot done in this city," said Mr. Leffler, who has focused in his Council tenure on environmental and public safety issues and said he has kept a diary of all the laws he has initiated and sponsored.
Ms. Gresser and Ms. Marshall have both portrayed themselves as being adept at advocacy. They also point to what they say would be their virtuosity at networking and uniting disparate groups in a borough teeming with new immigrants.
Ms. Gresser, who lives in Douglaston, drew citywide attention when, as president of the Board of Education, she clashed with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over chancellor nominations and feuded with him bitterly when the mayor drove out the chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines. She was on the board for eight years.
Ms. Gresser said that her willingness to stand up to the mayor demonstrated independence but that she expected as borough president -- an office that comes with the authority to make one appointment to the Board of Education -- to work smoothly with any of the mayoral candidates. "There is that mayor," she said, "and there is the mayor."
"I can be very independent," Ms. Gresser added. "But I also know you have to make some concessions in order to get anything done."
While the Democratic candidates agree on major priorities -- reducing school overcrowding, expanding the scarce supply of low- and moderately priced housing, creating better programs for the borough's large elderly population and accelerating economic development -- both Ms. Gresser and Ms. Marshall suggested that personality and gusto would be a borough president's best tools.
"This job is what you make it," Ms. Marshall said during a break from a recent frenzied day of campaigning. "I'm known to be a fighter. I also know how to use power."
Before joining the Council 10 years ago, Ms. Marshall, who represents the 21st District, covering Corona, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, served for nine years in the State Assembly.
During an interview in her campaign headquarters in Forest Hills, Ms. Gresser said she believed her wider name recognition would offset any advantage Ms. Marshall might have secured from the endorsements of Ms. Shulman and the Democratic organization.
Ms. Gresser and Ms. Marshall have roughly the same amount of campaign financing, and both are far better financed than Mr. Leffler, according to the latest filings with the Campaign Finance Board.
Ms. Marshall's campaign said she raised $82,000 in the last reporting period, bringing her fund-raising total to $343,731. Her campaign says that $40,000 in recent contributions is eligible for matching money, which would bring her matching fund total to $604,316. Ms. Gresser had raised $414,251 and received $415,808 in matching funds. Mr. Leffler had raised $164,424 and received matching amounts of $296,084.

Zenith Media Cuts Ad Spending Forecast

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Zenith Media has again lowered its estimate for advertising spending in the world's largest markets, reflecting the slowdown in economies around the world.
 Zenith predicted that ad spending in the seven biggest markets, which account for 75 percent of total global spending, would total $235.7 billion in 2001, down 2.6 percent from the record level of 2000. 
 As recently as July, Zenith predicted that ad spending this year would increase 1.5 percent from 2000, a figure that had been reduced as the American economy slowed.
In the United States, ad spending is to fall 4 percent this year, Zenith predicted, joining Britain, Germany and Spain in suffering declines.
Only France, Italy and Japan among the largest markets will show growth in 2001, according to the Zenith forecast. Zenith is 50 percent owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and 50 percent owned by the Publicis Groupe.

HEADLINE: Vying to Help Businesses at Heart of Caribbean Enclave 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
On Church Avenue in Brooklyn, amid the bustle of stores selling everything from videos and cellular phones to meat patties and jerk chicken, there are clear signs of a lively political campaign. Huge posters hang in stores, slogan-covered poster boards ride atop cars roaming the streets, and candidates work frenetically at subway stations.
 The 40th Council District is a largely Caribbean enclave of Flatbush and East Flatbush, an area that 10 years ago elected the first Jamaican-born woman to serve in the City Council, Una S. T. Clarke. Because of the city's term limit laws, Ms. Clarke is ineligible to run for re-election this year. Six candidates hope to succeed her, including Ms. Clarke's daughter. 
 The race has been a relatively cordial one. But the presence on the ballot of Ms. Clarke's daughter, Yvette D. Clarke, who is director of business development at the Bronx Overall Development Corporation and who worked previously for several elected officials, has been as much an issue as the fortunes of the businesses along the busy strip of Church Avenue.
Among the candidates are Alithia Alleyne, 33, who once worked for Councilwoman Clarke and who left her job as an administrator at the Brooklyn Museum of Art to run; Jean D. Vernet, 46, a longtime housing advocate who runs the Legal Education and Assistance Program for the National Coalition for Haitian Rights; Wellington Sharpe, 56, who operates a day care business and has been involved in a number of community organizations; Frances G. Purcell, 42, an accountant and real estate broker; and Edward A. Roberts, who is a lawyer and former administrator with the Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Legal Service Corporation. Another candidate, Carl W. Thomas, a lawyer, died of a heart attack a month ago.
The candidates have given the most attention to the issue of economic development. They suggest that the small businesses along the thoroughfares need tax relief and technical advice to preserve the district's economic backbone.
"What we need is a tax abatement program for businesses that have operated less than five years," Ms. Purcell said. Mr. Vernet has called for the creation of "one-stop centers for entrepreneurial support, to help people to have access to information on contracts and technical support." Those centers, he said, would be operated by nonprofit agencies.
Ms. Alleyne said that there was a strong need for the next Council member to meet with bank officials to help businesses find more access to capital. "Many of the businesses in this area need that kind of support and need technical help," she said. "That is crucial for this district because so many of the businesses are owned by local people. And that kind of ownership is something we want to encourage."
The candidates have made proposals in other areas as well. Mr. Roberts, for example, has insisted on the need to reinstate free tuition in the City University system. "We just need to have the political will to do it," he said. "It's what I would fight for on the Council."
Mr. Sharpe proposes dealing with the issue of overcrowded schools by constructing new classroom space on top of existing school buildings. "That would help address the need for smaller class size without a large cost," he said.
Ms. Clarke has proposed that the city play a greater role in providing health care insurance to the city's least affluent residents, a particular problem in this district, which includes Kings County Hospital Center. And she wants the city to do more to promote the annual West Indian Parade along Eastern Parkway as a tourist attraction to draw visitors to the area.
Immigration has also been an issue; each candidate has roots in the Caribbean. Mr. Vernet was born in Haiti, and Mr. Sharpe was born in Jamaica. Mr. Roberts is from Trinidad, Ms. Purcell is from Grenada, and Ms. Alleyne's roots are in Barbados and Panama. 
Each of them has called for the city to provide greater assistance to immigrants.
They only threat to the cordial atmosphere of the contest has been the criticism of Ms. Clarke by many candidates, who say she is running on her name and that she has fewer credentials than her rivals. "No one in this district even knows her," Mr. Roberts said. "To have worked for some public officials is not a symbol of accomplishment in terms of serving the community."
Ms. Clarke said she is proud of her family and of the commitment to public service that she said she has inherited. Her campaign posters read, "Following in a family tradition of service to the community."
Mr. Vernet has taken the lead in fund-raising, raising nearly $49,000 and receiving $60,000 in city matching money. Mr. Roberts has raised nearly $17,000 and has received another $37,780 in public campaign matching money.
Ms. Clarke has raised nearly $49,000 but has received no matching money. Similarly, the other candidates have received no matching money. Ms. Purcell has raised $44,000, Mr. Sharpe has raised $18,000, Mr. Roberts has raised nearly $17,000 and Ms. Alleyne raised $13,500.
Ms. Clarke has been endorsed by a number of officials, including United States Representative Edolphus Towns. Mr. Vernet has been endorsed by a a number of unions, including 1199, the health care workers union, as well as by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and United States Representative Major R. Owens. 
Ms. Alleyne has been endorsed by State Senator Marty Markowitz, who is a candidate for Brooklyn borough president.

HEADLINE: Waiter, Hold the Foie Gras: Slump Hits New York Dining 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
For months, restaurants in New York City seemed impervious to the bleak economic news, but recently their phenomenal double-digit growth in sales has come to a screeching halt.
 The unluckiest have seen business drop as much as 30 percent, and the city's top restaurants, the places whose stature makes them the least vulnerable to a cooling economy, are starting to feel the chill. Even Jean Georges and its cafe Nougatine are down, according to their owner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten. 
 Gone are the $10,000 bottles of Bordeaux at Le Bernardin, the $4,000 dinners out of the wood-fired oven at Beacon. Now it's more modest dining, three courses of comfort food for $20 at the Metropolitan Hotel, and half-price wine with the pan-Latin fare at Chicama. 
On the brink of the fall season, traditionally the time when lavish new places open and the luxury factor is pumped up on menus all over town, restaurateurs are instead worrying about filling tables in an oversaturated market. There are no splashy openings on the calendar, no new Ducasse on the horizon.
Even established restaurateurs are setting their sights lower. Danny Meyer, an owner of Eleven Madison Park and Union Square Cafe, is opening a barbecue restaurant. Drew Nieporent, an owner of Nobu and Tribeca Grill, is just sitting it out. "We probably opened two restaurants a year for the last two years," he said. "This year, I'm not opening any new stores."
It's a sea change in a food-obsessed city. Diners who were willing to endure a three-month wait for a reservation just months ago are now being courted with free meals, discounts and solicitous service. 
For almost a year, sales in restaurants across the country have been steadily declining. But New York, the country's premier restaurant city, seemed to buck the trend. No more. 
Most restaurateurs are not panicking, and dining rooms appear to be bustling all over town. But a growing number of owners -- particularly of restaurants below the top tier -- are concerned enough to change the way they do business. They are revamping menus, lowering prices, offering special prix fixe meals, even instituting frequent-diner programs. Harder times for restaurants have meant, in many cases, better times for the clientele.
"At the very best restaurants it's easier to get in," said Tim Zagat, who owns the Zagat restaurant guide with his wife, Nina. "They are politer at places like Nobu. Last year they didn't even pick up the phone. Those restaurants are a lot more accessible, but once you get there they are still full."
Signs of a slowdown are everywhere. William Troy, the owner of Cascade Linen in Brooklyn, keeps a Dow Jones of napkin rentals that includes 18 of the restaurants his company services. His napkin index has seen a drop of 5.6 percent since the beginning of the year, mostly in the last three months. At DeBragga & Spitler, suppliers of top-quality meats, Marc Sarrazin, the owner, says business is down 7 to 8 percent.
Joseph Bastianich, an owner of two respected restaurants, Babbo and Esca, said wine distributors were calling him almost daily, trying to sell him premium wines that they rationed last year. At Dairyland, which sells specialty foods to 3,000 restaurants in New York, the owner, Christopher Pappas, said restaurants that usually pay weekly are taking 30 days to pay; monthly clients are taking 50 or 80 days and longer. 
Steve Hanson, who owns midpriced restaurants including Ruby Foo's and Blue Water Grill, said he was getting calls from people who wanted him to buy their restaurants. "I tell them that I buy only deeply discounted restaurants," he said, "and they may want to call me back in a couple of months."
The restaurant boom of the last 10 years appears to have produced a restaurant glut. Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant, said New York was "overbuilt and overhyped," and competition has become fierce.
"Whatever has happened in New York City has been exacerbated by the overabundance of restaurants," said Alan Stillman, chairman of the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, which includes Manhattan Ocean Club and Park Avenue Cafe. Business is off 10 percent, Mr. Stillman said: "We see it as horrible."
Mr. Nieporent estimates that since 1995, 100,000 new restaurant seats for moderate to fine dining have become available in the city. "There are going to be a lot of closings," he said. "We hit a saturation point. We are not ready to start discounting, but we are watching very carefully."
Adam D. Tihany, who designed some of the city's best-known restaurants, including Le Cirque 2000 and Jean Georges, says his New York business has nearly come to a halt. "A lot of projects started to get canceled about one and a half years ago," he said. "The only projects we have in New York are longer term. Now most of our projects are abroad."
What is happening in New York reflects a national trend. The NPD Group, a market researcher, reports that the average American will eat out less this year than last, the first decline in 10 years.
Nationally, restaurant sales continue to rise, but at a slim 2.4 percent over the 12 months that ended on July 31, compared with 4.4 percent for the 12 months that ended on Jan. 31, according to Technomic Inc., a food consulting group. Part of that increase in dollar volume can be attributed to price increases.
An August survey of 450 restaurants by the National Restaurant Association reported that at 20 percent of them, customers are taking home more doggie bags than they did two years ago.
Scott W. Keller of DealAnalytics.com, a company that provides online research on mergers and acquisitions, said that restaurant acquisitions are "extremely hard" because of the slowdown in growth and a significant decline in profitability.
So far, the restaurants that seem most vulnerable are those in hotels, because of low occupancy rates, and those that are almost as expensive as the top restaurants. "Expensive second-tier Midtown places, caught in the tightening of corporate budgets, are getting hurt," Mr. Zagat said. Small neighborhood places are doing well because they cost about as much as a meal eaten at home.
As businesses tighten their belts, there has also been a drop in the number of bookings for private dining rooms. At Remi, Mr. Tihany said, parties have been trimmed back or canceled. Mr. Sarrazin of DeBragga & Spitler said, "It's chicken cutlet and salmon instead of steak."
But at every level, restaurateurs say that it would have been difficult to match, much less better, last year's records, even if the economy had not faltered.
Wine is the first thing diners are spending less on. At Le Bernardin, the tables are still full, but sales of expensive wines have slowed to a trickle. Business is off about 5 percent at Jean Georges and Nougatine because diners are buying cheaper bottles and skipping the final cordial, Mr. Vongerichten said. The fringe hours before 6:30 and after 10 are not filling up the way they did last year, and the early part of the week is quiet. On Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays, Douglas Rodriguez at Chicama plans to offer a 50 percent discount on wines. Mr. Rodriguez said his business was down 30 percent from last year.
At Patria, Andrew DiCataldo said that upscale Latin restaurant has repositioned itself to be "more approachable" and has instituted an all-day $10 bar menu. The Tribeca Grand Hotel is adding a finger food menu that offers smaller portions at lower prices. And there's that $20 dinner at the Metropolitan Hotel. 
Other restaurateurs are concentrating on service. "When you are extremely busy, all you can do is manage the reservation book," said Rocco DiSpirito, chef and owner of Union Pacific. "When it isn't a 24-hour obsession, restaurateurs become sensitized. We've been focusing on the guest experience for six months now."
After a slow six months, Waldy Malouf at Beacon mailed letters to his regular customers, asking them to come back as guests of the restaurant and to bring a guest. "The mantra to the wait staff is to make the person want to come back," he said, "to eliminate any sort of snobby New York feeling on the phone and to be much more accommodating at the front door."
Rick Moonen, the owner and chef at Oceana, has chosen the sweat equity method for reducing costs, working more himself. He has also cut back on shifts so that his employees now have two days off at a time instead of one.
What fall holds depends on whether the prognosticator is an optimist or a pessimist. Most are like Mr. Hanson. "I think it's going to get really bad," he said. "Consumers are going into a panic, layoffs are just starting. People are in denial. It will start to hit right after September."
Not everyone is predicting the worst. The few upscale Wall Street restaurants, like Bayard's and Vine, say they are thriving because there is so little competition. David Rockwell, who designed Nobu and Monkey Bar, said none of his New York projects have been canceled. Mr. Vongerichten is going ahead with his plans to open his Spice Market restaurant in Lower Manhattan. "I haven't put anything on the back burner," he said.
And many more restaurateurs are hoping that by the holidays, diners will be as eager as ever.
"What was going on last year was ridiculous," Mr. Troy said. "Some restaurants that were doing O.K. shouldn't have been in business at all. So we are getting back to reality."

HEADLINE: THE RACISM WALKOUT: THE OVERVIEW; 
U.S. AND ISRAELIS QUIT RACISM TALKS OVER DENUNCIATION

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa, Sept. 3 

 BODY:
The United States and Israel walked out of the United Nations meeting on racism here tonight, denouncing a condemnation of Israel in a proposed conference declaration and lamenting that a meeting intended to celebrate tolerance and diversity had degenerated into a gathering riven by hate.
 South Africa rushed tonight to convene emergency meetings to redraft the declaration and program of action in the hope of averting other walkouts, and a spokesman for the European Union delegation, which also raised concerns, said its diplomats would take part in the efforts to rewrite the draft documents. 
 In announcing his decision in Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said, "I have taken this decision with regret because of the importance of the international fight against racism and the contribution that the conference could have made to it." 
"But following discussions today by our team in Durban and others who are working for a successful conference, I am convinced that will not be possible," he said. 
Secretary Powell said negotiators here had failed to persuade Arab delegates to remove criticism of Israel from proposed conference documents that assail "the racist practices of Zionism" and describe Israel's treatment of Palestinians as a "new kind of apartheid." 
Questions about whether Israel should be condemned for its treatment of Palestinians and whether the West should pay reparations for slavery and colonialism have roiled conference preparations for months. Washington has said repeatedly that it would not consider language that criticized Israel or legitimized reparations for descendants of slaves. 
The fact that the United States did not send Secretary Powell to the conference, which opened on Friday, was a sore point with many of the countries represented here. The United States and Israel both sent mid-level delegations.
The decision to withdraw even those delegations dashed the hopes of thousands who have brought their fight against intolerance to a country chosen by conference organizers for its remarkable story of racial reconciliation.
Olivier Alsteens, spokesman for the European Union delegation, said it had no immediate plans to withdraw, "But if at one moment, we feel there is no other opportunity, then we will leave all together."
The American and Israeli pullout was warmly applauded by Jewish groups but greeted with great regret by South Africa and other developing countries and with anger by black Americans and their supporters. It seemed likely only to heighten the frustration and divisions between the increasingly polarized groups. 
Tonight, black Americans and their allies took to the streets here, chanting "Shame, shame U.S.A." The protesters said they were deeply disappointed that the United States could not find a way to compromise and sign an international declaration that is expected to condemn slavery and racial discrimination.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been urging the Arab League to back away from the charged language, and members of the Black Congressional Caucus also criticized the Bush administration's decision.
Representative Donna M. C. Christensen, a Democrat who is the delegate to Congress from the Virgin Islands, said, "It leaves African-Americans with no recognition of all the suffering we have had and all of the suffering we continue to have."
Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California and a delegation member, said he was sorry that the United States was pulling out. But he said the team, headed by E. Michael Southwick, a deputy assistant secretary of state, had no choice because the Palestinians and their supporters refused to compromise. 
The American and Israeli decision came after officials from the United States and Norway had huddled for hours in closed-door meetings with Palestinian and other Arab officials, trying to broker a deal.
Norwegian diplomats proposed new language that mentioned the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but was fair to both sides, according to American officials. But the effort failed, and some meetings were so heated that participants ended up shouting.
"It was an ugly meeting," Mr. Lantos said in an interview. "This was not a question of persuading people. This was a question of an iron wall we were up against, and there was no give."
Arab officials blamed the Bush administration for the failure of the talks. Farouk Kaddoumi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, accused the United States of using the dispute as a pretext to avoid serious discussion of slavery and reparations for the descendants of African slaves.
The Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Maher, said the Norwegian compromise document trivialized Palestinian suffering.
"The only mention of Israel is that the Palestinians and Israelis should go back to the peace process," Mr. Maher said in an interview. "That is not enough. 
"We are talking about a war waged using the most sophisticated weapons on a civilian population," Mr. Maher said. "This is a government that has taken an official decision to assassinate people. You want this conference, which deals with discrimination, not to mention these things? That is precisely what must be raised."
Polarization has also been evident in the interactions of delegates from civic groups meeting here in the hope of influencing the final declaration on racism, which is to be completed on Friday.
Last week, some Arab groups here distributed offensive literature that included posters of Jews with big noses and bloody fangs. Members of Palestinian and Jewish groups shouted at each other during competing rallies. And on Saturday, about 25 Jews walked out of a meeting of civic groups when someone suggested removing references to anti-Semitism. 
After the Jewish groups walked out, the coalition of civic groups approved a report that accused Israel of "racist crimes against humanity, including ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide" in its treatment of Palestinians. The report is not binding, and it is unlikely the language would be adopted.
"The U.S. did not reject a discussion about racism, they rejected a conference that was tainted by racism," said Stacy Burdett, an assistant director at the Anti-Defamation League, who is attending the conference. "This wasn't a discussion about legitimate issues. It was a hijacking that vilified and demonized Jews."
Mordechai Yedid, the head of the Israeli delegation, said in an interview, "Our position has always been to agree to generic language, to the suffering of people, to war, to occupations." 
"This time because the conference was so important to us and to our history as a people who suffered from anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, we have gone beyond, to specific language," he said.
Several human rights groups argued tonight that the United States should have stayed to improve the language about Israel and to show solidarity with the many suffering people in the world.
"We're very troubled by the whole Zionism as racism formulation as well, but we think our responsibility is to stay and have the conversation," said Karen K. Narasaki, president of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium. "You certainly don't build your moral standing in the world by running away."
And the South African government warned that by leaving, the United States might give the impression that it was ducking tough issues, like race relations within its own borders. 
"It will be unfortunate if a perception were to develop that the U.S.A.'s withdrawal from the conference is merely a red herring demonstrating an unwillingness to confront the real issues posed by racism in the U.S.A. and globally," the South African government said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing New Jersey's Debt Grows 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 New Jersey's mounting debt is threatening the state's long-term financial strength and its ability to pay for basic services, especially in an economic downturn, according to a report. A recession would raise serious doubts about New Jersey's ability to maintain the current levels of aid to municipalities and schools, provide property tax relief and make grants to communities and social, medical and other programs, according to the report, issued by the New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research group. 
The state's long-term debt climbed to $15.7 billion last year, from $4 billion in 1990, and the state expects to borrow at least $9 billion more over the next five years. By 2010, the state will have to pay at least $2.8 billion in debt repayments, compared with the current $1.35 billion. About 6.2 percent of the state's budget last year went to pay debt-service costs, according to James Poole, the state's finance director. But merely looking at the debt misses the accomplishments that have been achieved with it, he said.

HEADLINE: Check My Tires? Now the Fun Begins 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The only thing in life that is free is air, unless you need to buy some to inflate your tires at a growing number of gas stations in the United States. Many charge 50 cents. 
 An Aug. 30 National Briefing item reports that a national study found that a third of all light trucks and a quarter of cars have at least one substantially underinflated tire. The solution? It recommends that tire pressure be checked once a month. 
 That's where the real problems begin. I have one car, five tires and zero confidence that I'm ever riding on tires that have the correct pressure. My owner's manual gives one set of numbers, yet the plate inside the driver's side door states another. I have two tire pressure gauges, which always conflict with each other as well as with those at service stations.
All the fuss about proper inflation adds up to a lot of hot air and misspent change if more is not done by the car, tire and service industries not only to educate the public, but also to provide the proper information and technology to solve the problem.

GEORGE W. BUSH
From remarks yesterday at a Teamsters barbecue in Detroit:
 "Now let me tell you I'm a little concerned. I'm proud of our workers; I'm concerned about the fact that our economy is just bumping along. This is a Labor Day where we can't celebrate a booming economy. For the last 12 months, let me repeat, for the last 12 months the economy has been way too slow. And people are hurting. And people are suffering. And there's families who are wondering about how they're going to feed their kids. And I understand that, and we've got help in Washington. 
 But the best thing we can do is ask the question: How do we make sure our economy grows?
And I came up with this answer: Our economy can grow best when we give people their own money back, when we give the hard-working Americans their own money back in the form of rebates so that you spend it. And that's what's going to help this economy rebound. The federal government must keep a lid on spending and remember that when the American consumer spends it is the best way to kick-start a soft economy. The biggest threat to economic vitality and economic growth is if Congress overspends."

HEADLINE: Great Expectations Of Mexico's Leader Sapped by Reality 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON and TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 3 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox once said his path to power was "full of rocks, predators, leeches, scorpions and snakes." The road has not improved much since he won election last year. He may have made it harder by paving it with good intentions.
 His promises are a national wish list for transforming Mexico: a rapid end to conflict in Chiapas; new trade alliances with Central America to help lift this nation's south out of poverty; new jobs to keep young men from migrating to the United States; a truthful accounting of hideous crimes in Mexico's past; better salaries, training and equipment for teachers and the police; an end to government corruption. 
 With a salesman's hype, he raised expectations that he could offer same-day delivery for those hopes. 
The gaps between Mr. Fox's rhetoric and reality allow his critics to say that he acts as if he were the chairman of Mexico Inc., issuing policies and promises like business plans and projections. But Mr. Fox has realized -- slowly, say allies and enemies alike -- that he cannot govern Mexico the way he once ran Coca-Cola's operations here.
"No one can make decisions on his own," Mr. Fox said in an interview tonight with The New York Times. "And this obliges us to put a heavy emphasis on politicking in our work so that we can achieve consensus. That is an important change."
Mr. Fox proposed to build political alliances with Congress and reform Mexico's archaic tax code. The independent-minded Congress, controlled by his opponents, rejected the plan. He vowed to retool the inefficient state-run energy company. The plan remains on the drawing board. He promised to distribute a million micro-loans to support homespun businesses. Some 3,070 people have received them so far, according to the program's administrators.
He once thought that economic growth would finance his social programs, and that a newly energized federal government, fueled by his popularity, would turn his words to deeds. But countervailing political and economic forces have hit Mr. Fox's presidency like a cyclone. Mr. Fox pledged 7 percent economic growth and the creation of more than a million new jobs this year, but more than 300,000 have been lost since he took office on Dec. 1. 
The recession that gripped Mexico this summer was "a surprise," Mr. Fox said in the interview. "That has forced us to change strategy and to look for ways to stop the job losses, to look for new ways to begin growing." He said he knew that "Mexicans want to see more concrete progress; they want to see more money in their pockets."
But for now the economic decline in the United States has ended growth in Mexico, which sells roughly 85 percent of its exports to the United States. 
Luis Cruz was a bookkeeper with a business degree at a Mexico City electronics company when Mr. Fox took office. But he lost his job when the economy faltered this spring. Now he wonders aloud when and if "the president will ever accomplish anything concrete."
"Everything has changed," he said, "and nothing has changed."
Mr. Fox stood before Congress on Saturday night a visibly changed man from the dream-driven politician he was nine months ago, when he donned the ceremonial sash to become the first president of Mexico elected from the political opposition. As he gave his first state of the nation address, his voice was drained of the relentless optimism that fires most of his public discourse.
As his popularity ratings slowly descend from the clouds, so have the promises of his presidency. In flat, direct language, he acknowledged that his biggest pledges to Mexico -- promises that propelled his stunning rise to power -- have been deferred.
"Many results have not come as quickly or as fully as we needed," he told Congress. "There are obstacles, and there will continue to be obstacles. But rest assured, I will keep my promises to you." 
On one front -- in the United States, where Mr. Fox arrives late Tuesday night for a formal state visit -- he has made strides in the thorniest fields, like migration and international law enforcement. 
He may come away with only "partial agreements" on migration policy, he said, but he hopes to win a deeper trust from the United States government, based on his achievements in fighting cocaine cartels and smugglers of immigrants, and greater understanding about the key roles Mexico and Mexican immigrants play the American economy.
But foreign policy or popularity abroad will not make Mexico the nation that Mr. Fox envisions, warned a prominent political expert, Lorenzo Meyer. 
"No head of state can survive on his image abroad," Mr. Meyer said. "Fox is going to have to learn to live on his relationship with his own society and on the support that he generates at home."
Mr. Fox changed Mexico's history forever when he defeated the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had governed Mexico since 1929. That victory shattered the sense of political apathy and cynicism that millions felt under the once-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, a political machine that hoarded power, jobs and money. From that ground-shaking transition has sprung a more open government, an increasingly vigilant press corps, a more politically active society.
The question is how much Mr. Fox can change Mexico's future. He will succeed, he said in the interview, if he stays "close to the Mexican people, to have their support in order to govern well, and in order to have something that exists only in participatory democracies -- democratic governance, rather than an authoritarian regime."
But unlike presidents of the old regime, Mr. Fox has no political machine. He has been slow to embrace his own National Action Party, whose leaders are sometimes suspicious of him. His cabinet -- business leaders, academics and politicians of varying ideologies -- often resembles a debating society. The bureaucracy is filled with old-regime officials whose habits die hard.
And if the president cannot begin keeping his biggest pledges, the old apathy and cynicism might return, political experts say. 
"People wanted things to happen; they expected change," said Ricardo de la Pena, a Mexico City pollster. "They are beginning to question the president's failure to live up to their expectations. The popularity bonus he got after he was elected has been squandered."
Enrique Krauze, a leading Mexican historian, prefers to see Mr. Fox's glass as half full.
"It is difficult to have results after inheriting a regime that was in power for so many years," Mr. Krauze said. "The rules of politics have just begun to change, and it is more difficult to build consensus."
"We have to know how to be patient," he said. "Why? Because Mexico has already made significant political advances."
In public, Mr. Fox remains upbeat. Two Sundays ago, he bounded out of church, strode up to reporters and starting spinning his version of reality, saying he was fulfilling three big promises to the poor. 
"Micro-loans have begun," he said. "Starting tomorrow, they will be arriving to millions of Mexican men and women." The program, providing credits of up to $3,000 for the smallest businesses, is part of Mr. Fox's promise to help lift people up from poverty, a pledge many judge to be his most solemn vow. 
"Scholarships and financing for students have already begun, and are being received by all citizens and young people who want to move forward with their studies," the president went on. "Special programs to address the needs of the unemployed have already begun operating."
The president's accomplishments actually appear more modest.
Officials at the agencies that administer those programs said that 3,070 people, not "millions," had received micro-credits; that 18 percent of the promised scholarships had been granted, though the rest were in the pipeline; and that they had no statistics to show for the government's efforts to link up job-seekers with employers.
Alfredo Espinosa is president of the Mexican Foundation for Rural Development, one of 25 institutions selected to hand out micro-loans. His group, like most, has received no money from the government. Besieged by applicants, he was unable to grant a single loan. "At the moment, we've received nothing," he said. "I figure the president himself doesn't know all these details, and the people below him must have said, 'Hold it, we need more time.' "
Maria del Carmen Diaz, the federal micro-credit coordinator, said, "I had thought it would have taken us a month to get going, and it's taken six." By year's end, she hopes, 40,000 loans may be granted.
Mr. Fox needs Congress to change hidebound laws to help him accomplish some of his biggest promises. His failed efforts for tax reform provided a bitter lesson.
Congress and citizens cried out against a plan for a 15-percent levy on food and medicine. Mr. Fox thought that he could sweep aside the opposition. "Congress won't block me on fiscal reform," he told foreign diplomats in April. 
He could have gone to Congress to build support for his plan. Instead, he broadcast a television ad from the presidential mansion denouncing his opponents: "They're lying, those who say this reform will hurt the poorest," he said. "With this plan, everybody wins."
So far, only Mr. Fox has lost this battle. His tax plan is a dead letter; he damaged relations with Congress.
The debacle, said Carlos Ramirez Marin, congressional vice chairman for the PRI, showed that Mr. Fox "is a man who thinks that simply by saying something, he can make it reality."
Mr. Fox says he knows he must work with his enemies to succeed. 
"It is indispensable to show results inside this country and to give a better quality of life to our citizens," he said. "And that is my greatest struggle. That is why I get out of bed and go to work every day."

HEADLINE: At Pair of Labor Gatherings, Bush Gets Set for Fall Fight 

BYLINE:  By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was concerned about the nation's economy, describing it as "anemic at best" in the last year and adding that there were still "some problems on the horizon." 
 But speaking during briskly paced Labor Day visits to a carpenters' union rally in Green Bay, Wis., and a Teamsters picnic here, Mr. Bush mixed into his comments a note of optimism. 
 "Even though people are hurting today -- and I know they are -- I'm confident with the basic underpinnings of the economy," he told several hundred carpenters in Green Bay. "I'm confident we can recover." 
Mr. Bush tried to use his appearances to shape the terms of the coming budget battle with Congressional Democrats at a time of a shrinking surplus. Revised estimates that even by the administration's reckoning have all but eliminated the non-Social Security surplus over the next several years leave the president and Congress little room to operate in enacting spending bills this fall. 
Democrats including the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, maintain that Mr. Bush's tax cut is largely to blame and that the president is responsible for the painful trade-offs that many expect. 
But Mr. Bush told the carpenters: "Make no mistake about it: tax relief was the right thing to do at the right time. The rebate checks are now hitting. People have got more money to spend or invest, the very things needed to make sure that we sustain economic vitality and growth. There are some second-guessers in Washington."
In addition to trying to frame the coming budget debate, Mr. Bush was also seeking to improve relations with organized labor ahead of the Congressional elections next year.
This spring the carpenters' union broke away from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a reliable Democratic ally, and today the president of the union, Douglas McCarron, traveled to Wisconsin with Mr. Bush on Air Force One.
The political dimension of Mr. Bush's efforts was even more evident here in Detroit, where he offered extended praise to James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union. The Teamsters supported Vice President Al Gore in the last election, but Mr. Hoffa recently backed the administration's effort to authorize oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He has also emphasized his interest in having his union strengthen its ties to the Republican Party.
Mr. Hoffa was not present at the rally here, because of what both union and White House officials described as a commitment to be in California to celebrate the end of a two-year-old contract dispute involving 800 teamsters. But, before a sparse crowd of about 300 of the union's members, Mr. Bush did his best to embrace its leader. 
"You've got a good man running the Teamsters in Jimmy Hoffa," Mr. Bush said, to great cheering. The president also said Mr. Hoffa had run the union well, an unmistakable reference to the teamsters' efforts to be freed of federal court and Justice Department supervision, imposed under a 1989 consent decree because of past corruption.
"Let me tell you another thing about Jimmy Hoffa," Mr. Bush said. "He's running a good union and in an aboveboard way, an aboveboard way. And make no mistake about it, people are beginning to notice, particularly in Washington, D.C." 
Mr. Bush's success in pushing his energy policy through the House was due in part to his ability to split some of the Democrats' allies in the labor movement away from the party's allies among environmentalists, with the Teamsters arguing that drilling in the Arctic would provide jobs. Today Mr. Bush emphasized the employment theme, saying Mr. Hoffa "understands that good sound energy policy means jobs for American workers."
Mr. Bush did not mention one issue on which he and Mr. Hoffa remain far apart: the administration's effort to grant Mexican truckers access to the United States beyond a border area 20 miles deep. The teamsters and other unions have blocked the wider access.
But Mr. Bush is committed to lifting the restrictions, which have been a major irritant in the United States' relations with Mexico, whose president, Vicente Fox, is scheduled to visit the White House this week.
In both his appearances today, Mr. Bush repeatedly tried to demonstrate a concern for working families.
"I know people are hurting," he told a crowd at a Wisconsin airport. He used the word "hurting" several times today, in a defter version of his father's 1992 campaign statement "Message: I care." 
President George Bush was defeated for re-election that year by Bill Clinton, whose corresponding message, "I feel your pain," proved more effective.

Hewlett Agrees to Buy Compaq for $25 Billion
Hewlett-Packard announced yesterday that it was acquiring Compaq Computer for $25 billion in stock, a bold move to grow as the computer business struggles with shrinking sales.

HEADLINE: At a Labor Picnic, Mixed Reviews for Bush 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 3 

 BODY:
After trudging two miles in this city's Labor Day parade, Ford Dingman was sprawled on the grass, thirsty, tired and sounding unenthusiastic about President Bush's visit today to this cradle of unionism.
 Mr. Dingman, a burly steelworker wearing a "Union Yes!" button, praised Mr. Bush for visiting a union picnic today, but he complained that the president had done little to reverse the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last year. 
 "I would take any support for labor from any politician," Mr. Dingman said. "But I've very skeptical about Bush. I'm a Missourian. It's show me. He's trying to open up a bit toward labor, but we're waiting to see the actions he takes."
Interviews with three dozen union members at the parade and at a Teamsters' picnic indicated that Mr. Bush faced an uphill battle in the campaign he began two weeks ago to win the hearts and minds of union members. Last year, the nation's 16 million union members voted more than two to one for Vice President Al Gore, but Mr. Bush has been working earnestly to win labor support, especially in Midwestern swing states that his advisers say may be pivotal to his re-election hopes.
As part of these efforts, Mr. Bush attended a steelworkers picnic near Pittsburgh two weeks ago, a carpenters' union training session in Green Bay, Wis., this morning and the Teamsters' annual Labor Day picnic this afternoon.
To win over labor's rank and file, Mr. Bush will have to overcome a deep sense among many union members that he is unfriendly to organized labor and that his $1.3 trillion tax cut favors the rich. Labor Day marchers pointed to a long list of Bush positions that they opposed, including his plans to privatize Social Security, his revocation of ergonomics rules, his push for fast-track trade legislation and his efforts to give Mexican trucks greater access to American highways in accordance with the free-trade agreement.
Nevertheless, many workers welcomed his efforts to reach out, while others called his visit window dressing intended to make union members forget his antilabor actions.
Jim Parrinello, a driver for Consolidated Freightways who said he voted for Al Gore, welcomed Mr. Bush's decision to spend an hour with 300 picnicking Teamsters.
"It's good to see that his door is open," Mr. Parrinello said. "Now I think he's going to listen to us on some things."
But Robert Buthia, a member of the United Auto Workers, was cynical about Mr. Bush's visit.
"It's just a facade," Mr. Buthia said as he leaned on an antique Chevrolet in the parade's staging area. "It's just to make him look good."
Mr. Buthia, who is thinking of retiring after 37 years at an auto parts plant, said he was worried about Mr. Bush's plans to spend part of the Social Security surplus.
"He's ready to cut into Social Security," he said. "Why would you want to give people a tax rebate and than have to cut $9 billion into Social Security? It doesn't make sense at all."
The parade was a festive event, with floats, thousands of marchers and flatbed trucks that carried retirees and blared Motown oldies. At the parade, union members gave mixed reviews to Mr. Bush's Detroit visit.
"As a unionist, I'm embarrassed that he's in this city today," said Norm Kujawa, who works at a Mercury Cougar plant in Flat Rock, Mich. "It's an affront to labor. His policies have been antiunion. He's in Detroit today because he's a good politician, and he knows that unions can help him."
Latanya Mitchell, a worker at American Axle Manufacturing, said, "My take is the same as any other union member -- I don't see Bush doing anything to help."
But Wayne Hall, a retired chemical worker, was more generous, saying that it was early in Mr. Bush's term and that he was waiting for the president to prove himself.
"I'd give him a B-plus for bringing dignity back to the White House," Mr. Hall said. "But he has to realize where the bread and butter comes from. He hasn't really shown it."
A big obstacle for Mr. Bush in gaining the support of union members is that many union leaders articulate a steady anti-Bush message, condemning, among other things, the fast-track trade legislation, his tax cut and his plans to privatize Social Security. Along the parade route many telephone poles carried signed, printed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O, that read, "Working Families Say Stop Fast Track."
White House officials arranged for Mr. Bush to attend the Teamsters' picnic after that union backed him on drilling for oil in Alaska, a move that angered several other unions. At the picnic, the Teamsters gave Mr. Bush a polite reception, but applauded with enthusiasm when he praised the union's president, James P. Hoffa.
"I'm very glad to see the president is reaching out to the Teamsters and to labor," Bob Golota, a United Parcel Service driver said as he waited to shake hands with Mr. Bush at the picnic. "We need our voice to be heard, whether by Republicans or Democrats."
Scott Mielnicki, a truck driver who voted for Mr. Bush, said he and his family were thrilled to shake Mr. Bush's hand at the picnic. "I think he and Jimmy Hoffa have got a special bond going, and that's good for labor. They should be able to work some things out."
In his 10-minute speech to the Teamsters, Mr. Bush aid he was very concerned about the economy, insisting that the best medicine to speed up growth was his tax cut.
But most union members interviewed were indifferent or hostile to the tax cut. More often than not, union members said their rebates of $300 or $600 were paltry.
"I didn't need the $300 more to get the country more in debt," said Dawn McQuade-Gulley, a plumber who works at the Renaissance Center complex.
Michael Grivna, a Teamster, said the money could have been used to pay for prescription drugs for needy retirees, like his mother-in-law.
Mr. Golota, the U.P.S. driver was one of the few union members to applaud Mr. Bush's tax cut, saying, "My son is in college, and the tax rebate certainly will help pay his tuition."

HEADLINE: U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits 

BYLINE:  This article was reported and written by Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg and William J. Broad. 

 BODY:
Over the past several years, the United States has embarked on a program of secret research on biological weapons that, some officials say, tests the limits of the global treaty banning such weapons.
 The 1972 treaty forbids nations from developing or acquiring weapons that spread disease, but it allows work on vaccines and other protective measures. Government officials said the secret research, which mimicked the major steps a state or terrorist would take to create a biological arsenal, was aimed at better understanding the threat. 
 The projects, which have not been previously disclosed, were begun under President Clinton and have been embraced by the Bush administration, which intends to expand them. 
Earlier this year, administration officials said, the Pentagon drew up plans to engineer genetically a potentially more potent variant of the bacterium that causes anthrax, a deadly disease ideal for germ warfare. 
The experiment has been devised to assess whether the vaccine now being given to millions of American soldiers is effective against such a superbug, which was first created by Russian scientists. A Bush administration official said the National Security Council is expected to give the final go-ahead later this month. 
Two other projects completed during the Clinton administration focused on the mechanics of making germ weapons. 
In a program code-named Clear Vision, the Central Intelligence Agency built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb that agency officials feared was being sold on the international market. The C.I.A. device lacked a fuse and other parts that would make it a working bomb, intelligence officials said.
At about the same time, Pentagon experts assembled a germ factory in the Nevada desert from commercially available materials. Pentagon officials said the project demonstrated the ease with which a terrorist or rogue nation could build a plant that could produce pounds of the deadly germs. 
Both the mock bomb and the factory were tested with simulants -- benign substances with characteristics similar to the germs used in weapons, officials said.
A senior Bush administration official said all the projects were "fully consistent" with the treaty banning biological weapons and were needed to protect Americans against a growing danger. "This administration will pursue defenses against the full spectrum of biological threats," the official said. 
The treaty, another administration official said, allows the United States to conduct research on both microbes and germ munitions for "protective or defensive purposes." 
Some Clinton administration officials worried, however, that the project violated the pact. And others expressed concern that the experiments, if disclosed, might be misunderstood as a clandestine effort to resume work on a class of weapons that President Nixon had relinquished in 1969.
Simultaneous experiments involving a model of a germ bomb, a factory to make biological agents and the developoment of more potent anthrax, these officials said, would draw vociferous protests from Washington if conducted by a country the United States viewed as suspect.
Administration officials said the need to keep such projects secret was a significant reason behind President Bush's recent rejection of a draft agreement to strengthen the germ-weapons treaty, which has been signed by 143 nations. 
The draft would require those countries to disclose where they are conducting defensive research involving gene-splicing or germs likely to be used in weapons. The sites would then be subject to international inspections. 
Many national security officials in both the Clinton and Bush administrations opposed the draft, arguing that it would give potential adversaries a road map to what the United States considers its most serious vulnerabilities.
Among the facilities likely to be open to inspection under the draft agreement would be the West Jefferson, Ohio, laboratory of the Battelle Memorial Institute, a military contractor that has been selected to create the genetically altered anthrax.
Several officials who served in senior posts in the Clinton administration acknowledged that the secretive efforts were so poorly coordinated that even the White House was unaware of their full scope. 
The Pentagon's project to build a germ factory was not reported to the White House, they said. President Clinton, who developed an intense interest in germ weapons, was never briefed on the programs under way or contemplated, the officials said. 
A former senior official in the Clinton White House conceded that in retrospect, someone should have been responsible for reviewing the projects to ensure that they were not only effective in defending the United States, but consistent with the nation's arms-control pledges.
The C.I.A.'s tests on the bomb model touched off a dispute among government experts after the tests were concluded in 2000, with some officials arguing that they violated the germ treaty's prohibition against developing weapons. 
Intelligence officials said lawyers at the agency and the White House concluded that the work was defensive, and therefore allowed. But even officials who supported the effort acknowledged that it brought the United States closer to what was forbidden. 
"It was pressing how far you go before you do something illegal or immoral," recalled one senior official who was briefed on the program.
Public disclosure of the research is likely to complicate the position of the United States, which has long been in the forefront of efforts to enforce the ban on germ weapons. 
The Bush administration's willingness to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty has already drawn criticism around the world. And the administration's stance on the draft agreement for the germ treaty has put Washington at odds with many of its allies, including Japan and Britain. 

The Original Treaty
During the cold war, both the United States and the Soviet Union produced vast quantities of germ weapons, enough to kill everyone on earth. 
Eager to halt the spread of what many called the poor man's atom bomb, the United States unilaterally gave up germ arms and helped lead the global campaign to abolish them. By 1975, most of the world's nations had signed the convention. 
In doing so, they agreed not to develop, produce, acquire or stockpile quantities or types of germs that had no "prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes." They also pledged not to develop or obtain weapons or other equipment "designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict."
There were at least two significant loopholes: The pact did not define "defensive" research or say what studies might be prohibited, if any. And it provided no means of catching cheaters.
In the following decades, several countries did cheat, some on a huge scale. The Soviet Union built entire cities devoted to developing germ weapons, employing tens of thousands of people and turning anthrax, smallpox and bubonic plague into weapons of war. In the late 1980's, Iraq began a crash program to produce its own germ arsenal.
Both countries insisted that their programs were for defensive purposes.
American intelligence officials had suspected that Baghdad and Moscow were clandestinely producing germ weapons. But the full picture of their efforts did not become clear until the 1990's, after several Iraqi and Soviet officials defected. 
Fears about the spread of biological weapons were deepened by the rise of terrorism against Americans, the great strides in genetic engineering and the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left thousands of scientists skilled in biological warfare unemployed, penniless and vulnerable to recruitment. 
The threat disclosed a quandary: While the United States spent billions of dollars a year to assess enemy military forces and to defend against bullets, tanks, bombs and jet fighters, it knew relatively little about the working of exotic arms it had relinquished long ago.

Designing a Delivery System
In the mid-1990's, the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies stepped up their search for information about other nations' biological research programs, focusing on the former Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq and Libya, among others. Much of the initial emphasis was on the germs that enemies might use in an attack, officials said.
But in 1997, the agency embarked on Clear Vision, which focused on weapons systems that would deliver the germs.
Intelligence officials said the project was led by Gene Johnson, a senior C.I.A. scientist who had long worked with some of the world's deadliest viruses. Dr. Johnson was eager to understand the damage that Soviet miniature bombs -- bomblets, in military parlance -- might inflict.
The agency asked its spies to find or buy a Soviet bomblet, which releases germs in a fine mist. That search proved unsuccessful, and the agency approved a proposal to build a replica and study how well it could disperse its lethal cargo.
The agency's lawyers concluded that such a project was permitted by the treaty because the intent was defensive. Intelligence officials said the C.I.A. had reports that at least one nation was trying to buy the Soviet-made bomblets.
A model was constructed and the agency conducted two sets of tests at Battelle, the military contractor. The experiments measured dissemination characteristics and how the model performed under different atmospheric conditions, intelligence officials said. They emphasized that the device was a "portion" of a bomb that could not have been used as a weapon. 
The experiments caused concern at the White House, which learned about the project after it was under way. Some aides to President Clinton worried that the benefits did not justify the risks. But a White House lawyer led a joint assessment by several departments that concluded that the program did not violate the treaty, and it went ahead.
The questions were debated anew after the project was completed, this time without consensus. A State Department official argued for a strict reading of the treaty: the ban on acquiring or developing "weapons" barred states from building even a partial model of a germ bomb, no matter what the rationale. 
"A bomb is a bomb is a bomb," another official said at the time.
The C.I.A. continued to insist that it had the legal authority to conduct such tests and, intelligence officials said, the agency was prepared to reopen the fight over how to interpret the treaty. But even so, the agency ended the Clear Vision project in the last year of the Clinton administration, intelligence officials said.
Bill Harlow, the C.I.A. spokesman, acknowledged that the agency had conducted "laboratory or experimental" work to assess the intelligence it had gathered about biological warfare. 
"Everything we have done in this respect was entirely appropriate, necessary, consistent with U.S. treaty obligations and was briefed to the National Security Council staff and appropriate Congressional oversight committees," Mr. Harlow said. 

Breeding More Potent Anthrax
In the 1990's, government officials also grew increasingly worried about the possibility that scientists could use the widely available techniques of gene-splicing to create even more deadly weapons.
Those concerns deepened in 1995, when Russian scientists disclosed at a scientific conference in Britain that they had implanted genes from Bacillus cereus, an organism that causes food poisoning, into the anthrax microbe. 
The scientists said later that the experiments were peaceful; the two microbes can be found side-by-side in nature and, the Russians said, they wanted to see what happened if they cross-bred.
A published account of the experiment, which appeared in a scientific journal in late 1997, alarmed the Pentagon, which had just decided to require that American soldiers be vaccinated against anthrax. According to the article, the new strain was resistant to Russia's anthrax vaccine, at least in hamsters. 
American officials tried to obtain a sample from Russia through a scientific exchange program to see whether the Russians had really created such a hybrid. The Americans also wanted to test whether the microbe could defeat the American vaccine, which is different from that used by Russia.
Despite repeated promises, the bacteria were never provided.
Eventually the C.I.A. drew up plans to replicate the strain, but intelligence officials said the agency hesitated because there was no specific report that an adversary was attempting to turn the superbug into a weapon. 
This year, officials said, the project was taken over by the Pentagon's intelligence arm, the Defense Intelligence Agency. Pentagon lawyers reviewed the proposal and said it complied with the treaty. Officials said the research would be part of Project Jefferson, yet another government effort to track the dangers posed by germ weapons. 
A spokesman for Defense Intelligence, Lt. Cmdr. James Brooks, declined comment. Asked about the precautions at Battelle, which is to create the enhanced anthrax, Commander Brooks said security was "entirely suitable for all work already conducted and planned for Project Jefferson."

The Question of Secrecy
While several officials in both the Clinton and Bush administrations called this and other research long overdue, they expressed concern about the lack of a central system for vetting such proposals.
And a former American diplomat questioned the wisdom of keeping them secret.
James F. Leonard, head of the delegation that negotiated the germ treaty, said research on microbes or munitions could be justified, depending on the specifics.
But he said such experiments should be done openly, exposed to the scrutiny of scientists and the public. Public disclosure, he said, is important evidence that the United States is proceeding with a "clean heart."
"It's very important to be open," he said. "If we're not open, who's going to be open?" 
Mr. Leonard said the fine distinctions drawn by government lawyers were frequently ignored when a secret program was exposed. Then, he said, others offer the harshest possible interpretations -- a "vulgarization of what has been done."
But he concluded that the secret germ research, as described to him, was "foolish, but not illegal."

HEADLINE: Dot-Commers Trade Options for Books 

BYLINE:  By AMIE PARNES 

 BODY:
Back in the reign of the dot-coms, Colvin Pitts, 22, left his computer science classes and backpack behind at Stanford University for a job as a programmer at Media3k, a San Francisco streaming media Web site that set him up with a $45,000 salary and stock options worth $70,000.
 Around the same time, Daniel Billotte, 26, dropped out of Arizona State University in his senior year to work full time at AtWeb .com, a Web site developer in Sunnyvale, Calif., for more than $63,000 and options valued in the six figures. And Joe Cavanaugh, 22, left Stanford in the middle of his junior year to devote himself full time to his own company, EmpowerD.com, a Web site intended to help disabled people. 
 "I knew when I could no longer give enough time to school and the company," Mr. Cavanaugh said. "Since Stanford would always be there and I could go back, I decided to take a shot and see how far we could take the company." 
The three were among the thousands of college students who were lured away from their math textbooks and History 101 classes by dot-com start-ups that promised riches and fame. But when Internet Armageddon came and unemployment loomed, they and many of their peers rediscovered the value of an old-fashioned ticket to career success: a bachelor's degree. And back to school they went.
"These young dot-commers began to feel unfulfilled," said Allison B. Hemming, the president of the Hired Guns, a consulting firm in New York that specializes in the new economy. "They developed these amazing Web sites and then watched them disappear, and they are coming back to school looking for something more concrete."
Their return to academia was not easy. "It's tough to walk away from something you put so much work into," said Ravi Paidipaty, 20, who began his senior year at Yale on Tuesday. Mr. Paidipaty left school last summer to start broadcastbuilders .com, which delivered broadcasts to MP3 players and cell phones but lasted only a few months. He seems almost relieved to be back. "In the bigger picture, I think it's nice to be a kid and a student for a little while longer and graduate on time with your friends," he said.
The herd instinct played a large part in the defection of so many students to cyberbusinesses. Before the bubble burst, everybody seemed to be getting in on the action, and no one wanted to be left behind.
"You're sitting in class, and meanwhile, you're hearing about people your age making millions and millions of dollars," said Zaw Thet, 21, who dropped out of Stanford in his junior year to start GetInventory.com, a Web-based supply-chain-management company. "You want to make money," too, he said.
At one point last year, Mr. Thet said, eight dot-coms were up and running in a single fraternity house at Stanford. By the end of the year, though, he had run out of money and shut his down. "It almost pains me to talk about it," he said. "We had a great team, but you can only work in the garage for so long."
He returned to school last December to pursue a double major in political science and computer science and plans to graduate next June. Meantime, he has a job -- with a Fortune 500 company. "Going back to school after being in the work force feels a little odd but it feels right," Mr. Thet said.
For some, the pilgrimage back to school was always part of the game plan. Peter Douglas, 22, a native of Potomac, Md., who graduated from Stanford in June, says he could not resist dropping out for a chance to help muscle a company from the ground up.
"I always knew I'd come back and finish up," Mr. Douglas said. "I just didn't know it would be that soon."
His adventure began in February 2000, when as a junior he took a part-time writing stint at Bluedog.com, a developer of Internet shopping tools near the Stanford campus. Before long, he was putting in 40 hours a week and growing resentful about having to go to class. So he dropped out in the spring.
"I got sucked in," Mr. Douglas said. "I became entirely obsessed with the success of the company and its product and totally immersed in the start-up world." With a $40,000 salary and a trove of stock options, he also took his girlfriend to fine restaurants, gave lavish wine parties and booked a two-week vacation to England.
Then, in August, Bluedog.com went under, and Mr. Douglas was suddenly just another unemployed dot-commer. "There was a great deal of grieving," he said. "It was really comforting to come back to school and throw myself into something more stable -- write papers, study for tests, earn my degree. No one can take those things from me." After graduation, he chose one of the oldest professions around: acting.
Stanford's dean of students, Marc Wais, says the exodus of Net-giddy students reached such proportions two years ago that the school had a problem filling campus leadership positions.
But then they came back. Mr. Cavanaugh, who left Stanford in the spring of 2000 to start EmpowerD.com, returned to school last September after EmpowerD.com died. After graduating in June, he joined a software company, and he plans to apply to business school soon.
"I'm glad I went back to school," he said. "It was a loose end I had to tie."
Mr. Billotte, who dropped out of Arizona State in the fall of 1998 to join AtWeb.com, is now making plans to return to school either this spring or next fall to complete his senior year. In the meantime, he is working full time as a software engineer at AOL Netscape in Santa Cruz, Calif.
As for Mr. Pitts, the computer science major who went to work for Media3k last year, he will be returning to school this month as a senior with few regrets. "As for my $70,000 in stock options, I could net about $200 if I sold today," he said.
As the academic year opens, the flow of students back to campuses pretty much matches the outflow two years ago. "These students need support and stability now," said Anna Copeland Wheatley, the editor in chief of AlleyCat News, a New York trade publication that specializes in dot-coms.
The Stanford Daily, the campus newspaper, even ran a story last quarter welcoming back the dot-com refugees.
"It's very humbling for the dot-commers," Mr. Wais of Stanford said. "Some of these students were C.E.O.'s of these companies, and now they're back on campus" sharing a dorm room with a roommate.

HEADLINE: British Phone Gear Maker to Cut Another2,000 Jobs 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
Two months after telling investors there would be no top-level management changes, Marconi, Britain's battered telephone equipment maker, said today that both its chairman and chief executive had quit, and that it would eliminate 2,000 more jobs, half of them in the United States. It also reported an operating loss of $329 million in the quarter ended June 30.
 The sudden departure of the chairman, Sir Roger Hurn, and the chief executive, Lord Simpson, capped one of the most spectacular corporate debacles of recent years. Created in 1999 from the General Electric Company of Britain, which is not related to the company of that name based in the United States, Marconi went on an acquisition spree. It spent some $8 billion, much of it in America, to transform itself from a military contractor into a telecommunications company -- just in time for last year's collapse of technology-related businesses. 
 Marconi has since cut back sharply, eliminating 10,000 jobs (including those announced today), or one-quarter of its work force. Its market value has collapsed as well, falling from its $50 billion peak a year ago to just over $2 billion after London trading today. The share price fell by half in one day alone, July 5, after the company reversed its previous position and issued a profit warning. 
The assurances it gave to investors at that time -- including those relating to management -- have not been borne out. Indeed, one day after the former chief financial officer, John C. Mayo, said there would be no top management changes, he was himself ousted.
"Everything they said then has completely gone out of the window," said Robin Hardy, an analyst with WestLB Panmure in London. The company has left investors with few indications of how the company will fare. The change of management, Mr. Hardy said, may restore "some but not enough" confidence to investors' view of Marconi.
Other analysts suggested that investors would be disappointed that new managers had not been brought in from outside the company. Marconi said that Mike Parton, the head of its networks unit, would replace Lord Simpson as chief executive and that Derek Bonham, a senior nonexecutive director, would serve as interim chairman until a permanent successor was found for Sir Roger.
Before the July debacle, Lord Simpson had been seen as one of Britain's top managers. Analysts said then that the company, which sold its military business in 1999, had plunged into buying phone-equipment companies like the Reltec Corporation of Cleveland and Fore Systems of Pittsburgh without a close understanding of the industry. Investors also took exception to what they saw as attempts by management to mislead them about the company's health.
The Evening Standard reported that Lord Simpson received more than $1.4 million in severance.
Mr. Parton, the new chief executive, said today that the company had begun a top-to-bottom review in response to the drastic contraction of new investment in telecommunications equipment worldwide. "I do believe there is a place in this market for Marconi," he said, "and that we will be successful."
Like its rivals, Marconi has been caught in the downdraft as phone operators, deeply in debt from buying new digital mobile phone licenses at auction, have scaled back plans to build the new networks, which are years away from making profits.
Marconi said it would save the equivalent of $840 million from the layoffs announced today, allowing it to return to profitability next year. Debt will be cut from the current level of $6.4 billion to $4.7 billion or less. And the company said today that up to $5.1 billion in acquisition-related costs will be written off, another reversal of the guidance it gave in July, when it said no write-offs were foreseen.
Marconi's shares fell 1 penny today, to 53 pence (77 cents) a share on the London Stock Exchange, after rising initially on word of the boardroom bloodletting.
While analysts said today's measures should help, the clouds of gloom over its chosen industry remain thick. A major rival, Ericsson of Sweden, said today that it saw no clear sign that the market for equipment would begin to recover next year. "No one can tell when we will see an end to the downturn," said Kurt Hellstrom, the chief executive. The comment, made at a conference in London, helped pushed Ericsson's already battered share price down more than 10 percent.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
In France, Few Pickers May Mean No Nouveau

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
IT'S harvest time in the vineyards of France, and the growers are facing serious shortages. Not of grapes, but of people to pick them. 
 In Bordeaux, the largest of France's wine regions, the vendange, as the harvest is called, begins on Monday for white wines and about 10 days later for the reds. The 4,000 or so growers will need some 33,000 pickers for 10 days to a month to bring in the crop. Recruiters are working frantically to find prospects and to sign them up. 
 In Bordeaux's best-known region, the Medoc, home of world famous chateaus like Latour, Margaux and Lafite-Rothschild, 3,500 workers will be needed but only 400 had signed up as of Monday, according to the recruiters in Pauillac. 
In the Beaujolais region, in the east of France, the worker shortage is so serious that some growers there fear there may be no Beaujolais nouveau, the popular wine produced for release in November. 
"We used to be able to draw up our teams of pickers in July," Gerard Brisson, a grower in Villie Morgon told the news agency Reuters, "but for the past two years we have been able to find people only at the last moment."
The worker shortage would be even more acute if the larger properties were not equipped with picking machines. The situation in Beaujolais, which needs about 40,000 pickers, is particularly serious because the machines are banned there. Large properties throughout the rest of France use them, but hand picking is still preferred by many. 
Traditionally, vineyards in southwestern France relied on workers from Spain and Portugal, but improved economies in those countries mean fewer workers are headed for the vineyards north of the Pyrenees. The same is true for vineyards in the north, in Champagne and Alsace, where workers have often been recruited from Poland and other Eastern European countries, as well as from France's rust belt along the Belgian border. There, too, the economy has improved in recent years.
Compounding the problem is the decision this year by many French universities to begin the academic year in September rather than in October. Students have always been a principal source of seasonal vineyard workers.
So why don't the chateaus use machines instead? A modern picking machine can do the work of 100 or more pickers, and can work 24 hours a day if necessary.
The mechanical harvesters straddle the vines, slapping them with fiberglass panels. With most models, the ripe grapes, individually and inbunches, drop onto belts, which convey them to a hopper at the rear of the machine. 
That the machines are more economical for most vineyards is irrefutable. Their defenders also claim that they are more discriminating than humans because they collect only the ripe fruit, which falls off the vines easily.
The machines, developed in the United States but refined in France, can be found in every wine region in the world, including some of Bordeaux's best-known chateaus. In the United States, they are used wherever they are economically feasible, mostly in large vineyards. Few new vineyards are planted without vine rows wide enough and long enough to accommodate them. 
Even so, many growers prefer hand harvesting, especially for the most expensive wines. They cite the gentler nature of hand harvesting, which also allows the grower to pick only the best grapes.
The machines are not used at all in Beaujolais because the wine process there uses only full bunches of grapes, which are best picked by hand. Also, many Beaujolais plots are too small to accommodate the ungainly machines.
Wider use of the machines is no doubt inevitable, though, if finding skilled vineyard workers continues to be a problem. The shortage of pickers in France this year can be blamed almost entirely on Western Europe's prosperity. The pay, which is set by the French government, is hardly munificent: 43.87 francs, or about $6, an hour. Usually, food and lodging are included but taxes are deducted.
The work is backbreaking; a picker spends eight hours a day in the sun -- or worse, in the rain -- either bent over and wielding sharp cutters called secateurs, or lugging heavy boxes of fruit through the vine rows. Many quit after a few days. Several growers offer a bonus to those who remain for the entire harvest. 
In the past, skilled pickers followed the harvest, which in France, begins in the southernmost vineyards in August and ends in October in the north.
In the Rhine, in Germany, picking may still be going on in the chill early days of November. 
Many growers complain that France's social costs and burdensome bureaucracy have made grape picking far more costly than it once was. Some are cutting back on meals, and many would prefer to shut down the dormitories where they house pickers.
Francoise Janoueix, an owner of Chateau Haut-Sarpe in St.-Emilion, told Agence France-Presse that the paperwork alone was overwhelming.
"We are obliged to inform the government of every season worker we've hired at least 48 hours before the person is supposed to start work," she said. Even so, Mrs. Janoueix hopes to lure sufficient pickers this year by providing three evenings of entertainment during the harvest period. 
In less complicated times, food and wine were plentiful for the harvesters, and there was an element of fun in the harvest. Each morning, around 10 a.m., a hefty meal called a casse-croute (literally, breaking the crust) was hauled out into the vineyards to fortify the pickers until lunchtime.
Then after dinner, student pickers, who appeared to be exhausted after a day in the vines, would revive miraculously and party far into the night. Foreign pickers, often Spanish Gypsies, would sing and dance for their own entertainment and for the chateau owners and their guests.
Any anthropologist, or any farmer, for that matter, knows that harvest celebrations date back to the beginning of time and that despite meddling bureaucrats and temporary labor shortages, they will go on for a long time to come.
One harvest tradition is the gerbebaude, the final dinner for the pickers. Gerbe originally meant a sheaf of wheat. In the vineyards, it is a bouquet the harvesters present to the owner or his wife at the dinner.
In a memoir, Corinne Guisez, the owner of Chateau Faugeres, in St.-Emilion, remembered last year's gerbebaude.
"Big tables have been set," she wrote. "Zahra has prepared a succulent couscous. Alain is bringing the wine. I arrange the last flowers from the garden. The Portuguese swap addresses with the Moroccans, the policeman asks the accountant out, the Gypsy dances with Laetitia, one of the English girls. 
"Nobody knew one another on the first day, yet today, friendships have been born. There are no more barriers. In the late afternoon, everyone leaves, a bottle in hand and already thinking about returning next year. On Monday we will start the autumn work, preparing the soil for the next harvest. In the fields, life never stops. Wine is life."
There are, of course, only human harvesters at a gerbebaude.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Recipe for a Best Seller: Analogies About Cheese or Anthills or Parenting

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
In researching their new book, David B. Yoffie and Mary Kwak observed judo classes and competitions and interviewed judo masters in the United States. They went to Japan to consult with the experts there. But their book, "Judo Strategy," is not for martial arts enthusiasts. Their target readers are business executives, and the judo lesson they teach is a strategic mind-set.
 Just as a lightweight judo master can defeat a larger opponent, they argue, a small company can challenge giant competitors. The same principles of movement, balance and leverage apply. 
 The cardinal rule of writing a business book these days seems to be: look for management lessons almost anywhere but in the business world itself. Look at sports; look at war; look at science; look at the theater; look at other cultures; look at other eras; look at anthills. They can all be instructive metaphors for running a company or supervising a work force. 
This obsession with analogies has struck a chord among managers, too. Business books are big business, with about 10,000 published in the last three years. A colorful metaphor makes a theory stand out among the crowd.
But using metaphors like judo is not a gimmick, Mr. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor, says. It is a useful way for business theorists to make sense of the changing economy.
In their book, which was published this year by the Harvard Business School Press, Mr. Yoffie and Ms. Kwak cited executives at Palm Computing, before it became Palm Inc., and RealNetworks. They were well practiced in judo strategy, even if they did not call it that until the authors came along.
"Metaphors can be great motivational tools because they are usually easy to understand and hard to forget," Mr. Yoffie writes in his book.
Then again, some employees would like to forget. Scott Adams, creator of the Dilbert comic strip, receives hundreds of e-mail messages from workers about the latest management fads to hit the cubicles. Recently, most of the rants concern a certain best-selling parable about mice and their meal.
"The thing that is annoying people the most is the 'Who Moved My Cheese?' book," Mr. Adams said, referring to the fable by Spencer Johnson and Kenneth H. Blanchard (Putnam, 1998), that many managers have handed out to their employees. "Most people who are complaining to me have already figured out that change happens and that they should get over it."
The taste for business metaphors goes in cycles, Mr. Yoffie says. In the postwar era, the battlefield was the preferred way to envision strategy, and the words of generals from Sun Tzu to Norman Schwarzkopf to George S. Patton to Carl von Clausewitz are still being plumbed for their leadership lessons.
The sports world has also been a popular source for business comparisons, from the late Billy Martin's tales of leadership out of the Yankees dugout to "Coach to Coach: Business Lessons From the Locker Room" (Pfeiffer, 1995), by John Robinson, the football coach at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Mike Krzyzewski, the head basketball coach at Duke University; Joe Torre, manager of the Yankees; and Rick Pitino, the former coach of the Boston Celtics, are also business authors.
The Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton is likewise offered up as a lesson in corporate leadership, while Shakespeare's writings have been the basis for at least three management books. 
Now, business gurus are looking to other fields for inspiration. Like biology. The Bios Group, a company in Santa Fe, N.M., uses the behavior of ants to help analyze resource allocation, supply chains and other systems for major corporations. 
The idea sprang from naturalists' observations of ant colonies, which depend on scout ants to find the fastest route to a food source and lay a trail for others. Bios created mathematical formulas that mimic the ants' paths, and Procter & Gamble, Ford, Unilever and Boeing have all used software based on these "ant algorithms" to streamline their systems. 
If Bios covers biology, then the book by Richard Koch, "The Natural Laws of Business: How to Harness the Power of Evolution, Physics and Economics to Achieve Business Success" (Currency/Doubleday, 2001), should meet just about every college student's requirement for science courses.
Like most management theories, business metaphors have a nugget of truth in them, but backfire when taken too far. "Metaphors have distinct weaknesses," Mr. Yoffie acknowledged. "You have to know when they are useful and when they are not."
Or as Eileen C. Shapiro, a management consultant, says, you need to know what ails you before you look for a cure. 
"They are like a doctor's bag," said Ms. Shapiro, author of "Fad Surfing in the Boardroom" (Addison-Wesley, 1995). "Chemotherapy is a miracle today if you have certain types of cancer," she said. "Would you take that for your migraine? Businesses do the equivalent."
Books that look to other disciplines for management metaphors are part of a broader trend of exploring every corner of human activity for business lessons. Some motivational programs inculcate trust by having a co-worker hold the rope while you scale a cliff, for example. Mark Magnacca, founder of the Insight Development Group, urges participants in his Firewalk Experience seminars to "feel the fire within" before leading them outside to stroll barefoot over hot coals.
"It's not about walking on hot coals," Mr. Magnacca said. "It's about getting to a point where you realize you are ready to break through the fear that's been holding you back from doing what you're capable of doing."
He is writing a motivational business book centered on fire symbolism, but it will have to compete for attention. Walk into a bookstore, and you will see business books based on Aristotle, St. Benedict, "Star Trek," the Tao Te Ching, "The Wizard of Oz" and the Semper Fi way, drawn from the Marines.
Parenting, too, is a lot like running a company. That was the inspiration for the book "Peanut Butter and Jelly Management," (Amacom, 2000), in which Chris and Reina Komisarjevsky extol leadership principles they learned from raising nine children. 
Even if the analogies change, the business principles behind them are seldom new. Darrell K. Rigby, a director of Bain & Company, once counted 900 different management theories in use, and a lot of them are "just old wine in new bottles," he said. 
Even so, in a slowing economy executives are eager for anything that promises them an edge, said Ms. Shapiro, the consultant.
"This is a great time to be slogging a fad," she said. "You've got people who are just whiplashed."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Early Rally Mostly Fades As Tech Shares Stumble

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks tried to stage a robust rally yesterday, but lost momentum in the last hour of trading.
 Wall Street was heartened at first by an upbeat report from the National Association of Purchasing Management that suggested that factory orders and production made a surprising rebound in August. 
 "The markets were so depressed that any little ray of hope was going to lead to a rally," said Stephen J. Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities, an investment bank in San Francisco.
Still, there were only gloomy forecasts from the technology sector, and investors looking to put money into stocks after a long, slow season concentrated their buying on the heavily battered retail and consumer products sectors. Investors' disapproval of the proposed acquisition of Compaq Computer by Hewlett Packard weighed on technology stocks. 
Yesterday's rally dissipated as investors gained "a sense of reality about the midquarter update from Intel on Thursday and a quickly approaching pre-announcement season," said Matthew W. Johnson, a managing director of Lehman Brothers. "The market got defensive in a hurry."
The Dow Jones industrial average benefited in part from a surge in Johnson & Johnson, which rose after one of its medical products received praise from a group of eminent cardiologists. The Dow industrials, which were up more than 200 points during much of the day, ended trading with a gain of 47.74 points, or 0.5 percent, to 9,997.56. It fell 4.5 percent in the last week, and it has now fallen 4.87 percent since Aug. 1 and 9.03 percent since June 1.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index dropped 34.65 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,770.78.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 of a point, to 1,132.94.
"What's important to look at is the number of people that came back from vacation," said Mort Cohen, chairman of Clarion Partners in Cleveland, which manages about $150 million in hedge and venture funds. He was referring to fund managers.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.19 billion, demonstrating greater activity than in recent sessions. The average daily volume in August was 1.03 billion.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its manufacturing index rose to 47.9 in August from 43.6 in July, surpassing forecasts by some Wall Street economists that the index would rise only to 43.9. A reading above 50 would indicate that manufacturing activity is expanding, and it has been more than a year since the index was above that mark. Still, this was the highest reading since November, and the index measures a portion of the economy that suffered first and worst in the economic downturn, so Wall Street received the reading well.
Enthusiasm about the new report was evident in the stocks of such Dow components as Procter & Gamble, up $1.37, to $75.52; International Paper, up 96 cents, to $41.10; and Home Depot, up 87 cents, to $46.82.
But those gains were overshadowed by a 6.2 percent jump in Johnson & Johnson's shares. Researchers told the European Society of Cardiology yesterday that a stent coated with antibiotics, which the company developed, was successful in preventing arterial clogs in a study. Word traveled quickly to Wall Street, where the company's shares gained $3.44, to $56.15.
Johnson & Johnson's surge helped offset a sharp loss by Hewlett-Packard, another Dow component, which fell $4.21, or 18.1 percent, to $19, after it said it planned to acquire Compaq Computer for stock it initially valued at $25 billion. Compaq shares dropped $1.27, to $11.08.
Still, I.B.M., which would remain the largest computer company if that deal is completed, gained $1.54, to $101.49.
Technology stocks, which attempted to ride the rally for much of the trading day, eventually buckled under the weight of a downbeat forecast from Ericsson. Shares of Ericsson fell 97 cents, to $4.01, after the company's executives said their industry, telecommunications, was unlikely to recover next year. Qualcomm fell $4.55, to $54.30.
Shares of Intel, which is developing with Hewlett-Packard a computer server operating system that Compaq also plans to use, fell $1.11, to $26.85. The system will compete with one developed by Sun Microsystems and I.B.M. Shares of Sun fell 50 cents, to $10.95.
Cisco Systems, which introduced a few new products yesterday, fell 56 cents, to $15.77.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Dollar Rallies; Interest Rates Rise Sharply

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Interest rates rose sharply yesterday while the dollar rallied against the euro and the yen after investors were surprised by an unexpectedly strong report on manufacturing.
 But it is too early to tell if the rise in interest rates and the dollar's rally reflect a trend. So, rather than reversing directions, analysts said, interest rates and the dollar will probably trade within a range until the outlook for the economy is clearer. 
 Some analysts said that the rise in the manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management was significant, although it probably says more about the economic slump ending than about where the economy goes from here. 
But the sharpness of the moves in the bond and currency markets could be more a product of the reaction over the manufacturing data and the fact that the end of the summer doldrums and worries about the weakness of the economy had just sent interest rates too low and the dollar down too far.
By the end of last week, the yield on the Treasury's two-year note was down to 3.61 percent, the lowest it had been since the Treasury began selling the securities in 1972. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was 4.83 percent, close to the lowest that it has been since March. The dollar was at 91.19 cents to the euro, after falling 8.3 percent since its high in July.
"I just think the market got caught up in this recession talk," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "These interest rate levels are pushing extremes," he said of the decline of Treasury yields in August.
Referring to the dollar's move against the euro, Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at Fleet Global Markets, said, "It was unbelievably big but should not be perceived as something that will repeat itself anytime soon."
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note jumped to 4.96 percent and the price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 11/32 to 10010/32 . The yield on the two-year note rose to 3.76 percent.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar rose 3.3 percent as the euro was quoted at 88.62 cents. The move against the Japanese yen was much more modest, with the dollar at 119.52, up 0.6 percent from 118.80 yen on Friday.
The news that ignited this dollar rally and bond market sell-off was a report that the manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management rose to 47.9 in August, from 43.6 in July. The increase was the largest since 1996 and well above what Wall Street analysts had forecast.
While bond and dollar investors took this as positive news for overall economic expansion, any number below 50 still indicates that manufacturing is continuing to shrink. James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said that the monthly move "is significant enough that we should respect it."
"I think it is telling you," Mr. Glassman said, "that a huge drag on the economy is fading. But it is not telling you where we are going."
He said that he did not think that the jump in the index meant that the Federal Reserve had finished cutting short-term interest rates in its effort to revive the economy. The central bank has already cut its benchmark rate seven times this year, reducing it to 3.5 percent. Fed policy makers meet again in October.
Although Mr. Glassman said yesterday's bond market move was exaggerated, he added that it might reflect a return to a more balanced view of the economic outlook. 
"We came out of August under a cloud of gloom," he said. "We were getting overly pessimistic. Today maybe we are realizing that the world is not coming to an end."
Mr. DiClemente said "the economy is struggling to stay above water."
"But we have thrown a lot at it in the way of support," he said, including the Fed rate cuts and the $38 billion in tax rebates.
Mr. Fand said that a lot of the dollar buying yesterday came from speculators, including hedge funds, who had made big bets on the dollar falling against the euro. He said that he saw trades coming in at $200 million to $300 million each, which is one reason the dollar made such a big move.
And while he said the gloom about the economic outlook was overdone, he added that the manufacturing report did not signal that the American economy was in a rebound that would send the dollar a lot higher. "There is no reason to believe that the dollar will break the 85-cents-to-92-cents trading range," he said.

HEADLINE: A NEW COMPUTING GIANT: THE VIEW FROM TEXAS; 
Once-Strong Pillar of Houston's Economy Looks Shaky

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
There were few bright spots here during the energy slump of the mid- to late 1980's, when oil prices crashed and shiny new downtown office buildings stood half-empty. At one point, average home prices had dropped by one-fourth, and the joke was that only the seller had to bring a checkbook to real estate closings.
 A big exception back then, however, was Compaq Computer, the company founded after a bull session between engineers at a local dessert restaurant in 1982 that grew into the largest personal computer manufacturer in the nation. While the rest of Houston was buffeted by the weak oil and energy markets, Compaq rose from its headquarters campus in northwest Houston to lead the PC boom of the 1990's. 
 But the last few years brought a humbling role reversal. While Houston's oil and electricity business is booming, Compaq has been stumbling, hurt by a bruising price war with Dell Computer -- which recently took away the title of world's No. 1 PC maker -- and by a general slowdown as investors have concluded that the industry's best growth years are behind it. 
In just the last year, Compaq has eliminated 2,000 jobs in Houston. Now, with the company's acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, Houston is faced with the prospect of losing many more Compaq jobs as the two companies locate their headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., and look for ways to slash $2.5 billion in annual costs.
Today, executives said they would cut 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of the combined work force, assuming the deal closes next year. They did not say where those cuts would take place, but Houston "could bear the brunt" of it, said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In some areas, such as development of server computers, the two companies have a lot of overlap, Mr. Kumar said. "Usually, the surviving entity has the upper hand," he said.
Although unemployment is relatively low in Houston by historical standards, big cuts could be a blow to this city, where Compaq is the third-largest corporate employer, according to the Greater Houston Partnership, with 11,000 employees, behind the energy company Halliburton (nearly 17,000) and Continental Airlines (about 16,000). There are other major employers, including the Memorial Hermann Healthcare System, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and NASA. But Compaq is an important factor in attempts to diversify the region's employment base. 
"Compaq has been very, very important for Houston" and for the city's efforts "to redefine itself and move away from an energy-only image," said Ray Perryman, whose economic consulting firm in Waco, Tex., bears his name. In the mid-to-late 1980's, he said, "they were the bright spot" in the local economy, helping keep the housing market in northwest Houston somewhat stable relative to other parts of town.
Compaq started 19 years ago, when the three founders sketched out a design for an I.B.M.-compatible portable computer on a place mat at a House of Pies restaurant, according to a 1991 article in The Houston Chronicle. The company topped $1 billion in sales after just five years. By the end of the decade, it employed more than 5,000 people here -- a dramatic counterweight to the tough times in real estate, energy and banking.
"They've been the banner, the poster child, for the diversification of our economy," said Jim Kollaer, the president and chief executive of the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's largest business organization. "Things would have been a lot worse" in the 1980's without Compaq, Mr. Kollaer said.
In 1982, the year Compaq was founded, he said, the city's economy was 80 percent dependent on oil; now it is less than 50 percent, in large part because of technology. More than 1,500 programming companies and 225 other types of software developers are now based in Houston, Mr. Kollaer said, saying that a lot of the credit should go to Compaq, which encouraged suppliers and vendors to move here. 
Unemployment in Houston was only 4.2 percent in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, as the oil business and energy-trading industry continue to have a strong year. So Mr. Kollaer predicted the economy would be able to absorb any laid-off Compaq employees.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factories Offer Hints Of Revival 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Manufacturing, the weakest part of the United States economy, began showing signs of improvement last month, according to a survey of corporate executives released yesterday.
 Manufacturers increased their production for the first time since November, and the number of new orders they received rose for the first time in a year. Factories continued to cut jobs last month, though at a slower pace than in July, according to the survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management, a research group based in Tempe, Ariz., that polls 450 manufacturers each month. 
 The association's closely followed index -- which is calculated by combining the answers to 12 questions -- rose to 47.9, from 43.6 in July. The increase was the largest since 1996, although any figure below 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector continues to shrink. 
Investors seemed to take the report as evidence that the broad economy could be on the verge of improving. Stocks surged for a time after the report's release; the Dow Jones industrial average finished the day up 0.48 percent, at 9,997.49. The dollar rose sharply against the euro, and bond prices recorded steep drops. Page C15. 
Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said, "I'm pretty optimistic that we've hit a bottom in manufacturing." But, he added, "the recovery is going to be painfully slow." 
Separately, the University of Michigan reported yesterday that consumers were less optimistic last month about the economy's future. Two-thirds of Americans said the economy was declining, according to the university's monthly poll, and about half thought it would not begin growing at a healthy pace until late next year.
Consumers have cut back on plans to buy new cars, appliances, electronics and other expensive goods, according to Michigan's survey. The big American automobile makers said yesterday that sales had already fallen in recent weeks despite deep discounts the companies were offering.
Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending dipped 0.1 percent in July from the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of $859.4 billion.
Even if economic growth remains meager for the rest of the year, the manufacturing report offered support to those analysts -- a majority -- who are saying that the economy is unlikely to worsen in the coming months.
For more than a year, manufacturers, which employ about one in seven working Americans, have been struggling badly. Sales have fallen as companies drastically cut their spending on new buildings, machinery and software, after deciding that they had been overly optimistic in 1999 and early in 2000. And the strong dollar has effectively lowered the price of imports and caused products made in the United States to become more expensive overseas. 
As a result, the makers of everything from ball bearings to semiconductors have found themselves with more products and workers than they needed, and they have responded by laying off employees, cutting back on production and trying to sell their stockpiles of goods at reduced prices.
Yesterday's report suggested that the manufacturers had begun to make a dent in their problems. Most important, analysts said, orders for new goods rose last month, suggesting that executives were becoming more optimistic about the near future. The new-orders component of the index increased sharply, to 53.1 from 46.3 in July.
When the new-orders figure substantially exceeded 50 in the past, an economic recovery usually followed shortly, said David Orr, chief economist at First Union in Charlotte, N.C..
Companies have been able to order more products and equipment because many have significantly cut their inventories this year. Overall inventory levels, after rising for 35 consecutive quarters through the end of 2000, fell in both the first and second quarters this year, according to the Commerce Department.
"Inventories have gotten so low that even moderate further gains in consumer spending are beginning to generate new orders for manufacturers," Mr. Orr said. "The dynamic the Fed has been counting on is beginning to appear."
The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate seven times this year in an attempt to encourage consumers and businesses to spend money. 
In recent days, the price of a futures contract that follows that benchmark, the federal funds rate, has fallen, and analysts said the manufacturing report would make the Fed less likely to cut the rate again. Based on the futures contract, investors now think there is a roughly even chance that the Fed will cut rates when it meets on Oct. 2; last week, investors thought the odds of another reduction were above 80 percent.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Centers Offer More Than a Benefit Check 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
Ginny Velarde can still recall the snaking lines and pervasive gloom of the state unemployment office she visited weekly for three months in 1970. It was "horrible, horrible, horrible," said Ms. Velarde, who lost her job in the sales office of a manufacturing company when it left New York. "Dismal, depressing, dehumanizing. I don't know how else to say it."
 Last April, Ms. Velarde was out of work again, laid off after 17 years managing a podiatrist's office on the Upper East Side. This time, though, her experience was very different. 
 "I love it," she said of the Queens One-Stop Career Center in Jamaica, which she described as welcoming, user-friendly and efficient. "I've made this place like a second home. From the moment I walked in here I found it to be a pleasant experience." 
In many cities and towns in New York and across the country, the unemployment office's long reign as a despised destination of last resort seems to be coming to an end. This is due in large part to a 1998 federal law, the Workforce Investment Act. 
The new law required states to give any resident -- unemployed or not -- access to a wide array of training, employment and educational services at a single neighborhood location. The changes are expected to be fully adopted in all states within five years.
"The unemployment office of the past is truly a dinosaur," said Emily DeRocco, an assistant secretary for employment and training at the United States Department of Labor in Washington.
Even the name of the once-dreaded offices has changed. They are becoming One-Stop Career Centers, offering job counseling and recruitment; computer training; workshops on resume writing, interviewing and starting a small business; free faxing and Internet access; sometimes even coffee and cookies. And talk at the new centers is only of employment; the "un" prefix is unwelcome.
"We've been working hard to change our image from the unemployment people to the employment office," said Linda Angello, New York State's Labor Commissioner. "There's been a change in philosophy and a change in the way we do business."
Most states have phased out the requirement that recipients show up in person each week to claim unemployment benefits and certify that they are still without a job. The jobless can now call a computerized system that allows officials to retrieve tax records and authorize benefit checks to be mailed. The only required visit is for a five-minute video orientation that explains all the available services.
Last week at the 33,000-square-foot One-Stop in Jamaica, people like Ms. Velarde were there because they wanted to be.
"The orientation was eye-opening," said Ms. Velarde, 55. "I'd worked all my life and didn't know the state had this to offer. I said, 'You know what? Don't be a fool. While you're looking for a job, use the facilities.' "
The new centers are required to provide job-search assistance and information on labor trends, and help both the unemployed and working people who are looking for advanced training or new careers.
The changes do not come without cost. Since the new program began, New York State have spent about $220 million a year on redesigning its job training programs and building the centers with grants from Washington, federal officials said.
The One-Stop concept, although developed during boom times, is expected to do a better job of finding jobs during slumps and recessions than the old unemployment offices, officials said, because the centers now have strong local control and are more efficient.
The new law required states and municipalities to create local Workforce Investment Boards to match the One-Stops to their communities. And most of these boards must be made up of executives from whatever businesses predominate locally.
"We saw in the '91 recession that certain parts of the country were hit harder than others," said Mason Bishop, a special assistant in the Employment and Training Administration of the federal Department of Labor. "Under a recession, this new system allows flexibility for the management of economic issues in a much more local way, and according to local labor market information."
For example, in Austin, Tex., the local board recently opened a special re-employment center in addition to its three One-Stops and four satellite offices to handle the 16,000 high-tech workers who have been laid off since the beginning of the year.
In New York City, which is just beginning to feel that type of economic pain, a task force created in June by its 43-member Workforce Investment Board is preparing a plan to deal with a possible surge in unemployment.
"The system was so flawed before that whatever incremental steps we've already put into effect have helped thousands of people get and keep their jobs," said Stuart M. Saft, a real estate lawyer who is chairman of the city's board. 
Representatives from the nation's 15 largest cities met in Washington to trade ideas, Mr. Saft said, about how to deal with "diverse populations, a multiplicity of languages, large numbers of people coming off public assistance, and other unique problems of large cities."
Los Angeles, for example, decided that it needed 18 centers while smaller states might have only one. San Francisco has three centers and the Chicago area has 17, officials said.
The Queens One-Stop opened just over a year ago, and is a prototype for five more that are to be opened in the city in the next two years. Each borough will have at least one center. Manhattan will have two.
Only a few visitors interviewed at the Queens One-Stop said they had less than positive experiences. Two women who identified themselves only as recent college graduates said they felt the services offered were too basic for their needs.
Complaints have also come from outplacement companies that they are being deprived of millions of dollars in business because the government is assisting laid-off workers in finding new jobs.
Mike Giuffrida, executive vice president of the Association of Career Management Firms International-North America, estimated that his members were losing $18 million to $25 million a year to the One-Stop Centers.
"The act and the regulation that implemented it all say the same thing: the government is supposed to rely on the private sector unless it can provide services more cheaply," he said. "They're supposed to bid this stuff out at the local and state level and they're not doing it. The state is coming in and saying we'll do it for free and as a result our members are losing business all across the board."
The intent of the act was not to create "a government monopoly on employment training programs," said Mr. Bishop of the Labor Department. "The intent was the opposite: to engage partners at the local level, both private and public sector."
"Whenever there is concern from a business that thinks we're trying to take its customers, we sit down with them and talk it through," he said, adding that recourse is also available from state boards, governors' offices and legislators.
Tara Sullivan, 32, who was laid off from CNN Interactive in May, first went to the employment office on West 54th Street in Manhattan and then was directed to several programs at the Queens One-Stop, including a workshop on self-employment and the development of business plans.
"My experience was remarkable," Ms. Sullivan said. "I was very impressed. They treated us like professionals rather than problems. I think the common perception of unemployment services is that they're out to get you, or prevent one from getting money. I think they want to help you get through a period when you're unemployed easily and to make that time a short time."
That is indeed the goal, said Michael Josephson, the manager of the Queens One-Stop. "The whole idea is to get people into jobs without any hassle or runarounds," he said. "We don't want people to feel like, 'Oh no! I've got to go to the Department of Labor and they're going to growl at me.' I want people to leave feeling happy."

HEADLINE: Newark Arena Plan Faces Tough Legislative Fight 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
Two days before a critical committee meeting, the ambitious plans to build a $385 million sports arena in Newark and redevelop the Meadowlands are in the middle of a fierce political struggle that could scuttle the whole project before it ever gets to the full Legislature.
 Members of the 11-member Assembly Appropriations Committee are scheduled to meet Thursday to consider a bill to create a financing mechanism that would allow the two projects to be built. The bill was believed to have broad bipartisan support when it passed the Senate in June. It is enthusiastically backed by Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican. But it has since become an issue in gubernatorial politics, with the Republican nominee, Bret D. Schundler, saying the proposal should not be approved without a popular referendum. 
 Now, there is growing opposition on the Appropriations Committee, which has seven Republicans and four Democrats. Failure of the measure in the committee would likely deter the legislative leadership from calling a special session of the entire Legislature, as planned, to consider the proposals. Without such a special session, efforts to keep the New Jersey Devils and New Jersey Nets, who want a new arena, in the state would have to await action by the next governor and the next Legislature. 
"It will be a victory for the voters and for Bret Schundler if this fails," said Assemblywoman Clare Farragher, Republican of Freehold, one of the seven Republican members of the committee. "Speaking for myself, I am not in favor of it."
At least three other committee members also said they were firmly opposed. One other member said he was opposed with reservations and still another said that he had yet to make up his mind. The seventh Republican member of the committee, Assemblyman Rich Bagger of Westfield, the chairman, could not be reached for comment.
Assemblyman William Payne of Newark, one of the four Democrats on the committee, said that prospects for the measure looked bleak right now, but he said the mere fact that the bill had been introduced and come to the committee suggested that the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, was behind it. 
"In my experience, people seldom buck the leadership in Trenton," Mr. Payne said. "As it stands now I would expect that if Speaker Collins came before the committee to support the bill, those people who are undecided or even opposed would vote for it. But even if he doesn't show up, he has a way of letting people know what he wants."
In recent weeks, aides to Mr. DiFrancesco have said that they have amended the bill to also provide a sports complex at Rowan University in South Jersey as a concession to Mr. Collins and others in that part of the state who were seeking some economic stimulus for their region from the arena deal.
Mr. Collins's position on the measure remained as enigmatic today as it was two weeks ago. While the acting governor's spokesman, Tom Wilson, said that the speaker's role in negotiations leading to the inclusion of a Rowan University sports complex "were well known," a spokesman for Mr. Collins insisted that it would be a mistake to assume that he has made up his mind.
"I think he will await the committee's final version of the bill," said Chuck Leitgeb, the spokesman, who added that at this time there were no plans by the speaker to appear before the committee.
The proposed legislation would authorize the creation of a sports and entertainment district in the area around the planned Newark arena where the proceeds of a 6 percent sales tax expected to be generated by an anticipated increase in economic activity would be used to pay off some $190 million in money borrowed to aid in the construction of the arena.
In addition, the YankeeNets, owners of the Nets and the Devils, would provide $115 million, and would operate the 18,500-seat arena under a 30-year lease. The remainder of the cost, mostly for infrastructure improvements, would be met by the Newark and Essex County governments.
To broaden support for the plan, officials agreed to create a similar taxing district at the Meadowlands site of the current Continental Airlines Arena to finance its demolition and replacement with a Disney-like family entertainment, sports and retail complex.
Privately, some legislative staff members who are close to the speaker said that while he was supportive of economic development efforts for South Jersey, he was not about to "break arms" over the arena legislation. They said that Mr. Collins understood that many of his colleagues were getting polling data showing that their constituents did not like the idea of a Newark arena or the idea of spending money for the projects without a referendum.
"He understands the political side of this and that it has given Schundler an issue," said one close aide. "That's another reason he isn't going to press them on this."

PC Users Are Uninformed About Protecting Privacy
People shop, chat and play online, and look to the Internet for information on health care, for psychological support and even for love. Meanwhile, the technologies for monitoring and analyzing those activities grow more powerful. But when it comes to protecting privacy online, most consumers still do not even know where to start.
 Some companies offer packages for privacy, but they have not had much luck selling them directly to consumers. Privacy, it seems, is something that everybody wants but few want to pay for. Page A1.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Study Details Decline In Spending on Ads

BYLINE:  By Claudia Deutsch 

 BODY:
In another sign that the advertising economy is still struggling, spending by advertisers in traditional media fell 5.9 percent in the first half of 2001 compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, according to CMR in New York, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.
 Ad spending for the first half of this year totaled just under $47.5 billion, compared with $50.4 billion from January through June 2000. 
The medium with the highest percentage decrease was national spot radio, down 22.4 percent, to $1.03 billion from $1.3 billion, followed by spot television, down 14.7 percent, to $7.18 billion from $8.42 billion. The highest increases came in syndicated television, up 5.1 percent, to $1.62 billion from $1.54 billion, and cable television, up 4.6 percent, to $5.52 billion from $5.28 billion. 
 Although General Motors spent the most on advertising in the first half of 2001, CMR reported, at $1.1 billion, it also had the highest percentage decrease among the top advertisers, down 23.5 percent from $1.44 billion. AOL Time Warner had the highest percentage increase among the top advertisers, up 21.9 percent, to $734 million from $602 million.

HEADLINE: Army Meets Recruiting Goal Early and Credits Ad Effort 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
After struggling in the late 1990's to overcome the roaring economy and a stodgy image, the Army said today that it was experiencing its most successful recruiting year since at least 1997, having met its goals for the 2001 fiscal year one month early.
 While the Army used the announcement to boast about its new, much-debated slogan, "Army of One," and the $150 million advertising campaign built around it, experts said other factors were probably more responsible for the improved numbers, particularly the slowing economy. 
 Indeed, the other three services reported today that they were also on track to meet their recruiting goals for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30. And the Air Force said it was having its strongest recruiting year since 1986, though like the Army, it attributed its success to aggressive promotion rather than a tightening job market. 
To dramatize what Army officials described as a major turnabout in their recruiting fortunes, the Army held an elaborate event at the Pentagon today to swear into service its 75,800th recruit of the year: 19-year-old Rodrigo Vasquez III of Karnes City, Tex., who will begin basic training next week.
"A lot of people weren't quite sure that we crazy people were headed in the right direction," the Army secretary, Thomas E. White, said in a news conference. "Well, I tell you, the proof's in the pudding. You either make the numbers or you don't. And we have exceeded those numbers in the Army of One campaign. It's working."
Last year, the Army did not meet its recruiting goal until the last day of the fiscal year. And it missed its goals in the two preceding years: narrowly in 1998, and then badly in 1999, when it fell short by 6,291 recruits. 
The Army attributed those lean years largely to the strong economy siphoning off potential recruits into better-paying jobs. But the run of failures also embarrassed senior Army leaders and spurred much soul searching in the Clinton administration over whether the Army was out of touch with young Americans. 
As a result, the Army last year replaced its advertising firm of 13 years, Young & Rubicam, with Leo Burnett U.S.A. of Chicago. And in January, it dropped its slogan of 20 years, "Be all you can be," in favor of "Army of One," which has become the centerpiece of stylish new advertisements and an elaborate recruiting Web site, goarmy.com.
The new slogan immediately drew sharp criticism from some veterans and military analysts who said it emphasized individualism over collective action. Some analysts also scoffed at the Army for running the spots not just during sporting events, as was typical in the past, but during popular programs like "Friends" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," as well as on MTV and Comedy Central.
"I keep telling the old guys like me who are a little concerned about the nontraditional message that we're not recruiting you," Mr. White said. "So go ask your son or daughter or your grandson or granddaughter what turns them on, and that's where you're going to find the Army."
But some experts expressed doubts about the value of the new slogan and splashy marketing campaign, arguing that economic forces were more significant in determining recruiting results. 
"It was a fortuitous circumstance for the Army that their new slogan came out at the same time that the economy was weakening," said Charles Moskos, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University and an expert on military manpower issues.
Professor Moskos argued that the images of the armed services are shaped far more by current events than by advertising. As an example, he said that during a talk before military recruiters in 1996, he asked whether the audience would rather have their advertising budgets tripled or have Chelsea Clinton join the Army. 
"They unanimously raised their hands for the Chelsea option," he said.
Such arguments have not deterred the services from intensifying their marketing efforts over the past three years. In 1999, the Air Force began running television advertisements for the first time in its history. This year, the Navy tried to update its advertising by featuring a new theme, "Accelerate your life."
And the Marine Corps, which is the smallest service and rarely misses its recruiting goals, started buying advertising on stock cars last year and is preparing to roll out a new, sharply different advertising campaign this year.
Those efforts are clearly paying off, military officials asserted. The Air Force, for instance, met its recruiting goal for the 2001 fiscal year in May, when it signed a contract with its 34,600th recruit. That is the earliest the Air Force has met its annual goal since 1986, Air Force officials said. 
Army officials also attributed their improved recruiting to the goarmy.com Web site, which has featured two-minute video "Webisodes" tracking the boot-camp experiences of six recruits.
But the campaign experienced one public relations setback when a soldier who had been featured in one of the first Army of One commercials, Richard P. Lovett, voluntarily withdrew from a rigorous 24-day screening program for the Special Forces. Army officials said Corporal Lovett plans to try again this fall.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Decrease In Chip Sales 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Zipern (NYT) (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Worldwide sales of semiconductors fell more than 37 percent in July, to $10.86 billion, said a prominent industry trade group yesterday. The quarterly global sales report, from the Semiconductor Industry Association, attributed the slackening to the economic slowdown and excess inventories, but also indicated that highly expected new products could lead to a turnaround by the end of the year. 
"We expect sales of personal computers, communications products and a variety of hand-held devices, including newly introduced digital audio products, will accelerate demand for a broad range of semiconductors," said George Scalise, president of the group, in a statement. July sales in the European market dropped 34 percent from the month a year ago; the Americas market was down 51.2 percent, and the Asia-Pacific market was down 29.7 percent. In the Japan market, sales declined 28.6 percent from last July. More than 90 percent of semiconductor producers based in the United States are members of the industry group. Andrew Zipern (NYT)

HEADLINE: BUSH AND DASCHLE AGREE NOT TO TAP SOCIAL SECURITY 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
The White House and the Senate Democratic leader said today that they had agreed not to tap the Social Security program to pay the government's other bills, an agreement that economists insist is almost certain to be broken this year.
 After meeting with President Bush at the White House, the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said that he had pressed the president to promise not to dip into the Social Security program to make ends meet elsewhere, and that Mr. Bush had agreed. 
 "I was looking simply today for his assurance that we're not going to do that, and he assured me of that," Mr. Daschle said afterward. "We look forward to working with him and seeking his guidance on how we avoid using Social Security." 
The White House did not dispute Mr. Daschle's account of the meeting, which was called to discuss progress on the 13 annual spending bills that Congress is required to complete before the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1.
Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Bush "believes we can fund America's priorities while protecting Social Security, and that is what the president has promised in his budget."
Despite the reassuring words from the president and Mr. Daschle, prominent economists and the Congressional Budget Office say the government will almost certainly be forced to dip into Social Security revenues later this year to cover shortfalls created by the sinking economy and by the $1.3 trillion tax-cut package that Mr. Bush pushed through Congress this year. 
Mr. Bush said today that he was "open-minded" about a Republican proposal that supporters say would quickly raise money for the government through a cut in the capital-gains tax -- but there is almost no chance of passage of the plan in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
The Senate minority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and other Republicans want Mr. Bush to support a reduction in the capital gains tax. The plan's supporters said it would raise huge amounts of money for the government in its early stages, as investors sold off stocks and other holdings to take advantage of the reduced tax.
Democrats have long opposed a cut in the capital gains tax, saying it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy, and they could almost certainly block the proposal through their control of the Senate. Mr. Bush and his economic advisers have been less enthusiastic about the plan than their allies on Capitol Hill and on Wall Street.
Economic projections released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed that at current spending levels, $9 billion would need to be taken from Social Security this year, with billions more diverted out of the retirement program over the next several years. 
The projections did not factor in tens of billions of dollars in military and education spending that Mr. Bush is expected to propose this year, which would suggest that even more money would need to be taken from Social Security to pay the government's bills. Any move to tap Social Security would violate a promise made repeatedly by Mr. Bush and by Congressional leaders during last year's campaign, and both the White House and Congressional Democrats appeared to be maneuvering today to duck blame for a move that is probably inevitable.
Although the use of Social Security revenues for other government programs would pose no threat to current recipients of the government's retirement system, it would be politically perilous and likely to become a divisive issue in next year's Congressional campaigns, especially in House districts where large numbers of voters depend on Social Security checks.
The White House repeated today that President Bush had no intention of tapping the Social Security surplus, which is expected total about $157 billion this year.
"Funding projects out of Social Security is something the president said he wanted to avoid doing, and he pledged not to do," said the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer. He noted that the president had vowed to tap Social Security "only in the case of war or recession."
But later in the day, the president himself appeared testy when he was repeatedly questioned by reporters during a photo session over whether he would promise to veto bills that would require the use of the Social Security surplus elsewhere in the budget.
"I can say definitely every Social Security recipient is going to get their check, and that's what the American people need to understand," he said, refusing to answer the question directly. "I understand how politics works up here. There's always that scare tactic, trying to tell the American people that the budget process is going to lead them to not get their Social Security check. That's just ridiculous."
Asked again if he would veto bills that required tapping Social Security, he snapped, "I addressed your question."
Mr. Daschle has blamed Mr. Bush's tax-cut package for the disappearance of the government's non-Social Security surplus, and he said today that Mr. Bush would be responsible for finding a way of balancing the budget without dipping into Social Security.
"This is the president's budget, and we're looking to him for his guidance on how we do that," he said. "The Democrats are going to stay within the budget we have been given. We didn't agree to that budget, but we have lived within it so far."
According to the economic projections released last week by the Congressional Budget Office, it would be virtually impossible for Mr. Bush to preserve all the Social Security surplus without abandoning his plans for an $18 billion jump in the Pentagon's budget this year or without proposing sharp cuts in politically popular domestic programs.
Mr. Bush also met separately today with Mr. Lott, the Senate Republican leader, to discuss the appropriations process on Capitol Hill. And during a brief meeting with reporters as he began the session, Mr. Bush opened the door slightly to the proposal by Mr. Lott and others to balance the budget through a cut in the capital gains tax.
"I'm open-minded," he said. "I agree with the assessment that a capital gains tax would pile up some revenues early in the process." But Mr. Bush suggested that any proposal should wait until we "take a good look-see to make sure that the stimulus package that we're now implementing works."

HEADLINE: Staying Alive in a Crowded Race; 
Upside of Term Limits: Campaign Feels, Well, Democratic

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
On July 30, Heyward Dotson, a City Council candidate in District 7 in Manhattan, learned that he would not be on the primary ballot because of a flaw in his nominating petitions. He was reported to be distraught.
 At a candidates' forum the next night, a man identifying himself as Mr. Dotson's campaign manager announced that the candidate had died. Some who were present recall mention of a heart attack; others, a description of Mr. Dotson being carted out in a body bag. There was consternation. A moment of silence. Sympathetic speeches. The dispatch of flowers and condolence cards. And the news, a few days later, that Mr. Dotson was not dead at all. 
 A hoax? A tragicomic misunderstanding? The evidence is inconclusive. Mr. Dotson said that he had retreated to his mother's house in Staten Island after being disqualified, and returned home to learn he was dead. 
Then, as if one resurrection were not enough, a State Supreme Court judge restored him to the ballot for the election on Tuesday. "I survived," he said, not specifying to which of his comebacks he was referring.
The saga added even more color to a race already saturated with it. District 7 is sprawling and diverse, stretching from 123rd to 218th Street, covering Manhattanville, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights and Inwood -- and it has a field befitting it. There are 10 Democrats on the primary ballot, so many that candidates start staking out subway stops at 6:30 a.m. because there are barely enough to go around.
The district, which, with its layers of history, its immigrant enclaves and its evolving ethnic and economic mix, could represent a microcosm of the city. There are an estimated 53,537 African-Americans, probably the district's largest voting bloc, living in housing projects, freshly renovated brownstones and everything in between. In Washington Heights and, increasingly, in West Harlem, there is a large Dominican population. An estimated 47 percent of the district's 162,232 residents are Hispanic (although just over 4,000 Hispanics appear to have voted in the last primary, according to an analysis conducted by the campaign of Daryl G. Bloodsaw).
In Inwood and Washington Heights, there are Irish-Americans and Orthodox Jews, along with a growing number of gays, artists and actors (not to mention gay artists and actors). There are more whites moving to West Harlem (although there are fewer whites in the district as a whole since 1990), the vestiges of a Cuban population and the beginnings of a Russian colony.
The district will be selecting a new councilman for the first time since the 1978 election of Stanley E. Michels, who cannot run again because of the city's new term-limits law. Mr. Michels opposed term limits, and he concedes that his district has yielded an abundance -- some say an overabundance -- of candidates with records of activism and achievement. "Very good people," he said.
State Senator David Paterson called it "a great race -- a classic," and added, "It is exactly what term limits was designed to create."
Indeed, the upside of term limits is evident in the energy and enthusiasm of the candidates: each one believes success is possible. (And there are no polls that say otherwise.) Maybe because of that wide-open feeling, and because many of the candidates know each other, the race has a cozy, democratic feel. And since the Council primary will probably draw at most 15,000 votes, personal contacts -- made by knocking on doors, visiting street fairs or cruising stoop-sitters at night -- might matter a great deal.
This is making for some exhausted candidates. "Sprawling is not the word," said one of them, Jackie Rowe-Adams, of the district's size. "Out of control is the word."
It was not that way when Mr. Michels was first elected. But when the Council map was redrawn in 1990, District 7 was stretched like Gumby. The end result had the shape of an ungainly lobster, with one claw oversized and the other emaciated.
Mr. Michels, who is white, said the district had been reconfigured to enable a black candidate's election. "I fooled them," he said.
But this year, a black candidate may have the edge. That would be Robert Jackson, a field services director for the New York State Public Employees Federation, a tenant leader, and a school board president. But he is best known as the lead plaintiff in the successful lawsuit brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity against the state to secure more money for city schools. He is in a district with some of the city's most crowded schools, making education his campaign's focus.
Mr. Jackson was hand-picked as a candidate by Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, the Manhattan Democratic leader, well before the lawsuit was won. Mr. Farrell is managing the campaign's details, even designing posters and mailings. As a result, the other candidates are referring to Mr. Jackson as the machine candidate.
Mr. Jackson's reply: "I'm no one's yes person. I'm an independent person who works collaboratively."
Mr. Jackson has some important endorsements, including, in recent days, Mr. Michels, who had been thought to be tacitly backing another candidate, Mark D. Levine; and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president.
But he is no shoo-in. There are plenty of other viable contenders, including Mr. Levine, who founded a community-based credit union in Washington Heights that has made hundreds of loans and last year expanded to a second branch in West Harlem. Mr. Levine has made economic development his main issue.
He is one of two candidates who show how Council races can become big-money races. He has raised $110,174, 14th out of all candidates citywide. His contributions include $2,500 apiece from Courtney Love, Gwyneth Paltrow, David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Edward Norton, a childhood friend. 
He has also raised a significant amount from his hometown of Columbia, Md., for a total of $58,005 from out of the city.
The other big-money candidate is Mario A. Torres, a vice president at the Battery Park City Authority, where he has helped female and minority-owned businesses gain access to the authority's contracting opportunities. He has raised $89,681, including a significant amount from construction and real estate businesses, but has also returned some $10,000 in contributions. Still, he has raised enough -- including $32,689 from out of the city -- to place 28th out of all Council candidates.
Mr. Torres, whose campaign pledges included everything from more computers in schools to more money for the district's parks, comes across as a political professional, complete with a press secretary. He officially began his campaign with a catered affair, with wine and beer, at the Dyckman Marina, and rented a bus to bring up residents of the Grant Houses to thank them for supporting his petition drive.
Daryl G. Bloodsaw, an advertising and marketing executive, has not raised much money, but has a cadre of zealously dedicated, mostly female, volunteers. He has made West Harlem's drug problem -- it is widely considered the cocaine wholesaling center of the Northeast -- the central issue of his campaign. In February, he organized a "state of emergency" summit about the drug problem with elected officials that is credited with helping to spark a police crackdown in recent months.
Mr. Jackson, Mr. Levine and Mr. Bloodsaw are the only candidates to receive matching funds from the city so far, meaning that they met the requirement of raising a total of $5,000 from 50 voters in their district.
More candidates: Tony Spencer has been active in West Harlem/Hamilton Heights for about 30 years. He is New York City Director of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, and a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard. He, too, sees the drug trade as a major issue. "I love Stanley and think he did a wonderful job," he said of Mr. Michels, "but he didn't grab this before it got out of hand."
Victor Armando Bernace graduated from Harvard Law School, taught high school in the Bronx, and now runs a law practice helping mostly Dominican cabdrivers resolve traffic disputes. He put $7,500 of his own money into the race.
Mr. Dotson was the first Rhodes Scholar from Staten Island and a star basketball player at Columbia University. He worked for Alan G. Hevesi and Assemblyman Keith Wright, and describes himself as "the only pro-tenant candidate in the race," saying the district is facing a crisis of affordable housing.
Jackie Rowe-Adams is the only woman in the race. She is a former community board and school board member and works as recreation manager for Jackie Robinson and Morningside Park, which she says she took "back from the drug dealers." She called herself "the people's candidate."
Michael Hughes is a reporter for the Washington Heights-Inwood Report, who looks and talks as if he is an old-time policeman. "I've been here 44 years, during the gangs and the drugs in the 70's and the crack epidemic," he said. "It makes me step back to see these guys coming in now that crime's down -- now their biggest issue is cars double parking and dogs barking." Pedro Morillo, another candidate, did not return a reporter's phone call.
Most of these candidates are pointing to their biographies along with their records. Mr. Bernace told of his experiences in foster care and as the child of a welfare mother. Ms. Rowe-Adams described losing two sons to urban violence. Mr. Levine's literature features his Puerto Rican wife, while Mr. Hughes frequently mentions that his wife is of Caribbean descent. Robert Jackson volunteers that his campaign director is a white woman.
Daryl G. Bloodsaw, meanwhile, was Daryl G. Barnes until a few years ago. He said he changed his name to honor his mother.
The candidates have been collegial, even complimentary, toward each other. But occasionally the gloves have come off. When the announcement of Mr. Dotson's death was made, Mr. Bernace rose to say that Mr. Dotson had been removed from the ballot because the "Democratic machine" challenged his petitions, and that Mr. Dotson had been devastated.
The machine, Mr. Bernace said, had killed him.
A resuscitated Mr. Dotson, in turn, implied that the county organization had helped spread the false rumors of his demise.

HEADLINE: Today's Special? Discounts All Around 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
IN the heyday of New York restaurants -- which faded something like the day before yesterday -- there was often that tendency to beg just a little. You might turn on your most charming telephone voice to negotiate a reservation, for instance. Or act just a little too grateful for small favors in the dining room.
 Being allowed into the place at all (with just an hour's wait at the bar) was a privilege. Courteous, prompt service was a gift. A visit from the chef? Wonderful. And did that little repast cost less than a week's salary? A bargain. 
 Anyway, if you didn't take advantage of all this treasure, you were sure someone else was right behind you who would. And that wasn't paranoid -- it was often true. 
But, my fellow diners, the tables have turned. With the general economic regression, competition from new places opening on every corner and the growing fear of a catastrophic dining slump in this restaurant metropolis, many of the once confident culinary establishments are now the ones doing the pleading. To keep those tables filled, they're trying everything from newfound graciousness to gimmicks that would seem familiar on supermarket coupons.
A number of restaurants are offering special menus designed to be less expensive, there are more straightforward discounts on dinner these days, free or cheap wine is increasingly common, and as part of the meal deal there might even be savings on completely unrelated products, like 10 percent off at a music store.
Promotions are nothing new in the restaurant business, of course. What's dazzling now is the pervasiveness of the marketing ploys, the sheer creativity of some of them, and the candid admissions that they are being driven by a deepening anxiety in a city that may have opened more restaurants than it can handle, especially in the current business climate.
Alan Stillman, the chairman of the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, never a stranger to the world of promotion, is pegging the price of Friday's lunch in all his group's restaurants to the Nasdaq close on Thursday, and offering Champagne with dinner at the Manhattan Ocean Club.
At some restaurants, the uninitiated may not immediately recognize how much the establishment is willing to sacrifice: the $65 two-course lunch at Alain Ducasse is less than half the going rate for the standard lunch. And the discount lunch includes wine.
Several months ago, Strip House began offering a low-price Sunday evening wine list. Peter Glazier, an owner, said the promotion would be introduced in his other restaurants, Monkey Bar and Michael Jordan's: The Steak House, at the end of the month.
"Restaurants are losing 12 to 15 percent right now," Mr. Glazier said. "You have to find new sources of revenue. That's why we're starting to serve breakfast at Jordan's and we're turning the retail shop into a lounge." 
At Chicama in the Flatiron district, Douglas Rodriguez is setting up a frequent-diner discount and rebate program with a special membership card. At Union Pacific in the Flatiron district, where tasting dinners can cost $155, Rocco DiSpirito, the chef and co-owner, is also taking aggressive steps. "I want this place to represent more than just special-occasion dining," he said. "There are several Off Broadway theaters around here, so I'm adding a two-course pretheater dinner for $45, and I'm hoping to set a slightly less formal tone."
You could call it a classy version of the early-bird special. 
Other restaurateurs, not just in New York, have joined a discount reservation service. Dinner Broker, a company that went online about a year ago (www.dinnerbroker.com) with a system of off-peak restaurant discounts (and also the flip side, surcharges for hard-to-get prime-time reservations), now has about 300 restaurant accounts in more than 36 American cities, and in Toronto, Vancouver and London. 
"When we started, about two-thirds of our business was for the premium reservations, but it's changed and now about 80 percent of it is discounts," said Ben Dehan, the chairman. 
The special $20.01 lunches -- a promotion that began in New York with $19.92 lunches in 1992 -- have stretched summer-long. This year, 42 places will continue the lunches through December, double the number that offered them until the end of the year last year. Boston began a similar promotion this summer. The complete list of New York restaurants offering the lunch special is available from the Convention and Visitors Bureau, 810 Seventh Avenue, or from www.nycvisit.com.
For many of the top restaurants, and those with a loyal neighborhood clientele, making sure that the customers are happy may be enough. But these days, across the board, restaurateurs have recognized that they can't afford to sit on their laurels. As Mr. Dehan put it, "the most expensive thing in a restaurant, for the restaurateur, is an empty table."
Here are some special promotions.

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
The debate over airport runways continues as readers respond to proposals by Delta's chief.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
This is the second installment of comments from readers responding to Leo F. Mullin, chief executive of Delta Air Lines. In an interview in an earlier column, Mr. Mullin had insisted that the best way to deal with mounting airport delays and congestion was to build 50 miles of new runways at major airports.
 "THERE is no passenger-capacity crisis at the nation's airports," contended Joe Brancatelli, who writes an outspoken online travel column for Biztravel.com. 
 "The problem is an aircraft problem," he said. "Airlines continue to add more flights using smaller aircraft, and then they expect the American people to pay for their arrogance -- in which they push smaller planes through an overtaxed hub-and-spoke system."
Gerald Rothstein added: "Smaller planes have been substituted for larger ones on virtually all routes. When airline managers ignore the effects of this on congestion and just blame the government -- and neighborhood activists opposed to airport expansion -- they are just trying to deflect the blame from themselves."
Joseph E. Illick of San Francisco objects to airports gobbling up more land. "Leo F. Mullin's attitude toward airport expansion -- it must happen, no matter what the human and environmental cost, because the economy demands it -- reflects not only an arrogant stance toward humanity and the environment, but a narrow-minded view of what constitutes the economy," he said. "Mr. Mullin likens the air transport system of today to the rail system of a century ago. And look what has happened to the railroads. Is it not possible that 100 years hence our progeny will see abandoned airstrips?"
Don Carlson asked: "Where is it written that airline profits take precedence over the interests of people who are affected by the 50 miles of new runways he wants to build across the country? No, thanks, Mr. Mullin. I'm a business traveler, but I don't want the public to pay your price for my convenience."
Karen McClellan, vice president of the aviation division for the Institute for International Research, offers some encouragement for Delta's boss.
"It is refreshing to see a C.E.O. be articulate in what needs to happen to increase airport capacity," she said, adding that other solutions include perhaps increasing "airspace capacity" by revising current standards for keeping planes five miles apart, as well as using new technologies that enable closer takeoffs and landings.
John Heilner, a travel management consultant, said, "The solution involves aggressive use of peak, off-peak pricing of flights." He suggested that "significant differentials" of 25 to 50 percent in landing fees be imposed for peak hours at high-volume airports, for a trial period. "Savings on off-peak flights must be large enough to motivate a change in behavior and a shift in demand to these flights," he said.
Eric Oddleifson of Cohasset, Mass., suggested that "the polluters (i.e., the airlines) pay for the damage they will inflict" in increased noise and in decreased property values for people living near airports. "There are 65 million people affected by jet noise and emissions pollution" living in areas where jet noise ranges from significant to severe, he said. 
Meanwhile, he welcomes an emerging "new paradigm" involving increased use by businesses of small aircraft that carry six to eight passengers and fly among lesser used regional airports. "These aircraft are quiet, efficient, and utilize the 3,000 existing airports," rather than just the 25 major hubs where congestion is centered, he said.
James Fallows, the author of "Free Flight: From Airline Hell to a New Age of Travel" (PublicAffairs, 2001), said that the proposal for major runway additions "illustrates the limit the airline system is unavoidably hitting." He added, "It is fundamental to the airlines' pricing model that traffic be concentrated in hubs," which accounts for a disproportionate increase in congestion at major airports.
Laying down ever more runways is "politically unrealistic and conceptually weak," he said. As he did in his book, Mr. Fallows contended that novel aircraft designs advanced by NASA and others will usher in a new aviation era in which small, efficient and cheap corporate and owner-operated jets will help alleviate hub congestion by acting as "air taxis" with vastly expanded use of smaller regional airports. 
James Trunzo, an architect in Boca Raton, Fla., argued that "short-term patches," like building more runways, simply added to the "confused mess we call airports today." 
"There is a complete failure to integrate transportation systems -- that is, all of the cars, trucks, buses and trains that should ideally flow seamlessly and efficiently in your travels," he said. "Is it unreasonable to ask for organization and simplicity of purpose to all that concrete and glass?" he asked of airports, calling for smarter "big picture" planning focused on a "fully integrated model" incorporating the "entire surrounding transportation infrastructure," rather than the mere "piling on" of more runways.
Mark Brennan of New York wrote: "Building more runways sounds like a good solution until one recognizes that the real problem is that runways today (and presumably those to be added in the future) are not allocated economically. We have heavy demand for runways because the price of using one is the same regardless of whether I land on it by myself in a private plane, or a 747 with 400 passengers uses the same strip."
The problem will persist, he said, "until we charge usage fees for runways" by "auctioning off the landing rights" to the highest bidders.
Baylor Lancaster of New York objected to Mr. Mullin's comment that runway construction needs to take the same priority over neighborhood opposition as highway construction often does. Runway expansion, like highway expansion, will only lead to more traffic, she said, offering the notorious snarls of the highways in Atlanta, Delta's home, as an example. 
"Besides, if the number of runways were increased, where exactly does Mr. Mullin propose parking all those extra planes once they've landed?" she asked. "You can be sure Mr. Mullin would be back in your column arguing for larger terminals soon after the new runways were finished, no doubt causing additional 'community disruption.' "
Dan Woog of Westport, Conn., took issue with estimates cited by Mr. Mullin and others that domestic air traffic will necessarily grow to a billion a year from the current 680 million. "There are only a million or so variables that could come into play, ranging from a stunning rise in videoconferencing (and no, not with today's technology), to a global recession," he wrote.
James Baird accused airline executives of a "tradition of poor planning" and suggested they get on a plane and visit countries like Japan that have adapted to worse runway shortages than ours. 
"Tokyo, one of the world's largest metro areas with over 25 million people, is served by two airports with a total of three runways," he said. "Take-off delays are minimal," he added, because "virtually all aircraft are wide-bodies" big planes like 747's that carry 500 passengers. 
Though Amtrak conceded recently that its nearly year-old experience with high-speed rail between new York and Boston has had disappointing results, fully integrated rail systems work well elsewhere, Mr. Baird said, adding, "Short distances, 300 miles or less, are efficiently supplemented by high-speed rail."

HEADLINE: Detroit's Big Three May Shuffle as Chrysler Struggles 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
General Motors. Ford. Toyota?
 The overseas assault on Detroit's Big Three continued yesterday as the Chrysler Group reported that its August sales fell 24 percent from the year-earlier period. That surprised analysts and led some to wonder if the continuing sales gains by Toyota Motor would lead it to become the nation's third-largest automaker, vaulting past Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler. 
 "It seems inevitable that this is going to happen," said Stephen J. Girsky, a Morgan Stanley analyst. "You'll have to redefine the Big Three as G.M., Ford and Toyota." 
Chrysler's sharp sales decline came as the auto industry reported overall sales in August at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.4 million vehicles, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich.
While that shows a slowdown from the surprisingly strong first half of the year and the record pace of last year, analysts and economists say it is still historically strong. The industry is on pace to have its third-best sales year. But, they add, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler are likely to continue to struggle as foreign automakers flood the sports utility vehicle market.
Diane C. Swonk, chief economist for Bank One, said the industry sales number was evidence that American consumers were resilient. But domestic automakers, she said, have something to worry about.
Since Chrysler became a unit of DaimlerChrysler in 1998, it has been losing market share. Last November, Daimler sent Dieter Zetsche, a top German executive, to take over as Chrysler's chief executive to stem the losses. In the first half of this year, the company lost about $1.3 billion as his turnaround plan began. 
Though all of the Big Three have suffered this year, Ford and G.M. held up better against the gains foreign brands like Toyota, Lexus and BMW made in sport utility vehicles in August. G.M. reported a 7 percent decline in overall sales, but an increase of 7.1 percent in light trucks, which includes S.U.V.'s. Ford reported a 7.5 percent decline in overall sales, but only a 1.5 percent drop in light trucks. 
Chrysler, meanwhile, had a market share of 11.3 percent of the United States vehicle market in August, according to a projection by David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase. By comparison, Toyota has 10.9 percent of the American market. Most analysts said that the August margin between the two was the slimmest yet seen. "If I look back over history, I can't find a market share that low for at least a decade," said Mr. Bradley, referring to Chrysler. "It's pretty bad."
For the year, through August, Chrysler has a 13.5 percent market share of the United States car and truck market, according to a projection by Gary Lapidus, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. Toyota has a 10.1 percent market share. That represents a full percentage point decline for Chrysler compared with the first eight months of last year, and a full percentage point increase for Toyota.
"I find them disconcerting," Mr. Lapidus said of Chrysler's declining market share. "The numbers are pointing up for Toyota and down for Chrysler."
The sales figures "don't thrill us, by any means," said Christine Cortez, a vice president for sales and marketing for the Chrysler Group. Ms. Cortez said there were two factors that mitigated the August sales slump. 
In August 2000, sales were unusually high because Chrysler was trying to sell its excess supply of minivans at reduced prices. And this August, it had fewer older-model Ram pickup trucks to sell because it had been readying a new model for the fall.
But analysts said that could not explain all of the declines. The company's sport utilities, which fell 27 percent, were hit hard. Though Chrysler has made some inroads with its new Jeep Liberty, sales of the Grand Cherokee were off 40 percent compared with August 2000. 
"We have so many new competitors," Ms. Cortez said. "We have so much going on in that segment."
At Toyota, sales jumped 7.2 percent in August, including a 23.6 percent increase in sales of light trucks like the Tacoma pickup and the Highlander sport utility vehicle.

Don't Count On It

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
In the 1970's and 1980's one often read about remote mountain villages where people stayed healthy and vigorous into their 90's, with some individuals reaching extraordinary ages. How did people in these simple, traditional societies achieve such longevity? 
 The answer, it turned out, was that people in simple, traditional societies aren't very good at counting. There were some quite old people in those villages, but they weren't as old as they thought they were. Of course, one reason people were vague about their ages was that in their societies nothing important hinged on getting the numbers right. 
 In one respect, the story of our vaunted "new economy" is similar. In the last few years of the 1990's the data just kept getting better, culminating in an estimated 5 percent growth rate for real G.D.P. in 2000 -- not an unusual growth rate for a poor country playing catch-up, or for an economy recovering from a recession, but amazing for an advanced economy late in an economic expansion. How did we do it?
The answer, it seems, is that we weren't very good at counting. Last month's revision by government statisticians marked down U.S. growth rates in each of the last three years, with the biggest markdown for 2000. At 4.1 percent growth was good, but not as good as we thought it was. 
But there's one difference between us and the villagers: In our society numbers matter a great deal, and fuzzy math can have nasty consequences.
It's clear in retrospect that we shouldn't have taken the original estimates of economic growth too seriously. Anyone who has looked at how economic statistics are constructed knows that they are based as much on educated guesswork as on hard facts. And the guesswork gets more speculative as the economy's center of gravity shifts away from solid, physical products to more ethereal stuff; the biggest item in last month's revision involved a reduction in estimates of business investment in software.
Nonetheless, people who should have known better treated the estimated growth rates as solid data, and in particular took to heart their apparent message that the best was yet to come. According to the figures, the U.S. economy wasn't just growing fast, it was growing at an accelerating pace. And if that continued, all of our worries about the long run -- about the burdens of providing pensions and health care to an aging population -- would simply melt away in the face of a red-hot economy. 
Chief among the what-me-worriers was none other than Alan Greenspan. His crucial January testimony in favor of big tax cuts began with a paean of praise for the productivity revolution, "the key factor driving the cumulative upward revisions in the budget picture," and cited with approval long-term projections of an "on-budget surplus under baseline assumptions well past 2030." Seven months later the productivity estimates had been revised downward, and the on-budget surplus was gone.
Mr. Greenspan is still optimistic about long-run growth, as are many other people; they argue that a productivity revolution driven by information technology has decades to run. I would respectfully submit, however, that these optimists have no idea what they are talking about. I don't mean that they're necessarily wrong; I mean that history has repeatedly made fools of people who try to predict future technological developments, let alone the implications of those developments for long-term economic growth. 
And most of the mistakes have been in the same direction. Since the 1960's, futurists have consistently overestimated the future rate of technological progress and economic growth. (Rent "2001: A Space Odyssey" or read Herman Kahn's "The Year 2000" if you don't believe me.) The only major upside surprise was the productivity surge from 1995 to 2000 -- and that, it turns out, was partly a figment of our statistical imagination. 
So how should our society conduct itself now that the recent past is not what it used to be? Any villager could tell you the answer: Hope for good news but don't count on it. That is, don't commit yourself to tax cuts and spending promises you may not be able to afford.
But of course we have already made those commitments. So the question becomes, will our leaders ever admit that they made a mistake, that we may not be able to afford the full tax cut after all? And the answer is obvious: We should live so long.

HEADLINE: Kim Struggles As Ministers Quit in Seoul 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
As President Kim Dae Jung struggled to rebuild his government after a mass cabinet resignation, it appeared today that the big loser may have been his "sunshine policy" toward North Korea, the outstretched hand that is widely admired overseas but increasingly derided at home.
 Overseas, Mr. Kim is known for winning the Nobel Peace Prize after he visited Pyongyang last year in an attempt to bridge a half-century of enmity on the Korean Peninsula. But at home, his popularity has withered on the vine, falling in opinion polls from 80 percent in the hopeful days of the Pyongyang summit meeting to below 20 percent today. 
 Plagued by economic worries, South Koreans say they are fed up with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, who accepted food aid but then cut off the family reunification visits that began last year after the summit meeting, and who demands free electricity but has refused to fulfill promises on opening north-south road and rail links. Most galling, the North Korean leader has yet to reciprocate Mr. Kim's gesture with a visit to South Korea.
"The sunshine policy is failing, because the government just pushes money into North Korea," Chang Sung Hee, an assistant marketing manager, said here today. "It seems that North Korea just gets what it wants. While South Korea keeps giving this money, in the end we are getting nothing. We feel really dumb and stupid."
In March, South Korean officials were angered when President Bush appeared to pull the rug out from President Kim at a joint news conference in Washington. Mr. Bush expressed skepticism that North Koreans would live up to international pacts and said that the negotiation policy was under review.
Afterward, the North suspended all official contacts with the South.
Six weeks ago, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on a visit here that the administration backed the sunshine policy, adding that the United States was prepared to meet the North Koreans "anywhere, at anytime" with "no preconditions."
Washington and Pyongyang have not yet held high-level meetings. 
As weeks turned into months, President Kim looked increasingly desperate as he virtually begged the North Korean leader to come on down for a visit. Although the North Korean leader had the time this year for a trip to China and a 24-day train tour of Russia, he has not had time for Mr. Kim, a liberal politician who staked his career on the opening to the North.
On Sunday, the North Koreans apparently realized that they had overplayed their hand as the South Korean National Assembly prepared to vote a motion of no confidence in Unification Minister Lim Dong Won, point man for the sunshine policy. In a clumsy last-minute move, North Korean officials wrote a letter to Mr. Lim saying that after a six-month hiatus they were ready to talk again.
It was too late. On Monday, President Kim's critics rode a wave of skepticism and won an overwhelming vote of no confidence.
The vote fractured President Kim's parliamentary majority and prompted all cabinet ministers and senior staffers to submit resignations. Today, a presidential spokesman said a new cabinet would be announced by the end of the week.
But the crisis, growing as politicians are gearing for the presidential race in December 2002, makes President Kim look like a lame duck before his time. In South Korea, a president cannot run for re-election.
"He is kind of stunned," said Park Nei Hei, dean of business at Sogang University. "I don't think he can push as hard as he used to. He will have lots of trouble with every issue he faces." 
From sidewalks to editorial columns today, the criticism largely centered on anger over the stalled sunshine policy.
"We give too much," said Cheol Soo Kim, manager of a paper company. "We don't have any results after three years of talks. Only 200 family members made reunification visits."
Support is eroding for aid to the North as South Koreans watch their economic growth rate slide, hitting 2.7 percent for the second quarter of the year compared with 9.7 percent in the same quarter last year.
"Kim Jong Il should have honored his promise to make a return visit before the post-summit euphoria cooled down in the South," The Korea Herald editorialized this evening. "He should not have exploited President Kim's vision and good will."
The sunshine policy is not dead, President Kim pledged today. "I will push forward with the sunshine policy without being distracted," he said at a luncheon here.
"I will make efforts to improve North-South Korean relations and North Korea-U.S. relations," he said, referring to a meeting here next month with President Bush. South Koreans hope that by visiting this modern capital, within easy range of North Korean artillery, Mr. Bush will be impressed by the importance of negotiating with the North.
With the North Koreans now talking again about talking, Seoul is widely expected to respond in a few days with a formal proposal to resume cabinet-level talks.
The effort to normalize relations on the peninsula received a big boost today from President Jiang Zemin of China, who arrived on Monday in North Korea. Mr. Jiang is the first Chinese head of state to visit the secretive country in 11 years.
According to the New China News Agency, Mr. Jiang urged his North Korean counterpart to improve relations with the United States and Japan, saying China would "support all rational proposals to this end." Mr. Jiang also discussed sharing electricity and food aid to North Korea, a country where poor weather and Communist farming practices contributed to widespread hunger that might have killed up to two million people in the 1990's.
In Beijing today, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Kim Jong Il would be welcome to attend the meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders next month in Shanghai. 
But the short-term window for working with South Korea may be this fall. After the presidential campaign season starts in January, a visit by the North Korean leader could quickly spiral into a partisan issue. And a victory by the conservative opposition party, the Grand National Party, could signal a change of course for relations with the North.
"The time factor is critical," Mr. Park, the university dean, said of President Kim. "People already call him a lame-duck president."

HEADLINE: Rivals Covet Giuliani's Crime Data, Not His Ways 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gets mixed reviews from many of the men who want his job, but not when it comes to crime. All six major candidates have acknowledged his crime-fighting prowess. Yet even as they assure voters that they will retain successful anticrime strategies, the Democratic candidates on the Tuesday primary ballot are outlining tactics that differ sharply from Mr. Giuliani's approach.
 Mr. Giuliani funneled more than $80 million a year into a program known as Operation Condor, which pays officers to work a sixth day in a week. Several candidates have called it a waste of money. 
 The mayor's police commanders often de-emphasized neighborhood beat patrols in favor of putting specialized units in high-crime areas. Several candidates have said they would reverse that policy. 
Aggressive street units that stopped and searched people in hopes of finding career criminals or illegal guns were viewed by the Giuliani administration as an essential enforcement tool. Several candidates have said the units were overused and often used racial profiling in deciding whom to stop.
In fact, in matters of both substance and tone, many aspects of the crime plans put forward by the Democrats bear little resemblance to those pursued by Mr. Giuliani. On the Republican side, both Michael R. Bloomberg and Herman Badillo have said they will largely continue Mr. Giuliani's program, aside from a minor tweak here or there.
"This election," Mr. Badillo said in an interview, "is about whether we want to continue the progress that the city has made under Giuliani or whether we want to go back to the situation as it was in 1992."
As Democrats often note, crime began to dip in the Dinkins administration, but the decline accelerated greatly under Mr. Giuliani and now stands at a 30-year low. Whether any candidate will be able to match Mr. Giuliani's record will remain an unanswered question for many months.
Certainly other cities, like San Diego, have enjoyed drops in crime without using New York's approach, and some criminologists say a robust economy and a decline in the use of crack had as much to do with falling crime rates as any police strategy.
"Rudy was the beneficiary of some demographic trends," Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview. "But to not give Rudy credit for making a difference in this city seems to be ridiculous."
The Democrats -- Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president; City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi; Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker; and the public advocate, Mark Green -- have largely avoided criticizing the effectiveness of Mr. Giuliani's crime-fighting strategy and focused instead on the extent to which they say that strategy undermined the Police Department's relationship with blacks and Hispanics.
All of them have expressed respect for Compstat, a Giuliani innovation in which commanders began to use computers to map crime patterns. All have said they would continue to hold commanders accountable for crime in their precincts, as Mr. Giuliani has. Several, including Mr. Ferrer, have said they would continue efforts to seize illegal guns. Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone even said they would consider retaining Mr. Giuliani's current police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik. The commissioner has since said that he will leave with Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Hevesi said in an interview that he credited Mr. Giuliani with having "brought in the best brains in police science, lots of initiatives here in police methodologies that are now being replicated all over the country and the world."
Yet when they detail their own crime-fighting approaches, the Democrats express varying degrees of dissatisfaction with many of the core tactics that Mr. Giuliani's commanders employed.
Mr. Hevesi said he thought that many of the strategies, developed to respond to rampant crime, were no longer suited to a city in which crime has declined.
"Continuing to reduce the crime rates, we want to keep doing that," he said in an interview. "But you do that by heavier doses of community policing. That's requiring precinct commanders to be in regular, institutionalized contact with community leaders, church leaders, elected officials, to develop a focus, to develop priorities, to develop strategies. It's to put cops on the beat who have good relationships with the store owners and with the local community groups so that there is an exchange of information, so that there's trust."
Mr. Vallone similarly said that, for all the success of Mr. Giuliani's task forces, like undercover units that patrolled to seize guns, he wants to see officers posted in places where they are a visible deterrent.
"I want to see these cops," Mr. Vallone said in an interview. "I want to see them in the community. I don't want this -- what Mayor Giuliani has done, to my great chagrin, is to de-emphasize neighborhood community policing, patrol strength in precincts, and emphasize to a greater extent than necessary the centralization of the police and sending them out whenever a problem occurs."
Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Green have expressed similar support for community policing. Mr. Ferrer has even suggested that Mr. Green should explain why he has accepted support from William J. Bratton, Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, who Mr. Ferrer contends shares responsibility for what he characterized as divisive patrol strategies.
"Community policing was dismantled in the very opening days of the Giuliani-Bratton police administration," he said. "That planted the seeds for an enormous number of problems that we've seen develop over the last eight years."
Mr. Bratton has said the patrol tactics he began were necessary at the time, but should have been replaced after he left as commissioner with less aggressive strategies because crime had declined.
For their part, police officials maintain that they have been practicing community policing for years, but they define the concept differently. Instead of assigning young officers to walk beats and serve as neighborhood problem solvers, they said that commanders had been designated to direct the community policing effort by meeting with community leaders in their precincts. 
In general, Mr. Giuliani's police commanders have shied away from enforcement strategies that spread officers across a precinct to patrol individual blocks, or beats. Officers deployed in such sentrylike fashion, a Giuliani police official once said, resembled scarecrows who could not do much to frighten the birds.
Instead, the favored approach for several years has been to concentrate officers in areas with identified crime problems, as indicated by the pin dots on a crime map, even if that meant leaving more placid areas lightly patrolled.
Jack Maple, the late police strategist credited with devising many of the department's recent tactics, called the approach "putting the cops on dots."
In the last year, Mr. Kerik has tried to increase precinct staffing a bit, in part to address complaints about a lack of manpower in some neighborhoods. But the primary deployment strategy, officials said, continues to be the assignment of officers not as deterrents but as pursuers who track criminals in areas where crime is most prevalent.
In many instances, commanders looking to pay for the extra concentration of officers in a high-crime areas have used overtime money provided through Operation Condor. Police officials have called the program an essential tool. 
But several Democrats, including Mr. Green, have called it wasteful. Mr. Green said it was difficult to fathom why the city needed to pay so much overtime when it already employs what is by far the largest municipal police force in the country.
"I'd rather invest $15 million in Beacon schools and the Family Rehabilitation Program than in unnecessary overtime for Operation Condor," he said in a speech this year.
Mr. Green said he agreed that the police should stop and search people acting suspiciously, but he said the Giuliani administration had allowed the number of unwarranted stops to grow unchecked.
"There is extraordinary anecdotal and statistical evidence that there is a level of racial profiling on the streets of New York, where such a high percentage of young black and Latino men are stopped, frisked and harassed for no serious law enforcement reason," Mr. Green said in an interview.
Mr. Vallone, Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Hevesi have all voiced similar concerns that the police under Mr. Giuliani did not pay sufficient attention to civil liberties. But they said their attention to those concerns should not obscure their support for the rigorous enforcement of the law, including "quality of life" offenses.
"I want the pendulum to swing to the middle," Mr. Ferrer said in an interview. "It should not take a wild swing. I happen to believe in proactive policing, and that should not shock anybody."

HEADLINE: A NEW COMPUTER GIANT: THE OVERVIEW; 
Bold Move Will Test Executive's Skill

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Only a month ago, there were doubts about Carleton S. Fiorina's longevity as the chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company. H.P., as the big computer and printer maker is known, was suffering badly in the industry slump. The Silicon Valley rumor mill, analyst comments and media reports all suggested that Ms. Fiorina, 46, was in trouble.
 The speculative chorus became so loud that a few Hewlett-Packard board members spoke out in her defense, but the questions persisted. 
 Many of those doubts have been erased for the moment, particularly inside the company, with the announcement on Monday that Hewlett-Packard plans to buy Compaq Computer, a deal that would make Ms. Fiorina the leader of a combined company that will rival I.B.M. in size and reach. Both Ms. Fiorina, who joined Hewlett-Packard two years ago, and her bold move have been endorsed by the board. 
"Carly embarked on a several-year strategy when she came to H.P., and we knew there would some tough times," one board member said. "We're not happy about the company's performance recently, and no one could have predicted the steep falloff in technology spending in the economy."
"But the board is behind her totally and totally behind her strategy," the director said.
Yet Ms. Fiorina, her leadership skills and her blueprint for a new Hewlett-Packard will be tested in the coming days and months, analysts said. In the fast-moving computer industry, big mergers rarely succeed. The companies involved tend to focus on combining operations and lose their competitive edge, a pitfall that hampered Compaq after it acquired the Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998, analysts say.
Indeed, Wall Street seemed to be betting yesterday that the company's competitors stood to gain the most from the merger. In the market for information technology services, both companies compete against I.B.M., whose shares rose $1.54, to $101.49. In the market for personal computers, the two companies are struggling to compete against Dell Computer, whose shares rose 93 cents, to $22.31. By contrast, the price of both Hewlett-Packard and Compaq shares declined.
"On the PC side, this merger doesn't seem to solve a lot of problems," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. "On the services side, the combined company still will not have a services business that can go head-to-head with I.B.M."
If Ms. Fiorina cannot persuade investors of the merits of the $25 billion deal, the merger may collapse. 
Wall Street's unfavorable reaction appeared to be largely because the combined company would be increasing its stake in the personal computer business, which is in the throes of slumping sales and a savage price war. The new Hewlett-Packard would have about 19 percent of the worldwide PC market, moving ahead of Dell's 13 percent global share. But Dell has a leaner, more profitable PC business than either Hewlett-Packard or Compaq.
In a morning conference with analysts, Ms. Fiorina and Michael D. Capellas, the Compaq chief executive who will become president of the combined company, fielded so many questions about the PC business that Ms. Fiorina concluded with an appeal to look beyond personal computers.
In recent months, as her talks with Mr. Capellas progressed, Ms. Fiorina said they even "looked carefully" at getting out of the personal computer business. But they rejected that option, she said, because PC's are an important part of the "bundle" of technology and services that corporate customers want.
The merger plan faces a regulatory review by antitrust authorities in the United States and Europe. Until those hurdles have been cleared, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq cannot begin the work of pruning overlapping lines of business and melding the two corporate cultures. So Ms. Fiorina and Mr. Capellas were reluctant to discuss their plans in detail.
Still, they gave every indication that the traditional desktop PC business would not be at the strategic core of the new company. When asked about the combined company's standing in the PC market, Mr. Capellas replied that he was focused less on overall market share than on "next-generation access devices" like wireless hand-held computers.
And when asked about where the streamlining is likely to be greatest, Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said that the "intensity" of those efforts would probably be greatest in the PC business. Notably, the press release announcing the merger referred to PC's as "access devices" -- the phrase Compaq has adopted to try to distance itself from the battered personal computer business and to suggest that PC's are a link to more profitable operations like services and data-serving computers that are at the hub of corporate networks.
The merger with Compaq, Ms. Fiorina insisted, is a deal that "makes sense in good times or bad," but she conceded that "tough times" brought things to a head. What began nearly a year ago as a conversation with Mr. Capellas about sharing technology, she said, gradually escalated into a merger deal. For the last few months, Hewlett-Packard directors were informed of the progress of the talks. 
In part, the move made sense to both sides because both companies had been moving in the same direction. Under Ms. Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard has been trying to shift into more profitable computer services. It agreed earlier this year to purchase Comdisco's disaster-recovery business, while last year it negotiated to buy the information-technology consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, but those talks collapsed. Compaq, too, has tried to move into the huge field of supplying companies with packages of hardware, software and services instead of selling them individual pieces of information technology.
But that is a highly competitive and fragmented market. Companies like I.B.M., E.D.S., Sun Microsystems, Oracle and others are pursuing the same "enterprise" market of helping corporations with long-term programs for utilizing Internet technology to work more closely with suppliers and customers. 
Such technology spending, to be sure, has slowed and has been stretched in the current downturn. But the enterprise market still represents the most stable, lucrative area in the information technology industry, as I.B.M.'s strong financial results suggest.
Executives at Hewlett-Packard and Compaq said they thought that the planned merger would ensure that the combined company was a major player in that sector. Corporate customers, Mr. Capellas said, increasingly want to "purchase information technology as a utility" and he added that only a few companies will have the ability to be such full-service digital utilities. "And we're absolutely going to be one of them," he said.
Getting there, however, will require both skill and leadership, especially from Ms. Fiorina, who will head the new company. Since joining Hewlett-Packard in 1999 from Lucent Technologies, Ms. Fiorina has become a well-known executive. She has been articulate and outspoken on public policy issues, and she has been featured in the company's marketing campaign.
"H.P. has a visible leader, and somehow that's important when market conditions are difficult," observed Esther Dyson, publisher of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. "A company needs to define itself, and not only in terms of its products and services. It needs a leader people can rally around."
Her capacity for decisive leadership, most of all, was the reason the Hewlett-Packard board selected Ms. Fiorina after an extensive search. She started her career in her mid-20's after a failed marriage, a stint teaching English in Bologna, Italy, and time spent earning an M.B.A. from the University of Maryland. She then rose rapidly up the ranks at AT&T and later the Lucent spin-off.
In Ms. Fiorina, who has remarried, the board saw a "renaissance person," the board member said, with the experience and outlook needed to reinvigorate a highly respected company that had been slow to adapt to new technologies like the Internet. "What people call leadership and charisma," he added, "is really clarity of vision and the ability to communicate clearly."
Those skills will be put to the test as Ms. Fiorina tries to sell the deal to Wall Street, antitrust authorities, customers, suppliers and employees.

HEADLINE: Gramm Joins Republicans Who Plan to Quit Senate 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, an ardent conservative whose intellect, tenaciousness and willingness to buck consensus made him a major figure in two decades of Washington budget battles, announced today that he would not seek re-election next year.
 "Remarkably, the things I came to Washington to do are done," he said. 
 Mr. Gramm, a Republican, switched parties after gaining national attention as a Democratic apostate in the House who sponsored Ronald Reagan's 1981 budget cuts and tax cuts. Today he recalled that role as he said that he had made good on his promises to fight for less government and lower taxes. 
"The budget is balanced," he said at a news conference, his wife, Wendy, at his side and his staff arrayed in rows behind him. "First working with President Reagan and then with President Bush, we cut taxes twice. Never in American history has so much power been passed back from the federal government to the states and counties and cities and the people than in the last 25 years." 
Mr. Gramm, 59, is the third senior Republican to say he will not seek re-election next year, adding a new element of uncertainty to the 2002 race at a time when the Democrats control the Senate by just one vote.
A former economics professor who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996, Mr. Gramm has long been one of Washington's leading fiscal conservatives, known for mastering complicated subjects. He delighted in his reputation for being caustic, even mean, joking to at least one audience that he did have a heart: "I keep it in a quart jar on my desk."
But today he showed a different side, choking up several times and appearing near tears as he thanked his family and his staff for their support. He said his decision to leave the Senate came after "a long and difficult period of soul-searching."
His announcement, quickly following the declaration by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, that he would not seek a fifth term, caused political analysts to speak of a changing Senate.
"Jesse Helms was the foremost social conservative in the Senate, and Phil Gramm was the foremost economic conservative in the Senate," said Marshall Wittmann, a Congressional analyst at the Hudson Institute.
Republicans said they were confident they would have the advantage in President Bush's home state, and Mr. Gramm insisted that a "Republican will win my seat." 
Democrats said the retirements would bolster chances of increasing their majority. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, 98, has said he will step down at the end of his term after seven decades in politics. Republicans are watching Senators Fred Thompson of Tennessee and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico.
"It's one more competitive race where we didn't expect to have one," James M. Jordan, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
Mr. Gramm was first elected to Congress as a Democrat in 1978, and quickly won a seat on the Budget Committee by promising Democratic leaders he would be a team player. Instead, he became co-sponsor of Mr. Reagan's cuts even as he attended Democratic strategy meetings.
When Democratic leaders tossed Mr. Gramm off the Budget Committee in retaliation, he quit the party and resigned from the House. He triumphantly won as a Republican in a special election. The next year he was elected to the Senate.
There, his passion remained fiscal, and he was instrumental in pushing through a law requiring budget cuts if deficits were not reduced. 
"He was a brilliant tactician," said a former Republican senator, Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, who co-sponsored that law. "His strength was his knowledge and his quickness and his ability to see daylight and run for it. His weaknesses are, I think, Phil could be kind of hard on people sometime."
It was his weakness that showed when he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. While he raised vast sums of money, his abrasiveness haunted him in early contests in small states. He dropped out before the New Hampshire primary, with polls showing him far behind.
He threw himself back into the Senate, rising to chairman of the Banking Committee, until Democrats took control of the Senate in June. He fought hard to kill President Bill Clinton's plan for universal health coverage and produced a plan for turning Social Security into a system in which workers controlled their retirement accounts. 
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi today called Mr. Gramm "probably the most important utility player we have in the Senate."
Mr. Gramm showed he knew how to conciliate in the impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton. With one of the Senate's leading liberal Democrats, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, he convinced colleagues at a critical moment that the Senate could let the trial begin and defer a decision on summoning witnesses. 
But more often he has been the fierce partisan. Today, tart as ever, he belittled Democrats for their criticism that Mr. Bush's tax cut was depleting surpluses. "I mean, these are the same people that for the next three months are going to be screaming for more spending," he said. 
Mr. Gramm said he did not know what he would do next but did not close the door to a federal appointment, although he seemed to be leaning toward a career in the private sector. "If Coca-Cola called me up today and offered me $50 million to put the fizz back in Coke's stock, I might be tempted," he joked.
Mr. Gramm's decision is expected to set off a free-for-all for his seat. Republicans said possible candidates from their party included two House members, Henry Bonilla and Joe L. Barton, and John Cornyn, the Texas attorney general, and David Dewhurst, the land commissioner. Likely Democratic contenders included Ron Kirk, the Dallas mayor; former Attorney General Dan Morales; Representative Ken Bentsen; and Ed Cunningham, a lawyer.

HEADLINE: Big Belgian Beer Maker Posts 63% Rise in Profit 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
With an economic slowdown threatening, everything from computers to camisoles may be piling up unsold on store shelves. But consumers are still in the mood for a cold one, especially in the United States, if the earnings reported today by Interbrew, the giant Belgian brewer, are any guide.
 Interbrew said net profit rose 63.6 percent in the first half of 2001, to 200.2 million euros (about $177.7 million), compared with the 2000 period. A string of acquisitions, most notably that of Bass Brewers in June, and a good performance in emerging markets and the United States accounted for the 56 percent rise in sales, to 5.05 billion euros (about $4.4 billion). 
 Excluding the Bass acquisition, which is still being reviewed by British antitrust regulators, year-to-year sales growth was smaller -- 34.8 percent -- but profit growth was greater, 66.5 percent.
Interbrew's chief executive, Hugo Powell, said that British antitrust authorities were expected to rule on the Bass takeover by the end of this month. Regulators originally blocked the deal, but their ruling was overturned by a British court in May; they are now expected to approve it on condition that Interbrew sell some of Bass's brands in Britain.
Western Europe was the company's weakest region in the first half of the year. Sales were steady, but pretax profits eroded by about 10 percent.
Revenue growth was strongest in emerging markets in Asia and central Europe, where sales rose almost 25 percent, to 629 million euros ($559 million). The company increased its sales in the United States by 9.8 percent to 848 million euros (about $753.7 million), Interbrew said.
Interbrew's acquisitive appetite has not abated. The company said today that shareholders of Beck & Company, the brewer of Germany's leading export beer brand, unanimously approved Interbrew's August takeover offer. Interbrew bought a controlling stake in another German brewer, Diebels, in July.
Like Bass, the Beck acquisition is subject to approval by competition regulators in Europe and the United States. Mr. Powell said he expected to close the deal in the first quarter of 2002.
Interbrew calls itself "the world's local brewer"; Rolling Rock and Labatt's are among its well-known brands in the United States and Canada.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
As the economy falters, the tensions between advertisers and agencies rises, a new survey says.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE sluggish advertising economy is already causing rifts in relations between agencies and advertisers, according to an annual survey, as those reporting they have felt the slowdown describe serious consequences ranging from lower-quality campaigns to less teamwork to more of a focus on money.
 The results of the survey, which asked leaders at client companies and agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of their working relationships, show that "among those affected, the economy is really taking its toll," said Nancy L. Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a preview of the 2001 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations. 
 "Everything depends on the economy," she added. "We're entering into a time of greater tension." Salz Consulting sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising development for marketers including American Express, Clorox, General Motors and the Kraft division of Philip Morris. 
The results are particularly interesting because the 2001 survey, which Ms. Salz has sponsored since 1986, was taken in April -- well before it became apparent that there would be little or no chance of an improvement in the advertising climate for the year.
The survey, conducted by Thurm Marketing and Consulting in Princeton, N.J., is being released by Ms. Salz today against a gloomy backdrop of budget cutbacks and layoffs that had the trade publication Advertising Age speculating in a front-page article this week that 2001 could end with "the biggest year-on-year percentage decline in ad spending since the Great Depression." It was referring to data compiled by the Universal McCann media agency in New York showing that the sharpest one-year decrease in American ad spending, 8.1 percent, came in 1938.
In an interview, Ms. Salz was nowhere near as depressed as to cite the Depression, to paraphrase a lyric of Stephen Sondheim's from "Follies." This is primarily because relations between clients and agencies are suffering "less than might be expected," she said, given the current climate.
For instance, when asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from advertisers was 7.1, only a tenth of a point lower than 2000.
And when advertisers were asked to predict the effect on sales if the agencies working for them were able to do "their best work for you 100 percent of the time," they estimated a sales increase of 27.7 percent -- the highest response to that question since 1997. By comparison, when advertisers responded to that question in the 1991 survey -- the last time ad spending fell compared with the previous year -- they estimated a much lower sales increase of 21.1 percent if they could get their agencies' best work all the time.
There is now "a greater belief in what really effective advertising can do for a brand," Ms. Salz said, but there are also "higher expectations for advertising," which can be a double-edged sword for agencies under the gun in a weak economy, to mix weapons references.
The survey results were mixed, too. On the negative side, advertisers responding that there was more tension in relationships with their agencies rose to 36 percent from 30 percent last year, while agencies responding that there was more tension in relationships with clients doubled, to 54 percent from 27 percent in the 2000 survey.
Both sides also said they thought there was an increased focus on money in their relations: advertisers, to 42 percent from 32 percent, and agencies, to 71 percent from 54 percent.
And among those advertisers and agencies describing themselves as "greatly" or "somewhat" affected by the economy, there were far more negative responses than among those describing themselves as "slightly" or "not at all" affected.
The advertisers more affected reported "half as much teamwork" in their agency relations as those less affected, Ms. Salz said, "nearly twice as much tension, twice as much focus on money and twice as many hassles." (Ms. Salz was not trying to be casual; the wording of the question included "hassles.")
And the agencies more affected reported "less than one-third as much teamwork" in their client relations as those less affected, she added, "over twice as much tension, 50 percent more focus on money and far more hassles."
And yet, there were bright spots, too, Ms. Salz said, as "other internal dynamics of the advertiser-agency relationship have either maintained or surpassed last year's levels."
For instance, "the percentage of agencies reporting more teamwork" in relations with clients "is at a survey high," she added, of 50 percent, which is important because "those advertisers reporting more teamwork in their agency relationships rated their advertising 22 percent higher than those reporting less teamwork."
And while agencies responded that they were able to do their best work for 54.2 percent of major clients compared with 65.4 percent last year, the percentage for 2001 "is only slightly below the survey average of 58.2 percent," Ms. Salz said, adding that the result for 2000 may have been "an anomaly" stemming from "the unique advertising executions the agencies developed for their dot-com clients."
Dot-com clients. Now there's a phrase that conjures up memories, eh?

HEADLINE: Arabs Expect No Wider War, but Fear U.S. Coolness 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Arab governments do not see any prospect of a wider war growing out of the violence in Israel, but they view the disengagement of the Bush administration as dangerous and the bloodshed as unstoppable as long as Palestinians live in stateless misery. 
 "You can't calm things down simply by saying, 'Stop the violence,' " said Nabil el-Araby, an Egyptian lawyer who served as his country's ambassador to the United Nations from 1991 to 1999. "You have to say to the Israelis, 'O.K., you have a right to your security' and you have to say to the Palestinians, 'You have a right to a state.' " 
 "On this basis, you can move toward negotiations. But you can't just ask people to cease reacting to what is going on around them." 
The peace accord that emerged in 1993 was sold to the two million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza as a deal that would remove Israeli occupation forces from their lives and eventually bring them a state.
At first, it succeeded in doing the former. Israeli troops withdrew from the Gaza Strip and the major cities on the West Bank. The Palestinian leadership returned from exile, and the trappings of statehood began to flow -- a television station, postage stamps, an airport -- albeit with the entrances and exits controlled by Israel. 
For the Palestinians, as for the Arab population at large, the long Arab-Israeli dispute seemed to be easing toward a compromise. But then it stalled; Jewish settlements expanded, and in many places, Palestinians found that the soldiers had moved just outside town. 
The people in the West Bank and Gaza have felt increasingly frustrated. The promises were that their lives would improve, but their movements, their employment and their very future were still largely subject to Israeli gatekeepers.
It is from that font that the fury on the Palestinian side flows, Arab leaders argue, and they insist that no amount of Israeli counterviolence can stem it. Even suicide bombings like the one in a Jerusalem pizzeria last month are widely applauded as a legitimate tactic that inflicts the sort of suffering on Israelis that Palestinians regularly endure.
Not everyone blames Israel for everything. There is some anger that the only Palestinians who seem to have benefited economically from the changes since the Oslo accords have been associates of Yasir Arafat. But such criticism is submerged in the far greater condemnation of Israel's methods.
Occasional noises about a wider conflict are heard. But few commentators expect a Middle East war. Even Syria, an implacable foe of Israel, long avoided any open confrontation during the decades that Hafez al-Assad ran the country. 
President Bashar al-Assad, his son, is expected to follow his father's pattern of working through proxy guerrilla forces in southern Lebanon to hit at Israel. (The fact that Israel withdrew from south Lebanon after two decades of guerrilla skirmishes provides encouragement to the Palestinians.)
"Arab countries cannot do anything," said Imad Fawzi Shueibi, a professor of political sociology at Damascus University. "They cannot launch war because they are weaker than Israel and the Americans will make sure Israel wins. It would be stupid to launch war, knowing that you are going to lose." 
Finding themselves largely impotent, but with agitated populations, the Arab governments instead seek to lash out at Israel at every available opportunity. They turned the United Nations conference on racism this week in Durban into a forum for condemning Israeli practices, prompting the United States and Israel to walk out.
"Occupation is evil on its own," said Ahmed Maher, Egypt's foreign minister, in his speech to the conference. "And this occupation is accompanied by killing men, women, children and elders, demolishing houses, uprooting trees, deploying the most advanced weapons used only in war."
He later condemned the American departure as an insult to the United Nations and its members.
For Arab governments, it is bewildering that the Bush administration has divorced itself so thoroughly from any active role in halting the bloodshed, especially after Washington brokered the peace negotiations for so long. 
They find the American mantra that Mr. Arafat must stop all the violence even more perplexing, viewing it more as a sop to the Israeli lobby in the United States than as a realistic goal. Officials in Jordan and Egypt say American officials, in distancing themselves from Mr. Arafat, are actually undermining his ability to do the very thing they ask.
If Mr. Arafat cannot engage with the United States, the logic goes, then the Palestinian people realize that he cannot deliver an agreement. So they should continue fighting. 
"The fact that things are getting uglier and nastier in the occupied territories is because they know they are on their own," said Mustafa B. Hamarneh, the director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan. 
In a speech last week, , President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt offered his own interpretation of why Palestinians are driven to violence. "If the blockade remains, I sit at home in any Palestinian village without work, the school is in another village, and the hospital is in town, and the work is in many places, and there I am unable to move from one village to another," he said. "This method pushes Palestinian citizens to a certain degree of despair and frustration. So you can expect them to do anything. You see how they detonate bombs and kill themselves."
For that reason, Mr. Mubarak said, Mr. Arafat cannot be expected to control everything. Arab leaders predicted back in February, after Ariel Sharon was elected Israel's prime minister, that given his past military history, he would increase the level of violence, and they now feel vindicated. 
Some officials believe that Arab leaders caution Mr. Arafat privately to try to prevent attacks against civilians. 
"We are against violence toward civilians -- I don't think anyone can condone violence toward civilians," said Hesham Youssef, a spokesman for the Arab League. "When we say stop the violence, though, we don't mean stop the intifada because the intifada is a reaction against all these Israeli practices and overall against occupation."
The moderate Arab camp -- countries like Jordan and Egypt that have peace treaties with Israel -- cannot push Mr. Arafat to do more without risking the wrath of their own people. Demonstrations have been banned in Jordan, and Egyptian officials are bracing for what happens when the universities reopen this fall.
There is also increasingly vocal grumbling about Arab impotence in the face of Israel's American-supplied arsenal. The Israelis' use of F-16 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters and tanks is contrasted each night on Arab television stations across the region with Palestinians bearing rifles, homemade mortars or -- usually -- stones. 
"No Arab soldier has explained what has happened to our great armies and their weaponry paid for with the money of the people," Al Ittihad, a government daily in Abu Dhabi, said in an editorial last week. "Arab defense ministers have not even held a meeting," the paper noted, at a time when Israelis are "massacring Palestinians." 
Given such sentiments, if Mr. Arafat stood up now and tried to stop the violence, the Palestinian population would probably turn on him and then support more extreme groups like Hamas or Islamic Holy War, several political commentators said. 
"Palestinian officials have to make some gains, have to get anything so that they could go tell their people, 'We got this,' " said Abdel Wahab Badrakhan, a political analyst with the newspaper Al Hayat. "Please stop now so that we can take a break and solve our economic problems."
There is a sense among Arabs, though, that neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis have a strategy, and that if the United States does not step in they will go on slugging at each other in increasingly horrible ways. 
Both Egyptian and Jordanian officials and analysts said they also found it baffling that Israel, just as it was beginning to earn some acceptance in the Middle East with trade offices and the like, should toss it all aside and try to pummel the Palestinians into submission. They point out that a similar series of pinpoint killings of Palestinian leaders by Israel in the 1970's and 80's did nothing to eradicate Palestinian opposition to Israeli rule. 
"Fifty years from now there will be a majority of Arabs in Israel and on the West Bank," Mr. Hamarneh said. "The Israelis will be living in a sea of Arabs. What are they going to do then? Now is the time to say, 'We made a mistake; we stole your land; let us see what we can do.' "

HEADLINE: Productivity Growth Rate Is Revised Down to 2.1% 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers grew strongly in the second quarter but the increase was less impressive than originally thought, the Labor Department said today.
 A private firm, meanwhile, predicted that the steady drumbeat of company layoffs would keep up in coming months. 
 The latest figures on nonfarm productivity, measuring the amount of goods and services that workers produce in an hour, showed a 2.1 percent annual rate gain for the April-to-June period. That was revised down from the 2.5 percent pace previously estimated. 
The productivity growth rate was still solid, given the economy's weakness. Productivity growth, which in the longer run is crucial to rising standards of living, typically suffers as the economy slows. "If we can do this well in productivity in the wake of economic slowdown, it means the best is yet to come," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio.
The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, advanced at an anemic 0.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, its slowest growth in eight years. 
Among manufacturers, productivity rose at a 1.1 percent rate in the April-through-June period, revised from a previously reported drop of 0.2 percent.
Although productivity growth is a healthy economic sign in the long run, one way that companies are trying to bolster efficiency and increase profits is by thinning their work forces.
The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said today that job cuts totaled 140,019 in August, down 32 percent from July, when companies announced 205,975 layoffs. But job-cut announcements were up 145 percent compared with August 2000.
"There is no evidence reported by any industry that anything that could be called a significant sustainable rebound is on the horizon for this year or even early next year," the report said.
High-technology industries -- telecommunications, computers and electronics -- were hit hardest. Total layoff announcements in those three areas rose more than 1,200 percent from the period a year earlier.
Unit labor costs advanced at a 2.7 percent pace after a 5 percent jump in the first quarter. The Labor Department had previously put the increase in second-quarter unit labor costs at 2.1 percent.
Productivity in the second quarter grew 1.5 percent compared with the quarter a year earlier, down from 3 percent for all 2000 and 2.3 percent for 1999.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A vital economy isone that suffers lucky fools gladly.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel@reason.com.

 BODY:
THE dot-com bubble has burst. The stock market keeps taking scary plunges. Even well-established technology companies are suffering from surprising downturns. The cynics of a few years ago are laughing. All that "irrational exuberance," they say, was not just irrational but downright stupid. Grown-ups don't become carried away with the idea of striking it rich.
 But what if irrational exuberance is in fact the secret to vigorous economic growth? What if countries become stagnant if all their business people become too mature and rational? 
 That's what the economic historian John V. C. Nye suggested in a 1991 article, "Lucky Fools and Cautious Businessmen." Economic vitality may depend, he argued, not on rational investment but on "lucky fools." His analysis, published in the journal Research in Economic History, provides an interesting take on the latest bust.
The traditional view, articulated by the economist Joseph Schumpeter, sees entrepreneurs as brilliant calculators who take rational risks that other people are afraid to try. Some risks don't pay off, but enough do to cancel the losses.
The problem for economic historians is to explain why some countries, like Victorian Britain, seem to lose their edge, even though their financial markets work as well as those elsewhere and their entrepreneurs continue to take rational risks. Historians who have delved into the evidence have found no reason to believe that Victorian businessmen failed to invest wisely. Yet Britain's economy fell behind those of the United States and Germany.
Professor Nye, of Washington University in St. Louis, offered an explanation. Suppose we think of "the entrepreneur as the valiant, but overoptimistic investor rather than the heroic seer," he wrote. In this story, entrepreneurs miscalculate their odds of success. They start more businesses than they should, but those mistakes lead to social benefits.
It's easy to see how people might overestimate their chances. William H. Gates and Thomas Edison become famous. We all know about the entrepreneurs who hit the jackpot. The losers are more scattered and less well known, though far more numerous.
If the few big wins cancel out the many losses, starting a business would be a risky, but rational, bet -- the sort of investment a "cautious businessman" might make. But Professor Nye argued that the wins and the losses probably don't cancel out. Even the biggest winners don't make enough money personally to cover the losses of all the individuals who went into businesses that failed.
The big winners are usually people who, based on rational calculations, shouldn't have bet their time, money and ideas. They overestimated their chances of striking it rich. But they were lucky and beat the odds.
Even more important, the lucky fools create huge spillover benefits for society: new sources of wealth, new jobs, new industries offering less-risky opportunities, new technologies that improve life. Entrepreneurship does generate net gains, but most of those gains don't go to the risk-takers. The gains are spread out to the rest of us. Capitalism, in this view, works by exploiting the capitalists themselves.
"We depend upon people continuing to open up new businesses for the success of industry and of the economy and for our health and well-being," Professor Nye said in an interview. "But on the whole it probably doesn't make sense for the average person to open up a business. Hence, the lucky-fools phenomenon."
Entrepreneurship is not, in this view, a sort of rational risk calculation. It is, as critics of capitalism sometimes say, a bit like gambling. But society plays something like the role of the house, gaining from the process.
"It's like having a Powerball lottery where you say nobody should really play Powerball," because the odds of winning are so bad, Professor Nye said. "But if nobody plays Powerball, we won't be better off."
And while the social benefits of real-life lotteries don't justify the risk, he said, the metaphor does hold "true for things like technological innovation."
Foolish optimism solves a basic economic problem. Usually when there's some sort of positive spillover effect -- say, the social benefits of education -- economists suggest that the government subsidize the activity.
But this policy won't work for entrepreneurship because there's no way the government can guess any better than private individuals which businesses to subsidize. If anything, interest-group politics will tend to make the government somewhat worse at picking good targets.
Instead, Professor Nye said, "a dynamic society simply creates more people willing to take these chances." They risk their own resources, rather than the public's, but on those rare occasions when they succeed -- and even sometimes when they don't -- the public enjoys spillover benefits.
Most economic activity isn't like gambling, of course. For most businesses, the odds are reasonably well known, and the procedures are rational. Cautious businessmen can thrive. But they won't produce a lot of innovation. And if they drive out the crazy innovators, the economy will stagnate.
The lucky-fools theory suggests, then, that Victorian Britain's economy was successful but stagnant not because investors were irrationally afraid of risks but because they were all too mature and calculating. They didn't tolerate the foolish chances that a vital economy requires.
Growth spurts depend on people who don't know how bad their odds of success are. Sometimes those people are too young to know better, and sometimes they're doing new things for which the odds simply aren't known. The dot-com boom featured both young entrepreneurs and unfamiliar business models. Nobody really knew what the odds were.
The recent bust, Professor Nye said, isn't just a one-time foul-up in which the market becomes overvalued. It's a side effect of a healthy process. "No real progress is made unless real leaps of faith are made." Big losses are inevitable when people take the sorts of chances needed to produce major advances. Dynamic, wealthy societies suffer boom-and-bust cycles, while stagnant economies generally avoid both busts and booms.
What makes the American economy strong isn't that everyone is entrepreneurial -- most people avoid major risks -- but that the people who do undertake foolish ventures get both an opportunity to try and a way to bounce back when they fail. "So long as the system permits weirdos, the lucky fools who take these chances," Professor Nye said, "we are better off."

HEADLINE: Inspired by Jesus, Sandinista Tries for a Comeback 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua 

 BODY:
Daniel Ortega is not running for president as much as he is power walking. In his brisk campaign swings through neighborhood bastions, he strides for miles drenched in sweat and basking in the cheers, hugs and handshakes that greet him as he embraces grandmothers and kisses babies.
 Of course, for many other Nicaraguans who endured 12 years of civil war, nationalizations and economic ruin until the Sandinistas lost power in the election in 1990, the mere fact that Mr. Ortega still has designs on power is seen more like the kiss of death. They consider Mr. Ortega, the Sandinista leader, the personification of an outdated revolutionary idealism that divided the country in the doomed pursuit of a Socialist utopia. 
 Mr. Ortega has a simple reply: times change and so has he. 
In the early stages of his third presidential effort -- after losses in 1990 to Violeta Chamorro and in 1996 to President Arnoldo Aleman -- Mr. Ortega is in a virtual dead heat with a former vice president of the Liberal Party, Enrique Bolanos. 
Today, rather than denounce the middle class and confiscate their houses or businesses, Mr. Ortega assures voters he will respect property rights. He says he accepts free markets and free elections and speaks of reconciliation with past foes. 
Although he still says Karl Marx is relevant, he says Jesus was his first inspiration as a revolutionary. 
"I continue being a revolutionary who pursues ideals, growing in the understanding and learning that what is desired is not always possible," Mr. Ortega said in an interview. "In these last 11 years, we have been learning to struggle with this new reality in the space established by the Constitution and the law."
It is indeed a change for a man who 22 years ago was at the forefront of the social and political uprising that ousted the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza and ushered in an era of Central American-style socialism.
But that experiment, for Mr. Ortega, belonged to a different world. "In this new context, to which we had to adjust, the market economy plays its role," he said. "That is important. In the 60's and 70's, there were two worlds, the capitalist world, in which everything was bad for the revolutionary, and the socialist world in which everything was bad for the counterrevolutionary. That was a wrong vision of the reality." 
Occurring during the cold war and with the Sandinistas' forging alliances with President Fidel Castro of Cuba and leftist rebels in neighboring countries, Mr. Ortega's rise to power so unnerved the United States that American officials funneled millions of dollars to help arm a fractious rebel movement against him that became known as the contras. 
Some of the same American officials who propelled the contra war have re-emerged in the Bush administration, and they voice doubts about Mr. Ortega's conversion. Although American officials say they will work with whoever is elected on Nov. 4, their statements have been seen here as a not-so-veiled endorsement of Mr. Ortega's opponent. 
American officials are troubled by unresolved claims of 300 Americans whose property was confiscated by the Sandinistas, as well as what the officials contend are Mr. Ortega's continued contacts with Cuba.
The Sandinistas and their supporters are worried about American declarations, as well as reports that American diplomats urged a third-party candidate to drop out of the race to consolidate support for Mr. Bolanos. Although the battles that once raged in the mountains in the war in the 80's have been succeeded with elections, some of the language -- and warnings -- echo the past. 
"It should be enough only to think about what a new conflict would mean for this region," Mr. Ortega said. "To scare Nicaragua about what happens" if the Sandinistas win, "is to trigger a new exodus of refugees to the United States. That is not good for the United States. It would be better for the United States to seriously review the policy it is seeking now." 
On the domestic front, both candidates are promising additional employment and honest government, the major preoccupations of an impoverished population whose confidence in Mr. Aleman's government has nose-dived amid constant accusations of corruption. 
The unemployment and poverty will be the biggest challenges for the winner, and the high foreign debt and dependence on foreign aid will limit the ability to deliver on campaign vows. But the more immediate problem for both candidates now is to win the voters' confidence. 
"Daniel has less of an advantage, because people are scared of an abrupt change," said Sergio Ramirez, Mr. Ortega's former vice president and the founder of a Sandinista splinter movement. The winner, Mr. Ramirez added, "will not be the one who lifts their hope, but the one who causes less fear." 
The Liberals have the support of many in the middle class, as well as former contras. Mr. Bolanos's Liberals have emphasized their leader's business skills and ability to work with the United States and foreign investors. 
But they have not hesitated to slip in pointed digs at the Sandinistas, touching on bitter memories of nationalized enterprises, forced military service, politically motivated jailings and Sandinista dealings with Cuba, Iraq and Libya.
The Liberals have also stressed their candidate's reputation as a family man, in contrast to Mr. Ortega, who was accused in 1998 by his stepdaughter of having sexually abused her for years. The government refused to lift his immunity, and the woman subsequently took her complaint to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which has yet to issue a ruling. 
For their part, the Sandinistas, in addition to emphasizing their business-friendly side, have also vowed to help the landless and the poor. They have taken aim at the corruption that is widely seen as a hallmark of the incumbent Liberal government.
"The Sandinistas have got to convince people they are not going to plunge the country into economic chaos," said William M. LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University in Washington. "They need to say, 'That is not what we are about anymore.' " 
"Their hope," Professor LeoGrande added, "is the more recent bad experiences people had with economy and corruption under Aleman will be enough and that people remember that because it is fresh in their minds." 
Mr. Bolanos said in an interview that he is his own man. He bristled at the suggestion that corruption was a major issue. "He has a lot of explanations to give," Mr. Bolanos said of Mr. Ortega. "I don't have to give any. I keep on being me."
He emphasized that the administration had built roads, schools and other public works and that he, a longtime leader in the private sector, had the training and the contacts to continue that growth. "I'm not saying we will do it all in five years," Mr. Bolanos said. "That's impossible. What I am saying is we will continue to improve the situation of the country."
For Mr. Ortega, the campaign has been an effort to balance his populist appeal among the poor with reassurances that he understands a changed country. 
But his critics doubt that he can shift even 10 percent of the budget, given how tight it is already, even with his proposed austerity measures.
"They are right," one diplomat said of the Sandinistas. "Things have changed. And one thing is that there are not a lot of people out there jumping to help them."
Indeed, the past and Daniel Ortega have touched everyone in this country. In Matiguas, where the Liberals started their campaign, some voters said they could not forget. 
"The Sandinistas made two of my sons fight for them in the war," Zacaria Albiures said. "They died in the mountains. The Sandinistas did not help me in anything. Only God knows if Daniel has changed."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: COMPTROLLER; 
Candidates Trade Charges Over Fitness

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
In a heated televised debate that focused on credentials more than issues, the two men running for city comptroller accused each other last night of being unfit for the job.
 The men, Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the City Council Finance Committee, and William C. Thompson Jr., the former president of Board of Education, disagreed on several issues, including whether taxes should have been cut this year and whether the education budget could be cut without harming children. 
 But most of the focus was on the charges and countercharges in what has become an increasingly bitter campaign. As he does in campaign mailings and on television, Mr. Berman accused his rival of serious legal lapses. Mr. Berman said Mr. Thompson failed to pay his taxes on time and failed to get legally required licenses on time when he worked on Wall Street. 
Last night, Mr. Thompson hit back, accusing Mr. Berman of running "a gutter-type, mudslinging nasty campaign." The allegations are "false, misleading, distorted and a lie," Mr. Thompson said.
Mr. Thompson, who has just started running his own negative ads, suggested that Mr. Berman had improperly taken big campaign contributions from developers whom he had helped. Mr. Berman said he was proud of the project in question, the minor league baseball stadium in Coney Island (indeed, he ended his remarks for the evening with, "Go, Cyclones!"). And he said that developers were supporting him because he was the best qualified.
The comptroller's race will be decided by the primary next Tuesday; no Republican is running in the general election. Among the comptroller's duties are auditing the city's books, managing its pension funds and overseeing its efforts to borrow money.
The hourlong debate was sponsored by New York Law School, WNYC Radio and NY1 News in conjunction with the city's Campaign Finance Board.
Citing a report released yesterday by the conservative Manhattan Institute on the positive effect of tax cuts on the city economy, Mr. Berman said that tax reductions he had backed during his years on the Council had added thousands of jobs in the city.
"My opponent has consistently indicated his opposition to tax cuts," he said. Mr. Thompson said that the timing of the cuts was bad, and called the most recent city budget irresponsible. 
The two men sparred over the Board of Education, with Mr. Thompson insisting that there was no room in its budget for cuts. Mr. Berman, however, said that cuts could be made in a bloated bureaucracy without hurting children.

HEADLINE: Nairobi Journal; 
A Song About Corruption Takes Kenya by Storm

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
When a Kenyan asks for a little tea, he may or may not have a hot beverage in mind.
 Tea is a popular drink here, usually served with healthy helpings of milk and sugar. But "a little tea" is also the slang used by bureaucrats, police officers or anyone else with an outstretched palm to ask for a bribe. 
 In "Nchi ya Kitu Kidogo," a new Kiswahili song that has taken Kenya by storm, Eric Wainaina tells those desiring a little tea to visit a popular tea-growing area in central Kenya. He recommends that those in need of a soda -- another word for bribe -- refresh themselves with a Fanta. "A nation of 'something small,' " he asserts, using still another bribery euphemism, "is a nation of small people." 
Mr. Wainaina's song, whose title means "a nation of something small," has caught on among the wananchi, or everyday people, of this country, where corruption is commonplace. 
Police officers stop matatus -- the overcrowded vans that shuttle people to and fro -- and demand tea from the driver in the middle of the road. Underpaid civil servants remain aloof until they hear the crinkling of a 1,000 shilling note. Elected officials skim from the treasury a little something for themselves.
"No bribes should be given or accepted whether demanded or not," says the sign greeting passengers at the airport. The demands can begin as early as the baggage carousel.
"Corruption is not limited to ministers, permanent secretaries and other top state officials," Kiraitu Murungi, a member of Parliament, said at a recent conference on the topic. "Corruption is everywhere. The chief, the businessman, the teacher, the driver, the messenger, the farmer, the rich and the poor -- your brother and mine -- are involved."
But just because the problem is widespread does not mean Kenyans embrace the current state of affairs, as evidenced by the popularity of Mr. Wainaina's anticorruption anthem.
Radio stations say they are playing the song over and over because listeners keep requesting it. And many of those matatus, known for their breakneck speeds and blaring sound systems, seem to have adopted the catchy tune as their own.
Mr. Wainaina, 27, took a break from his studies at the Berklee College of Music in Boston to make his new CD, "Sawa Sawa" ("It's O.K."), which was produced and arranged by Christian Kaufmann in the Boston area.
"I'm not a politician," Mr. Wainaina said. "I'm just a young Kenyan living at a time when there's a lot happening in Kenya politically."
The World Bank office in Nairobi has been one of the largest en masse buyers of the compact disc, according to Mr. Wainaina's brother, Simon, who is his manager. The bank is withholding financial aid to Kenya until the government of President Daniel arap Moi takes serious steps toward addressing corruption.
When Kenya's Parliament failed last month -- despite a rare personal appearance by the president -- to endorse an independent body to investigate corruption, Mr. Moi announced that he would set up a special police unit to do the job. International financial institutions remain skeptical of the government's commitment to stamping out the problem.
One indication of that commitment may be the official reaction to Mr. Wainaina's song. He delivered the CD to the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, the only station with a national reach, but officials there so far have declined to broadcast it.
When he began singing the song at a national school musical festival last month -- in front of the vice president and other government ministers, no less -- organizers cut the microphone before he was through.
"The impression that the Kenya government doesn't want people singing about corruption is the wrong impression," said Silverse Anami, the deputy director of culture, a singer himself and the man who gave Mr. Wainaina the ax.
Mr. Anami said corruption was a real vice in Kenya and that music ought to address it. But he said there was a time and place for everything, and Mr. Wainaina had not been scheduled to perform when he did.
An earlier Wainaina song, called "Kenya Only," won praise from politicians, including Mr. Moi, who heard the young singer perform it at a ceremony and asked him for a repeat performance. The government, however, has not called for an encore of the anticorruption number.
"It's a sensitive song," Mr. Wainaina said, recalling the music festival. "All these big shots of the government were there. I saw them motioning for me to stop. I said to myself, 'I'm not going to stop because a couple of people are getting their feathers ruffled.' If there is one thing that Kenyans live under it's the fear of challenging authority. By singing, I showed that it's possible to stand up and speak without putting your life in danger."
The Kenyan government does promote songs that address societal ills in its national music competitions. There are separate categories for songs dealing with such topics as AIDS, female genital mutilation and even corruption. But the songs are judged not just on how well they depict the problem but whether they also offer a solution, Mr. Anami said. 
"I believe this world must be better than it is," said Mr. Anami, sounding not at all like a censor. "Messages through songs, through poetry, through theater, act as mirrors. Through them the society is able to see what their face really looks like."

Ryan Leaf Fails Cowboys Physical

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
Quarterback Ryan Leaf failed a Dallas Cowboys physical yesterday because of a wrist problem and remains one of the N.F.L.'s unemployed veteran quarterbacks. 
 "It was an injury that concerned us enough that we couldn't make a decision to put him on the roster," Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, said. 
 Leaf, the second overall pick in the 1998 draft, was waived by San Diego in March and by Tampa Bay on Monday. The Cowboys were interested in Leaf as their third-stringer behind the rookie starter Quincy Carter and the second year backup Anthony Wright.

Wall St. Remains Cool to Hewlett-Compaq Merger

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Investor skepticism about a proposed merger between Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer turned to concrete fallout today as both companies' stocks continued to slide, and a major rating service downgraded Hewlett-Packard's creditworthiness.
 Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating of Hewlett-Packard two notches to A2, still a relatively high rating shared by the likes of Texas Instruments, but nevertheless a symbolic vote about the challenges posed by the merger. 
 The merger, announced on Tuesday, would create the world's largest computer company. A hardware juggernaut under the Hewlett-Packard name with $87 billion in revenue and a broad reach into the technology industry, it would be anchored by a an emphasis on sales of personal computer and printers. 
But the challenges in integrating the companies, coupled with the struggles each has had individually in the PC market, have raised questions among investors. Today, shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 66 cents, to $18.21. Compaq declined 67 cents, to $10.41.
"This is the type of merger where just about everything needs to be going right to be successful," said Bill Shope, an enterprise hardware analyst with ABN Amro. "In this type of environment, it's hard to imagine that everything is going to go right." 
Explaining the market's reaction to the proposed merger, Mr. Shope criticized Hewlett-Packard as failing to explain how the two companies would gain strategically. Carleton S. Fiorina, chairwoman and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, and Michael D. Capellas, Compaq's chief executive who is to be president of the merged entity, emphasized cost savings when announcing the deal. But, Mr. Shope said, such savings are the easiest to achieve but much less important than "strategic synergies." 
"I don't think there is any way, in the near term, to convince the majority of investors that this was a good idea," he said.
As for Moody's, it downgraded Hewlett-Packard from AA3, a rating that was among the highest held by any technology company. Along with a lower rating, Hewlett-Packard's creditworthiness was assigned a "negative outlook," meaning that it is possible the company could be downgraded further in the next 6 to 18 months. Compaq's rating remained at BAA2, which is several slots below Hewlett-Packard's current rating.
Dave Berman, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, Calif., said the downgrade was "not unexpected." He said ratings services typically took a conservative position regarding large mergers, and he said the company still believed that it had an "outstanding" credit rating.
Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's, said the reason for the downgrade was that the two companies would face "significant integration challenges." Mr. Lane said large technology mergers rarely worked smoothly, and he said Hewlett-Packard in particular was being downgraded because it was buying a company with a lower credit rating.
From a practical standpoint, Mr. Lane said the change in rating might have a slight effect, by increasing the cost to Hewlett-Packard of raising money. But he said that cost could be easily offset if the combined companies execute their business plans.
Mr. Lane said one question was whether the newly merged company would be successful in expanding its services business.
Indeed, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq said that one reason for the merger was to try to combine their strengths to increase their presence in services, a growing and potentially profitable area that entails advising companies on how to build and manage technology networks.
Ann Livermore, president of Hewlett-Packard's services division, said today that the merger partners complemented each other's strengths: Hewlett-Packard has particular expertise in serving customers using the Unix computer operating environment, while Compaq has focused on Windows NT, made by Microsoft. She also said the companies' expertise providing support to individual users made them an attractive candidate to be hired by corporations who wanted help setting up networks, then offering support to employees at their desktop computers.
"Customers today want an alternative to I.B.M.," Ms. Livermore said, adding that she believed that Hewlett-Packard could expand its services business faster than market growth levels. "We'll have double the critical mass and twice as many resources," she said.
Revenue from the service business at a combined company would be around $15 billion. About 10 percent of that comes from leasing and renting equipment; 35 percent from consulting, the most profitable of the services business; and 55 percent from customer support.
Peter Bendor-Samual, the chief executive of the Everest Group, an outsourcing consulting firm, said the merger partners had an opportunity to expand the consulting and outsourcing aspect of the services business -- the most profitable piece -- by as much as $10 billion in the next three to five years. The reason, he said, is that Compaq already has a toehold in the industry, while Hewlett-Packard has a "strong appetite and deep pockets."
The two companies are presently considered second-tier players in the professional services area, but could, with a major push, join the ranks of I.B.M. and Electronic Data Systems on the first tier.
But Mr. Bendor-Samual said the company faced tough challenges to achieve such growth, notably a need to integrate the two organizations, improve sales efforts, and overcome customer concern that may be growing in light of negative investor reaction to the merger.
"If they focus on it, they could really create some economies of scale," he said, referring to the services business. "If there are synergies in this merger, that is it."

HEADLINE: Ford Said to Be Considering Merging Engineering Operations 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Ford Motor may merge its North American car and truck engineering operations as part of its efforts to cut costs, The Detroit News reported earlier today.
 Ford directors were expected to approve the plan when they met today, The News reported. 
 "We don't have any announcement until the board meeting is done," Ford spokesman Jason Vines said, adding that the board was still meeting late into the day.
Last month, Ford eliminated bonuses for 6,000 top managers including its chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser, and said that it would eliminate as many as 5,000 salaried jobs.
In July, the company named Nick Scheele, the Ford of Europe chairman, to take over North American automaking operations. Merging the engineering operations would save money and make sense because many new vehicles combine elements of cars and trucks, analysts said.
"You have significant overlap," said David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, whose firm is one of the company's bankers. The distinction between new cars and trucks has disappeared, he said.
Ford's United States light-vehicle sales slid 12 percent in this year's first eight months, hurt by a slower economy and new truck products from rivals like Toyota Motor and General Motors. Ford, the second-largest automaker, has lost share in the American market, dropping to 21.9 percent from 23.6 percent for the first eight months of the year, according to Autodata, a research firm.
Ford shares fell 28 cents, to $19.97.

HEADLINE: Rock Stars Oppose Bush's Energy Plan and Ask Fans to Join Them 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE with BEN SPIESS 

DATELINE: HOLMDEL, N.J. 

 BODY:
David Crosby, the mustachioed, silver-haired third of Crosby, by Stills & Nash, claims not to think when he plays. "Gets in the way," he said.
 So on a cool night at the PNC Bank Arts Center here recently, he said he was on autopilot of sorts, tapping into something visceral, when he stepped up to the microphone after the trio's third song, "Deja Vu," and urged audience members to sign a petition at intermission against the Bush administration's energy policy. 
 "You'll find that most of us, most musicians, are very vocally opposed to not just what's laughably called an energy policy," Mr. Crosby said later, "but to this administration's complete disregard for the planet." 
Riled by an energy plan they call a sop to business and a grave threat to the environment, Crosby, Stills & Nash and about a dozen other popular bands joined together over the summer to stir their fans to action, as Congress prepares to consider significant energy legislation this autumn.
Part of an effort, organized by the drummer Michael Diamond, or Mike D., the founder of the Beastie Boys, with the help of several major environmental groups, performers as disparate in style and following as Jackson Browne, Moby, Matchbox 20 and the Barenaked Ladies have permitted volunteers to canvass their concerts for signatures against the energy plan. Most, like Mr. Crosby, have urged fans to sign petitions at the stadiums or online.
More than 30,000 signatures have been sent to Congress as a result of such efforts, said Stuart Trevelyan, a spokesman for Save Our Environment, the coalition of environmental organizations working with the musicians. Mr. Diamond, the singer Alanis Morissette and the Dave Matthews Band are sending e-mails to fans asking them to log their protests with the Senate via electronic postcards on saveourenvironment .org. The Dave Matthews Band alone has a 400,000-member e-mail list it plans to tap, Mr. Trevelyan said. 
Built on the assertion that the United States is suffering its worst energy crisis since the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the White House energy plan includes a range of measures that administration officials say balances environmental protection with the production of fuel supplies while also bolstering economic growth. The administration has taken some steps on its own, but it is up to Congress to introduce legislation that fleshes out a national energy policy. Environmentalists were rankled recently by a House energy bill that they said gave more than $30 billion in tax incentives to energy companies while calling for drilling in protected federal lands.
It remains to be seen whether the celebrities' campaign influences the energy plan, especially the aspects that most worry its critics, like opening more federal lands to oil and gas exploration. But so far, environmentalists are pleased to have such marquee names on their side. 
"We're about to have critical votes in the Senate," said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization. "And we need as many voices as possible speaking about the plan and reaching out to different people, and that's what these artists are doing."
Activism among musicians is hardly new. But if musicians 15 years ago rallied fans around heart-rending causes like famine in Africa, they have recently embraced more complex approaches to political and economic issues. Bono, the lead singer of U2, has joined advocates and economists to lobby industrialized countries to forgive the foreign debt of developing nations. The Beastie Boys, Moby and others regularly organize and play at benefits to aid Tibet. Sting and the Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir have performed to raise money to protect rain forests in the Amazon.
Fighting a Republican administration on the environment at a Crosby, Stills & Nash concert may seem like preaching to the choir, but as latecomers rushed to their seats in the PNC Bank Arts Center, most merely smiled at the Sierra Club's request for their signatures and then strode on. Still, the canvassers expected to get 500 to 600 signatures from the 17,000 people attending the concert that evening.
People stopped every few minutes to sign, despite the fact that the concert had already begun. "He's given away $33 billion in tax credits to big oil," a Sierra Club volunteer, Steve Ember, told Eileen Ford, 48, as she signed the petition and her husband, Kevin, waited his turn. 
Mr. Ford, who said he worked in management, needed no argument. "The fact that we rejected the Kyoto protocols was extremely shortsighted," he said, referring to the international treaty on reducing emissions linked to global warming. 
Mr. Diamond seemed to reach the same conclusion as he read about the details of the Bush energy plan when it was published in May. In a telephone interview from New York, he said he was particularly concerned about President Bush's proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling as a response to the electricity crisis in California. "If you think about it for more than a minute," Mr. Diamond said, "you realize that a pipeline that starts in Alaska is not going to get here for another 5 or 10 years."
Mr. Diamond contacted Adam Werbach, a former president of the Sierra Club, who, in turn, introduced him to the Save Our Environment coalition. Mr. Diamond cast around to other artists and said that because of their own concerns, they were easily convinced of the need to unite against the energy policy. 
On the Internet, Mr. Diamond calls on fans to act: "Dear peoples, though I rarely do stuff like this, pestering the masses, this is a topic that is too vital, too central and too important to our entire planet to ignore," his online letter says. "I'm asking for your help to stop George W. Bush's energy plan."
In legislation backed by the White House that is thick with arcane tax and economic-incentive schemes, drilling in the Arctic refuge in Alaska has become the most accessible symbol used by environmentalists to convey the clash between their priorities and those of the Bush energy plan. The message seems to have taken hold. 
Taking a pen held out at the New Jersey concert, 21-year-old Joshua Storch signed the petition and said, "I know all about Alaska and I'm totally opposed to drilling there."
In late July, when Ms. Morissette performed in Alaska, she spoke out against drilling in the refuge. Midway through her set at the Egan Center in downtown Anchorage, she urged the crowd to get involved in oil development issues and to sign the petition circulating in the lobby. But in oil-friendly Alaska, the pitch drew a mixed response of cheers, polite applause and a smattering of boos.
"This is the state that oil built," said Patrick Gillan, 32, who refused to sign the petition. Mr. Gillan pointed out the importance of oil in the state's economy: "Most Alaskans are pretty honest with themselves -- We need oil, and we need ANWR," he said, referring to the wildlife refuge by its acronym. 
Ms. Morissette tuned in to the debate over the refuge in June, after Mr. Diamond contacted her about the energy plan. She began researching the issue and digging into the environmental movement, reading "The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight," a book by Thom Hartmann about the environment and spirituality. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Werbach, the former Sierra Club president, also contacted Ms. Morissette about fighting development of the refuge. Her role, Ms. Morissette said, is as publicist, not policy expert. "By taking part in it myself, I hope I encourage people to do the same." 
Ms. Morissette's message resonated with many in the Anchorage audience, including those who had worked in the North Slope oil fields. Those circulating petitions said they gathered about 300 signatures, or roughly 70 percent of those they approached.
"One place in Alaska, one place on earth, should be left alone," said Rodney Jones, 46, as he signed. Mr. Jones said he had worked in the oil fields of Alaska in the 1980's.
Amy Lynnbille, 26, said that she had relatives who worked in the oil patch but that she opposed refuge development. "When have we done enough?"

Bringing a Pal Up to Speed On Politics

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
HI! Welcome back. Hope you had a great summer in Vermont.
 Good timing. Here we are at the end of a campaign, and it's just crystallizing. Might never have taken off if not for two guys who aren't even running, those helpful kibitzers Mayor Giuliani and Al Sharpton. 
 Before they made their moves, the campaign was just rambling along with Mark Green, the public advocate, leading in the polls and the three other main Democrats trailing, struggling to be second and praying Green wouldn't hit 40 percent, which would mean no runoff.
There were theories, though. It seemed likely that Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, would eventually emerge, because he is the only Latino candidate in the Democratic race, the city's Hispanic population is growing and while it's a guess how many will vote, most Latinos vote for Latinos the way most Jews vote for Jews, blacks for blacks. It's a New York custom.
So that possibility loomed early on. So did another: that the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi, would eventually connect with voters as the class of the field. But he kept getting into trouble, first when he sought Sharpton's support after dissing him in the past, then with the Campaign Finance Board when he tried to stretch its rules, ultimately with the mayor, who called him "ethically challenged" for arranging a business meeting for a contributor.
Hevesi began to look hapless and probably will not make it now. Same fate, it appears, for Peter Vallone, the Council speaker. His campaign has seemed tired, and though he's got the most conservative record of the four, he has promised a program of federal proportions to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and to support health care for children. With the economy weakening? Vallone doesn't seem to have built much on his white ethnic base, despite endorsements from The New York Post, The Daily News and Crain's New York Business.
And then there were two, Green and Ferrer. That's where we seem to be.
Ferrer got a substantial boost last week, when Sharpton endorsed him, though it is difficult to believe that the borough president could have leapt as high as the latest poll suggests. The Quinnipiac University poll of 303 people put Ferrer ahead of Green, 28 to 26 percent, after long showing him locked in second place with Vallone and Hevesi, well behind Green. Could Sharpton make such a difference, especially after the summer Green has had?
You missed most of it, but not only has he been lucky in his opponents, he's also run a smooth, careful campaign. Remember when his name was synonymous with liberal? He's managed quite the feat of remaking his reputation by watching his words, putting the brakes on his normally outspoken (O.K., brash) enthusiasm and talking a lot about crime and getting the endorsement of William Bratton, the former police commissioner.
David Dinkins and Calvin Butts are supporting Green, too, and the public advocate has long nurtured black support. He'll probably hold on to most of it, Sharpton or no Sharpton.
So get ready for a Ferrer-Green runoff. If so, back to politics as usual -- no longer dull, but inevitably divisive. Both candidates reject ethnic appeals. But Green is white (and Jewish). Ferrer is Puerto Rican. And this is New York.
YOU can sort of see where things are going. Ferrer, the mild, mainstream Democrat, who even supported the death penalty in 1997 when he hoped to challenge Giuliani (he now wants a moratorium), is running as the candidate of "the other New York."
Those New Yorkers left out of the prosperity of the Giuliani years are heavily black and Hispanic. Ferrer has prominent white supporters, but his ads are aimed at minorities and his backers are largely black and Hispanic -- members of the hospital union that endorsed him yesterday, for instance.
The borough president talks mostly about things of particular importance to minorities -- racial profiling, community policing, the state's harsh drug laws. And then there is that Sharpton endorsement, which will never sit well with many a white voter.
It's a problematic strategy because while it might get Ferrer into the runoff, how does he then reach out to the white voters he needs to defeat Green, not to mention Mike Bloomberg, who will probably be the Republican nominee?
This is going to be interesting. Maybe better than autumn in Vermont.
All best,
Your very own political junkie

Sharon in Moscow

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon returns to Israel today after two days of meetings in Moscow with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. 
 That struck me as odd; what was Sharon doing there during what some Israelis call "the Rosh Hashana war," the violence that began as they celebrated the Jewish New Year one year ago? Are the Russians, who are also meeting with Palestinian leaders, trying to insinuate themselves into Middle East negotiations? 
 Reached by telephone as he left his meeting with Putin, Sharon says no: "The Russians have no desire to replace the U.S. as mediators. Their position is much closer to the American one than the European one -- the Russians don't pressure us to bring in international observers." 
What brought Sharon to Moscow was partly to cement ties among the Russians, Israelis and Americans regarding intelligence-sharing to combat international terrorism. But the bloody guerrilla war launched last year against Israeli civilians, though infuriating and terrifying, does not pose a threat to Israel's existence. 
A greater danger comes from Iran, which Sharon notes "is calling for the destruction, the elimination of the state of Israel." Russia has been supplying Iran with scientists and materiel to build nuclear warheads on missiles. 
"I brought our top man in this field," says Sharon, "the head of our atomic energy agency. Moshe Kaplinsky met with their experts and the deputy head of their National Security Council, and they will have further meetings. I didn't ask for commitments because I don't believe in declarations, I believe in deeds. We'll discuss it further through Washington."
I'm told in Washington that Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke with Sharon on the eve of his Moscow trip, suggesting that the Israeli assure Putin that he has nothing to fear from America's limited national missile defense. Sharon did his bit in this ongoing calming. It may carry some weight because of another reason for Israel's engaging with the Russians: Both nations have much to offer each other in space technology and economic cooperation. 
In that phone call, Powell surely brought up the U.S. plan to stand up for its ally at the U.N. conference at Durban ostensibly about racism. Though Powell is taking some flak these days from media unhappy with his loyalty to President Bush's policies, he did precisely the right thing in yanking State's low-level delegation. Yasir Arafat had made a fool of well-meaning Jesse Jackson, who thought he had won agreement to avert an anti-Semitic blast, but Powell was not taken in. Our dramatic walkout shamed the Europeans out of acting like complete doormats for bigotry. 
Looking beyond the current Middle Eastern war of attrition, Sharon is thinking strategically about the strengthening of Israel's population. "Putin has energized Jewish communal life here, with Hebrew schools in 400 communities. It's like a golden era with freedom of worship. Matter of fact, it worries me because we want a million more Russian Jews. So I tell them, 'don't get used to it -- move to Israel.' "
The Israeli leader, who understands Russian, may be too optimistic about the former K.G.B. operative now stifling dissent at home and helping Iraq's Saddam Hussein remain in power. I tried the question on Sharon that embarrassed George W. Bush: Does he trust Putin? He didn't bite: "Yes, I trust him, but I remember what President Reagan said -- 'trust and verify.' " 
In Moscow, Sharon treated the Rosh Hashana war as a trial to be endured by a people who do not flinch from trials. In due time, Palestinians will have leaders who act not in a lust for land and vengeance but in their people's interest. Then, in the quiet that exhaustion brings, an accommodation will be reached that can go by the name of peace.
"I told Putin," says the resolute Sharon, "what I told Bush and Chirac and Blair: There is a different government now in Israel. We are doing what you would be doing in defending ourselves. We have been facing Arab and Muslim fundamentalist terror for 120 years, and we managed to bring millions of Jews here from a hundred countries, building a tremendous infrastructure -- while holding a sword in one hand."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE ISSUES; 
Tax Increases Would Cost Jobs, Mayor Warns

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, interjecting himself again into the contest to succeed him, warned yesterday that the Democratic mayoral candidates who have advocated tax increases risk hurting the city economy by forcing the elimination of thousands of jobs.
 "There is no question that there is an enormous correlation between cutting taxes and jobs," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday at the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. "Raising taxes will take us back to where we used to be, which is a city that locked people in poverty." 
 The remarks came as Mr. Giuliani presided over the release of a new study by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, that concluded that city tax cuts over the past four years created about 80,000 private sector jobs, or about a fourth of overall job growth since 1997.
The study, prepared with the assistance of a Boston economist, David G. Tuerck, uses 25 years of data on city tax changes and compares them with dips or increases in employment and other variables. Out of that comparison, a formula is devised that is used to estimate how recently imposed or proposed changes in city tax rates might affect overall employment.
The report suggested that without the tax cuts imposed over the past four years, the employment growth in New York City would most likely have been just under the national average of 0.4 percent. But with more than $2 billion in tax cuts in that period, employment in the city jumped nearly 11 percent.
"In every prior economic expansion since 1950, including a couple of roaring bull markets on Wall Street, New York City has trailed annual job growth in the rest of the country," said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the chief author of the study. "The difference this time has been tax cuts."
Based on this analysis, the same study suggested that reversing a small personal income tax cut approved this year, as Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, has advocated to help pay for after-school programs, would ultimately wipe out about 6,335 jobs. 
An even larger increase in personal income tax, which Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said he would consider if necessary to reduce class sizes and make other school improvements, could cost 24,500 jobs, the study suggested.
Mark Green, the public advocate, has said he would support "as a last resort" raising taxes to pay for police protection or improving schools, but unlike Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Hevesi he has not specified which taxes he might increase. And Peter F. Vallone, the Council speaker, has ruled out any tax increases if elected mayor.
Spokesmen for Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Hevesi defended their tax proposals yesterday, saying that regardless of the mayor's comments, more money must be invested in city schools or after-school programs, which they said had been neglected during the Giuliani administration. 
"We risk losing a generation of children," said Josh Isay, a spokesman for Mr. Hevesi.

HEADLINE: Government Is Wary of Tackling Online Privacy 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Mozelle W. Thompson took a stroll last summer through the Silicon Alley Street Fair, a celebration of New York City's dot-coms back when they had something to celebrate. His T-shirt and shorts belied his high office as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the federal agency that has taken the lead in consumer privacy protection online. He met the chief executive of a high-technology company that gathers personal data on Internet users, a man who was, Mr. Thompson said, "treating people as data instead of treating people as people."
 Mr. Thompson asked the executive whether he worried that regulators might some day crack down on his business practices. Mr. Thompson's eyes went wide as he recalled the man's answer: "I'm going to do as much as I can, as fast as I can -- until somebody stops me." As for the Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Thompson said, "He didn't know me, and he didn't know us. 
 "But I assured him he would." 
Since then, the world has changed, and not just for the dot-coms. Momentum has dissipated in Washington for new laws and regulations that might restrict the use of cookies and other high-technology tools by businesses to monitor Internet users' activities. Some lawmakers say that the politics of privacy is so touchy and complex that a deliberate approach is best -- but there is growing agreement that some kind of government action will eventually have to emerge.
Mr. Thompson still serves on the Federal Trade Commission, but Robert Pitofsky, the chairman who led many of the commission's privacy initiatives, has been replaced by Timothy J. Muris, a former trade official in the Reagan administration who has said he is still studying the privacy issue. President Bill Clinton, who appointed Mr. Pitofsky and Mr. Thompson, has been replaced by President Bush, whose executive branch team has been less than enthusiastic about expanding regulatory authority over businesses.
Movement toward legislation restricting invasions of consumer privacy by business has slowed in Congress, as well: although the chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, has a strong interest in privacy, the Senate is currently bogged down in the appropriations process and other issues. The leadership of the House has called for the debate to be refocused on the misdeeds of the government rather than those of companies.
"Let's see to it that the government is handling privacy mandates properly before we start mandating privacy rules for the private sector," said Richard Armey, the House majority leader, in an interview, citing such examples as government Web sites that store personal information, the F.B.I. Internet wiretap system known as Carnivore and cameras that photograph motorists who run red lights.
Some in Congress say that the loss of momentum to regulate technologies like cookies can be attributed to a more subtle understanding of the interplay of privacy and technology. Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont who has long been concerned about privacy issues, said that he and other lawmakers had realized that simple responses to privacy fears, like sharply restricting the use of cookies, would do more harm than good.
"Cookies have gotten bad press as a surveillance tool, but they also make Web site visits faster and online transactions more hassle-free," Senator Leahy said in an e-mail response to a reporter's questions. "These are important functions for Internet users, and any regulation of the use of cookies must be sufficiently nuanced to ensure that we do not throw the proverbial baby out with the bath." 
Little wonder that privacy has emerged as one of the thorniest issues for policy makers, said Peter Swire, the former privacy counselor to Mr. Clinton. The issues are complex, and they pit passionate public opinion against equally powerful business interests. "The strongest impetus for action and the strongest resistance to action have come together on the Internet privacy debate," he said.
Federal efforts to regulate privacy took off within the Federal Trade Commission in 1995, recalled a former staff member, David Medine, when "we realized the Internet collects a lot of information about people cheaply, efficiently and sometimes in unprecedented ways -- like what you looked at as opposed to what you bought, which in a store would never be collected." After working with industry to develop self-regulation efforts, the commission asked Congress last year to expand its legal authority to regulate privacy efforts when self-regulation fails.
That call for Congressional action has gone unheeded. But several laws have been passed in recent years in the areas of highest concern to voters. Financial institutions must now send out notices describing their privacy policies under the terms of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and new health care privacy regulations are coming into effect because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The privacy of children has been shored up because of restrictions on data collection under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. 
These laws, however, leave some elements of privacy protected and others utterly exposed. Privacy advocates see the job of filling in the holes as their challenge; business sees it as a threat.
At least 50 privacy-related bills are awaiting consideration this year, many of them new versions of bills introduced in the last session of Congress. No matter how varied the legislation, proposals generally come down to a few crucial requirements and distinctions. Most require that consumers be notified of the ways companies collect data and the use they will put that information to and require that companies give consumers the ability to say no to such collection. 
The crucial distinction is the way consumers can say no: by "opting in" or "opting out." For example, a recent Senate bill co-sponsored by John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, would require companies to give consumers the right not to have their personal information collected via cookies or other technologies.
The bill would set a standard, but consumers must make the effort to "opt out" of data collection, which means most will, through inertia or ignorance, stay on the rolls. Privacy advocates generally favor a higher "opt in" standard, which would prohibit collection of information without explicit permission from consumers -- an approach taken by another bill introduced by Senator Hollings in 2000; a version will be reintroduced this fall.
Whatever route lawmakers choose, said Priscilla M. Regan, an associate professor of government at George Mason University in Virginia, privacy is exactly the kind of area in which government action can lead to a benefit to citizens. "The costs to the individual are just enormously high in terms of time and energy and an individual's attention to detail," she said. 
Even though most people do not take action to preserve their privacy, the rights of those who do want protection have to be upheld, said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. "The right of privacy is not simply a ratification of a majority practice," he said. He compared safeguarding personal data to the American system of food safety, which gives consumers control over what they purchase but leaves a role for government in protection beyond the capabilities of individuals. "Not many of us have a fully equipped U.S.D.A. lab in our basement that we can run two pounds of chuck through at night when we get back from the supermarket." 
Representative Armey, Republican of Texas, disagrees. He sent a letter to his colleagues in April warning them against taking any action in the current legislative session because, in his view, government can only make a mess of privacy. "Congress is an inexperienced and amateur mechanic trying to tinker with the supercharged, high-tech engine of our economy," he said. "We need to be careful not to let our good intentions get in the way of common sense."
Lawmakers like Mr. Armey are bolstered in their efforts to slow the march of legislation by a flood of new studies and surveys sponsored by high-technology companies, questioning consumer attitudes about privacy and giving multibillion-dollar estimates of the costs of complying with such laws. 
Thus a study by Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research center in Washington, concludes that complying with privacy legislation proposals would cost companies a staggering $30 billion. Such figures help industry spokesmen like Jonathan Zuck of the Association for Competitive Technology, which paid for the Hahn study, to argue that "the costs associated with regulation appear to be higher than the benefits achieved by regulation." 
Robert Gellman, a privacy consultant in Washington, calls the new crop of studies "put-up jobs" with inflated estimates. He ridicules the private sector's opposition to legislation, saying, "The industry is willing to spend millions for studies, but nothing for privacy."
Mr. Hahn defends his study, saying that if anything, the estimates are conservative. He has also drawn attention recently with a study suggesting that the benefits of lowering arsenic levels in drinking water would not justify the costs. "I made my best assessment," he said. 
The price of inaction, however, could be precisely the kind of overreaction that Senator Leahy warns against, legislative experts say. Highly visible violations of privacy have tended to generate specific -- and, often, narrow -- legal responses, leading to a patchwork of legal remedies. Lawmakers were quick to pass legislation making it illegal to release video-rental records after a list of rentals by Robert Bork, a Supreme Court nominee, was leaked, for example. And Florida moved to seal autopsy records after a fight over publishing the death photos of the Nascar racer Dale Earnhardt.
Quick-fix legislation rarely fixes anything but lawmakers' standing in the polls, said Stewart A. Baker, an lawyer in Washington who consults with companies on technology policy issues. Legislation is "often just a set of palliatives" that is unlikely to do much for consumers, he said.
"All that allows you to do," he added, "is that you can say, 'Well, we passed a law.' " 
The Internet has presented a never-ending set of complaints: consumers and privacy advocates raged when the online advertising giant Doubleclick announced in 1999 its intention to combine personal data identifying many visitors to its affiliated Web sites with a large database of catalog shopping information that it acquired in a merger with a company called Abacus Direct. Another company, Toysmart, raised consumer fears in 2000 when it tried to sell its user records to raise money in bankruptcy proceedings; the company's data included personal information on children. But privacy experts say they worry about the dangers of government overreaction to such episodes. Public concern over cookies, for example, has already led to some results that even the most ardent privacy advocates say have been bizarre. Last year, the Clinton administration, for example, prohibited the use of cookies on any federal Web site without permission from the head of the site's agency -- a decree that ignored the usefulness of cookies in helping visitors to a Web site remember where they have been and to ease their navigation. 
"I think the government has swung too far," said Mr. Rotenberg, the privacy advocate. "Everything is without any historical dimension. It's, 'Help! There's a cookie on my computer! Someone get in here!' "
That is why Mr. Swire says, in fact, that the current lull might be helpful, so long as a full-bodied debate on privacy continues. "We should learn from our medical and financial privacy experience," he said, "and now we're getting a chance to do so." The stakes, Mr. Swire added, are huge: "It's not just human rights, and it's not just burden on industry. It's how to get the rules and the systems right for the information age." 
One way or another, Mr. Rotenberg said, new privacy laws will emerge. "I don't think that Mr. Armey and the Republicans and the army of lobbyists that surround our president can make this issue go away." He suggested that the crisis-to-crisis collage of laws should be reshaped into "a legal framework that sets out how these technologies are used." 
Business itself could lead the charge for legislation, said Mr. Gellman, the privacy consultant -- especially if the federal lawmakers are reluctant to act and states take up the issue. That could lead to a patchwork of inconsistent and even conflicting laws in many states. That, in turn, could bring companies back to Washington to lobby for a federal privacy law that would set a national standard and nullify, or pre-empt, state efforts. "You know who really wants privacy legislation -- and won't admit it -- is industry, because they want pre-emption," he said.
Sensing the troubles to come, Mr. Thompson of the Federal Trade Commission issued a warning earlier this year to executives at a high-technology conference in New York: Without the legal protection that comes with regulatory structure, he said, horror stories will accumulate and damage will be done and "your stock valuation will continue to sink into the sunset."
The companies, he said, will have to prove to consumers that giving up privacy is a trade -- something companies can prove will repay them in convenience and services, without the nasty surprises of seeing the information leak out into the broader world.
"The worst thing we could do to you," he said, "is to do nothing."

The first article in this series examined how cookies came to be and the way they changed the Web; the second discussed the difficulty that consumers have in maintaining their privacy as online activity increases and the means to monitor it grow more sophisticated.

(Susana Raab for The New York Times)(pg. C6) Chart: "Also Watching You Online"Cookies are only one of the technology tools that can be used to monitor what people do online. Here are some others: WEB BUGS are often placed invisibly on Web pages by third parties like advertising networks; they place a cookie on the visitor's machine and can be used to monitor users' activities across many sites. E-MAIL BUGS are similar to Web bugs but are planted within e-mail and relay information back to the sender, like whether a message was opened. SPYWARE is a common term for software that checks in with the manufacturer's servers. It is often used to look for updates but sometimes also sends reports on a user's activities. (pg. C6)

HEADLINE: Courting Blacks and Latinos, Ferrer Is Walking Fine Line 

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS and ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer leapt onto a stage at the headquarters of the hospital workers union yesterday and declared that his candidacy was built on the support of an ideological "coalition of conscience," and not simply a coalition of black and Latino voters seeking to elect New York's first Puerto Rican mayor.
 "When we have a city that doesn't work well for all New Yorkers, that is why I'm running for mayor," Mr. Ferrer said exuberantly, accepting the endorsement of 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union. 
 "The 'other New York' is everywhere in this city where people feel the city hasn't worked well for them," he continued, adding, "The other New York is not some narrow coalition." As Mr. Ferrer spoke, he looked across a cheering audience that was almost entirely nonwhite. Mr. Ferrer then invited officials supporting him to the stage, producing another mostly nonwhite tableau. 
The scene yesterday reflected the underlying duality of Mr. Ferrer's candidacy as he enters the final week of a Democratic primary in which, once again, ethnicity and race promise to be a central factor in determining the outcome.
On one hand, his advisers assert that the key to Mr. Ferrer's victory in a crowded field is his success at rallying black and Latino voters, whose numbers are increasing at a faster clip than campaigns can calculate, along with white liberals, who tend to turn out in large numbers.
But if Mr. Ferrer is perceived as running a campaign driven by ethnic appeals -- suggested by some of his recent television and radio advertisements, as well as his decision to campaign with the Rev. Al Sharpton -- he risks pushing away those white voters who his aides say are integral to his electoral calculation.
As it is, many Democrats believe the direction Mr. Ferrer has taken in this campaign already -- he has run more to the left and against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani than any Democrat since David N. Dinkins in 1993 -- is going to make it difficult for him to win his party's nomination and the mayoralty. 
Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader and one of Mr. Ferrer's senior advisers, has from the earliest days sketched out a campaign in which late polls would show Mr. Ferrer moving ahead -- a poll on Tuesday by Quinnipiac University suggested precisely that -- and Latino voters would rush to Mr. Ferrer's candidacy and push him over 40 percent next Tuesday and into the runoff two weeks later. 
But the results of this underlying conflict in the Ferrer campaign have become increasingly evident in the final days of this campaign.
Mr. Ferrer the candidate avoids direct appeals based on race and ethnicity, which his aides have strongly advised him to avoid. But his campaign has quite explicitly appealed for black and Latino votes, with the use of precisely aimed television and radio advertisements, campaign literature and the choice of issues, like an emphasis on racial profiling by the police.
So it is that at his rally with the health care workers yesterday, Mr. Ferrer took pains to avoid describing his campaign in anything other than ideological terms, talking about the need for less expensive housing and for spending more on schools. As he campaigns, Mr. Ferrer likes to point to the prominent white support he has picked up so far, like the endorsements of former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. And he sometimes tells people not to vote for him solely because he is Puerto Rican.
By contrast, in one Ferrer television advertisement, a young black couple walk together down a dark street, looking on nervously as a blue police siren flashes by. On the radio, in time purchased mostly on black radio stations, the Rev. Al Sharpton implores listeners to choose Mr. Ferrer because he understands "our community," while Representative Charles E. Rangel, the Harlem Democrat, says in an ad first shown yesterday that Mr. Ferrer understands "our problems."
In a Spanish-language television commercial, a sea of Puerto Rican flags flash across the screen while a narrator reminds viewers that "Fernando Ferrer es uno de nosotros." ("Fernando Ferrer is one of us.") On the campaign trail, he frequently speaks Spanish before predominantly Latino audiences.
And in recent days, Mr. Ferrer has been increasingly attacking Mark Green, whom he views as his principal rival for black support, for his endorsement by William J. Bratton, who was the first police commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
A Ferrer leaflet given out in Harlem shows a handcuffed Mr. Ferrer being led away by the police during a protest against the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, a black man killed by the police. The other pictures on it show Mr. Ferrer with Mr. Sharpton and other black leaders, including Mr. Rangel and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. The only white person in the ad is Ruth W. Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president who ran for mayor in 1997.
Mr. Ferrer's advisers say that he is simply conducting campaigns the way they have been conducted for years, and taking advantage of his own ethnic heritage much the same way, for example, Mr. Giuliani appealed to pride among Italian-Americans or Edward I. Koch campaigned among Jews.
And no one has suggested that in trying to assemble a coalition of blacks and Latinos, Mr. Ferrer is excluding any voters. Mr. Ramirez repeatedly argues that even in this changing city, Latinos and blacks alone will not make Mr. Ferrer New York's next mayor.
"Let's be honest, if you are talking about racial profiling, then it would be odd to have a white couple in a TV spot," said David Axelrod, Mr. Ferrer's media adviser. 
Mr. Ferrer said, "If some people believe that a message of hope and opportunity is some kind of zero-sum game, that to give somebody hope you have to take it away from somebody else, I'm here to tell you that that is dead wrong."
Beyond that, he and his aides say that Mr. Ferrer's advocacy for the other New York is based on economics, rather than ethnicity, aimed at people who were left out of the economic boom of the last several years. But even among Mr. Ferrer's supporters the campaign has been clumsy at times, trying to juggle these complicated forces, which perhaps accounts for the low level of white support he has in some polls. 
By contrast, when Mr. Dinkins campaigned to be New York's first black mayor in 1989, he left no doubt he was trying to assemble a coalition that included black and Latino voters, but described his effort as trying to assemble a "gorgeous mosaic."
"He's been fairly explicit throughout the race, and then he denies that he's doing it," said Joe DePlasco, Mr. Green's spokesman. "We do not make racial appeals. What we do try to do is speak to every community."
As suggested by Mr. DePlasco's remarks, Mr. Green's campaign seems aware of the risks inherent in Mr. Ferrer's strategy, and seems inclined, at a time each man views the other as his main rival, to take advantage of it. Mr. Green, who has generally avoided engaging any opponents, yesterday took caustic note of the fact that Sonny Carson, a black political activist who calls himself "antiwhite," told The Village Voice that he was backing Mr. Ferrer.
"I think people like Floyd Flake, Calvin Butts and David Dinkins should jump off the white bandwagons and join what is happening," Mr. Carson told The Voice.
Mr. Green, asked about that, said: "I always thought it's improper to impute the views of a supporter to the candidate. But if you ask me about Sonny Carson, my last recollection was he said he is not anti-Semitic, he was antiwhite. And when someone is an unrepentant racist and anti-Semite, I'd have nothing to do with him on a campaign like this."
Mr. Ferrer responded that he did not seek Mr. Carson's support, and added, "If he does it on the basis of race and ethnicity, I reject it."
With the makeup of the city changing so quickly, and primaries so unpredictable, a critical question in the week ahead is the ethnic makeup of the primary vote on Sept. 11. vote. Mr. Ferrer's advisers are counting on a historically high turnout as part of their calculation.
John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center, said that based on past patterns, he expected the whites to make up about half the turnout, with blacks a third and Latinos up to 15 percent. Although the Hispanic population has been climbing quickly, its registration and turnout rate is still relatively low, he said.
That could change with this race, Mr. Mollenkopf said, particularly if Mr. Ferrer succeeds in exciting ethnic passions about his candidacy. 
"For the first time, there is a Latino candidate with a good shot at winning," he said. "Will Ferrer be able to galvanize the Latino vote in the same way that Dinkins galvanized the black vote? We don't know."

HEADLINE: The Politics of a Promise 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
For all the partisan fighting over the disappearing federal budget surplus, Republicans and Democrats are in lock step on one issue: the desirability of sticking to their promises not to use any money intended for Social Security to pay for other programs.
 The reality is that meeting that goal for the next few years will be difficult if not impossible, especially if the economy does not perk up. Recognizing that they are headed toward breaking their promises, both parties are putting strategies in place to minimize any political penalty -- and to make sure they are not seen as being the first to violate that benchmark for fiscal responsibility. 
 Democrats are doing their best to blame President Bush and his tax cut. 
The administration is trying to shift the focus from the budget to the economy, saying that the tax cut was essential to averting a recession and that the revenue shortfall is largely a result of a slowdown that started a year ago under President Bill Clinton.
But in their relentless focus on the politics of the surplus, Democrats and Republicans alike have been almost silent on the question of whether maintaining a fiscal policy that was developed in a period of boomlike prosperity and rising surpluses still makes economic sense.
In a sharp slowdown that is still threatening to become something worse, good economics could end up conflicting with political imperatives.
The issue is being debated behind the scenes in Washington, and among economists. And the debate is likely to get far more intense if the economy does not recover in coming months.
Textbook economics suggests that a government should seek to stimulate a weakened or contracting economy through some combination of lower taxes and higher spending. It was just that theory that led Congress and the administration to send rebate checks this summer to people who pay income taxes, putting $38 billion into the hands of consumers.
But the tax cut was formulated when Washington had a surplus to play with outside of Social Security. For the next few years, the only surplus will come almost exclusively from Social Security, money that the two parties agree should be used only to reduce the national debt.
If the economy remained weak, Congress and the administration would find themselves not only in a squeeze on spending but constrained from giving the economy another boost through further tax cuts. 
If they took their commitment to maintaining the Social Security surplus literally, they could even find it forcing them to raise taxes and cut spending as the economy weakened -- the opposite of what economic theory says would be the correct response.
Even some backers of the Social Security commitment say there is sure to be a re-examination of the issue.
"It's a complicated question," said Robert E. Rubin, who as treasury secretary in the Clinton administration as much as anyone created the policy of leaving the Social Security surplus untouched.
Mr. Rubin said he was not ready to rethink the policy. But he said that if there was going to be a debate, it should encompass the broader issue of shoring up the long-term fiscal outlook, which he said was badly undermined by Mr. Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut.
"The economically sound thing to do is debate it in the context of fixing the long term," Mr. Rubin said in an interview. "The re-establishment of a sound fiscal position was central to the good things that happened in the eight years through 2000, and it's critically important going forward."
In economic terms, analysts said, spending part of the Social Security surplus -- projected by the administration to be $171 billion next year -- would do no discernible harm in the short run.
"There's no economic consequence to a modest use of the surplus," said Thomas Gallagher, a political analyst with the International Strategy and Investment Group, an investment-advisory firm.
Should the economy remain weak and Congress and the administration stick to their policy of not touching the Social Security surplus, it could deprive the government of an important economic tool, leaving the Federal Reserve without much additional help from fiscal policy.
Mr. Gallagher said, "To the extent we may be into a post-bubble economy characterized by weak demand for a period of time, where an active policy of fiscal stimulus would be appropriate, sticking to this doctrine would appear to preclude that."
Spending part of the Social Security surplus would not by itself have any immediate effect on the government's ability to pay Social Security benefits.
But both parties have made much of their commitment to paying off the national debt, a goal that would be attained more slowly, at best, if Washington returned to a regular policy of spending part of the Social Security surplus. 
And by their own slogans -- promising to prevent "raids" on the Social Security and Medicare trust funds -- Democrats and Republicans have left at least some voters with the impression that their retirement benefits could be at risk right away if fiscal discipline erodes.
A case can be made that the economy has benefited, and will continue to benefit, from showing financial markets and investors around the world that the United States government can keep its finances in order.
As a result, both parties are convinced there could be a heavy political price to pay if they are judged to have put other priorities ahead of the health of the old-age programs.
"Social Security trumps everything else, except the economy," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "Candidates better have a darned good reason -- and it better be a dire reason -- for messing with the so-called trust fund."
While Republican members of Congress remain fixated on not dipping into the Social Security surplus, Mr. Bush is taking a more flexible stance. He has dodged questions about whether he would veto spending bills that required use of the Social Security money. And he has spoken of how his promise not to use the Social Security surplus for general purposes would be withdrawn in the case of war or recession.
Administration officials have not defined what they would consider a recession, but have hinted that it would not necessarily have to mean the classic definition of two consecutive quarters in which the economy contracted.
Democrats do not have a clear strategy either. They are trying to force Mr. Bush to say how he would pay for his proposal for more military spending, and how the budget could accommodate bipartisan calls for more spending on education and the creation of a prescription drug benefit for the elderly, without dipping into Social Security.
Beyond that, though, they have done little more than hint that they might want to revisit Mr. Bush's tax cut, to scale back or eliminate some provisions that are scheduled to take effect in coming years. That course, though, has obvious political and economic problems.
"This is not simply business as usual," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. "We've got a problem. And if the economy gets any worse, then we've got an even bigger problem."

HEADLINE: Mr. Fox Comes to Washington 

 BODY:
All the pomp and circumstance of Vicente Fox's arrival on the South Lawn of the White House yesterday could not mask the diminished expectations of the Mexican president's state visit to Washington. With both the American and Mexican economies stalled and the blush off Mr. Fox's reform presidency, a lot less will come of the visit than the two leaders hoped when they set the date earlier this year. Given the depth and complexity of the relationship between the neighboring nations, that may not be a bad thing. 
 There is no doubt that this is a time of greater interdependence, and warmer ties, between the United States and Mexico. The improved relationship is reflected in growing cooperation on immigration, drug trafficking and other traditionally nettlesome issues. Mr. Fox, who defeated the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in last year's election, enjoys a democratic legitimacy that his predecessors could not claim and a good personal rapport with President Bush. 
 Good will, however, cannot instantly solve the divisive issues that still strain relations between the nations, especially the illegal movement of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans across the border. Last February the two presidents directed aides to fashion a broad new deal on immigration by the time Mr. Fox came to Washington. 
That proved unrealistic. The White House considered legalizing the status of a large portion of the more than three million Mexicans working illegally in the United States by incorporating them into an expanded guest-worker program. But after gauging the opposition on Capitol Hill and watching the downturn in the American economy, the White House now favors a more gradual approach, and seems unsure when a deal can be reached. 
Mr. Fox did not hide his impatience yesterday when he challenged Mr. Bush at the welcoming ceremonies to reach an agreement by the end of the year. While the Fox timetable may make for good politics in Mexico, Mr. Bush needs more time to build political support for an agreement that resolves the immigration problem in a responsible way that benefits both countries.
Economic stagnation in the United States has also limited Mr. Fox's options on a range of domestic issues. Mexico, now the United States' second-largest trading partner, is integrated as never before into the American economy in the aftermath of the North American Free Trade Agreement. As a result, the slowdown north of the Rio Grande has produced a recession in Mexico. 
The economic problems have hindered Mr. Fox's plan to increase public spending to combat poverty. Combined with his failure to sell his legislative program to opposition parties that control the Mexican Congress, the recession has hampered the Fox administration's reform agenda. 
Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox had reason to toast one another last evening at the first state dinner to be held by Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura. There has never been a better relationship between Mexican and American presidents. Even so, celebrations to mark the completion of a new immigration agreement will have to wait.

HEADLINE: U.S. Diplomat Said to Protest China Actions On First Boston 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
The United States ambassador to China, Clark T. Randt Jr., decided not to attend a dinner with Chinese officials tonight, apparently in protest over China's recent blacklisting of Credit Suisse First Boston. The investment bank angered Beijing by inviting senior Taiwan government officials to speak at conferences it sponsored earlier this year.
 The United States Embassy in Beijing declined to comment, and a State Department official in Washington would say only that Mr. Randt had skipped the dinner, aimed at promoting investment on the mainland, because "it was not convenient." But other American officials said Mr. Randt made his decision after China withdrew an invitation to Credit Suisse First Boston. 
 China recently removed Credit Suisse First Boston from the list of underwriters for a multibillion-dollar stock offering planned by the China Unicom Group, China's second-largest telecommunications company. China was apparently punishing the bank for having invited Taiwan's finance minister, Yen Ching-chang, to give the keynote speech at a conference in Hong Kong in March. 
The bank, a subsidiary of the Credit Suisse Group of Zurich, further angered China by arranging a five-nation European tour for officials from Taiwan to promote the island's economy and companies.
China's move against Credit Suisse First Boston led two other investment banks, Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch, to drop plans to sponsor a similar promotional tour of the United States, Taiwan officials say.
China regards Taiwan as a province. And though Beijing has increasingly encouraged commercial ties with Taiwan, it has also continued to retaliate against countries or companies that afford the island's leaders official status abroad, or even refer to Taiwan as a country. 
Occasionally, China presses companies to join in its propaganda campaign. Last year, Coca-Cola dropped a mainland advertising campaign that featured a Taiwan pop star after she angered China by singing the Taiwan national anthem at the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian.
But the State Department apparently viewed China's latest rebuke as going too far. 
"When it had an immediate effect and made Goldman and Merrill both run for cover, that's what made the State Department decide to come up with a response and send a message," said a senior staff member on Capitol Hill. Officials in Washington said that China should not go unchallenged if it played politics in the economic arena, particularly as it prepares to join the World Trade Organization.
China Unicom; Goldman, Sachs; and Merrill Lynch all declined to comment, as did officials at the China Securities Regulatory Commission. 
A Credit Suisse First Boston spokesman in Hong Kong also declined to comment, other than to say that "this is a serious matter and is a priority for our senior management."
John J. Mack, the new chief executive of Credit Suisse First Boston, has close ties in China. Before he resigned as president of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter early this year, Mr. Mack was a director of the China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank that is a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and the state-owned China Construction Bank.
The ambassador's action suggests that the brewing contention over the Credit Suisse First Boston ban is not likely to end soon. It also highlights Mr. Randt's close ties to the investment banking community. Before his appointment this spring as ambassador, Mr. Randt worked as a mergers and acquisition lawyer in Hong Kong, representing both Chinese companies and American investment banks. 
He was largely responsible for getting Credit Suisse First Boston's American subsidiary, then called the First Boston Corporation, the job as lead underwriter of China's first public stock listing in the United States nearly a decade ago. 
But Mr. Randt has also seen China punish investment banks before. In the early 1990's, Beijing barred Morgan Stanley from underwriting a portion of a $4.2 billion share offering by China Telecom Hong Kong Ltd. after the investment bank angered Beijing by predicting a sharp decline in Hong Kong and Chinese share prices. Mr. Randt worked on the share offering.
Chinese investment bankers expressed surprise today that the ambassador would take any action, official or unofficial, in response to the controversy, which most people here expected to disappear after Beijing's message had sunk in with the investment banking community.
"It's not going to help Credit Suisse First Boston," said a prominent Chinese banker in Beijing, adding that a protest by the United States government would only anger Beijing.

HEADLINE: DEFENDING BUDGET, BUSH AIDES TAKE FIGHT TO CONGRESS 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush's budget director and defense secretary mounted a vigorous defense of the Bush budget today in separate appearances on Capitol Hill, insisting that the administration and Congress could protect the Social Security surplus and still increase military and education spending.
 But Democrats intensified their attacks against Mr. Bush, blaming his $1.35 trillion tax cut for the shrinking federal surplus and asking him to submit a budget that would protect Social Security funds. 
 "This is a result of the Bush budget and the Bush tax cut," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, of the dwindling surplus. "Certainly, they're the architects of our current economic condition, and I think we have to turn to them for leadership now as we find our way out of the box that has been created." 
Coming on Congress's first full day back at work, today's jousting opened what is expected to be a bitter fight over the budget, as Congress tries to enact spending bills by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
Throughout the day, each side sought to blame the other for the shrinking surplus and position itself to avoid responsibility for what many economists consider the inevitable: using surplus Medicare and Social Security money to pay for spending increases. News analysis, Page A18. 
Last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the government would almost certainly have to use Social Security revenues to pay bills this year because of the economic downturn and the tax cut. The report also predicted that Congress would have a relatively small $2 billion surplus outside the Social Security system next year, not enough to cover just the increases in the Pentagon budget needed to keep up with inflation.
In testimony before the House Budget Committee today, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the Office of Management and Budget, urged Congress "to honor" President Bush's budget, asserting that surplus Social Security money would not have to be spent if lawmakers did not exceed the spending plan.
"The budget, as proposed by the president, and the budget resolution that now sits before the Congress, if not exceeded, will allow the funding of our nation's priorities -- defense, education, debt reduction -- all consistent with the full protection of the Social Security surplus for debt reduction," Mr. Daniels said.
In the Senate, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told a subcommittee that the Pentagon would need "every nickel" of the administration's proposed $33 billion increase in military spending to begin repairing decrepit bases, replacing aging equipment and improving benefits for the troops.
A pressing problem for Mr. Rumsfeld is that if Congress adds spending to the president's budget -- as it almost always does -- and if both parties stand by their promise not to touch the Social Security surplus, the money would probably come out of the Pentagon budget. 
For the 2002 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, Mr. Bush has requested an additional $18.3 billion for the Pentagon and a $669 million increase for education. Republicans and Democrats have proposed raising the president's education request by $5 billion to $16 billion.
House Republican leaders are also pushing for a new, immediate tax cut package, including a reduction in the capital gains tax, that they say would boost the economy. The White House has been open but not enthusiastic about those proposals.
With the economic terrain shifting so rapidly, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri and the minority leader in the House, reiterated today his request to Mr. Bush to write a new budget, one that would reflect the stumbling economy and the slimmer surplus.
"Ever since the budget was presented, we have seen increasingly pessimistic or increasingly different budget forecasts and economic forecasts, and the economy has changed before our eyes," Mr. Gephardt said. "I would hope the president would give us a new budget in light of the completely new numbers that we're looking at."
But the administration immediately rejected that demand. In Mr. Rumsfeld's testimony, he said that the extra Pentagon spending sought in the Bush plan was vital to the nation's security. 
"The budget request does not solve the problems of the department," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "It begins to repair the damage that's been done by a long period of underfunding."
Mr. Rumsfeld also warned the Democrats against trying to reduce Mr. Bush's proposed $8.3 billion budget for missile defense, saying that any cuts to the program would weaken the president's hand in negotiating with the Russians on a new strategic framework to replace the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty.
"To the extent the Russians develop a perception that the United States is not interested in going forward in providing defense against ballistic missiles or that we're split on that issue, obviously it's in their interest to not come to any agreements with us," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
In a sign that the Democrats face internal divisions over military spending, Senator Daniel Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, told Mr. Rumsfeld that he would do everything in his power to make sure the Pentagon receives its full $329 billion budget request. But Mr. Inouye also warned that the fight would be difficult.
"Many of our colleagues are going to be reluctant to cut into Medicare and Social Security to pay for defense," said Mr. Inouye, who is chairman of the subcommittee on defense appropriations. "Politically, they worry that the voters will penalize them for raiding Social Security."
But Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, who is the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee and a member of the appropriations defense subcommittee, said next year's surplus would be large enough to accommodate the administration's entire Pentagon budget. And even if it is not, Mr. Domenici suggested, dipping into surplus Social Security revenues, as Congress did for decades, might stimulate the economy.
"How do we get the American economy to come back?" Mr. Domenici said in the subcommittee hearing. "I don't believe you cut spending when you have this kind of recession."
With Democrats deferring on what should be done to correct the situation, leaving it to Mr. Bush to make the first move, Republicans in the House and Senate seemed at odds over what course to follow.
Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader from Texas, reiterated his commitment to leaving the surplus untouched and said he was pushing for a package that would include a cut in the capital gains tax, expanding trade, and making permanent a tax credit on research and development.
Mr. Armey also said House Republicans are considering making Mr. Bush's 10-year tax cut permanent. Another proposal, he said, involved setting aside any money that exceeded the budget spending limits, a procedure that is called sequestration.
Mr. Bush had a lukewarm reaction to a cut in the capital gains tax when he met with Congressional leaders on Tuesday. And Senate Democrats called the idea dead on arrival. 
Those Democrats, however, backed away from suggestions that the president's tax cut be rescinded. 
"There's no way that's going to happen this year," said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "We shouldn't have a tax increase in the midst of an economic slowdown."

HEADLINE: At G.E., Whither The House Jack Built?; 
His Successor Faces Skeptics And a Market Less in Awe

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Officially, the baton does not pass until tomorrow. That's when Jeffrey R. Immelt takes over the top spot at the General Electric Company, and John F. Welch Jr. leaves. Tonight, there are the going-away festivities: some 200 people will gather at Crotonville, G.E.'s management school, for a roast of their departing chairman and chief executive. "I'm going to get hammered," Mr. Welch laughingly predicted.
 But of course, the transition has been in progress for months. Since November, when Mr. Immelt was anointed as Mr. Welch's successor, G.E. aficionados have bandied about the question: Can "the House That Jack Built" thrive without Jack? 
 Mr. Welch and Mr. Immelt, both premier contrarians, see that as a decidedly silly question. 
"I'm inheriting a company with no burning platform, no business sucking up cash, every business returning its cost of capital," Mr. Immelt said good naturedly, fielding questions earlier this week at a G.E. suite on the 53rd floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the Manhattan skyscraper that houses NBC's studios and many G.E. corporate offices. 
Mr. Welch, holding court down the hall, seemed similarly sanguine about his soon-to-be-ex-employer's prospects.
"G.E. has grown through all kinds of cycles," he said. "I'm excited to be leaving, and I'd be feeling horrible if I had doubts about Jeff."
Still, Mr. Immelt's challenges are enormous. Investors' uncertainties about G.E.'s prospects in the stagnant economy have taken a toll on its stock, which closed yesterday at $41.70, 30 percent below its peak of $60 in August 2000. At the same time, G.E. is moving into a world where so-called knowledge products -- software, services, Internet-related processes and the like -- will determine whether it continues to stand above its competitors.
"Jeff must manage businesses whose mix is changing from tangible products to intellectual content," said Nicholas P. Heymann of Prudential Securities.
Indeed, for all the demurrals, G.E. under Mr. Immelt will necessarily become a different place from what it was under Mr. Welch -- if not immediately in substance, certainly in style. Mr. Welch, a scrappy hockey player in high school, wears his emotions openly. Ask about G.E. employees, and his face lights up.
"We are a family, and I'll miss them terribly," he said.
Ask about persistent accusations that G.E., which has made good on its earnings predictions every quarter for decades, manages its numbers to mask deteriorating earnings, and the storm clouds gather.
"We don't manage earnings, we manage businesses," Mr. Welch responded, calling those who say otherwise "brain-dead idiots." He added, "You can't fool with cash flow, and ours is great."
By contrast, Mr. Immelt -- who at 45 looks like an older and somewhat chunkier version of the football player he was in college -- speaks in even tones, and exudes an unflappability and easy humor. But his resolve is as steely as Mr. Welch's, and, at least publicly, his assessments of G.E.'s virtues are pretty much the same.
"G.E.'s people are its strength," he said, "and developing them will take up half my time."
And what about those intimations of squishy numbers?
"We give investors certainty and visibility," he said, his tone not changing one whit. "We've said our earnings will grow 15 percent this year, and we meet our commitments to analysts."
That is getting harder to do. In 1981, when Mr. Welch took the helm, G.E. earned $1.7 billion on revenue of $25 billion. Last year, it made $28 billion on $130 billion in revenue. Under Mr. Welch, G.E. typically acquired 100 small companies a year; analysts say it will take twice that many now to maintain double-digit growth.
Wall Street is becoming a harder sell, too. The David L. Babson Company, an investment firm, sold its General Electric stock six months ago, when it first looked as if G.E.'s hopes of acquiring Honeywell would be dashed by European antitrust regulators and Babson figured that investors would no longer be willing to pay a big multiple of G.E.'s earnings for the stock. "G.E. used to have category-killer economics, and that kept its P.-E. high," said Anthony M. Maramarco, a Babson managing director. "But it's already maximized operating margins."
Mr. Immelt says he is not worried. "This isn't a $130 billion one-product company, but a group of businesses operating in growing industries," he said.
Still, acquiring Honeywell would have helped a lot. Mr. Welch was not at all coy about his plans to reduce Honeywell's work force of 120,000, and G.E. had ferreted out many ways to make Honeywell's operations far more efficient.
Buying Honeywell, a $25 billion industrial company, would also have given G.E. more breathing room to expand its fast-growing finance business, GE Capital, last year already a $56.5 billion business. G.E. recently paid $5.3 billion to buy Heller Financial; more such big purchases could tip its portfolio too much toward financial services.
G.E. has a triple-A credit rating, and its stock usually trades at 30 to 40 times its earnings. Credit agencies and investors are rarely as generous to financial services businesses as to industrial or technology companies. And while highly successful, GE Capital earns a return on assets of only about 1.4 percent, in line with that of other financial companies.
G.E.'s industrial businesses, on the other hand, average an 8.4 percent return, well above the 5 percent of most such companies.
"They run the risk of reducing their profitability if they keep expanding GE Capital, and they will deserve a much lower P.-E.," said Robert Friedman, an analyst with S& P Equity Research.
Thus, Mr. Immelt must now set a new growth path for General Electric -- and sooner than he had expected. Mr. Welch, who planned to stay until year-end to help integrate Honeywell, moved up his retirement date after the deal fell apart.
Mr. Immelt will also have to find his own way of preventing the stigma of being a conglomerate from further reducing G.E.'s stock price. For decades, conglomerates have been out of favor on Wall Street, and investors have demanded a discount on their share prices. G.E.'s potpourri of businesses certainly qualifies it for the conglomerate label, but Wall Street's faith in Jack Welch, experts say, kept G.E. from that fate.
"Jeff Immelt has to demonstrate quickly that G.E.'s excellent institutionalized management system, not Jack Welch, set G.E. apart from other conglomerates," said Michael Hammer, a management consultant in Cambridge, Mass.
Many other G.E. watchers say he should be able to do that. "Jack Welch was a visionary, but he wasn't the vision," said Jeffrey A. Krames, an editor and author of books about Mr. Welch. "He created a company where 300,000 diverse people are delivering on that vision."
But that well-oiled machine may be developing creaks. G.E. has long used stock options as a prime compensation tool and motivator. Some warn that, with the stock losing its luster just as the patina of working for Mr. Welch fades, other companies might woo away much of General Electric's talent.
"G.E.'s famous deep bench may thin out," Mr. Hammer warned.
Mr. Immelt insists that attrition is low. "People stay for head, heart and wallet, and this remains a great place for them to be," he said.
Mr. Immelt can also expect more pressure from environmentalists, as the company continues to fight an order by the Environmental Protection Agency to dredge the Hudson River of hazardous PCB's, once used in electrical transformers and left there from manufacturing operations years ago.
Mr. Welch said he would have readily met with environmentalists to explain why G.E. thinks that the dredging order is a mistake. Environmentalists acknowledge that they never asked. "Meeting with Jack Welch didn't seem to hold any promise," said Ned Sullivan, president of Scenic Hudson. "I'll give Mr. Immelt the benefit of the doubt, and I intend to reach out to him."
No one suggests that G.E. is in serious trouble. But it wasn't when Mr. Welch took over, either. Many of the innovations that Reginald Jones, his predecessor, introduced -- carving the company into hundreds of strategic business units, or turning planning into an art form -- were then considered leading-edge.
"Welch pulled apart that much-admired system," said Christopher A. Bartlett, a Harvard Business School professor. More important, he stripped the company of bureaucratic impediments. "Jack was marvelous at creating simplicity out of huge complexity," said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School.
Mr. Welch soon applied his catchy slogan -- fix it, sell it or close it -- to every G.E. business. He sold some 200 that were not dominant in their markets, and bought hundreds of others to bolster the remaining ones. And early in his tenure, he fired close to 100,000 people -- the genesis of his nickname, Neutron Jack, after the weapon with the capacity to wipe out people without destroying buildings.
"He made plenty of mistakes, but he rectified them," Mr. Bartlett noted, citing as examples the acquisitions -- and later, divestitures -- of RCA and Kidder Peabody.
By the end of the 80's, Mr. Welch was ready to deconstruct G.E.'s culture. He created systems for sharing ideas and for spotting and developing employees with high potential. He became personally involved in the evaluations of G.E.'s 400-or-so top executives. He regularly taught classes at Crotonville -- nearly 40 miles north of midtown Manhattan -- and insisted that other executives teach, too.
Today, corporate America is dotted with chief executives who cut their eyeteeth at G.E. and are now emulating Mr. Welch. "He believed in lean and mean," said Robert D. Fagan, who was with G.E. from 1976 to 1985, and is now chairman of Teco Energy in Tampa, Fla. "He'd insist that you make your numbers, but he'd let you decide how to do so."
Many G.E. alumni say they learned more at Crotonville than at any university. "He turned Crotonville into the glue for G.E. culture," said Robert L. Nardelli, who left to become chief executive of Home Depot after he lost a three-man race to succeed Mr. Welch. The other candidate, W. James McNerney Jr., runs Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing.
Paradoxically, Crotonville is high on Mr. Immelt's list of things to tinker with: He is switching the emphasis of the executive training courses from general management to achieving growth and serving customers. G.E.'s quarterly management meetings may go soon, too.
"They seem silly," Mr. Immelt said, "now that so much information is available with the Internet."
Mr. Welch will watch all this with interest, of course -- but from afar. "I'm not selling $1 worth of G.E. stock," he said, "but my hands-on relationship with the company will be zip."
He is relishing the chance to travel with his wife, play more golf, work as a consultant to other chief executives and promote his book, which came out this week.
As for Mr. Immelt, if he survives as long as Mr. Welch did, he will presumably put his own firm mark on G.E.
In his 20-year reign, Mr. Welch mounted four major initiatives: he turned a largely domestic company into a global behemoth; he moved G.E.'s businesses toward selling more services; he instituted Six Sigma, a complex statistical process that has produced immense cost savings, and, although he spurned the idea of e-business for several years, he finally pushed each G.E. executive into exploiting the Internet.
For now, Mr. Immelt is content to tweak, not revolutionize.
"I know G.E.'s portfolio of businesses will have to change eventually," he said. "But there's no reason to add a fifth initiative now."

HEADLINE: MEXICO PRESIDENT URGES U.S. TO ACT SOON ON MIGRANTS 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Making the first state visit of the Bush administration, President Vicente Fox of Mexico today urged the United States to commit to a speedy timetable for agreement this year on broad, politically sensitive proposals for the treatment of millions of illegal Mexican immigrants. 
 Among the proposals being discussed by high-level officials in both governments is one that would give legal status to some of the 3.5 million Mexicans working illegally in the United States. 
 "We must, and we can, reach an agreement on migration before the end of this very year," Mr. Fox said, "which will allow us, before the end of our respective terms, to make sure that there are no Mexicans who have not entered this country legally, and that those Mexicans who have come into the country do so with the proper documents." 
Offered within the first hour of his arrival at the White House, President Fox's challenge did not surprise Mr. Bush's top aides, who said they were aware of Mr. Fox's desire. But it did add a new sense of urgency to an issue that faces a significant fight from conservative political forces in the United States. 
Aides to Mr. Fox, the first Mexican president to be elected from the political opposition, said the statement, made on the South Lawn, was aimed at making clear that while Mexico is willing to take time to forge a new immigration agreement that benefits both countries, it does not intend to let the negotiations drag on for years. 
The statement differed from Mr. Fox's earlier statements about the timetable for a deal on immigration. To some political analysts, it seemed too ambitious a goal, though bold pronouncements against the odds have become the signature of Mr. Fox's public discourse. A year ago, the last time Mr. Fox visited Washington, as president-elect, he stirred imaginations by urging the United States to make the border more open to the flow of workers.
In welcoming President Fox to the White House, Mr. Bush spoke only in general terms about the negotiations, saying Mexico and the United States "must work in a spirit of respect and common purpose." 
But in an afternoon briefing with reporters, his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, stopped short of committing the White House to a deal this year. She emphasized that President Bush had to negotiate immigration agreements with Congress and various political and business sectors, saying the discussions involved "a lot of moving parts." 
"We are going to work as hard and as fast as we can to achieve the goal," she said. "But as both presidents have emphasized, we do not only want to make a deal, we want to do it right." 
The welcoming ceremony for President Fox was replete with a 21-gun salute and a Revolutionary War-era marching band. President Bush called the visit "recognition that the United States has no more important relationship in the world than the one we have with Mexico," language that past presidents have usually reserved for Britain and Japan. 
Breaking comfortably into Spanish, President Bush said, "El que tiene un buen vecino, tiene un buen amigo" -- "He who has a good neighbor has a good friend." 
President Bush's opening words also emphasized the importance of strengthening social and cultural ties, rather than the fight against drug trafficking and Mexico's struggle against corruption, another departure from the typical discourse between past presidents.
Tonight Mr. Bush entertained Mr. Fox and his new wife, Marta Sahagun de Fox, his former press secretary, at a state dinner. 
For his part, President Fox underscored that Mexico has become one of the United States' most important trading partners, second only to Canada, and contended that immigrants have fueled economic growth on both sides of the border.
He pressed the United States government to quickly "build new conditions of fairness" for undocumented Mexican immigrants "whose hard work is a daily contribution to the prosperity of this great nation." 
Calling immigrants "national heroes," Mr. Fox has made immigration issues a priority for his nine-month old government. Mr. Bush, to the surprise of many of his Republican supporters, has done the same, entertaining ideas about legalizing migrant workers that go beyond anything previously considered in Washington.
Aides to President Fox said it was important for the presidents to reach a formal agreement on immigration this year so that it could be presented to their respective congresses before the spring, particularly before the start of the 2002 campaigns in the United States. The Senate is currently controlled by Democrats, from whom Mr. Fox expects greater support for the immigration proposals. 
But the complexities of getting a deal done quickly -- if at all -- became clear as soon as talks began this spring between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda. 
Mr. Bush's aides realize that the notion of accepting some of the millions of Mexican workers believed to be in the country illegally could raise enormous opposition among conservatives in Congress. The economic downturn has further narrowed Mr. Bush's options, while making the relief valve of sending workers north all the more important to Mr. Fox. 
In recent days Mr. Bush's aides have become vague about the talks, which cover everything from control of the border, to expanded guest-worker programs, to what would amount to an amnesty for some illegal workers. But President Bush has said he would never issue a "blanket amnesty." 
Adding to the White House's problems are growing protests by other immigrant groups about the favoritism inherent in special deals for Mexicans.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Under pressure from a Dutch court, the fight over control of the Gucci Group may be resolved.

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The dispute between the French billionaires Francois Pinault and Bernard Arnault for control of the Gucci Group has proved something of an embarrassment for the Dutch legal system.
 And so it was with renewed vigor that Dutch investigators recently approached the parties involved to push for a settlement of their two-and-a-half-year-old ownership dispute. 
 Since March 1999, investigators have been examining whether the Italian fashion house Gucci, which is incorporated in the Netherlands, acted improperly when it issued shares to Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which is controlled by Mr. Pinault, to thwart a takeover by Mr. Arnault's LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. 
The deal gave Gucci $3 billion to spend on acquisitions, including the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, and effectively halved LVMH's stake in Gucci, to 20 percent.
The French moguls and Gucci's chief executive, Domenico De Sole, have been locked in an uncomfortable dance ever since, with the loss of face almost as important as the loss of money.
Now the last-ditch diplomacy on the part of the Dutch court, which was expected to offer its latest ruling in the case later this month, may finally bear fruit. The settlement talks are at an advanced stage and a deal could be announced within days, people involved in the discussions said yesterday.
"The real difference this time is that investigators are sitting on top of this process and telling the parties they need to settle," one person close to the negotiations said.
Given the stormy history of the situation, however, these people held out the possibility of last-minute problems that could unravel a complex three-stage deal.
According to the plan, which was reported yesterday in The Financial Times, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute would pay about $95 a share for 40 percent of LVMH's holding, which would increase its stake in Gucci to 50 percent. In New York yesterday, shares of Gucci rose $6.88, to $85.35.
Then, in November, Gucci would pay all shareholders except Pinault-Printemps-Redoute a special dividend of $7 a share.
Finally, LVMH and all of Gucci's other shareholders would have the option to sell their stakes for $101.50 a share in March 2004, when an agreement expires that requires Pinault-Printemps-Redoute to receive approval before increasing its Gucci stake.
All three companies confirmed they were in talks to resolve the situation, but would not provide details. LVMH shares fell 1.35 euros ($1.12), or 2.5 percent, to 52.65 euros ($46.77). Pinault-Printemps-Redoute shares fell 4 euros ($3.55), or 2.7 percent, to 142.5 ($126.60).
People involved in the negotiations said one remaining issue was when Pinault-Printemps-Redoute would officially take control of Gucci. The Italian company has maintained that it would not give up control unless Pinault-Printemps-Redoute made an offer to all its shareholders, not just LVMH. Such a stipulation is not required under Dutch law, permitting an acquirer to take "creeping" control of a company by acquiring shares on the open market without issuing an offer to all shareholders.
Because the terms of the current deal do not require Pinault-Printemps-Redoute to make that offer until 2004, Gucci would like to retain some measure of control, even though Pinault-Printemps-Redoute will own 50 percent of the shares, these people said.
Analysts and investors hailed a possible resolution of the conflict, which would provide a windfall for LVMH and permit all three companies to end the raft of legal bills and distractions at a time when the business climate has toughened.
Although consumer spending has largely remained strong despite the global economic downturn, LVMH warned in March of more difficult conditions in 2001 because of slowing growth prospects in major economies, most notably in North America. Three months later, Gucci reported first-quarter results that fell short of analyst estimates and lowered its sales and profit forecasts for the entire year. Although Gucci said at the time that the shortfall was mainly a result of the higher costs of revamping Yves Saint Laurent, which Gucci bought in 1999, the economic climate also played a role in the tempered outlook.
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute is expected to report first-half profits today that increased 9 percent, to 295 million euros, or $260 million, compared with 271 million euros ($240 million), according to a consensus of 15 analysts.
Talks to end the dispute collapsed last year when Gucci rejected a $100-a-share offer from Pinault-Printemps-Redoute as too low.
Legal battles erupted afresh in March, after a Dutch court ordered a review of Gucci's initial agreement with Pinault-Printemps-Redoute.

Waving Brazilian flags and carrying signs reading "Save Our National Market," workers at the Sao Paulo stock market, the Bovespa, interrupted trading for an hour this afternoon to protest government measures that they say have caused trading volume on the exchanges to plummet, as investors switch to trading stocks of Brazilian companies in New York, where transaction costs are lower. 
 A cheer went up from the trading floor a few minutes into the trading halt, when the news arrived that the government had agreed to exempt stock trades from a tax of 0.38 percent on all financial transactions. The Finance Ministry said that the exemption would take effect before the year ended, but did not specify a date. 
 The tax is the main culprit blamed by traders for the steep fall in average trading volume on the Bovespa, to about 350 million reais ($136 million) a day this year from a peak of 1.2 billion reais ($1.08 billion) a day in 1997. The tax, called the C.P.M.F., makes it roughly twice as expensive to trade a Brazilian blue chip on the Bovespa as it is to trade it as an American depository receipt on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Without the C.P.M.F., there is more chance that we would buy through the Bovespa, since you would have a similar, if not lower, transaction cost in Brazil," said Bill Rudman, head of the Latin America group at WestAM, a British money management company. 
Thirty-two of Brazil's largest companies have A.D.R.'s that trade in New York, including Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company; Embraer, which makes commercial jets, and almost all the country's phone companies. In some cases, trading volume in the A.D.R.'s exceeds that of the underlying shares on the Bovespa.
The New York Stock Exchange has actively wooed Brazilian companies, including organizing a "Brazil Day" for Friday, with some 20 Brazilian companies set to meet with institutional investors to drum up interest in their A.D.R.'s. The protest today was timed to anticipate the Brazil Day event.
Brazilian brokers and traders say they do not object to A.D.R. trading, only to having to compete with it at a disadvantage. The situation has become so bad, they say, that the Bovespa has not had enough trading volume over the last few months to cover its operating costs.
"It's laughable that we are the ninth economy in the world, yet trade only 350 million reais per day," said Raymundo Magliano Filho, the president of the Bovespa. "The Bovespa is a national patrimony, and we need the government to support us."
Beyond relief from the transaction tax, the protesters also called today for the government to scrap a plan to raise the rate of income tax on stock market profits to 20 percent, to match that levied on bond income. 
Experts say that even if the government did all that the protesters ask, the Bovespa will continue to be depressed by the economic crisis in neighboring Argentina and an energy crisis at home that has crimped industrial production.
Nor is merely leveling the playing field likely to bring international investors flocking back to the Bovespa, analysts say; what is needed is new blood.
"If we can manage to list medium-size companies in Brazil and put them together with smaller, even individual, investors, that could be the route to restoring growth at the Bovespa," said Aloisio Lemos of Lopes Filho & Associados, a Rio de Janeiro consulting firm. "Of course, that's not something that will probably happen this year, or even next."

HEADLINE: The Problem With Analysts: You Get What You Pay For 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
EVERY bear market must have a scapegoat. After all, when so many people lose money, it cannot just be because they made bad investment decisions.
 Seven decades ago, in the aftermath of the 1929 crash, it was the short-sellers who were tarred and feathered. Short sales were "the greatest evil that has been permitted or sanctioned by the government that I know of," said one congressman. The shorts were accused of driving down prices, bankrupting investors and causing the Depression. 
 In subsequent market retreats, there have been other villains, notes James Chanos, himself a well-known short-seller. In the early 1970's, it was the go-go mutual fund managers of the 1960's. Program traders took the blame after the 1987 crash. A decade ago, it was junk bonds.
In each instance, there was a grain of truth in the vilification. But the talk was overblown. Limits were imposed on short-selling in the 1930's, but for some reason neither the economy nor the stock market quickly recovered.
So it is now with this bear market's scapegoat: Wall Street analysts. Amid Congressional hearings, Wall Street is scrambling to impose new rules to curb abuses. Some firms now say that they will not allow analysts to own stocks they are recommending. A New York pediatrician got a $400,000 settlement from Merrill Lynch after claiming he lost money by following bad advice from Henry Blodget, Merrill's Internet analyst. 
There are problems with Wall Street analysis, but they were apparent long before prices plunged, and the reforms now being made will not solve them.
Consider Mr. Blodget. He gained fame as an early fan of Amazon.com. The Internet bubble coincided with the emergence of CNBC as an investment force, and he became a media star. 
At Merrill, Mr. Blodget replaced an analyst who had taken a more cautious view of Internet valuations. With the bubble inflating, it was the bullish analysts who appeared to be right. Since there were no profits anywhere in sight, other "metrics" had to be found to evaluate stocks. Some wonderfully creative ones were invented.
Such metrics, which were based on anything but cash flow, seemed absurd to some of us at the time. But they were explained, and investors could evaluate them. It was also obvious that Merrill, like its competitors, was quite happy to recommend stocks of investment banking clients.
But if the problems were clear, why did Merrill pay the doctor? It offers the normal public relations gobbledygook nonanswer, but the real reason may be embarrassment that a client's account was concentrated in two very risky stocks, an imprudent strategy in any market.
As investigations proceed, some outrages may turn up. It is offensive for analysts to sell shares they are endorsing, and more disclosure is clearly a good idea. But rather than bar analysts from investing in stocks they follow, investment banks might do the reverse. They could require analysts to follow their own advice, buying a couple of weeks after they recommend a stock, and selling only after their clients are advised to get out.
But that would not attack the real problem: money. With commissions on share trading continually falling, it is not investors who provide the cash for Wall Street bonuses. The money comes from investment banking fees, and the companies that direct those fees want praise, not criticism.
Investors who want good research will have to pay for it. Until a mechanism is devised to pay Wall Street for quality advice, no new rule is likely to produce it.

Shares Fall Again; 2 Indexes Risk Retracing April Lows

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended near their lowest levels in two and a half years yesterday as bleak earnings forecasts and slack economic data drove the Dow Jones industrial average back below 10,000.
 Bonds rallied after a report showed further contraction in services businesses. 
 "The overriding concern is the economic slowdown," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray. How long and how much? If those questions could be answered, then you would see a bottom to the market. But the best prospect for the market is best guesses -- that's not enough. The market is saying, 'Show me the money; show me the turnaround.' " 
The euro rose against the dollar, to 89.53 cents from 88.64 cents on Wednesday, after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its gauge of service-sector activity fell in August, to a four-year low of 45.5.
The Dow dropped 192.43 points, or 1.92 percent, to 9,840.84. sliding back below the 10,000 level.
Technology stocks again had a worse day, with the Nasdaq composite index losing 53.37 points, or 3.03 percent, to end at 1,705.64. The Nasdaq posted its third consecutive losing session, and its seventh daily decline in eight. It is threatening to breach a two-and-a-half-year closing low on April 4 of 1,638.80, and is now down 30.96 percent for the year.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 25.34 points, or 2.24 percent, to 1,106.40. It is teetering near the April 4 low of 1,103.25.
Declining issues on both the Big Board and Nasdaq outnumbered those advancing by a margin of more than 2 to 1.
Intel, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average and a Nasdaq heavyweight, fell $1.37, to $26.10, in regular-session trading on expectations that it would lower revenue estimates. After the bell, Intel said its quarterly sales would be "slightly below the midpoint" of its earlier forecast; its shares rose to $26.75 after hours.
The National Association of Purchasing Management set the bleak tone early in the day. Its monthly nonmanufacturing, or services, index fell for a second month, to 45.5 in August from 48.9 in July. Economists had expected a reading of 49.4. The drop followed a rise on Tuesday in the group's manufacturing index, which spurred some hopes of an economic revival starting late in 2001. "The bigger picture here is maybe the service sector is taking over in terms of the weakness," said Ian Morris, chief United States economist at HSBC Securities in New York.
Adding to pessimism was a sales warning by Motorola, the big mobile phone maker, which helped knock the wind out of technology stocks. Motorola dropped $2.46, to $13.94. 
Gap Inc., the apparel chain, reported a 17 percent drop in same-store sales last month and warning that it was not likely to meet its third-quarter sales forecast. Gap shares plunged $4, closing at $15.
Retail sales over all rose 2.8 percent for the month, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index issued yesterday. 
The 10-year Treasury note rose 22/32, to a price of 101 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.86 percent from 4.94 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 28/32, to 99 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.41 percent from 5.47 percent.

HEADLINE: Report Counts Computers In Majority of U.S. Homes 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
More than half of the households in the United States had at least one computer last year, and more than 40 percent were connected to the Internet, a Census Bureau report released today said.
 In addition, 65 percent of children ages 3 to 17 had access to a computer at home in 2000, up from about 55 percent in 1998. Of children in that age group, 30 percent logged onto the Internet, compared with 19 percent in 1998, the report found. 
 Census figures showed that 54 million households, or 51 percent, had one or more computers in 2000, up from 42 percent in 1998. It was the first time computer ownership surpassed 50 percent, the report said. 
The bureau surveyed about 50,000 households in August 2000. (The data are separate from the census, which did not include questions on computer access or Internet use.)
"This is such a big shift, and it happened so fast," said Eric C. Newburger, a statistician with the bureau who wrote the report. "Years from now we will look back on this as a watershed year, when computers went from a special thing in a home to a common appliance."
Forty-four million households, or 42 percent, included a family member who used the Internet at home last year, the report said. When the bureau first collected data on Internet use in 1997, 18 percent of households had Internet access.
Many people are shopping, checking stock quotes and reading news online. And among those who use the Internet, 73 percent of children and 88 percent of adults said they exchanged e-mail messages regularly.
But the survey found significant discrepancies in computer ownership and Internet use along age, racial and economic lines. 
Among households with incomes of $75,000 or more, 88 percent had a computer and 79 percent went online. In households with incomes below $25,000, 28 percent had a computer and 19 percent used the Internet.
Sixty-six percent of Asian and Pacific Islander adults said they had a computer at home, the highest of any racial or ethnic group. Among other groups, 61 percent of white adults said they owned a computer, while 37 percent of black adults and 35 percent of Hispanic adults said they did.
The oldest adults in the nation had the lowest rates of computer ownership and Internet use. About 28 percent of those 65 and over said they owned a computer, and 13 percent said they used the Internet.
Schools have "leveled the playing field," the report said, for children with no computer at home. Nearly 90 percent of children used computers at school, the report said.

HEADLINE: Scoopful of Ice Cream to Help Truancy Go Down 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
First there was whole language. Then there was constructivist math. Now ice cream may be the latest weapon in the arsenal of raising student achievement.
 In a drive to increase student attendance, Harold O. Levy, chancellor of New York City's public schools, promised yesterday to serve favorite foods -- like ice cream -- in school cafeterias on Mondays and Fridays, the days that children eager to stretch out their weekends are most likely to be absent. 
 Speaking during a five-borough tour on the opening day of school for 800,000 elementary and middle school children, the chancellor also said that he would like to see tests scheduled at the beginning and end of the week, rather than in the middle. That way, children would lose points on their grades if they were not present.
"First off, we are going to have tests on Mondays and Fridays instead of during the week," Mr. Levy said as he visited Public School 194 in Harlem. "There will be small rewards. The food will be better on Mondays and Fridays."
Ice cream Mondays and Fridays may not be just another educational fad, nutritional experts said. National studies have shown a definite correlation between enjoyable as well as nutritious meals and school performance and attendance.
Studies in Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia and Minneapolis have indicated that when children ate breakfast in class, where they could socialize in an intimate, friendly environment, they improved their test scores and attendance, said Agnes Molnar, director of child nutrition programs for the Community Food Resource Center, an advocacy group that studies nutrition and poverty.
"It sounds great," she said of Mr. Levy's idea.
Mr. Levy can deliver the favorite foods because the chief of food services works directly under him. But he said that he cannot force superintendents and principals to schedule tests on particular days, nor would he want to override their educational judgment. But he said superintendents like Thelma Baxter in Harlem had informed him of the attendance problem on Mondays and Fridays, so he expected them to be cooperative.
David Ernst, spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association, said special ice cream and test days were not a strategy for improving attendance that he had heard in other districts. More common, he said, is the punitive approach, like a program in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that allows parents of truants to be charged with endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor.
"Whimsy from 110 Livingston Street?" Mr. Ernst said disbelievingly. "I guess, what's the downside?"
Kevin F. Gill, executive director of the school system's Office of School Food and Nutrition Services, said yesterday that he was a bit leery of using food as a reward and that ice cream was expensive. But, he added, "I can live with ice cream on Friday." 
As for Monday, he said he would try to think creatively. "Kids like chicken, pizza and Italian food," Mr. Gill said. "We could move the broccolini to Wednesday."
Mr. Gill said that high school students could prove especially hard to entice, even with chocolate fudge sundaes. They tend to like eating lunch out, he said.
This is not the first unorthodox proposal for Mr. Levy, a former corporate lawyer who became head of the New York City school system 20 months ago. Early in his tenure, he proposed offering free airline tickets as a reward for teachers who helped their students get better test scores, though the idea was later dropped.
The chancellor acknowledged that the correlation between poor attendance and low performance might reflect other factors as well, like homelessness, poverty and unemployment.
"Which way causality runs is not clear to me," Mr. Levy said. "But the point I'm making is much more rudimentary. If a child doesn't attend, that child will not learn. Attendance is a quid pro quo. It is a necessary minimum."
Citywide, average daily attendance is 92 percent, and "that's not good enough," he said. At Public School 194, which he visited yesterday, attendance averages just 88 percent, he said.
Schools opened on Wednesday for the city's 281,000 high school students. Despite talk of budget cuts among politicians and school officials, elementary and middle schools appeared to open smoothly yesterday, though there was some shuffling of teachers and aides, and many after-school remedial programs have been indefinitely postponed.
Mr. Levy charmed a roomful of first graders at P.S. 1 in the South Bronx by reading the book "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" aloud and prompting them to sing the alphabet song. Having elicited the conundrum that both coconuts and cows give milk, he encouraged the children to ask their teacher to explain how that could be.

HEADLINE: Virus Is Killing Thousands of Salmon 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
A virus that kills Atlantic salmon but is harmless to people is spreading in fish farms in eastern Maine, forcing the destruction of hundreds of thousands of valuable fish and threatening endangered wild salmon, state and federal officials say. 
 The disease was first detected in the 1980's in Norwegian and Scottish fish farms, then appeared in New Brunswick fish pens in 1996 and crossed the border into Cobscook Bay in Maine in March. 
 The discovery in recent days of several more infected fish in pens in the bay prompted state officials on Wednesday to impose emergency rules barring boats from leaving infected areas and requiring fish farmers to notify officials immediately when an infected fish was found. Infected fish and fish exposed to them must be removed and killed, although some may still be sent to market. 
The Boston Globe reported the restrictions yesterday.
The highly contagious disease, infectious salmon anemia, affects a fish's kidneys and circulatory system. It causes the fish to bleed internally and usually die. Much remains unknown about how the virus spreads, although it is known to move in the water and from fish to fish in crowded pens. Juvenile and adult fish are affected.
The anemia has forced the destruction of millions of fish in Europe and Canada in recent years as fish farmers on both sides of the Atlantic have tried to contain its spread. Maine fish farmers have killed more than 900,000 fish since March, state officials said yesterday. 
Several fisheries experts said that in the countries where the disease was most established, close surveillance had prevented large outbreaks. They said it was likely to be kept at bay in Maine as well.
In the short run, though, it could be a costly blow to a Maine enterprise that had grown in a decade from nearly nothing to an industry worth $100 million a year, state officials and aquaculture companies said.
Fish that have reached their adult size of 8 to 10 pounds can still be sold, cutting the financial losses somewhat. So far, state and industry officials said they had not been able to estimate the economic cost of fighting the virus.
The state's fish farmers plan to seek aid from a Department of Agriculture program that compensates farmers for herds of livestock lost to illness. 
"We're looking for the same kind of assistance any terrestrial farmer would have open to them," said Sebastian Belle, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, a trade group. 
Mark F. J. Kesselring, a project manager for Stolt Sea Farm, said, "This is a very serious disease and economic loss and a problem for the industry, but, in the long term, I believe it's manageable." 
Mr. Kesselring's company has fish pens in bays on both the Canadian and American sides of the border, including Cobscook Bay, along the Canadian border, the only place in Maine where the disease is known to have struck. More than half of Maine's 800 acres of salmon pens are in the bay, said Andrew Fisk, the aquaculture coordinator for the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Mr. Kesselring said that disease outbreaks were a fact of life for farmers raising animals, whether they have hooves or fins.
"The difference is that with terrestrial livestock, we've had thousands of years of history to deal with," he said. "Aquaculture is only about 20 years old, so there are some learning curves to be gotten through."
Biologists said it remained unclear whether the virus was accidentally imported to North America from Europe or had always existed in the wild on both sides of the Atlantic but had remained unnoticed, with widely dispersed wild fish dying and disappearing unseen. Several experts said it could be that the disease had only come to light with the recent burgeoning of salmon aquaculture, which packs thousands of fish into floating cages. 
New England newspapers have focused increasing attention on the problem in recent months because of the threat the virus poses not only to the growing aquaculture industry but also to the already imperiled stocks of wild Atlantic salmon.
Strains of native salmon that breed in eight of Maine's rivers were given endangered status by federal wildlife agencies last November. 
Some scientists said the large populations in fish farms could serve as breeding grounds for the virus and that occasional escapees from the floating cages could spread it. 
But other experts said it was unlikely that the virus would have a significant impact outside the dense collections of raised fish, though many said it was better to err on the side of caution by aggressively culling fish when there was an outbreak.
Many private environmental groups have criticized the nascent aquaculture industry as playing down the risk of disease and pollution from the moored pens, where the fish are fed for a year or two until they reach market size. 
"Density creates an environment in which a virus that might be very random and rare in the wild can concentrate," said Peter Shelley, the vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston. 
Mr. Shelley said the industry in Maine had been in denial for years about diseases in farmed fish.
"There are right places and ways to do this and practices that could minimize issues like viral outbreaks," he said.
Industry officials defended their practices. Many companies have divers who inspect pens for dead fish twice a week and all the fish are removed and killed as soon as an infection is spotted, they said.

HEADLINE: With Pressure Growing, Zimbabwe Agrees to Stop Land Seizures 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
With international pressure, particularly from other African nations, intensifying, Zimbabwe agreed tonight to stop the land occupations that have fed the country's political turmoil and fueled its economic crisis for more than a year, according to news reports. In exchange, Britain has agreed to provide money for Zimbabwe's efforts to resettle poor blacks on much of the country's fertile land, most of which is owned by the country's small white minority. 
 The apparent breakthrough in the political standoff between Zimbabwe and the West capped a daylong summit meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where foreign ministers from several Commonwealth countries had gathered for talks with the foreign ministers of Zimbabwe and Britain. 
 The Commonwealth's heads of government are due to meet in Australia next month, and easing Zimbabwe's crisis before the meeting had become an urgent priority. 
In a communique being drafted tonight, Zimbabwe promised no further occupations of farmland, a restoration of the rule of law to the land-reform process, a commitment to free expression as assured by the country's Constitution and decisive steps against violence, Reuters and the BBC reported from Abuja.
Zimbabwe's chief government spokesman, Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, did not answer calls tonight to his cellular phone, nor did his deputy, George Charamba.
While widely accepted as necessary, land reform in Zimbabwe has struggled to yield significant gains for the country's ordinary people, hindered by the erratic efforts of the government and the sometimes slow pace of international assistance. 
With Zimbabwe's economy struggling and his popularity falling, President Robert Mugabe has sought to blame the country's troubles on the slow pace of land reform. Accusing international donors, in particular Britain and the United States, of reneging on commitments to finance land reform, Mr. Mugabe has encouraged poor blacks to simply seize white-owned land for themselves. 
Since February 2000, ruling-party thugs have invaded more than 1,000 farms, often attacking and occasionally killing white farmers and their black workers. 
The chaotic and widely condemned effort at land reform began shortly after Mr. Mugabe's proposed new Constitution was voted down early last year. Coming only a few months before parliamentary elections, the Constitution vote was an ominous sign for Mr. Mugabe's party and an encouraging one for what was then a fledgling opposition party. 
The staggering wave of land invasions that followed was, many experts and critics say, a naked effort to intimidate opposition, and with presidential elections due early next year, the tactics have persisted and even spread.

HEADLINE: Head of Children's Services Says He Won't Stay in the Job Under a New Mayor 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Nicholas Scoppetta, whose six-year overhaul of the city's long-troubled child welfare bureaucracy transformed it from a national scandal to an agency widely praised for making real reforms, announced yesterday that he would not serve as its commissioner in a new mayoral administration.
 Months ago, Mr. Scoppetta indicated that he was willing, even eager, to stay on as commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services, an agency created in response to a public outcry over the death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo while she was nominally under the city's protection. 
 But yesterday, though Mr. Scoppetta called his revamping of the child welfare system unfinished, he said the time was ripe for him to write, speak and teach about what had been accomplished so far. 
"I think there are systems across the country that have our problems and maybe are not so far along in dealing with them," he said.
Mr. Scoppetta is widely credited with strengthening the management, training, pay and accountability within the city agency, particularly in investigations of reported child abuse and neglect. His credibility as a reformer allowed him to lay to rest two sweeping class action lawsuits that had asked a federal judge to take over the $1.2 billion system, which had a long history of breaking promises to change.
To drive home his message of accountability, Mr. Scoppetta recently ordered the closing of a city office that administered foster homes in Manhattan and Staten Island after it scored at the bottom of the city's new evaluation of foster care agencies -- the most comprehensive and sophisticated such evaluation ever conducted.
But many veterans of past foster care overhauls that ultimately unraveled had hoped Mr. Scoppetta would stay on to see his changes through. They worry that pitfalls lie ahead, including the possibility that an economic downturn and welfare time limits could leave more poor children vulnerable to harm, whether they stay with their parents or are placed in foster care. 
Mr. Scoppetta acknowledged that many of his changes had not yet penetrated to the day-to-day experiences of children and families in the child welfare system. 
Improving training and pay at the private nonprofit agencies that care for nearly 90 percent of children in the system is "one of the great undones," he said in an interview yesterday. Turnover at the private agencies remains high, and he said he hoped foster care rates paid to the agencies would be increased.
But Mr. Scoppetta noted with pride that for the first time in memory the number of children in foster care this month -- 29,800 -- was lower than the number (30,000) who receive home services that are aimed at keeping them out of foster care. The foster care population was at 43,000 when Mr. Scoppetta took office, declining from its 1991 peak of 49,100. The previous low of 16,230 was set in 1983, before the crack epidemic that overwhelmed a system already in disarray.
Mr. Scoppetta took on what many regarded as an impossible job when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had cut child welfare staff during his first two years in office, vowed to fix the system after Elisa Izquierdo's death in 1995. Investigation showed the city had rejected, ignored, or incompetently investigated at least seven formal reports of possible abuse or neglect before Elisa was beaten to death by her mother. 
Mr. Scoppetta, a longtime prosecutor who lived in an orphanage as a child, was promised direct access to the mayor and millions of dollars for the agency, which Mayor Giuliani separated from the city's Human Resources Administration by executive order. 
"All of our reforms flow from that decision," Mr. Scoppetta said, urging New Yorkers to approve an amendment to the New York City Charter on Nov. 6 that would make the separation permanent.
Mr. Scoppetta's aggressive efforts to lower caseloads and increase worker training helped him to reach an innovative settlement of longstanding federal litigation by Marcia Robinson Lowry, director of Children's Rights Inc. He agreed to have the agency monitored from inside for two years by a national panel of experts, led by the director of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a child advocacy organization.
That decision became a personal triumph last year when the panel's final report praised the agency's "remarkable progress." The panel also said that a great deal remained to be done if Mr. Scoppetta's ambitious five-year plan, including a reorganization of services to children along neighborhood lines, was to become a reality.
Mr. Scoppetta credited the panel with shifting his focus from child removal, which characterized his first three years in office, toward a recognition that child safety could often be better served by preventing the trauma of foster care placement in the first place. 
"Mayors in the past have panicked and dismissed child welfare administrators every time there's been some crisis," Mr. Scoppetta said. "The average tenure has been something like a year and a half -- and that is a mistake." He added, "I hope the new mayor picks a committed person and supports that person."

HEADLINE: A Region's Workers Go From Flush Time To Hard Times, Fast 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: HICKORY, N.C. 

 BODY:
In the spring of last year, the Century Furniture Company ran a help-wanted advertisement for upholsterers in six area newspapers. The company was offering good pay in a region with thousands of experienced furniture workers, but not one applicant responded.
 At the time, the unemployment rate in this manufacturing area of North Carolina was an extraordinarily low 2.2 percent. Anyone who wanted to work was doing so, and companies were raiding each other for experienced workers. New industries refused to move in, fearing they could not fill jobs. 
 But in just 12 months, Hickory's economy has moved through the looking glass. The region's main industries have slumped, and unemployment is at 7.2 percent, the nation's highest increase in joblessness over the past year. Century Furniture is no longer running help-wanted advertisements; workers are knocking on its doors. And the relationship between employers and employees has been transformed. 
"Instead of employees being in the driver's seat, now we're in the driver's seat," said Bill McBrayer, the operations manager for the upholstery division of Lexington Home Brands, another large furniture maker with a plant across town. "It's a whole different feeling. Now, if you want to do something like clamp down on smoking in the plant, you can. Last year, people would just have quit."
Managers say productivity is up and workers are more motivated, fearful that layoffs might reach them, too. Employees ruefully acknowledge the change, and say they are stunned by the speed of their descent on the workplace see-saw.
"They cut us back from 60 hours to 36" in July, said Henry Stallard, who works at a large fiber-optic cable factory here and was looking for a second job at the county unemployment office this week to supplement his income. "They would never have done that last year. Now everybody's got to cross their T's and make sure they don't make any mistakes. Everything's totally flip-flopped."
While Hickory has been hit unusually hard, many production workers across the South and in other manufacturing states are facing tougher and more demanding environments than any they have known for the better part of a decade. And as layoffs continue to grow, employers will be asking more of workers, and the specter of future layoffs means they are likely to get it.
"When a worker has more at stake by losing his job, he's always willing to work much more efficiently," said Walter Wessels, a labor economist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. "What's different this time is that the change is happening much more quickly than in the past. Employers are monitoring the market much more carefully now, and they know that if they don't get their employees to work harder in times like these, their competitors will."
This is not necessarily true of the entire economy. Ronald E. Bird, chief economist for the business-oriented Employment Policy Foundation in Washington, noted that jobs continue to grow in the services and information sectors, and he said that the current national unemployment rate of 4.5 percent was low by the standards of the last half-century.
But workers in manufacturing states are in many cases bearing the brunt of economic change. The nation has lost 837,000 manufacturing jobs since July 2000, by far the largest loss in any sector, and states that were recently thriving have been among the hardest hit. North Carolina has lost more such jobs than any other state, the flip side of enormous growth in the last 20 years, and it is here that the effects of rapid change are most visible. (Other states that have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs include California, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania.)
The state's jobless rate is the highest since 1993, rising to 5.3 percent in July this year from 3 percent in July 1999. The Hickory metropolitan area, which has about 350,000 residents and is known as the Unifour, has by no means the highest unemployment in the state -- 10 counties have double-digit unemployment, and 2 have more than 12 percent -- but the growth of its unemployment has been greater than anywhere else in the nation. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that joblessness in the four-county Hickory area grew by 4.5 percentage points in the last 12 months; the next highest was San Jose, Calif., where the rate grew by 2.5 percentage points.
This region has long been a capital of furniture and textile manufacturing, industries known for their unforgiving business cycles, but when the three largest manufacturers of fiber-optic cable began building factories in Hickory in the 1980's, the region's economic base seemed fully diversified. By last year, the nation's furniture capital was also producing 40 percent of the world's supply of fiber optics. But last summer all three industries hit a sharp decline almost simultaneously, beset by foreign competition and slowing demand for the older industries, as well as an oversupply of fiber-optic cable.
Nearly 1,000 fiber-optics workers in the area have lost their jobs this year, and there have been more than 2,000 layoffs in furniture, textiles and related industries. Ridgeview Inc., which has made socks in Catawba County for 89 years, closed its doors last year, putting 100 employees out of work. At the much smaller Jon-Scott Hosiery Company, where gray knitting machines spin white yarn into athletic socks, the entire third shift has been laid off, along with much of the second shift. Only a skeleton crew remains to mount the spools of yarn and box the socks.
"I don't know how long we're going to make it," said Bill Anderson, the head fixer at Jon-Scott's tiny factory on the west side of Hickory, where he spends the day moving among the machines, unimpeded by other employees. "We're down to about five people now, and they're shutting things down one or two weeks every month. It's been bad before, but I've never seen it like this."
J. D. Lane, 63, who ran a band saw at Fine Furniture, a chair manufacturer, in nearby Vale for 12 years, said he could not believe it when he was laid off a few weeks ago.
"I always figured there would always be a job for people like me," said Mr. Lane, who was one of 6,899 people to file new claims for unemployment insurance in Catawba County in July. "But now there's just nothing out there."
From the point of view of managers, the downturn has advantages. Several company officials said the period of 2.2 percent unemployment hampered their ability to expand product lines, and it cost them dearly to train employees who left at the next good offer. Scott L. Millar, president of Catawba County's economic recruiting agency, said local leaders had to turn away new industry when everyone was working.
"We weren't sure we could provide labor to them, and we didn't want to tick off the industries that were here by having their work forces raided," Mr. Millar said. "Not to mention how many companies didn't even look at us. But now, with the bad publicity we've been getting because of the unemployment numbers, we're getting a lot more interest from potential prospects. I've had six calls in the last two days, and a lot of them wouldn't have been interested last year."
At Century Furniture, a high-end manufacturer that has so far avoided all but 14 managerial layoffs, managers say productivity is significantly higher than last year, and they do not expect to return to essentially full employment. "When you have unemployment at 2.2 percent, it's just not sustainable," said Robert J. Maricich, the president of Century. "Nobody can grow."
Looking back on the region's boom years, local officials now consider the period of full employment as much of an anomaly as the current downturn, the extremes of a business cycle writhing through a transition from a factory economy. Though such thoughts may be of little comfort at the unemployment office, they reflect the widespread feeling in managerial offices about the usefulness of economic difficulty.
"There was a whole generation of workers in this region that had never experienced a challenge in finding and keeping jobs," Mr. Millar said. "They didn't understand that it wasn't normal. And frankly, I don't see it as unhealthy for a person to appreciate their job."

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday with a front-page article about the effect of rising unemployment on workplace relationships misstated the cause of a 100-job reduction at CommScope Inc. of North Carolina, a manufacturer of broadband cable. It is the slowing economy. The company is not under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: Afghans Present Aid Team's Sins, Complete With Theology Lesson 

BYLINE:  By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
Most foreign ministers do not begin news conferences with religious commentary, but Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil seemed compelled today to explain that the people of Afghanistan have great respect for Jesus Christ. After all, Jesus was not only a man of wisdom, but also someone who "cured lepers" and "brought the dead back to life." 
 But Jesus was not the greatest of the holy men, Mr. Muttawakil further expounded. That distinction goes to "Muhammad, peace be upon him, in that he was the last prophet." 
 Such matters of comparative theology are currently a pertinent topic in Afghanistan, for while Jesus may be highly regarded here, Christianity is not -- and that has become yet another big source of friction between international relief agencies and the Taliban mullahs who rule one of the world's poorest countries.
The news conference came on the third day of closed-door court proceedings for eight foreign aid workers accused of preaching Christianity, a crime that the Taliban have suggested may bring them the death penalty. Mr. Muttawakil used the news conference to display what he called more evidence of Christian evangelism: confiscated Bibles in local languages, audio tapes and videos. 
"O.K., turn it on," said Rehmatullah Hashmi, a foreign ministry official. A television set -- itself a forbidden thing -- brightened into life. A movie called "Jesus" appeared, its narrator extolling "the good news of the Virgin Mother and the Savior's birth." Soon, a young Jesus was on screen asking precocious questions of startled rabbis. 
"That's enough," said Mr. Hashmi, who tried some levity to accompany the grave accusations. "We have to put it off. Otherwise, we will also be proselytizing."
He then held up various items, including a children's book with Bible lessons on flash cards. "These books say Jesus Christ was the son of God," Mr. Hashmi patiently explained. "We don't believe this. We believe Jesus was a prophet but not the son of God." 
The Christian materials were said to have been found in the vacated offices of the United States-based International Assistance Mission, one of two aid groups that were expelled from the country last week. Some 50 employees of the agency, most of them Americans, hurriedly departed, leaving behind their work of feeding the hungry.
Had the "hundreds" of Persian- and Pashto-language Bibles been found earlier, these foreigners might too have been arrested -- or that is what the Taliban are declaring publicly. Privately, some officials say the timing was a way to avoid adding to the headache of what to do about the eight Christians already imprisoned since early August.
Those arrested aid workers -- two Americans, two Australians and four Germans -- were employed by the German-based agency Shelter Now. Sixteen other workers, all Afghans, are also jailed. But court proceedings began only against the foreigners on Tuesday.
"How long the trial will take is not clear, but we are moving along rapidly," said the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Noor Muhammad Saqib. 
The case skipped the lower courts, going directly to an assemblage of 22 legal experts and religious scholars. They have been reviewing the evidence, trying to decide how to proceed, Chief Justice Saqib said. Eventually, the matter will be turned over to an even larger group, which will allow the accused to appear and make statements. 
"We have no obligation to allow them legal counsel, but if they are having difficulties, this can be permitted," said the justice. "They can have any lawyer they want, Muslim or non-Muslim, Afghan or foreigner. This is for them to choose."
Ultimately, the case will be decided by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's seldom-seen supreme leader. He lives in Kandahar, far from Kabul, the nation's capital.
There has been confusion about the possible punishments for preaching Christianity. A recent edict from Mullah Omar would seem to indicate that the penalty for foreigners is 3 to 10 days in prison followed by expulsion. 
But today, Mr. Muttawakil, the bespectacled foreign minister, said that this rather light jail term applies only to people accused of the crime. "In this case, there is a difference. This is not just an accusation. There is proof."
The two Americans -- Heather Mercer, 24, and Dayna Curry, 29 -- were caught by the religious police in an Afghan home, itself an offense. They confessed to playing a CD-ROM about the life of Jesus. It lasted an hour, until "we had a problem with the computer." 
"The Shelter Now people have been preaching for a long time and their tentacles are everywhere," said Mr. Muttawakil, who is considered a moderate voice among the immoderate Taliban. "I cannot say what the parameters of the punishment may be." 
There was a broader purpose to the foreign minister's timely remarks. While thus far closed to the press, the court proceedings, which Afghanistan considersa "trial,", have nevertheless drawn a fair-sized contingent of the international media, all of them hopeful for a look at Taliban jurisprudence in so riveting a case. Mr. Muttawakil had an unusually large audience, and he used the opportunity to vent some frustration.
Only three nations recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government, he reminded the group, and the United Nations has imposed economic sanctions, insisting that Afghanistan no longer play host to the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden. But, he complained, what happens when the Taliban comply with the world's difficult requests? The growing of poppy plants has been banned in Afghanistan but little has been done to provide farmers with replacement income. 
"We believe that we are actually here to serve human rights but there is a slight difference on the definition of these rights," he said, addressing the many criticisms of the international community. "We believe in rights according to Islam, and if anybody is trying to impose their definition of the human rights on us, they will be sadly mistaken because this world is not a world of one culture or one religion."
Afghanistan is in its 4th year of a catastrophic drought and 22nd year of unremitting war. The United Nations and hundreds of relief agencies provide help that now accounts for more than $300 million a year. But these organizations and the Taliban frequently have been at odds over issues steeped in cultural conflicts and mutual distrust. 
Today, Mr. Muttawakil announced that a new commission had been formed to supervise the activities of the United Nations and the relief agencies, the so-called nongovernmental organizations or NGO's. Strict rules, overlooked in the past, would be enforced, he said. Taliban approval would be required for the hiring of staff workers. Money would have to be channeled through the Afghanistan National Bank.
"We have been relaxed, but now the NGO's will be made to obey the laws," he said.
The gathering had taken on a hostile air. The foreign minister seemed to realize this and returned to the more ecumenical tone of his religious commentary.
He said, "We will end this conference by saying, praise be to Jesus Christ, who will eventually come as a Muslim and will follow the teachings of Islam."

HEADLINE: State Colleges, Feeling Pinch, Cut Costs and Raise Tuitions 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: CLEMSON, S.C., Sept. 6 

 BODY:
As students settle into classes at Clemson University this fall semester, the pink crape myrtles are blooming as usual, but the sense of anticipation is muted.
 Like dozens of other public universities around the country, Clemson raised its tuition sharply this summer and put off a number of maintenance projects, signaling the abrupt end of a relatively flush period for the nation's state colleges. 
 The economic boom of the 1990's enabled Clemson and many of its competitors to expand while holding the line on tuition. But the economic slowdown and the decline in state aid have forced those institutions to cut some costs and raise fees. 
At the University of Minnesota, tuition for state residents has risen 12 percent, or $600, to $5,500 this academic year. Last year, the increase was 3 percent.
The University of Tennessee, whose legislative patrons have been wrestling with a decline in tax revenue, raised tuition by 13 percent. The university says it has had to fill some professorships with part-time professors because it cannot afford to pay salaries high enough to attract experienced candidates.
And while the College of William and Mary, a public institution in Williamsburg, Va., held its tuition increase to 2 percent this year, it did so only by freezing faculty salaries and suspending a $16 million renovation of its biology and psychology building. That 30-year-old building, where a fifth of the students take courses to meet the requirements of their majors, has a badly leaking roof and outdated laboratory equipment.
The tuition increases and budget shortfalls seem most pronounced in the South and the Midwest. The State University of New York is not raising its tuition; Rutgers University in New Jersey is increasing its rate by 5 percent; and the University of Connecticut by 3.9 percent.
While some private colleges and universities have seen their endowments and alumni donations fall this year along with the stock market, those losses have not yet had a major effect on fees or student services.
In part, that is because those institutions spend only a small part of their investment earnings each year. Not so the public colleges: they have felt the impact of cuts in state allocations or of increases that did not keep up with inflation.
Nowhere has the new burden on students been as high proportionately as at Clemson, founded in 1889 on a plantation in the northwest corner of South Carolina.
The Clemson trustees announced in the summer that they were raising tuition and fees this year by 25 percent, or $900, for South Carolina residents, most of its students. Students without scholarships will be charged $4,490 this year, well above the national average for public universities, which was $3,510 for 2000-2001. In the previous five years, the combined increases in tuition at Clemson had totaled less than 15 percent.
While the university said it was responding to a lean state budget and the rising costs of health insurance and electricity, it also said it was motivated by loftier goals.
The university said it was intent on proceeding with ambitious projects intended, before the economic slowdown, to vault Clemson into the upper tier of public research universities.
A 10-year mission statement approved by the trustees in January, for example, set such goals as grooming "at least two Clemson students to win Rhodes scholarships" (none ever has) and raising faculty salaries to a level competitive with institutions like the University of Michigan.
"Your child is attending the university that was designated Time magazine's Public College of the Year for 2001," the Clemson president, James F. Barker, wrote to parents in June, explaining a tuition increase that was then projected at 42 percent, but was later scaled back.
But the goal of catching the attention of the educational handicappers at publications like Time and U.S. News and World Report has meant little to Nicolle Mohrbacher, 19, a sophomore from Charleston, S.C. To pay the higher tuition, she has had to seek another student loan and postpone plans to buy a used car.
"They should have done it gradually," Ms. Mohrbacher said. "I don't see why they're in such a hurry to have so much money."
Alyson Gibson, a pharmacy major from Columbia, S.C., said that to pay for the tuition increase, she must spend more time at her $5.25-an-hour work-study job.
Ms. Gibson said she understood the reasons for the increase and was willing to pay her share in a bid to raise Clemson's academic profile.
But she was among students who lamented that while Clemson's 79,000-seat football stadium was undergoing a major renovation, paint was peeling in campus buildings and the old one-piece desks in some classrooms were too small and slanted to accommodate laptop computers.
"A lot of the money goes to Clemson athletics," Ms. Gibson said. "Everybody knows that."
Clemson officials say the athletic program pays for itself, largely from television revenue, and contributes income to academic programs.
Though the last few years were relatively good for public universities, Mark G. Yudof, the president of the University of Minnesota, said the trend had been bleak for at least three decades.
Several states, including Minnesota, that once provided 60 percent of the budgets of their state universities now supply less than 40 percent, Mr. Yudof said.
If legislatures do not act soon to reverse that trend, he said, they risk pricing out those students whose need for a state-financed education is most acute.
"There is a long-term trend where state governments are telling kids to pay for their own education," Mr. Yudof said. As the American population ages, he said, legislators are concluding that higher education "is not where the votes are."
Public universities like Clemson are already beginning to scale back one core mission, their agricultural extension services, which have provided free advice and expertise to farmers for generations, as stipulated in their charters. While Clemson's main allocation this year from South Carolina was unchanged from last year's, the budget of its extension service was cut by $5 million, or 10 percent.
One critical indication of whether public universities and their students will remain a priority, at least for South Carolina legislators, will come later this year. 
In 1998, the governor and the legislature established a scholarship program that now provides $3,000 to any freshman at a state university who graduated from high school with a B average and a SAT score of at least 1050.
To keep the scholarship in future years, a student must maintain a college grade-point average of 3.
Next year, by statute, the scholarship amounts were to be raised to cover full tuition at the state's colleges, whatever that might be. But given the current economic climate, students and administrators at Clemson are skeptical that the state will keep its promise.
The Clemson trustees have already signaled that they expect the economy to get worse before it gets better. And they have voted to raise tuition again next year by at least $600, or 13 percent.

HEADLINE: School Construction Debate Pits City Against Rest of State in Albany Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The way the state pays for school construction has become one of the main stumbling blocks in negotiations between the governor and legislative leaders over a supplementary budget, and the debate is pitting upstate and suburban lawmakers against their urban colleagues.
 For a month, Gov. George E. Pataki has been driving a hard bargain in private talks with the Democratic Assembly speaker and the Republican Senate majority leader, who are seeking to add more money to the $14.1 billion the governor proposed giving local districts this year. 
 In essence, Mr. Pataki has cried poor, legislators say. He has maintained that tax revenues are shrinking and that the state cannot afford more than the $382 million increase he put in his January budget unless the Legislature revamps the building program for schools and puts those savings toward educational programs. 
But his proposed changes in the way the state reimburses schools would hurt upstate and suburban districts, who have gone on a building binge in recent years, more than it would hurt New York City schools, which have been slower to take advantage of state money for construction. 
In August, after four months of budget gridlock, the Democrat-led Assembly and Republican-led Senate overcame their partisan differences and passed a parsimonious budget that stripped about $4 billion from the governor's proposed $83.6 billion budget. Their intent was to force the governor, who had resisted negotiations, to bargain over a supplemental budget that would include not only his pet programs but a few of theirs as well.
During the talks, the governor has advocated saving money by stretching out payments on the bonds that local districts floated for construction, to reduce payments in the short run. He has also said the education department should rank projects and only finance the most urgent. Those changes would free up about $200 million this year, lawmakers say.
"This is an idea that will save school districts money in the short term," said the governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon. "It will allow all projects to move forward."
But the governor's insistence on these changes in three-way talks this week has enraged many Senate Republicans and Assembly Democrats, especially lawmakers from New York City suburbs. Because those districts are relatively wealthy, they receive very little aid for educational programs from the state, but they do depend on aid for construction and transportation.
In suburban eyes, the governor is trying to alter the building program retroactively after local voters approved bond acts on the promise of state aid. In 1997, the Legislature and the governor approved incentives to encourage school construction, and spending on new schools has tripled since then, to $5 billion. Many districts borrowed money on a 10- or 15-year schedule, counting on the state to help pay it back. The governor's plan would now force them to refinance those loans over 30 years.
"If we don't repair the building aid issue, we are changing the rules after the start of the game," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Westchester County.
The Assembly Democrats, meanwhile, have been pushing for extra money to pay for a new contract with New York City teachers, which could cost as much as $300 million. They have also been trying to restore about $500 million for preschool classes, all-day kindergarten, smaller classes and after-school programs.
The governor and legislative leaders have not yet agreed on an overall amount for additional school aid, but they have been talking about a figure in the range of $800 million to $900 million, several people with knowledge of the talks said. Since all new school aid must fit under that cap, the Senate Republicans, led by Joseph L. Bruno, are worried that they would be giving up money for building new schools just to free up cash that would flow mostly to New York City.
"It's a zero-sum game for our districts," one Republican staff member said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "There would be no more money going to upstate and suburban schools."
Senator Bruno has suggested in the talks that the city's school-construction program should also be investigated and overhauled. He points out that the Board of Education cannot account for about $2.8 billion that was supposed to be spent on building new schools. Assembly Democrats have resisted that idea.
"The darn problem from my point of view is that New York City reforms aren't any part of what was going on" in the negotiations, Senator Bruno said.
So far, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, has also said he does not support the governor's changes in building aid, partly because some Democratic Assembly members from Westchester County also oppose them. But Mr. Silver is still fighting for more money for New York City teachers and other programs dear to urban educators.
That leaves the three men at the bargaining table with a big problem: where to find other revenue. The Assembly Democrats want Mr. Pataki to dip into his reserves of about $2.8 billion. The governor says he needs that money to hedge against an economic downturn. Instead he has put several gambling proposals on the table. But even they would not produce much money for education this year.

U.S. No Longer Seeking A Breakup of Microsoft
Reversing the government's strategy in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, the Bush administration announced that it would no longer seek a breakup of the software company. The government also abandoned a central claim of the lawsuit that Microsoft had violated federal antitrust law by integrating its Internet Explorer browser software into its Windows operating system.
 The action marked a sharp departure by the Bush administration from the Clinton administration's belief that breaking Microsoft apart was the only effective way to curb its business practices. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Citigroup to Pay Up to $20 Million in Deceptive-Lending Case 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Citigroup has agreed to pay up to $20 million to North Carolina customers of the Associates First Capital Corporation to settle allegations that Associates illegally tricked them into buying expensive and unneeded credit insurance as part of their mortgage loans, a practice at the center of a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Associates.
 Associates, one of the nation's largest consumer lenders, has long been a target of consumer advocates who describe the company as the worst "predatory lender" in the nation. 
 Predatory lending refers to the practice of deceptively packing high fees, credit insurance and other charges into home loans to unsophisticated borrowers while inducing them to repeatedly "flip" their loans through refinancings that serve only to generate big fees for lenders. 
Citigroup acquired Associates last year and has been trying to settle regulatory investigations and hundreds of private lawsuits. The agreement yesterday ends the North Carolina attorney general's investigation of Associates, which began in 1999, the year the state became the first to pass laws against predatory lending. Citigroup also agreed to pay $300,000 to the state.
In a statement yesterday, the attorney general, Roy Cooper, said: "The investigation revealed that the Associates pressured its employees to sell credit insurance on all mortgage loans. It used deceptive tactics to add expensive prepaid credit insurance premiums to the loans, and then finance those premiums at high interest rates over the life of the loan."
Citigroup, in the settlement, denied allegations of wrongdoing. In the past, company officials said they were working to improve lending practices at former Associates branches. Last month, Citigroup also said that it had suspended more than 1,200 pending foreclosures involving Associates customers after an internal review found "serious enough problems in the way the loan was originated."
Under pressure from consumer advocates and some lawmakers and regulators, Citigroup also recently said it would stop selling single-premium credit insurance. The insurance, which is generally intended to pay off a loan should the borrower become disabled or dies, has a premium of one lump sum assessed when the policy is originated and the sum is typically rolled into the loan balance.
F.T.C. officials have said that during the last five years, Associates earned more than $800 million in premiums from the insurance while paying out less than $300 million in benefits.
In its lawsuit, the agency said that employees at the company, instead of properly disclosing the insurance to customers, would call it "total payment protection," and, at least until mid-1998, were instructed to quote the monthly payment for the loan with the insurance automatically included.
The F.T.C.'s lawsuit is in federal district court in Atlanta, where a motion to dismiss, filed by Citigroup, is pending. Since the acquisition, Citigroup has settled more than 200 private lawsuits against Associates, though more than 400 remain.
The settlement yesterday allows North Carolina residents who purchased single-premium credit insurance from Associates between August 1995 and July 2000 to receive a refund of the premium, depending on whether they ever filed a claim for the insurance. About 9,000 state residents are eligible, Mr. Cooper said.

HEADLINE: Plan to Build Newark Arena Falls Apart 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
The proposal to build a $355 million sports arena in Newark and redevelop the Meadowlands fell apart today when a key Assembly committee canceled a hearing on the issue, effectively derailing the legislation.
 The plan would have provided a new home for the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, and was seen as vital to helping further the renaissance of downtown Newark. But in recent weeks the plan had come under increasing scrutiny, with the Republican candidate for governor, Bret D. Schundler, warning that taxpayers might end up footing some of the bill and calling for a referendum on the issue. 
 Some backers of the arena plan held out hope that it could be revived after the gubernatorial election in November, which was backed by the Republican acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and a bipartisan group of legislators. 
The cancellation of the hearing drew a quick and angry retort from officials with the YankeeNets, owner of the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, which is seeking to move the teams to Newark from their current home at the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands by the opening of the 2004 basketball and hockey seasons.
"Our proposition has been simply stated for nearly three years: If we are not in Newark, we will not be in the Meadowlands either," said Len Coleman, the chairman of Newark Sports and Entertainment, which would run the arena. "And we won't be. Today's message to the YankeeNets was, in effect: Find someplace else to do business. We hear the message."
The vote represented a major setback for YankeeNets, whose corporate partner is George Steinbrenner, and reflected the increased scrutiny nationally of publicly-financed sports complexes.
The cancellation of the hearing by the Appropriations Committee was announced just after Mr. DiFrancesco held hurried meetings with Assembly Republican leaders in an effort to salvage the bill. In recent days, Assembly leadership introduced millions of dollars in additions to the measure, all ostensibly to broaden support for it. 
Most committee members could not be reached for comment on the measure. But Assemblywoman Connie Myers of Washington, a member of the committee's Republican majority, said that for her, the millions of dollars in extra projects had made the bill "too complex to reach a consensus at a tough time of the year," as election neared. 
The collapse of the plan came after two weeks of attacks by Mr. Schundler, who criticized it as "a Christmas tree" for lawmakers and a money pit for taxpayers. Those attacks seemed to force his Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, who had supported the original plan, to announce this morning that he, too, opposed the measure, terming it "a pork barrel feast."
Mr. DiFrancesco, who had hoped that committee approval would pave the way for a special session this month to vote on the measure, said in a statement that he was "deeply disappointed." 
"What started as an effort to address a very real and significant problem has apparently fallen victim to election-year politics and legislative parochialism," he said. But he held out hope that the plan, shorn of some of the added projects, might ultimately survive.
The winner today appeared to be Mr. Schundler, who swept victoriously into the committee room in the Capitol minutes before the cancellation of the hearing was announced. Accompanied by about two dozen of his supporters who had clogged the committee room, he held an impromptu news conference. 
"I am gratified that we have this resolution," he said, smiling. "Jim McGreevey and the Democrats, in the face of our opposition, have caved in. The Republican caucus made a decision that they didn't want to go along with this."
Mr. Schundler's supporters said the developments showed that he had wrested control of the state party away from Mr. DiFrancesco, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and other moderate Republicans who had been cool to his candidacy.
"Bret Schundler had control of the party on June 26," said his campaign manager, Bill Pascoe, referring to the candidate's primary election victory over Bob Franks. "But for those who may not have gotten the memo then, I think Bret answered their questions unequivocally today."
Assemblyman William D. Payne, a Democrat of Newark and a supporter of the arena, said he found its defeat and Mr. McGreevey's abandonment of it disappointing. 
"Schundler has put some fear into people, but we should not be kowtowing," he said. 
Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said in a statement that the plan had been "derailed by ugly partisan politics," but added that he hoped lawmakers would reverse themselves. 
It was unclear whether the proposal could be revived. For his part, Mr. Schundler pronounced the issue tabled until the November election was over. One of his supporters, Assemblywoman Rose Marie Heck, a Republican of Lodi, suggested that the matter was dead. Like other Bergen County legislators who feel spurned by the teams' desire to leave the Continental Airlines Arena, she said she was not moved by threats to move the teams. "The YankeeNets could go play in California for all I care. We opened our hearts to them, and this is the way they repay us."
Other Republicans speculated that after the election, in a lame duck session, Mr. DiFrancesco might have more leverage, especially if voting goes against Mr. Schundler and the current Republican majority in both houses. 
But some among Mr. DiFrancesco's allies said that that was unlikely.
"Why would he help them then when they wouldn't help him now?" said one ally who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Lewis M. Eisenberg, whose talks with the YankeeNets formed the basis of the arena bill, suggested that officials might yet embrace the proposal. It relieves the state of $20 million a year in subsidies for the Continental Airlines Arena and $160 million in debt on the Meadowlands site, he said.
"Furthermore, one of the unintended consequences of the timing of this legislation is that it will create thousands of jobs and millions in commerce at a time when the national and state economies are ebbing and unemployment is rising," he added.

HEADLINE: Retailers Report Disappointing Sales for August 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The federal tax rebates, which were supposed to stimulate demand for consumer goods, failed to transform America's shoppers into bigger spenders in August, resulting in disappointing sales for many stores and renewing fears that the December holiday shopping season will be one of the most lackluster in years.
 Sales over all rose 2.8 percent for the month, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index issued yesterday, but sales at many department stores fell, as expected. Consumers appeared to head instead for discounters like Wal-Mart Stores and T. J. Maxx, a unit of TJX, if they were going to part with their cash. But even Wal-Mart executives, who had offered to cash the rebate checks for shoppers right in their stores, said on Wednesday that there had been no "overly significant" impact on sales as a result. 
 "The tax rebates have been a nonevent," said Shari Schwartzman Eberts, a retail analyst for J. P. Morgan. Even President Bush acknowledged last month that instead of rushing to the nearest mall to spend his own rebate, he had given it away to an unspecified charity. 
Wal-Mart's same-store sales grew 7 percent in August, according to Goldman, Sachs, while Target's same-store sales increased 2.4 percent. Shares of Wal-Mart fell $1.78, to $47.37. 
Kmart, the nation's second-largest discounter after Wal-Mart, increased same-store sales 0.2 percent, according to the Goldman, Sachs index. Costco Wholesale's same-store sales rose 4 percent.
Inside the no-frills discounters, customers appear to be cutting back their spending. "America has become a nation of bargain-hunters, but not only that, they are buying less than they bought last year," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
Continuing worry about the economy, and personal concern about job layoffs, have made many consumers skittish about spending money, Mr. Barnard and others said. Many companies are announcing second rounds of layoffs as the economy continues to falter, and shoppers tend to put off purchases if they do not think they will have the income to pay for them. 
"Job layoffs and the news surrounding job layoffs have affected consumer confidence," said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers. "The discounters did better, reflecting the fact that people are trading down." 
Department stores lost ground, although their results were about what analysts had expected. Same-store sales at Saks fell 2 percent in August, and sales at Federated Department Stores fell 2.6 percent. 
The specialty retailers experienced mixed results. At Gap Inc., which has been struggling to redefine itself at a time when business in all stores has trailed off, sales in August fell 17 percent, according to the Goldman, Sachs report. At Limited, same-store sales dropped 4 percent. Same-store sales compare sales in stores that have been open at least a year.
The results from August indicate that the rest of the year will be off as well, several analysts said. "We are leery of the idea that the American consumer will bounce back in the near term," Mr. Feiner said. "We are cautious on our outlook for retailing in the near term, through Christmas." 
Some stores may be in a position to weather the downturn, after cutting back orders and curbing expenses since the beginning of the year. But Ms. Eberts of J. P. Morgan noted that the cuts were based on existing buying patterns among consumers, and cautioned that if demand dropped further, even those stores could find themselves with too many products left over on their shelves.
"They are all taking a conservative approach that assumes the continuation of current trends," she said. "I don't think many retailers are planning for the trend to get worse."

HEADLINE: House Passes Broad Trade Pact With Vietnam 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
The House voted today to approve a wide-ranging trade agreement with Vietnam that would end decades of economic sanctions imposed by the United States against its former enemy.
 The voice vote on the agreement cleared the way for final approval in the Senate, where the trade pact has overwhelming support. 
 The agreement was reached last year by the Communist government in Vietnam and the Clinton administration, and it was endorsed by President Bush after he took office. But Congressional approval was stalled in the House, where a handful of opponents tried to kill the measure by bundling it in a larger bill with several more difficult trade issues. 
The vote today relieved diplomats, business executives, economists and others who had argued that the accord would benefit the United States by opening a market of more than 80 million people to American products while encouraging political changes by Vietnam's rigidly authoritarian government.
The agreement would grant Vietnam the same "normal trade relations" that nearly all countries enjoy with the United States, would lower tariffs on both sides and would force the Vietnamese to enforce copyright protections for American goods.
"It's time that we no longer view Vietnam simply as a war," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Washington Republican who noted that Boeing, which builds jet airliners in her state, planned to sell four 777 jumbo jets to Vietnam for its state airline. "Engagement with Vietnam does not diminish our commitment toward pressing the Vietnamese government to respect basic human rights."
Opponents of the bill, backed by prominent human rights and veterans' groups, said it was wrong to have normal trade relations with Vietnam while its government continued to persecute political opponents, religious leaders and ethnic minorities.
The debate in the House today was a reminder of just how much bitterness lingers in the relationship between the two nations 25 years after the end of the war and six years after they established formal diplomatic relations.
Representative Michael R. McNulty, a New York Democrat whose brother was killed in 1970 while serving as a hospital corpsman in Vietnam, said he objected to normal trade relations while the United States continued to press Hanoi for help in the search for the remains of American troops killed in the war. "I do oppose declaring business as usual when the remains of American service personnel are still being recovered," he said.
Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat whose southern California district includes one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside Vietnam, said it was wrong to open trade relations with Vietnam "until we do something about political and human rights in Vietnam."
"I'm concerned that we are losing our economic leverage without gaining concrete verifiable steps toward reform," she said.
Economists have said that as a result of the trade agreement, Vietnam's exports to the United States, mainly textiles and light manufactured goods, could more than double. Trade between the United States and Vietnam totaled $1 billion last year.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
In a soft economy, the National Football League changes direction and tries to woo casual fans.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TO expand its fan base -- and not so incidentally, to help counter slipping ratings and declining advertising sales for the telecasts of its games -- the National Football League is taking a walk on the mild side.
 After years of assertive, sometimes bombastic promotional campaigns, produced internally, carrying the bold theme "Feel the power," the league is switching strategies with its first effort from an outside agency. 
 A quieter, lower-key campaign, which will begin Sunday with the kickoff weekend of the 2001-2002 N.F.L. season, is being created by the New York office of Young & Rubicam Advertising, part of the Young & Rubicam division of the WPP Group, and it carries the theme: "This is what it's all about."
Not even football, one of the nation's most popular spectator sports, is immune from the effects of the softening economy. The demand for commercial time during the games is down and, as a result, so are the prices charged by the networks that carry the league's telecasts. The trade publications Advertising Age and Mediaweek estimate that those networks -- ABC, CBS, ESPN and Fox -- are selling spots at prices 5 percent to 15 percent less than last season. 
The four networks will give the spots that make up the new campaign commercial time that is valued at more than $100 million. The spots are to run during various programs, daytime and nighttime, in addition to during games.
The intent of the campaign is to broaden the audience for professional football by enticing casual fans to follow the sport more closely -- by, say, watching games more often, which would raise ratings and permit the networks to raise commercial prices. Before, during the "Feel the power" days, the league placed more emphasis in its campaigns on reinforcing the ardor of devoted, hard-core football fans.
The change in target audiences is the reason for moving from the aggressive style of the earlier campaigns, which presented a large number of film clips showing intense, hard-charging moments from games and practices, to the kinder, gentler approach for the new season. That is typified by the complete absence of game film from the commercials, which instead tell warm and fuzzy, even whimsical stories that are fan-focused.
The league and Y.& R. New York "did a lot of research with avid and casual fans," said John Collins, senior vice president for marketing and entertainment programming at the National Football League in New York, "and they're different."
"People who are avid fans, when they talk about the game, they say they love it as a collision sport, along with talking about the athleticism and grace of the players," he said, "while somebody who is a little less of a fan sees more of a one-dimensional aspect to the collisions, the 'rough, tough' aspects."
So to transform the casual fan into a more dedicated fan, Mr. Collins said, the decision was made to concentrate on what he described as the "social currency" of football, "not just as a sports league but as sports entertainment."
"The connection to a bigger community is why these people watch," he said, "talking to their buddies about the game, going into work the next day and sharing stories."
To stimulate good feelings about the N.F.L. brand, the commercials depict casual fans on game day. In one spot, a fan's pregame rituals are compared to those of his favorite player, Eddie George, a running back for the Tennessee Titans, while in the background, Lionel Richie sings the soft-rock ballad "Easy."
In a second spot, a fan's "N.F.L. experience" turns out to be a barbecue in his backyard for family and friends gathered to watch a game. "You win here," a voiceover announcer intones in a parody of game-film narrators, "you just might get the game at your house next week, too."
A third spot is the most emotional. Set on a farm, it shows a teenage boy seated next to his grandmother on a porch swing, watching a game on a small TV set. His friends drive up in a pickup and one calls out: "Hey, Billy, we're going into town to meet the girls. Wanna come?"
The boy looks at his grandmother and she looks at him. Pause. It's really not that tough a choice. . "Nah, I'm just gonna stay here today," he finally replies. The pickup leaves and the boy -- and the girl he would rather be with -- resume watching the game.
Is that spot as corny as the Kansas City Chiefs in August, or what?
"In New York, it's a little corny, but to people out in America, it will touch a nice emotion with them," said Jim Ferguson, president and chief creative officer at Y.& R. New York.
"Hey, don't be a cynical New Yorker," he added. "There's a world beyond the Hudson."
Mr. Ferguson, who said he wrote the farm spot himself, contrasted the agency's approach with the "very funny, outlandish humor we found in most sports advertising," particularly for cable channels like ESPN and Fox Sports Network, which aim primarily at younger men who are sports fanatics.
"We've already got the heavy user in our pocket," he said. "We found the casual users aren't attracted to the violence of the game."
As for younger men, Mr. Collins said, there is "one spot Jim has in development on the relationship sons have with their fathers and how football is a point of connection for those fans."
"That spot, for Thanksgiving, will be the spot every young guy -- as well as every father -- will say 'That's me.' "
In other words, if you think the farm spot is corny, just wait.
The decision to shift strategy was developed, said Marianne Raphael, account director at Y.& R. New York, through the use of a research technique the agency calls the Brand Asset Valuator, which found that "N.F.L. football in general is considered a great equalizer for people of all different ages, backgrounds, cultures."
"The real power of the N.F.L. is that emotional connection," she said.
In addition, the agency is creating spots to promote the sale of league merchandise through a catalog and a Web site (www.nfl.com). Those spots are as humorous as the others are schmaltzy; they show a fan pilfering jerseys, shorts, even mouth pieces from the New York Giants locker room as an announcer declares, "There's an easier way to get the gear the pros wear."
Mr. Collins said plans call for the introduction in November of a "Gridiron Classics" line of clothing, produced by an N.F.L. sponsor, Reebok International, featuring "contemporary, Abercrombie & Fitch apparel" like "retro lettermen's jackets."
And the league is "talking to a number of different partners right now about an opportunity for a football-only monthly publication," he added.
The kickoff weekend for the football season will bring, as it always does, the start of campaigns and special commercials from N.F.L. sponsors and other advertisers that seek to reach the consumers who watch the games.
They include Southwest Airlines, with the fourth year of its humorous "Must be football season" campaign by GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, and Visa U.S.A., with two new spots in its campaign carrying the theme "Visa. It's everywhere N.F.L. fans want to be." Those spots are by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, also part of Omnicom.
"I know it's a tough advertising marketplace out there," Mr. Collins said, "but at the end of the day, N.F.L. football is still one of the best ways to reach large audiences on a week-to-week basis."

HEADLINE: Fox Urges Congress to Grant Rights to Mexican Immigrants in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox of Mexico urged a joint meeting of Congress today to grant legal rights to millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants, saying they bring large economic and cultural benefits to the United States. 
 "Let me be clear about this," Mr. Fox said. "Regularization does not mean rewarding those who break the law. Regularization means that we give legal rights to people who are already contributing to this great nation." 
 Alternating almost seamlessly between Spanish and English, he asked Congress for stronger ties and greater trust between the United States and Mexico. It is a theme that has been highlighted on his first official visit to Washington. 
Mr. Fox also urged the legislators to show confidence in his government, the first to be led by a president elected from the opposition, by supporting legislation that would exempt Mexico from the United States's drug certification program and that would allow Mexican trucks on American highways. 
President Bush, playing host for the first state visit of his administration, expressed support for Mr. Fox's proposals and said he understood the Mexican leader's urgency. He warned Congress that he would veto an appropriations bill that would ban Mexican trucks from the United States. 
Mr. Bush also called the drug certification process counterproductive and unfair to Mexico. Every year since 1986, the White House has had to certify to Congress that Mexico is doing its part in the war on drugs.
"We are committed to becoming a true partner with the United States in the fight against drugs," Mr. Fox said. "But trust requires that one partner is not unilaterally judged by another."
On Mr. Fox's quest to reach an agreement on the immigration issue by the end of the year, Mr. Bush said, "I want to accommodate my friend." Then he explained the political struggle ahead.
"This is an incredibly complex issue," Mr. Bush said. "It is complex to the point where my administration is going to spend a lot of time on resolving that type of question. But to make matters even more complicated, we've got to work with the Congress, and we've got to come up with a solution that Congress can accept."
Acting after President Fox addressed Congress, the Senate approved a measure giving illegal immigrants more time to seek visas.
Legislators seemed divided along party lines on Mr. Fox's proposals to expand programs for guest workers and to give legal work status to 3.5 million Mexicans in the United States. Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said that he agreed with Mr. Fox's request for quick action on immigration and that he thought that legislation was possible by the end of the year. 
But Representative Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who heads the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, said he opposed any amnesty for illegal immigrants.
Despite the partisan differences, legislators expressed admiration for Mr. Fox and for the ties that he has forged between the two countries that have shared a wall of distrust for much of the last century.
"The bottom line is the fences are going to go down between these two countries," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said. "And it's in the interest of both countries that we make it work." 
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, called the speech "muy excelente."
Mr. Fox boasted of his legitimacy before American legislators. "The dream that for decades was unfulfilled is now a reality," he said, bringing legislators to one of three ovations. 
It is a legitimacy that Mr. Fox hopes will help level the playing field in negotiations with the United States over contentious issues like narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration. He also hopes to turn the burgeoning feelings of trust between Washington and Mexico City into reforms and programs that will help lift his nation out of social distress.
"Give trust a chance," he said, to more applause. "Give our two governments a chance."
In a joint statement released after the address, both presidents celebrated the "special friendship and authentic partnership" that they had achieved. The statement indicated that the two had reached accords on sharing assets seized in joint law-enforcement operations, on a $50 million college scholarship program to spur studies in economic development and the creation of a public-private alliance to generate growth in the private sector throughout Mexico.
The Mexican national security adviser, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, said the two governments had nearly worked out the organization of new binational law-enforcement units. 
In his speech, Mr. Fox emphasized that his government had already demonstrated its commitment to fighting organized crime by arresting important drug traffickers and smugglers of immigrants over the nine months that he has been in office.
Calling the North American Free Trade Agreement an incomplete treaty, Mr. Fox urged legislators to back away from safety standards that have prohibited Mexican trucks from entering the United States. 
He said he spoke in the name of 100 million Mexicans in his country seeking similar hopes for a more prosperous Mexico. But some of his most earnest pronouncements were directed at Mexicans who are living in the United States. He told the legislators that immigrants were always more of a benefit than a cost to the countries that receive them. 
He said he was seeking measures that would lift the ceilings on the numbers of Mexicans who are granted permanent visas to the United States, expand opportunities for Mexican guest workers and save lives on the United States-Mexico border.
Reminding legislators of this country's immigrant past, Mr. Fox paid homage to "the brave men and women who had taken the challenge to build new lives for themselves and their families."
Then he spoke to Mexico's immigrants in the United States. "Mexico will never forget you," he said. "We will support you. And we will not fail."

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Extols India, Accepting Its Atom Status 

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
Robert D. Blackwill, the new American ambassador to India, today offered the fullest description yet of the Bush administration's drive to turn India and the United States into "fast friends and international partners" after decades of strained relations.
 What he did not say was as revealing as what he did say. In a 45-minute address to business leaders in Bombay, Mr. Blackwill, a former Harvard lecturer who was one of several advisers to Mr. Bush on foreign policy during the presidential campaign, never criticized India for beginning nuclear tests in 1998. 
Instead, he extolled the common ground that the two nations have recently found on nuclear issues, strongly suggested that the administration would soon approach Congress on the lifting of sanctions imposed on India after the tests and pledged that the United States "will not be a nagging nanny."
The tenor and substance of the ambassador's remarks signaled a calm recognition of India's nuclear status. And that is a change. 
Even when Bill Clinton visited India last year on a presidential tour that was more lovefest than slugfest, he gently scolded India, saying its decision to conduct the tests had eroded barriers to the spread of nuclear weapons. He also urged India to sign the nuclear test ban treaty, another issue Mr. Blackwill did not mention.
The Bush administration's respectful treatment of India's nuclear ambitions is part of a broader diplomatic strategy to engage India on a range of issues, including liberalized trade, counterterrorism, Mr. Bush's missile defense initiative and collaborative efforts to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.
"President Bush has a big idea about India-U.S. relations," Mr. Blackwill said. "My president's big idea is that by working together more intensely than ever before, the United States and India, two vibrant democracies, can transform fundamentally the very essence of our bilateral relationship and thereby make the world freer, more peaceful and more prosperous."
Mr. Blackwill recalled a day in 1999 in Austin, Tex., when he asked Mr. Bush why he had a special interest in India. "He immediately responded: 'A billion people in functioning democracy. Isn't that something? Isn't that something?' "
In coming months, the ambassador said, a stream of cabinet members and administration officials are already scheduled or likely to visit India. They include Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser.
Those visits will certainly be a change from the first two years of the first Bush administration, from 1989 to 1991, when not a single cabinet-level officer working for Mr. Bush's father visited India, according to Dennis Kux, an historian on Indian-American relations.
"India was really off the radar scope then," Mr. Kux said today. "There was practically no American investment in India. The cold war was ending, and the focus was there. And Pakistan was the main plank of our interest in South Asia because of the Afghan war.
"Daddy ignored India," Mr. Kux said. "Junior is embracing it."
Despite the upbeat nature of the ambassador's speech, several contentious issues may elude the search for common ground between the United States and India.
For instance, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, came to India last month and sought to convince the government here that it was in India's interests to join a new round of international trade talks. But India has continued to be the leader of a group of developing countries, including Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, that say a host of issues from the last round of talks should be resolved first. 
Mr. Blackwill also offered a note of warning on an issue that is dear to the heart of Kenneth Lay, the chairman of Enron who is also one of Mr. Bush's close friends and important campaign fund-raisers. 
The ambassador said the American government hoped that a fair solution could be found soon to a messy dispute over a financially troubled $3 billion power plant -- by far India's largest foreign investment -- that Enron largely owns. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has defaulted on payments for the power, and Enron is now trying to get the bills paid.
"I want to be frank," Mr. Blackwill said. "These disputes have darkened India's investment climate. I know this personally from speaking with some of the premier American business executives with major investments in India."
But over all, Mr. Blackwill's message was optimistic, and he said he even recently saw a headline in a national Indian newspaper that said, "U.S., India on the Same Side."

HEADLINE: Two Amigos Visit Toledo And Court Its Mexicans 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
Toiling 72-hour weeks in a tomato-packing plant near here, Noelia Reynoso doesn't have much time for politicians. But she said she was warming to President Bush and to President Vicente Fox of Mexico after both leaders today praised the contributions of Mexican migrants and pledged to improve their lives. 
 "I liked what both of them said, knowing that as Mexicans we count," said Ms. Reynoso, 17, one of 500 migrant workers dressed in red-and-black T-shirts who union leaders bused in for an indoor rally at the University of Toledo. 
 But elsewhere in the crowd of 8,000 students, faculty members and residents, the two presidents' remarks extolling improved ties on trade and law enforcement, and limited progress on legalizing some of the 3.5 million Mexicans working here unlawfully, drew a more skeptical reaction. 
"Let's get real, it's a photo op," said Louis P. Escobar, a Democrat and a Mexican American who in 1997 became the first Latino to serve on the Toledo City Council. "I want to see some action. I want to see dollars for programs."
The reactions of people like Ms. Reynoso and Mr. Escobar are crucial to Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox, who came courting the small but fast-growing Mexican community in this industrial, largely Democratic city today. The two men conducted a whirlwind three-hour visit that, despite its brevity, reflected each leader's distinctive reasons to reach out to this important constituency. 
The nation's Hispanic population grew by nearly 60 percent in the last decade, to 35.3 million people, edging out blacks as the country's largest minority, according to the 2000 census. Nearly 21 million of those are people of Mexican origin. 
Mr. Fox has actively engaged Mexicans in the United States, seeking their investment and political backing while offering them his political influence in support of new immigrant protections, legal status for undocumented workers and the right to vote in elections in their homeland. 
Remittances from Mexican immigrants -- $6 billion to $8 billion a year -- rival oil and tourism as Mexico's single largest source of foreign revenue. Indeed, Ms. Reynoso, the tomato packer, said she sent home half her $380 weekly earnings to her grandfather in Mexico. 
For his part, Mr. Bush is actively wooing Hispanic voters in preparing for a re-election campaign in 2004. White House political experts have projected that if Mr. Bush wins the same 35 percent of Hispanic voters in his next election as he did in 2000, he will lose by three million votes. Aides say he must capture 40 percent of Hispanics to have a shot at re-election. 
The new attention being paid to Mexican immigrants represents a sharp departure for both the American and Mexican governments. 
In the past, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the party that governed Mexico for seven decades, often looked down on its fellow countrymen, or paisanos, who left to seek their fortunes in the United States. Mr. Fox whose election ended the rule of the P.R.I, as the party was known, today praised those immigrants for their "courage, determination, perseverance and valor."
Mr. Fox understands that Americans' view of immigrants has long shaped its view of Mexico, and in his frequent trips to the United States he has sought to burnish that image. Helping immigrants become more powerful in the United States, he believes, helps secure Mexico's influence there as well. 
"President Fox has addressed the issues dear to our heart, the legalization of undocumented workers and the rights those workers have," said Baldemar C. Velasquez, president of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee here, which represents 7,000 agricultural workers in Michigan and Ohio.
But Mr. Fox is not the only president who sees himself as a suitor to the Mexican population in the United States. Since entering office, Mr. Bush became the first president to give his weekly radio address in Spanish and the White House recently redesigned its Web site to include a section in Spanish. 
As he tries to shed the Republican Party's anti-immigrant image of the early 1990's, Mr. Bush has found a receptive audience among many Mexican Americans here when he talks about the economy, health care and education in a town where the high-school dropout rate among Latinos exceeds 40 percent.
"I like the $600 tax refund he sent me," said Estela Trinidad, 52, a bakery worker here who said she did not vote for Mr. Bush last year but would reconsider in 2004 because Mr. Bush "is doing a pretty good job so far." 
Holding out hopes of a sweeping immigration deal sent spirits soaring in Mexican communities here and across the country, but Mr. Bush may pay the price if he cannot deliver. "He's in a tough spot with Latinos if he tries to backpedal now," said Maria Blanco, national senior counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a civil rights group. 
In Ohio, Hispanics accounted for just 1 percent of all voters in last year's elections, according to Voter News Service exit polls. But the presidents' visit underscores how a the once-tiny electoral bloc is taking on greater significance in a battleground state. 
In Toledo, 5.5 percent of the city's 313,000 residents, or 17,000 people, identified themselves as Hispanics in the 2000 census, up from 3.9 percent a decade ago. The vast majority claim Mexican roots. 
The Mexican community here dates from the 1930's, when economic pioneers arrived from Mexico and Texas to work the area's tomato farms and lay tracks for the railroad. Mr. Fox's grandfather was reared in Cincinnati, four hours from here. 
Family ties may have played a role in the presidents' trip here today. During the campaign last fall, George P. Bush, the son of Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and his Mexican-born wife, Columba, received a warm welcome at the same boys and girls club that his uncle and Mr. Fox toured today after the rally.
In interviews earlier this week, Mexicans here voiced hope that a strengthened diplomatic relationship might yield some tangible benefits. 
At a vegetable-packing plant outside of town here, Juan Perez clambered down from the cab of the truck to rave about Mr. Fox. Ducking out of the hot afternoon sun, Mr. Perez, one of thousands of undocumented migrants working in northwestern Ohio's cucumber and tomato fields, said he hoped that Mr. Fox and Mr. Bush could strike a deal to let Mexicans like him who work 110-hour weeks, pay taxes and send remittances home to come out of the shadows and earn permanent legal status. 
"Fox is a very humane person, and so is Bush," Mr. Perez, 48, said in an interview in Spanish. "If there was an agreement, we'd no longer have to risk our lives crossing the border."

HEADLINE: Buffalo Gazes Back To a Time When Fortune Shone; 
Much-Maligned City Celebrates The Glory of a Century Ago

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
It is hard for outsiders to imagine that before the steel mills died, the young people fled and the Bills choked, Buffalo was unbowed and proud.
 This, after all, was once the eighth largest city in America and one of its most prosperous, with mansions and parks designed by the best architects in the country. Its geography, on Lake Erie, and its crisscross railroad lines made it a pivotal hub for moving goods from the Midwest to the East. 
 Its political influence was strong enough that two sons went to the White House: Grover Cleveland (1885-89, 1893-97) and Millard Fillmore (1850-53).
Now, in a spate of nostalgia that has become something of a civic obsession, Buffalo is awash in a series of conferences, lectures, books and exhibits, harking back to what has become in civic mythology the moment when Buffalo's long slide began -- the assassination of President William McKinley a century ago at the world's fair that was supposed to immortalize Buffalo's status as one of the nation's great cities. 
On the centennial of the Pan-American Exposition, held from May to November 1901, the city is collectively rummaging through its past, at once recalling its glory, and asking if it could ever come back. And with both a scholarly and a somewhat jocular eye, people here are exploring the legacy of moment when, the myth goes, Buffalo began its slide from the nation's 8th largest city to its 59th and from a boomtown to a symbol of rust belt decay.
"There is a strong nostalgia for the past here, of the heydays of the 20's to 50's when Buffalo was a very wealthy and prosperous city," said Robert B. Skerker, the chairman of the Erie County Cultural Resources Advisory Board who has promoted commemoration of the centennial. "There is a longing to turn the clock back and see what can be learned."
At the heart of the nostalgia is what some call the McKinley Curse, the aftermath of the assassination of President McKinley on Sept. 6, 1901, at the hands of an anarchist, Leon Czolgosz (pronounced CHOAL-gosh), railing against imperialism. Mr. McKinley had come here to visit the exposition, which was showcasing a relatively new technology, the electric light, and promoting America as the leader of the Western Hemisphere.
Of course, the city's prosperity did not immediately come to a halt with the assassination. Its population peaked in 1950 at 580,000, about twice what it is now. But the "Pan Am" or "Pan," as it is commonly known, is something of a fixation here, where nostalgia runs deep and the city's long economic slide is burned into the civic psyche.
So the observances are now being held all around town, including one at the historical society -- housed in the only remaining building from the expo -- that is setting attendance records.
A group in town, the Pan-American Collector's Society, numbering about 70 people, has filled a gallery at the State University at Buffalo with a display of tickets, trinkets, souvenir glassware and other exposition keepsakes passed down from generation to generation, and now actively traded on Internet auction sites. The county bar association plans to re-enact the trial of McKinley's assassin. 
One of the city's ubiquitous abandoned grain elevators, the legacy of its once dominant role in shipping goods from the Midwest, will be illuminated two nights a week through September with images from the expo. There has been a parade and dozens of seminars and readings, using the centennial as a theme for looking back and forward.
Whether because of McKinley or, perhaps more rationally, the late 20th-century collapse of the manufacturing industry that had been the city's backbone, hard luck has come in many forms.
With a 2000 population of 292,648, Buffalo now ranks No. 59 in population, behind places like Mesa City, Ariz., Arlington, Tex., and Fresno, Calif. There were snowstorms, including the infamous 1977 blizzard of 20-foot snowdrifts, that inspired a run of weather jokes by Johnny Carson, and, from 1991 to 1994, the beloved Buffalo Bills lost four straight Super Bowls.
"There are people who seriously believe if McKinley was not shot here, the Bills would have gone on to win four Super Bowls," said William Siener, the executive director of the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society.
Today, sometimes just the name of the city draws a smirk. How it got its name is much disputed, with some historians speculating that buffaloes may indeed have roamed here centuries ago or maybe the name came from a creek whose Indian name, beaver, was mistranslated, or maybe it was in honor of a solitary Indian who lived on that creek.
Whatever the case, Buffalo was not mocked 100 years ago. The exposition's "Spanish renaissance revival" buildings, festooned with 8-watt bulbs in what was then one of the most spectacular displays of decorative light ever seen, were torn down afterward, as planned; the site of the expo, formerly a farm, is now a neighborhood of broad streets and pleasant homes and includes the New York State Building, the only permanent structure and now home for the historical society.
The gun used to assassinate McKinley, during a reception at the Temple of Music that housed one of the largest pipe organs ever built in the United States, is in the exhibit, along with a tongue-in-cheek "What if?" display speculating on "Would Buffalo be a different place today or is the long-term impact of the McKinley assassination overrated?" (One of the possible answers: "The kick is up. IT'S GOOD. The Bills win the 1991 Super Bowl and add two more Super Bowl victories to their record over the next three years.")
There are vintage photographs -- including night pictures with the buildings aglow in sparkling light, courtesy of newly built hydroelectric power plants in nearby Niagara Falls -- architectural models and renderings, posters and paintings.
The city's commemoration has not spared the seamier side of the exposition, and not just the assassination.
In another nearby building, the society has also put on display photos and artifacts from the fair's midway, which, along with "diving elks" and other carnival attractions, included demeaning and stereotypical exhibits of Indians, Asians, Africans and African-Americans.
A "scalp dance" is advertised at the "Indian theater." Visitors could tour a display called the "Old Plantation, or the South befo' de wah!" that stood near the re-creation of an African and Philippine village meant to show off "exotic" locales.
Mr. Siener said the society wrestled with acknowledging the less glorious underside of the exposition but, as an organization devoted to history, it felt compelled to recall the fair, warts and all.
"You are better able to understand the present if you go back and look at some of the threads that brought us here," he said.
The idea of commemorating the centennial also caused some discord.
Plans for government-sponsored, large-scale celebrations fell through after a local exploratory committee charged with organizing it presented the projected cost, $50 million, to be paid by the city, county, state and private businesses. 
But political leaders balked at the price, leaving it up to individuals and organizations, loosely operating under the umbrella of the historical society, to honor the exposition.
The number of monthly visitors to the historical society has tripled over that of previous years and has been the largest ever recorded, Mr. Siener said.
The look-back has caused a mix of emotions, from how great we were to why can't we do it again.
"Buffalo was once the queen city of the Great Lakes," Florence Nicholson, who grew up here but now lives in Virginia, said during a visit to the historical society exhibit. "I tell my friends that and they say, Buffalo? With all that snow? This was a big place once, and you need to remember that."
Will Buffalo ever return to its turn-of-the-century glory? Some believe the centennial commemorations may inspire people to build the city back up. But others are not so sure.
"There is a sort of defeatist attitude here that prevents it from ever becoming a big city," said Suzette Filipski, who attended college here in the 1980's and who toured the exhibit as part of a visit with family. "It's always No. 2. Even though it has so many great attributes on its own it never gets respect.
"Here," she added, motioning to the displays on the exposition, "was when it got respect."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs; 
Reforming Success

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I'm the last person who should be giving President Bush political advice. As his father used to say to Jim Baker, "If you're so smart, why am I president?" But Mr. Bush might want to study the parallels between himself and the former British Conservative Party leader William Hague, who recently lost in a landslide to Tony Blair.
 If politics were math, I would reduce my advice to this equation: George W. Bush won the presidency because he persuaded enough swing voters that he would rule as "Clinton-minus." He would give them Clinton-like policies on key issues, which a majority of Americans favored, without Clinton the man. That was what "compassionate conservative" was supposed to signal. But once in power, Mr. Bush has ruled not as "Clinton-minus" but as "Reagan-squared," not as a compassionate conservative but as a radical conservative. 
 Mr. Hague lost to Mr. Blair because what the British public wanted was "Thatcherism-plus." That is, while the British public had come to enjoy the benefits of the more market-oriented, American-like, lower-tax economy that Mrs. Thatcher engineered, they now wanted more of the public services and welfare benefits that the French and Germans had. Mr. Hague ignored all these signals. Instead of offering "Thatcherism-plus," he campaigned on a platform of "Thatcherism-squared" -- even smaller government, fewer services, and more free-market alternatives. He got crushed.
What the Bush and the Hague folks have in common is that they both misread the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. They both acted as though what accounted for Mr. Reagan's and Mrs. Thatcher's successes was their strict allegiance to conservative ideology. Wrong. What made Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan popular was that they were each reforming failure -- they were each reforming the least popular and least successful aspects of the welfare state, while leaving intact the most popular.
So Mrs. Thatcher broke the power of the labor unions and privatized some industries, but under her rule the British government grew, and she left the biggest government agencies, like the National Health Service and railroads, unprivatized. Mr. Reagan also took on the unions and cut taxes, and reversed the image of America-the-weak. But he never shrank the size of the federal government, he produced record deficits, and he engaged in sweeping arms control with the Russian Evil Empire. 
"The people who came after Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher suffer from the delusion that the key to their success was their loyalty to right-wing doctrines," noted a European diplomat. "Actually, the key to their success was that they were great politicians who were reforming failing systems, and compromised all over the place."
Mr. Hague thought Brits wanted more Thatcherism, when they wanted to go beyond Thatcherism. A majority of Americans voted for Clintonism minus Clinton, but Mr. Bush is giving them radical conservative policies on taxes and missile defense. Was the U.S. economy so bad these past eight years that we needed a deep tax cut that has now put the whole budget out of whack? Is America really threatened by rogue missiles so much that we need to immediately unravel every arms control treaty for an untested missile defense scheme? 
It seems that American conservatives have never gotten over the end of the cold war and our victory over Communism. They need a mission, which is admirable. Mr. Reagan had that missionary zeal, he had the conservative reform ideology to go with it and he had the context of failure at home and an Evil Empire abroad to justify and energize his mission.
The Bush people have all the missionary zeal of the Reaganites, but the context is completely different. For the country, context is everything. But for the Bushies, context is nothing. Their theological beliefs are everything, and what they believe must be good everywhere all the time. So they are giving us a great experiment in the radical reform of success -- a radical tax cut at a time when the U.S. economy was basically sound and the national debt on track to be eliminated, and a radical missile defense scheme to replace the deterrence doctrine that has maintained nuclear stability for 50 years.
I sure hope they know what they're doing.

HEADLINE: World Bank Presses Inquiry On Economist Who Dissents 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
The World Bank is conducting a disciplinary investigation of one of its most senior economists, who sharply criticized the bank's record on fighting poverty in a recent book and newspaper opinion article.
 The economist, William Easterly, came under investigation by the bank's office of business ethics and integrity after he wrote an article in The Financial Times that summarized views expressed in his book, several bank officials said. They said the inquiry, which has not yet concluded, was started because Mr. Easterly did not receive the required permission to write an article in a general-interest publication. 
 In the article and the book, Mr. Easterly harshly assessed the bank's half-century history of fighting poverty, arguing that it has pursued a long list of failed elixirs and systematically ignored the poor results of its programs.
He said the bank should encourage countries to adopt traditional free-market policies and stop lending to corrupt and incompetent governments.
The investigation of Mr. Easterly, which a bank spokeswoman described as a routine enforcement of the World Bank's media and communications policies, is being conducted at a time when its president, James D. Wolfensohn, has come under attack from numerous critics.
Right-wing economists say he has led the bank far astray of its traditional mission to enhance economic growth around the world, while those on the left say the bank under his leadership remains a top-down institution that does too little to respond to the needs of the poor. Critics have also put pressure on Mr. Wolfensohn to forgive more third world debt.
Several bank officials said that Mr. Easterly's case is one of several recent examples of how Mr. Wolfensohn has sought to assert more control over a raging debate within the bank as he battles outside critics. 
The timing of the dispute is particularly sensitive because thousands of protesters are expected to gather in Washington later this month at the annual meetings of the bank and the International Monetary Fund to oppose the way the lending institutions do business.
Some protesters argue that the bank and the I.M.F. have failed to alleviate -- and may have worsened -- poverty in developing countries. Environmental, human rights and social activist groups have also sought to force the bank, which is controlled by member governments, to disclose more documents and allow the public to express views about policies before they become final.
Separately, President Bush and his top advisers have pressed the bank to rethink its antipoverty strategy. Mr. Bush proposed replacing as much as half of the bank's loans to developing countries with outright grants, a change that the World Bank leadership has resisted.
Two influential opinion journals, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy, have lengthy articles in their most recent issues that question the direction Mr. Wolfensohn has taken the bank. 
Although many of its critics have conflicting views about what is wrong with the bank and what should be done to fix it, the flurry of internal dissent and outside attacks have sapped morale and created a sense of crisis, several people who work there say. 
One close supporter of Mr. Wolfensohn said the bank was "under attack by the forces of reaction," who are trying to undo the changes Mr. Wolfensohn has brought since he took office six years ago.
Mr. Easterly's views are among the most pointed. As a senior adviser in the bank's research group, he has helped shape antipoverty strategy for 16 years.
In his recent book, entitled "The Elusive Quest for Growth," Mr. Easterly argues that the World Bank has systematically failed to raise growth rates in the countries it seeks to help. He wrote that two generations of bank leaders have been deluded by supposed panaceas for growth, like increasing business investment, improving education, limiting population growth, changing government policies and forgiving past loans, all of which ultimately failed to raise growth rates.
The developing world, including Africa, Latin America, South Asia, East Asia outside Japan and former Communist nations in Europe, grew at a average rate per capita of 0.1 percent from 1980 to 2000, according to the bank's statistics. East Asian nations grew relatively quickly, but in the other regions, living standards declined.
"Consider the facts and it soon becomes evident," Mr. Easterly wrote in the op-ed page article, "that the $1 trillion spent on aid since the 1960's, with the efforts of advisers, and foreign aid givers, have failed to attain the desired results."
He proposed that the bank instead focus on creating incentives for poor countries to adopt free-market policies, largely by halting loans to nations that do not manage their economies effectively and increasing loans to those that do.
Mr. Easterly declined to comment on his views or the bank's investigation.
The agency's chief spokeswoman, Caroline Anstey, said it supports Mr. Easterly's right to publish his book. She said the inquiry into his newspaper article followed standard practice, and was not intended to suppress dissent.
"This isn't about academic freedom," Ms. Anstey said. "Our guidelines state simply that staff need to inform their managers of contacts with the press, preferably before an interview, but if not, afterward."
She said the inquiry involving Mr. Easterly had not concluded, so it was unclear if he would be disciplined.
Several other people who work at the bank say its top officials have taken a harder line on employees who violate guidelines for communicating with the press.
In one recent case, Robert Wade, a professor at the London School of Economics who has served as a paid consultant to the bank, was cited for violating disclosure policies when he wrote an opinion piece supportive of a bank lending program in China that was canceled under pressure from outside critics.
"They are going to be tough on anyone who says anything that has not already been vetted," Mr. Wade said.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Pendulum Swings to Microsoft, But the Degree Remains Unclear

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, by adopting a measured, conservative approach in the Microsoft antitrust case, clearly increased the chances that the two sides would reach a settlement.
 The Justice Department yesterday made a crucial concession in dropping the charge that it has been illegal for Microsoft to pursue its longstanding practice of bundling, or tying, new software to its monopoly product -- the industry-standard Windows operating system. William H. Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chairman, and his top lieutenants regarded the company's bitter fight against the federal government and the states suing it mainly as an uncompromising defense of Microsoft's unfettered freedom to add whatever it wants to Windows, the corporate crown jewel. 
 "This was fundamentally a tying case," said Richard Schmalensee, the dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an economist who testified as an expert witness on Microsoft's behalf in the antitrust trial.
Yet if the pendulum has swung in Microsoft's direction under the Bush administration, it is by no means clear how much. 
The steps announced yesterday are partly tactical compromises. Splitting Microsoft in two was the option championed by the Clinton administration, some industry groups and some economists. Many argued that such a remedy would actually be less intrusive than a solution relying on regulatory oversight. But a federal appeals court ruling in June, which upheld most of a lower court's findings against Microsoft, strongly suggested that a breakup remedy was not appropriate in the Microsoft case. Typically, the courts have imposed breakup orders in antitrust cases involving government-sanctioned monopolies, like AT&T, or when the monopoly was assembled in a series of mergers. Neither condition applies to Microsoft.
"The tea leaves were pretty clear on the breakup issue in the appeals court decision," said A. Douglas Melamed, a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, who was a senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Microsoft trial.
So the Justice Department will rely instead on court-ordered sanctions on Microsoft's corporate behavior to increase competition in the software business. In the trial, the government and states showed that Microsoft used its market muscle to essentially bully and bribe personal computer makers to favor its software over that of rivals, like Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems, whose Internet software posed a threat to Microsoft's dominance of the industry.
Microsoft's restrictive contracts with personal computer makers were the key tool in its campaign to illegally defend its monopoly, the appeals court ruled. And freeing PC makers to choose and promote competing software and services, for everything from playing music delivered over the Internet to electronic commerce, will be a big part of any package of "conduct" remedies in the Microsoft case.
But the trouble with conduct remedies is that they require constant oversight and monitoring to be effective, and a clever company can often find ways to sidestep them. In 1994, after four years of government scrutiny, Microsoft signed a consent decree with the Justice Department and Europe's antitrust authorities, agreeing to modify its licensing contracts with PC makers. But that remedy was widely seen as little more than a slap on the wrist that did nothing to foster competition in the software industry.
This time, the issue for the government, according to industry analysts, is whether the Bush administration, having decided against restructuring the software industry by breaking up Microsoft, will have the determination to aggressively police Microsoft's behavior.
"The relationship between the PC makers and Microsoft has to be fixed, and that means regulating that relationship," said Stewart Alsop, a general partner of New Enterprise Associates, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. "My concern is that the government won't pursue that hard enough."
Loosening Microsoft's grip on PC makers is also seen as essential to increasing choice for consumers. If the PC makers have greater freedom to add rivals' software and remove some features that Microsoft bundles with Windows, the theory goes, consumers should benefit from a greater diversity of offerings.
"A structural remedy was our first choice because it is a cleaner, less regulatory solution," said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group that supported a breakup of Microsoft. "But we will consider the case a success if Dell, Compaq, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and the other PC manufacturers feel they can put software on their machines that competes with Microsoft's products without fear of retribution."
Microsoft flexed its muscle recently after it declared in the wake of the appeals court ruling in June that it would permit PC makers greater freedom in adding icons to rivals' software on the desktop screen for its next-generation operating system, Windows XP.
But as soon as Compaq announced that it had reached a deal to make America Online its featured online service, Microsoft announced that if PC makers chose to place any competing software or services on the desktop screen, they had to put three Microsoft icons on as well -- one for the Internet Explorer browser, one for Microsoft Media Player, and one for its MSN Internet service. Microsoft described its move as pro-competitive since AOL's software includes a browser, a media player and it is an online service.
Limiting such conditions from Microsoft, industry analysts say, are the kind of actions that the government should pursue to insure that the company cannot impose its will so easily in the future.
"Strong conduct remedies could make it difficult for Microsoft to be as aggressive as it has been in the past," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
The Justice Department said it would use as its starting point the temporary package of conduct remedies in the final judgment of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who was removed from the case by the appeals court for his negative comments about Microsoft to reporters. Beyond prohibiting Microsoft from negotiating restrictive contracts with PC makers and others, the package called for Microsoft to more openly share technical information with rival software companies whose products must run smoothly on the Windows operating system.
Other sanctions, industry analysts say, could well include more open -- even published -- price lists for Windows' licenses, so that Microsoft could not rely on hidden discounts to encourage PC makers to use other Microsoft software products. Another proposal during earlier rounds of settlement talks was requiring the Microsoft board to create an independent oversight board that would report to the Justice Department.
In dropping the tying claim, the Justice Department explained that it was seeking to "streamline the case with the goal of securing an effective remedy as quickly as possible." Indeed, the appeals court vacated Judge Jackson's finding that Microsoft had illegally tied its browser to Windows, and sent it back to a new judge for reconsideration.
Retrying the tying issue could have taken months. And the government has a powerful finding against Microsoft without it, because the company was found to have illegally defended its monopoly with its restrictive contracts with PC makers.
But bundling new products into Windows -- or "integrating" new features, as Microsoft terms it -- is central to Microsoft's corporate strategy for expanding its reach in the industry. Microsoft and its supporters argue that the company's integration strategy is a consumer benefit, yet it also serves to give Microsoft an enormous advantage against any competitor who happens to be in its path.
Windows XP, Microsoft's new operating system, tightly integrates music playing, Internet shopping and digital photography software, among other features.
Perhaps by giving PC manufacturers wide-ranging freedoms to pick and choose from Microsoft's bundled offers, the Justice Department could do something to shield competition in new markets, analysts said. But it is not clear that it will, and walking away from the tying claim makes that less likely.
"That's a loss," said Mr. Alsop, the venture capitalist. "The most common question for potential investors is: 'What about Windows XP?' You can still compete, but if Microsoft bundles it in Windows it makes it much more difficult for any kind of innovation that is in Microsoft's path."

HEADLINE: Torture Charge Pits Professor Vs. Professor 

BYLINE:  By CECILIA VALDES 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Felipe Aguero says the nightmarish evening in late September 1973 is forever fixed in his mind. Then 21 and a student at Catholic University, Mr. Aguero had been arrested for having leftist pamphlets in his car five days after the military coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet. At the National Stadium in Santiago, a hood was put over his head, and he was stripped, burned and beaten, he said. When his captors allowed him to dress, the hood came loose for a moment, and he caught a glimpse of one of his torturers.
 Fifteen years later, Mr. Aguero, by then a professor, was at an academic conference in Santiago. Among the 15 or so professors at the table, Mr. Aguero said, was the face he saw that night. "I never forgot that face," Mr. Aguero said in a telephone interview from Miami, where he now lives. 
 The face that Mr. Aguero said he remembered belongs to Emilio Meneses, a prominent and popular professor of military studies at the Institute of Political Science at Catholic University in Santiago. Mr. Aguero, who teaches at the School of International Studies at the University of Miami, said he was too shaken to confront Mr. Meneses at the 1988 conference and didn't make any accusation until February this year, prompted by a more open atmosphere in Chile. 
Mr. Meneses said he was shocked by the charges. He denies torturing Mr. Aguero or anyone else. "I had no relation of any kind with Professor Aguero's interrogation or stay in the stadium," Mr. Meneses said in a written response to questions from The New York Times. "I did not know him then, nor did I see him." Mr. Meneses said he did spend about three weeks as a naval reservist at the stadium at the time, but his job was to process arriving prisoners and he was too far away to hear or see any abuse. Only weeks after he left the stadium did he hear word of the torture and murder, he said. In May, Mr. Meneses filed suit in Chile, accusing Mr. Aguero of libel, a crime punishable there by three years in prison.
"What is really at stake is the right of any person to be considered innocent unless demonstrated otherwise in court," Mr. Meneses wrote in his response. "Nobody is above this essential principle no matter how much he or she may have suffered or endured."
The case, which was first reported in the United States by the Chronicle of Higher Education, has shaken the academic world here and abroad. In April more than 200 scholars in the United States from schools like Harvard, Georgetown, Duke and Notre Dame and in Japan, Latin America and Europe signed a letter supporting Mr. Aguero. They promised to boycott academic conferences attended by Mr. Meneses.
In Chile, scholars say the academic world has made little public reckoning for the cooperation some members gave to the military regime. After taking power, General Pinochet put military officers in charge of the universities, and they fired professors with dissident political beliefs. Many students and professors were killed, jailed or sent into exile. Catholic University in particular became the president's brain pool, churning out experts who helped the military create a free-market economy, hobble unions, rewrite the constitution and overhaul the education and health systems.
After General Pinochet stepped down as president in 1990, a human rights commission documented 3,197 cases of people who were killed or disappeared at the hands of security forces.
But Chileans have begun publicly confronting the country's history of torture only in the last couple of years, after General Pinochet, who remained head of the army until 1998, was first arrested on human rights charges in London. Dozens of cases against other former military officers are working their way through Chilean courts, although this summer one of the courts declared General Pinochet mentally incompetent to defend himself. And last year, as a result of a national commission that included the armed forces, human rights organizations and the Roman Catholic Church, the military admitted human rights abuses and turned over information about the whereabouts of some victims' bodies.
Now, scholars say, it's academia's turn. "Catholic University needs to do a serious and responsible internal debate," said Carlos Huneeus, a professor at the institute who is also an expert on General Pinochet's 17-year rule. "It needs to take a look at its history, admit the mistakes and take responsibility for collaborating with the military regime."
At Catholic University, the divisions are reflected in an open letter to academics from the political science department's student council. Some students feel Mr. Meneses should be fired and others think he should stay until proved guilty, while a third group says he should be judged only on his academic record, which is not in question.
As for the professors, some have sided with Mr. Aguero, while others, including Mr. Huneeus, insist that Mr. Meneses should not be condemned unless the allegations are proved. Manfred Wilhelmy, a professor at the institute, said: "Meneses should be given the benefit of the doubt. I don't think Catholic University should respond to isolated accusations or try to be a substitute for the courts."
In April, Mr. Meneses was given four months of paid leave to give him time to clear his name, according to a letter the university sent him. The leave was extended indefinitely last month as a result of an unrelated case. This year the former military attache at the American embassy in Chile, Col. Mark Mayer of the Air Force, sent a letter to the commander in chief of the Chilean Air Force accusing Mr. Meneses of soliciting two American military contractors for payments to lobby for them. They were what was then the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, and they were competing for a contract to sell fighter jets to the Chilean Air Force. Mr. Meneses, whose university chair is paid for by the defense ministry, has denied the allegation.
The university's Secretariat General is investigating the lobbying charge. The university rector, Pedro Pablo Rosso, who will finally decide what happens to Mr. Meneses, declined to comment.
Mr. Aguero, who left Chile in 1982 and earned a doctorate in political science from Duke University, said he debated for years about what to do. He ran into Mr. Meneses frequently at academic conferences after the meeting 13 years ago, but he avoided contact, overcome with shame and fear.
"It was ridiculous," he said. "I was embarrassed about seeing him, when it was he who should have been ashamed about himself."
Mr. Aguero said he had finally found the resolve to confront Mr. Meneses this year after details about the torture of a family friend who later died, Eugenio Ruiz Tagle, came to light.
Three former prisoners accused the second in command of the Chilean Air Force, Gen. Hernan Gabrielli, of torturing Mr. Tagle and others. This was the first time someone so high in the military and on active duty had been charged with human rights violations. (General Gabrielli brought a libel suit against the prisoners, but it was dismissed; five cases brought by other former prisoners or their families are still pending. Under Chilean law, the statute of limitations on the crime of torture is five years, which has long passed.)
Mr. Aguero said that when he learned about Mr. Tagle's suffering -- his nose was smashed, his ears were sliced off and his back was broken in several places -- he decided that he shared responsibility for those torturers who had escaped punishment. "I am a silent accomplice," he said.
In February he sent a confidential letter to the director of Mr. Meneses' department, Alfredo Rehren, and it soon found its way into the Chilean press.
Mr. Aguero said there was other evidence that Mr. Meneses did more than just process prisoners at the stadium's entrance. Francisco Justiniano, who is a lawyer in Santiago and was a prisoner at the stadium around the time that Mr. Aguero was there, said he saw Mr. Meneses, whom he knew as a fellow student at Catholic University, inside the stadium, waving a gun and barking orders at prisoners. "He identified me, called my name and made me stand in front of the prisoners," Mr. Justiniano said, although he added that he did not see Mr. Meneses abuse anyone.
Mr. Meneses denied Mr. Justiniano's account, and he insisted that Mr. Aguero was mistaken. Indeed, witnesses' testimony is notoriously unreliable only hours after an event, let alone years later. Mr. Meneses says he was at the stadium as part of a navy team that questioned arriving prisoners about their identity and when and where they were arrested. After being called to service during the state of emergency, Mr. Meneses wrote, "I was liable to be court-martialed if I refused my assignment." He said his team couldn't see into the stadium bowl where those arrested were kept or into the rooms above the stadium where they were tortured.
"It was impossible to hear the loudspeakers, screams or any other indication of torture of prisoners assigned to me," Mr. Meneses said in his written response. He said he didn't hear about the abuses until several weeks after leaving the stadium and didn't believe them at first. "Full realization of what happened came only several years later," he said.
Jose Zalaquett, a Chilean human rights lawyer, said in an interview: "Meneses's explanations about the stadium are absurd and ridiculous. He was in the critical place at the critical time yet he saw nothing."
The statement that he had no knowledge of any torture is also what prompted many professors abroad to sign the letter supporting Mr. Aguero.
"I felt Meneses' account about the stadium, describing it like a resort where he never saw any human rights violation, needed at least a moral sanction," Patricio Navia, a professor at New York University, said in an interview. He wrote the letter and sent it to his friends, and soon it was broadly circulating in academic circles.
The letter says at one point: "We reject the complacent and self-congratulatory mode in which Meneses has referred to his participation as 'interrogator' of detainees in the National Stadium. We are deeply disturbed that a person who acknowledges having participated in interrogations in the National Stadium is today teaching young university students."
But Mr. Meneses said he was being convicted without a fair hearing: "Those academics have every right to support Aguero's sorry experience, but they are absolutely wrong in condemning another person without a trial in a proper court."
Tens of thousands are estimated to have been tortured during General Pinochet's reign. An estimated 12,000 people were detained at the National Stadium, most enduring some form of torture, until the center was shut in November 1973 in preparation for a qualifying match for the World Cup soccer championship, said Carmen Luz Parot, who is filming a documentary about the stadium. Dozens of prisoners were executed, including the American journalist Charles Hormann, a case that inspired the movie "Missing."
Mr. Aguero said he had ended up there after being detained with a fellow Catholic University student, Fernando Villagran. The two men were first taken to an air force base and beaten during interrogation, he said. A sympathetic air force captain, Jorge Silva, learned they were to be shot and took them to the stadium to spare them from death, he said in a television interview.
Mr. Aguero said he had entered a terror-filled world, with prisoners crowded into the bleachers by day. Rooms above the stadium were converted into torture chambers and holding cells. The place reeked of decaying corpses, he said, and there was frequent machine-gun fire.
Mr. Aguero is fighting the libel suit by seeking to prove that his charges against Mr. Meneses are true, said Ciro Colombara, one of Mr. Aguero's lawyers.
"If the army, the Catholic Church, the medical community have acknowledged their role in human rights violations, the university should do the same," Mr. Aguero said. "Its role is to pursue the truth. I do not feel the higher authorities at Catholic University are up to the moral standard to face this responsibility."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 13, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on Saturday about Emilio Meneses, a Chilean professor who was recently accused of torture during the military coup in Chile in 1973, misstated the New York University affiliation of Patricio Navia, who wrote a letter denouncing Mr. Meneses.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad; 
A Civilized Society

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: CIVITELLA, Italy 

 BODY:
The forces of the market have conquered the political world. East and west, most societies have come to believe that competition will produce more prosperity for more people than a planned economy. I share that belief.
 But Italy is evidence that there is more to life -- a civilized life -- than the unregulated competition of the market. There are values of humanity, culture, beauty, community that may require deviations from the cold logic of market theory. So I am convinced after spending some weeks in Italy this summer. 
 Consider health care. A friend in Italy suffers from multiple sclerosis. She is severely handicapped, and she now requires an expensive motorized wheelchair. The Italian national health service sent an agent to her home to look at her situation and will apparently pay much of the cost.
She lives in a remote cottage in rough country. Traveling to a city for medical checkups is difficult, so the health service regularly sends a nurse to visit her.
Are those wasteful deviations from the logic of the market? Or is a society more civilized for everyone if it provides necessary medical help for all who need it?
Americans who visit Tuscany or Umbria love the landscape: the silvery olive groves, the fields of sunflowers, the vineyards, the stone houses and barns. The farms are mostly modest in size.
Those farms are to a large degree uneconomic. They continue to exist because the European Union subsidizes them through its Common Agricultural Policy. It also gives crucial grants to restore beautiful villages.
The Common Agricultural Policy has been denounced for years by true believers in pure market principles such as The Economist. The policy is undoubtedly costly to taxpayers, and to consumers in higher food prices. But would the life of Italy -- and France and Germany -- be improved if that money were saved and corporate agriculture took over? If the landscape were transformed by single crops over vast acreage? 
The look of the Italian countryside is also protected by tight legal controls over development. Getting permission to build, or even to move a road a few yards, is a struggle. The gross national product might be raised a notch if those controls were eased. But would Italians prefer their country that way?
Italy is an easy target for political ridicule. Its bureaucracy is notoriously obscurantist. It has had 59 different governments since World War II.
Reform is necessary. But the fact is that the society functions extremely well despite those problems. In between the beautiful vistas Italy has dynamic industry. Northern Italy is one of the most prosperous regions of Europe. And there is a sense of joy in life. That, not the beauty alone, appeals to visiting Americans. 
A number of Italian towns are called Civitella. I stayed in Civitella in Val di Chiana, near Arezzo in Tuscany. It is a tiny walled town on top of a high hill, population about 250. At one end are the remains of a 13th-century castle, which was bombed by the Allies as the Germans retreated north through Italy in 1944.
Economic subsidy of one kind or another has helped hundreds of such small towns to survive. But there is another factor: community, fortified by history.
There is a tangible sense of community here, as in other small towns and urban neighborhoods in Italy. Families sit in their open doorways in the evening, or in the narrow streets, and say "Buona sera" to people walking by. A small cafe sets tables in the town square for dinner. Small children run around, utterly secure, until 10 or 11 o'clock in the summer nights.
The owner of one house was 3 years old in 1944. On June 29 of that year there was a knock at the door of the house. When his father opened it, a German soldier shot him dead. The Germans gathered all the men of Civitella, including the priest, and killed them: 119 men. The town was not a center of partisan activity against the Nazis; the massacre seems to have been a random response to defeat and retreat.
An event like that marks the historical memory of a people. Plaques honor the martyrs and hail the British Eighth Army, which liberated the town soon after. Few Americans have such a sense of place. We are immigrants and wanderers, rightly glorying in our diversity. But we respond to the power of community when we see it.

HEADLINE: The Vanishing Surplus, Barely Noticed 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Kohut; Andrew Kohut is the director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Judging from recent political discourse, "Who lost the budget surplus?" threatens to become the "Who lost China?" question of our times -- the focus of finger-pointing for years to come. But there is a problem with that parallel: The American public knew about the loss of China -- not so with the surplus. 
 As recently as June, a 46 percent plurality in a survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press thought the federal government was spending more than it took in this year. Only 19 percent knew it was spending less. The debate over the budget surplus is one of those Washington conversations that goes right by the public, in part because of its complexity, but in larger part because of people's cynicism. 
 It's very hard for people who were lectured and admonished for years about a federal deficit -- and told it would rob their children of their future -- to shift gears so quickly and worry about the surplus. The budget deficit slipped away in the night during Bill Clinton's presidency, with little fanfare and little explanation short of each party trying to take credit for it. No political leader stood up to say, "We were not expecting this either, and it's happened mostly because the economy zoomed ahead, also unexpectedly."
As a consequence, despite all the talk in the past couple of years about what to do with the surplus, nationwide surveys have shown only limited increases in awareness of the reality of the surplus. And not surprisingly, when poll takers inform respondents that the surplus does exist, Americans are quick to discount reliance on it. Two in three respondents in nationwide surveys this past spring by Newsweek, ABC and The Washington Post said the projected "$6 trillion surplus" would prove to be lower than expected. Similarly, a Pew survey to be released next week finds a plurality of the public expecting a smaller rather than larger surplus.
While the reality of the surplus never fully sank in, and people have been quick to minimize it when told that it existed, the conversation about it has mattered to ordinary Americans. The projections of surplus opened up a discussion of new government spending, and that is where the ears have perked up. Americans tell poll takers about a long wish list for new spending, with education and prescription drug benefits through Medicare at the top -- but nothing is more important to Americans than protecting Social Security and not using its revenues to pay for other things. Yet three in four Americans think that the government has spent the Social Security reserves on other programs and that this is the main reason that the system is in financial trouble.
Sparring between the White House and the Democrats over whether the tax cut endangers needed spending or threatens the inviolability of Social Security funds will certainly go on despite the fact that the tax cut passed because it had support from some Democrats. Blaming the other party when no one is really in a position to be absolved of blame can only add to public cynicism and doubts about the debate in Washington. An August Gallup survey that pretested the blame game found the president was held most responsible for the shrinking of the surplus, but most respondents also assumed that the Democrats in Congress bore some responsibility.
The direction of the economy is about the only thing likely to clear the air on this argument for ordinary Americans. Fully 80 percent in a new Pew survey say keeping the economy strong is the most important thing the president and Congress can do. If the tax cut comes to be viewed as the stimulus that revived the economy or, at minimum, put a Band-Aid on it, the president will prevail. If, on the other hand, the economy continues to decline and the wish list gets trashed, the president's signature tax cut program will be seen to have led the country astray. In the end, "who lost the surplus" is the wrong rhetoric. The public wants to know what will fix the economy.

Oops! BankWill Write Off $1.75 Billion

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
How did National Australia Bank, the country's largest bank, bungle its foray into the American mortgage market so badly that it had to write off $1.75 billion this week?
 The blunders involved several fundamental mistakes at the company's HomeSide Lending unit, based in Jacksonville, Fla., including, most embarrassingly, a simple but devastating computer error that went unnoticed for two years. 
 HomeSide is the sixth-largest home-loan servicing company in the United States, with two million loans on its books.
When National Australia bought HomeSide in 1998 for about $1.2 billion, executives praised the unit's proprietary processing and servicing systems and said they planned to use them throughout the bank's global network. 
Now, those systems have helped cause severe financial heartache: last week, consultants discovered that HomeSide had been feeding the wrong interest rates into a critical valuation model since 1999.
The write-down resulting from this and other mistakes was the second recent piece of bad news. In July, National Australia said that the mortgage company had not protected itself adequately against the flurry of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.
Those cuts indirectly affected long-term rates, making home-loan refinancings more attractive and potentially reducing the stream of income that servicing companies earn from existing mortgages. The company's miscalculations prompted a $288 million after-tax write-down.
Analysts and investors say National Australia got in over its head in a market it did not fully understand. But some of the losses at HomeSide, which the bank now wants to sell, stemmed from errors that tighter controls or oversight might have caught.
Consider the interest rate mix-up. Two years ago, HomeSide introduced a computer model to forecast the fees it would receive from servicing loans. The model was linked to a second model, from which it drew vital information. Either a gross or a net interest rate can be plugged into such systems, as long as one or the other is used consistently. But at HomeSide, one of the two linked models used the gross rate while the other used the net, said National Australia's chief financial officer, Richard McKinnon, resulting in wildly inflated fee expectations.
That flaw, which cost the company $400 million, was not spotted until last week, during a review by consultants from Cohane Rafferty Securities, who were called in to sort out HomeSide's problems after the $288 million write-down in July, the bank said.
But that was not the most expensive mistake National Australia announced on Monday. The bank said that some other assumptions built into the models failed to anticipate the "continued unprecedented uncertainty and turbulence" in the market for servicing mortgages, resulting in a revision of the model and a $760 million charge. On top of all that, the bank said it would write off $590 million in good will as it prepares to sell HomeSide -- perhaps, analysts said, for no more than the unit's book value of about $1.14 billion.
Monday's announcements put the total damage sustained by National Australia in the HomeSide fiasco at more than $2 billion, equivalent to more than half the parent company's annual earnings. The write-offs are "extremely concerning," and "a reflection of inadequate internal risk-management controls," said John Murray, a money manager with Perennial Value Management, which has a substantial holding of National Australia stock.
HomeSide's missteps have stunned investors and analysts and have complicated the parent company's expansion plans.
Frank Cicutto, the chief executive of National Australia, which is based in Melbourne, called the losses "a disaster" as well as a "strategic disappointment."
On Tuesday, the bank announced the resignations of three top HomeSide executives: Hugh Harris, the chief executive; Kevin Race, the chief operating officer; and Blake Wilson, the chief financial officer. The unit's chairman, Joseph Whiteside, has taken on the role of chief executive, and the bank announced today that a little-known executive, Gary W. Fiedler, had been recruited to replace Mr. Race.
The review into what happened, and how, is still going on, and the bank cannot be sure that there are no more ugly surprises in the offing. "There have to be lessons and accountability from this," Mr. Cicutto said today. 
Neither the board nor many outside analysts and investors seemed to be calling for Mr. Cicutto to resign or be dismissed over the affair, in part because he was not running the bank when it bought HomeSide. But analysts like Brian Johnson at J. P. Morgan suggested that some heads at the parent company should roll.
"They didn't understand what they bought," Mr. Johnson said, citing the big differences in accounting rules and competitive climate between the American and Australian markets.
The rest of National Australia's businesses are performing well, and the bank has an ample cushion of capital to absorb the HomeSide losses. It recently sold its only other significant American unit, the Michigan National Corporation, to ABN Amro for $2.75 billion, for a net gain of $1.1 billion after taxes.
The bank also has units in New Zealand, Britain and several Asian nations. Mr. Cicutto said the bank's ambition to expand further in Britain was "still an open issue." He would not discuss whether the size of the HomeSide losses would delay those plans, but he acknowledged that there would be less money on hand for acquisitions or stock buybacks, a common step by large Australian banks.
The write-downs have caused ratings agencies to issue rebukes. Standard & Poor's said National Australia's "reputation as Asia-Pacific's highest-rated bank and as a strong manager of banking and related risks has been sullied." Moody's Investors Service downgraded the bank's outlook to "stable" from "positive."
Investors remain somewhat wary of "some more nasties popping out," as Mr. Murray of Perennial Value Management put it. "The good news," he said, "is they have now signaled that they are getting out" of the United States market.
It might take some time, however, for the bank's stock price to recover from its 13 percent slide on Monday, when the latest write-downs were announced. The shares are up only 1.4 percent since then, closing today at 29.30 Australian dollars ($15.23).

HEADLINE: A Buyer's Market for Work 

 BODY:
Just a year ago, America's labor market was the envy of the world. The unemployment rate was hovering at 30-year lows of about 4 percent -- lower than Japan's rate and half Europe's. Companies were so desperate for new hires that they abandoned dress codes, encouraged telecommuting and invited pets into the workplace. Now the tight labor market is loosening up, with painful side effects for workers and the economy. 
 Yesterday's monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics told the sad story. The steady climb in hourly and weekly earnings that characterized the last few years appears to have crested. Half a million more people were out on the street seeking jobs in August than in July. The unemployment rate jumped last month from 4.5 percent to 4.9 percent, its highest level in four years. 
 Unemployment had grown by a similar amount in the first half of the year, as slews of dot-com start-ups morphed into not-com wind-downs. In contrast, last month's sudden uptick came from widespread job losses across almost all manufacturing industries. Retail food and beverage establishments, where wages are lowest, also lost tens of thousands of jobs. In the past two months, the least-educated workers have been hit hardest. That said, this downturn has been more egalitarian than most. White-collar unemployment has grown from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, the highest since the economy's hiccup in 1995. During the recessions of the 60's, 70's and 80's, it barely moved.
Mounting layoffs are also bad news for Washington. The Bush administration had predicted a jobless rate of 4.8 percent for the fourth quarter. That figure now looks less likely than ever. The underestimate of unemployment implies an overestimate of growth, since the president's mid-session budget review used a simple formula to relate the two. Less growth will mean lower tax revenues, and even more budgetary pressures.
A separate worrying aspect of the bureau's report did not make the headlines. More than 600,000 people have left the labor force altogether -- neither working nor looking for a job -- since January. That has not happened over a similar period since 1953.
Back then, exceptionally low unemployment had loaded a heavy burden of business inventories onto the economy. America had produced far more than it could consume. In July of that year, a recession began. The legions who left the labor force by choice, without applying for jobless benefits, were followed by a larger wave of the unwillingly unemployed. The unemployment rate shot from 2.6 percent to 5.9 percent in 10 months.
The foundations of today's economy -- productivity growth, legal protections and the financial system -- are slightly stronger than those of a half-century ago, so the nation may yet be able to avoid a full-blown recession. For the moment, though, the unemployed and employed alike are still feeling the pinch. Companies are putting strict caps on hiring and expenses. Imaginative perks, flex-time schedules, even management bonuses are drifting away. And say goodbye to casual Fridays every day of the week -- suits are coming back.

HEADLINE: Japan's Figures Officially Show A Contraction 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Japan, the world's second-largest economy, is falling into another recession. Statistics released today by the government showed that output of goods and services in the second quarter contracted at a 3.2 percent annual rate.
 Faced with so unequivocally downbeat a report, government ministers abandoned diplomacy and spoke bluntly. Takeo Hiranuma, the economy, trade and industry minister, told reporters: "The economy's footing has become very weak. Whether the economy will even attain zero growth this fiscal year is doubtful." 
 A small upward revision in figures for the first quarter, from a slight contraction to slight growth in gross domestic product, means that conditions in Japan do not yet meet the usual technical definition of a recession, two successive quarters of shrinking economic activity. 
But Japan's economy is clearly in "a severe condition," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said today.
In response, Mr. Koizumi announced a package of emergency spending increases, known as a supplemental budget, that the economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, said was needed to keep the slowdown from "expanding into a spiral."
The economic drop is the latest addition to a mass of gloomy figures that will greet Paul H. O'Neill, the United States Treasury secretary, when he arrives Wednesday for a two-day visit to Tokyo as part of a weeklong Asian tour.
Before departing from Washington today, Mr. O'Neill called on Japan to take "real action" to clean up a huge overhang of bad bank loans that has hobbled the economy since real estate and stock bubbles burst here a decade ago.
"It is time for decisive action to turn the Japanese economy around," Mr. O'Neill said Wednesday in Washington. "It isn't enough for the U.S. economy to be the only engine for economic growth in the world."
The American engine itself is hardly humming these days, as today's report of a sharp jump in unemployment indicates. But the United States is slowing down from a long boom, while Japan has been anemic for years. "Japan is going into a new recession before it ever recovered from the last recession," said Richard Katz, an economist and author of a book on Japan's troubles. "As soon as it lifts it head from the mat it plops right down again."
With tax revenue running 20 percent below forecast levels and the government turning to emergency spending in what has become an annual ritual, Japan's credit rating is slowly eroding. Moody's Investors Service placed Japanese government bonds on review, weighing a third downgrade since 1998, to AA3, the same as Italy.
"What concerns us is that as the reform process drags on, there is a continued buildup of the government debt," Vincent Trugli of Moody's said. "Public-sector debt is high by any measure. Then, fiscal stimulus becomes similar to a drug -- the more and more you use it, the less and less effective it becomes."
Eager to cut government spending somewhere, Mr. Koizumi commissioned a group of senior civil servants to identify candidates for privatization among 153 prospects. Reflecting the depth of bureaucratic resistance to his plans, the panel found only four.
Japan's financial system has grown so opaque and its bad-debt problem so large that estimates of the scope of the trouble diverge widely, and few analysts are willing to say its full extent is known. The International Monetary Fund discreetly asked Japan a week ago to allow it to send a team to size up the state of the banking system directly, an almost unprecedented intrusion in the affairs of a major economy.
At first, Japan's leading bank regulator, Hakuo Yanagisawa, refused, on the ground that his agency did not have the staff to assist the team. But he reversed himself on Wednesday, standing on the steps of the I.M.F.'s building to say, "We will work out an agreement."
The dead weight of the bad loans has also been blamed for dragging down the stock market. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index has threatened to slip below the psychologically important level of 10,000 several times in recent days, and appears to be only a few weak sessions away from another benchmark of decline: closing below the level of the Dow Jones industrial average, which it has not done since 1957.
American, German and French stock brokerage houses here have announced layoffs, and according to a poll by Reuters, Western fund mangers reduced their holdings of Japanese stocks and bonds in August -- two ominous signs, because foreign investors account for almost half the Nikkei's trading volume.
The yen gained a little strength in New York today to close at 120.07 to the dollar, compared with 121.08 on Thursday.
The I.M.F. hopes to have its banking survey team in place by Sept. 30, the end of the first half of the Japanese fiscal year. The date looms large this year because it is the effective deadline for banks to begin carrying stock and real estate investments on their books at their current market value. Though some banks are making use of loopholes to soften its effect, the change nonetheless threatens to force many to book huge paper losses.
"Sept. 30 is going to be very tough," said Keiko Kondo, a senior strategist for a securities affiliate of a Japanese bank. In advance of that date, two of Japan's weaker big banks, Asahi Bank and Daiwa Bank, said today that they were in talks to merge their operations.
The picture is no better in Japan's labor market, where the true extent of the country's troubles is also somewhat obscured in the official statistics, dire as they are. After the government reported that the official unemployment rate had reached 5 percent, the highest level in nearly half a century, the public management ministry said that a more inclusive method of calculating the rate would find that nearly 11 percent of workers are seeking a job.
Once feared in world markets, Japanese auto workers now fear for their jobs. This week a union group released a study predicting that by 2005, 143,000 workers, or about 20 percent of the industry's payroll in Japan, would be unemployed.
Job creation is far from the industry's mind. "If the auto industry has the capacity to build 14 million to 15 million cars and they have sold 11 million since the early 1990's, why are the carmakers going to build more capacity?" Mr. Katz said. 
On a broader scale, cleaning up the bad-loan problem will require turning off the tap for many struggling companies, exacting a social cost that few Japanese politicians are prepared to bear. "If you do this, you are talking at a minimum about three to four million people losing their jobs," Mr. Katz said.
After four months in office, Mr. Koizumi has yet to be very specific about his plans to heal Japan's economy, and some Japanese are starting to voice doubts that he will ever accomplish much.
"These were not the empty 120 days, but they were very counterproductive at best," said Yoshi Tsurumi, an international business professor and author of a recent book that criticized Mr. Koizumi. "This is a phony reformist. On the economic policies, he talks about changes and everything, but he has no plans, no specific plans."

HEADLINE: Blame Flies After Collapse of Arena Bill 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: BRIDGETON, N.J., Sept. 7 

 BODY:
The state broke out into a round robin of recriminations today after the collapse of a proposal to build an arena in Newark.
 Democrats blamed Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, accusing him of faulty tactics and faintheartedness. Mr. DiFrancesco's allies privately blamed Bret D. Schundler, the Republican candidate for governor, and accused Assembly Speaker Jack Collins of treachery. Mr. Collins, for his part, called a news conference here to blame the Democratic candidate for governor, James McGreevey, who, he said, abandoned the arena proposal rather than allow its pairing with a number of projects aiding South Jersey. 
 Mr. McGreevey, in his last-minute opposition statement Thursday had already blamed Republicans in the Legislature for burying the bill under a mountain of pork-barrel projects.
And Sharpe James, the Newark mayor, blamed just about all of them, from Mr. Schundler, who first made it a campaign issue, to Mr. McGreevey, who responded in kind.
"Neither side should have made this a political issue," Mr. James said. "In the process they have all lost sight of keeping the two sports teams here in the state. If there is any hero in all of this it is Acting Gov. Donnie DiFrancesco who tried to structure a bipartisan bill."
Despite the finger-pointing, the one thing that all of these elected officials seemed able to agree on was that there was some way that the arena proposal might yet reemerge, but only after the elections.
Left in the lurch for now was the fate of the proposed $355 million arena, the future of a major redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands, and the ultimate home of the New Jersey Devils and Nets, who want to leave the Continental Arena at the Meadowlands for a new arena in Newark. The teams are threatening to leave the state if they can not move to a Newark arena by the beginning of the 2004 season.
The plan to build the arena with financing from a state-created borrowing agency collapsed on Thursday when a long-awaited vote by the Assembly appropriations committee was canceled. The cancellation came as Republican Assembly members, feeling pressure from Mr. Schundler's opposition, began abandoning the bill, which had grown over the past few weeks into at least a $1 billion package including projects around the state.
Still, the pronouncements that the deal was not quite dead suggest that the political stakes remain high enough to try again. For Mr. DiFrancesco it would mean salvaging what had emerged as his bid for a legacy. Republicans said he had staked much of his political capital and longtime friendships in the Legislature on the proposal. But in the end, they said, his lame-duck status and the intense pressure of trying to push such a large and controversial project in an election year frustrated his efforts.
Some Democratic allies of Mr. McGreevey said it was political fumbling on Mr. DiFrancesco's part to allow Mr. Schundler, his party's standard-bearer, to trash the plan, and to let Mr. Collins load it up with other projects. The McGreevey camp had refrained from attacking Mr. DiFrancesco as long as he appeared to have things under control.
"But now we can go after the DiFrancesco record as well as Schundler," said a Democratic Party figure and McGreevey ally. "We can attack him as a symbol of Republican incompetence."
Some in the DiFrancesco administration say they regret not pushing an Assembly vote on the measure in June, when the Senate approved it without added projects and while the measure had momentum. But at the urging of Speaker Collins, they said, they did not press the issue.
"Some of us regret relying on Collins's ability to deliver the votes," said one senior DiFrancesco aide.
Mr. Collins, standing near skittish llamas today at the Cohanzick Zoo in Bridgeton, more than 100 miles south of Newark, spoke publicly for the first time about the issue. He said that the arena bill was not hurt by his actions, but rather by the defection of Mr. McGreevey, who is the mayor of Woodbridge.
"When it was just an economic development project for Newark, the mayor of Woodbridge and many of his political allies in the Legislature had no trouble supporting the bill," Mr. Collins said. "But once the bill became more of a statewide plan rather than an urban redevelopment project, they seemed to have a change of heart."
"There could be positive action on this after the election," he said, "but nothing will go through the Assembly that is going to be considered a Newark arena bill with there also being projects for other parts of the state."
Mr. James of Newark said Mr. Collins was politicizing a "self-financing" arena project, a process he said had not occurred when the state built the three-year-old New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark
Over two decades, he said, three different governors had advanced that project, and none of them had allowed it to be caught in the "urban-suburban," "black-white," and "partisan politics" of the state.
"It was viewed as a state project and not a Newark project, and the question was just whether it would work and not the dollars and cents," Mr. James said. "But what happened here is an embarrassment for the state, and this embarrassing bill with all the pork is politics at its worst and ugliest."

 BODY:
Unemployment Up to 4.9%, Its Highest Level Since '97
The nation's unemployment rate jumped sharply in August to 4.9 percent from 4.5 percent in July, the biggest one-month rise since 1995 and its highest level since 1997, dashing hopes that the bleak economic climate was starting to improve. In August, according to the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, businesses eliminated more than 100,000 jobs, suggesting that the economy remained at risk of falling into a recession. And companies, in an effort to halt profit declines, made further cuts this summer in the number of hours worked by their employees.
 A month ago, the Labor Department offered some reason for optimism, finding that manufacturers in July made the fewest number of job cuts in almost a year and reporting a rise in the number of people in the labor force -- those with a job or actively looking for one. But the August numbers erased nearly all of the hopeful signs. Page A1. 

President Bush said "too many people are losing their jobs," and he cast the surge in the unemployment rate as a reason for Congress to advance his economic agenda by expanding trade agreements and reducing energy costs while holding down spending. A9.

Court Questions TV Takeover Rules
A federal appeals court in Washington signaled its intention to strike down two regulations that have prevented the nation's biggest broadcasters, cable companies and media conglomerates from expanding by taking over local television stations. A1.

AMR Expects Losses in Second Half
AMR, the parent of American Airlines and Trans World Airlines, expects to post losses in the third and fourth quarters because of higher costs and fewer passengers. The company said the third-quarter loss would be "considerably larger" than its loss of 68 cents a share in the second quarter. C4.

Genetic Corn Risk Found Negligible
Genetically modified corn poses a "negligible" risk to monarch butterflies, according to a series of papers that will soon be published. The papers represent the most comprehensive peer-reviewed publications on a question that has been at the heart of controversy over genetically modified crops. C2.

UPN Is Sued by its Chief Executive
Dean Valentine, the president and chief executive of UPN television, has sued the network, contending that the broadcaster owes him up to $22 million in promised bonuses. Mr. Valentine, who was hired away from the Walt Disney Company in September 1997, accused UPN of arranging a financial incentive plan that differed from the terms that the company agreed to when he joined the network. C14.

Australian Bank's $2 Billion Blunder
The National Australia Bank, the country's biggest, bungled its foray into the American mortgage market by overlooking risk management fundamentals and by making a simple computer error. The mistakes forced the bank to write off $1.75 billion this week. C3.

India to Intervene in Dabhol Dispute
The government of India will intervene in a dispute between the Enron Corporation and the Indian state of Maharashtra over the Dabhol Power Company, which is controlled by Enron and is the largest private foreign investment in India. C3.

BP Pulls Out of China Gas Pipeline
BP, China's biggest foreign investor, pulled out of the bidding to help build a $14 billion natural gas pipeline that was designed to help development in the western provinces, reflecting concern about the plan's profitability. C3.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Stocks Slump on Fears Economy Won't Recover Quickly

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
A weak employment report further depressed stock prices in both the United States and Europe yesterday as hopes faded for a quick economic recovery.
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 20.62 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,085.78, as it fell below 1,100 for the first time since October 1998 and became the first major American index to fall below the lows reached this spring. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 234.99 points, or 2.4 percent, to 9,605.85, with such economically sensitive stocks as Boeing, Caterpillar and United Technologies leading the losses. But it remains above its spring low of 9,389.48. 
The report that the unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in August was viewed as indicating that the American economy was continuing to decline and spurred talk that the economy would shrink this quarter.
"People have wanted to see some definitive sign of a bottom in the economy so they could feel more comfortable about earnings," said Charles H. Blood Jr., a market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "This report certainly does not do that."
The sell-off has been even worse in Europe, where growth also appears to be slowing. In recent weeks several technology companies, among them Sun Microsystems and Novellus Systems, have said they see signs of stability in American business but that overseas sales are surprisingly weak.
The major stock indexes in all major European countries fell 5 percent or more this week, with a large part of the losses coming yesterday. Markets in Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Germany are all at their lowest levels since 1999 or earlier.
It is not just the stock market that appears to be warning of a weakening economy. Industrial commodities have been falling sharply, with one index of such prices at its lowest level since 1986. Treasury bond interest rates are also falling, reflecting an expectation of lower growth and a flight of investors to the safety of government securities. The 10-year Treasury yield is down to 4.78 percent, while the yield on two-year Treasuries is at 3.49 percent. In late May, when hopes for a recovery were rising, those yields were 5.51 percent and 4.31 percent, respectively.
"The bond market, the stock market and the commodities market are all saying, 'More easing, please,' " said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. Economists now seem convinced that the Federal Reserve will lower rates again at its next meeting, in October, something that was not deemed a sure thing only a few days ago, and there is growing speculation that the cut will be by half a percentage point, rather than the quarter point some expected.
It was the sharp fall in technology companies, first of their stock prices beginning in the spring of 2000 and then of the underlying businesses, that set off the stock market decline in America and then the economic slowdown. But yesterday, technology companies generally suffered smaller losses than many other stocks. Intel fell 21 cents, to $25.89, the day after it said business was meeting its lowered expectations.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 17.94 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,687.70, but that was the smallest loss for a major index. It also remains above its spring low, of 1,638.80. Microsoft fell 62 cents, to $55.40, the day after the Justice Department disclosed that it would no longer seek to break up the company.
Hewlett-Packard, up 38 cents, to $18.08, and Compaq Computer, up 24 cents, to $10.59, rose for the first time since they announced plans to merge. Even with the gains, however, they are down 22 percent and 14 percent, respectively, since the deal was announced on Monday night.
Byron Wien, a strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the unemployment report showed the economy was worse than people had thought. But he added that he thought the stock market could bottom by the end of October, turning back up well before the economy does. "Some tech stocks have suffered enough," he said, and might be close to their lows now. He pointed to EMC, which fell 53 cents, to $13.35, and Cisco Systems, which fell 4 cents, to $14.36.
Concerns that consumers are starting to react to rising unemployment by cutting back on spending affected some retail stocks. Home Depot fell $2.60, to $40.95. For the week, it fell $5, or 10.9 percent.
Financial companies are also coming under increased scrutiny as investors look for signs of deterioration in credit quality. Conseco fell 89 cents, to $7.11, bringing its loss for the week to $2.07, or 22.5 percent. TheStreet.com, citing leaked documents and interviews with former employees, reported Conseco had pressured employees to extend loans to avoid having to report that more loans were in default. The company called the allegations "tiresome and wrong" and said it had acted properly.
AOL Time Warner, down $2.81, to $32.28, was the biggest contributor to the daily decline in the S.& P. 500, which fell 4.2 percent for the week and has now lost 8.4 percent of its value in two weeks, for the worst two-week performance since April 2000, just after the market began to fall after a sustained bull market.
While the Nasdaq composite was the strongest of the major indexes yesterday, it fell 6.5 percent over the week, the second consecutive week that it had lost more than 5 percent of its value.
