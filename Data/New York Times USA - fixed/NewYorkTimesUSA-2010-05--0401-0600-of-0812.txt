Value, or Not, in a VAT
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Much to Love, and Hate, in a VAT'' (Economic View, May 2): 
 Like most discussions of consumption-tax options, the column didn't address what I hate most. For many Americans near or in retirement, a VAT would be punitively retroactive. A lifetime of saved income -- on which taxes have already been paid -- would be taxed again when those savings are used to fund retirement.
 The situation is somewhat different for tax-deferred retirement accounts, which are funded with the understanding that future tax rates may be less favorable than current ones. But many people don't fund retirement from such savings alone. After-tax savings -- whatever the instruments -- are a bedrock of responsible retirement planning.
 A VAT would do substantial violence to Roth IRAs, which are funded with the explicit understanding that all distributions will be tax-free. And what of people who, nearing retirement and realizing that taxes must rise soon, have recently converted traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, paying their taxes now while rates are supposedly lower? Surprise! 
 Yes, it seems that taxes must increase, that our sins must be paid for. But a VAT would disproportionately hurt those who have lived their financial lives most responsibly -- and are least responsible for the country's economic distress. Rob Rowan

 To the Editor:
 In the column, N. Gregory Mankiw pointed out that a value-added tax ''is just another form of a retail sales tax'' but that it ''has the advantage of being harder to evade.''
 That advantage is not to be taken lightly. For example, a national VAT could eliminate the sizable revenue losses currently incurred when states are unable to collect sales taxes on Internet purchases. 
 But a VAT without eliminating already-existing state and local sales taxes would be onerous and unreasonable. If a VAT could take the place of those taxes, with states and localities getting an equitable VAT share, small businesses could save money by not having as many reporting requirements to various governments.

HEADLINE: Green Economics

 BODY:
Paul Krugman (April 11) does an excellent job of explaining climate-change economics but omits one important factor: the immediate and local human health benefits of the cleaner air that most climate-change-mitigation measures will also provide. When reducing carbon dioxide emissions (e.g., by reducing the burning of coal), other air pollutants, like particles and ozone, that are associated with increased risk of asthma attacks, hospital admissions and mortality will often also be reduced at the same time. 
 These climate-mitigation health co-benefits will be immediately reaped by the communities that clean their air, producing an additional incentive that must also be weighed in economic evaluations of climate change policy. GEORGE D. THURSTON, SC.D. N.Y.U. School of Medicine, New York

HEADLINE: EXCLUSIVE ONLINE COMMENTARY FROM THE TIMES: The Making of a Terrorist

BYLINE: By ROBERT WRIGHT

 BODY:
One fate the conservative commentator Daniel Pipes doesn't have to worry about is drowning in conceptual complexity. He keeps his theories simple. His theory about why Faisal Shahzad tried to blow up a bomb in Times Square last week is ''jihadi intent.''
 Pipes writes dismissively of other explanations - that Shahzad is emotionally unstable, say, or that the bomb was payback for American military action in Pakistan. In Pipes's universe, apparently, these explanations are rivals to the ''jihadi intent'' explanation, and couldn't figure in an account of how Shahzad came to have jihadi intent in the first place.
 Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic seems to agree that jihadism is a kind of prime mover of terrorism. After bloggers noted that Shahzad had lost his home to foreclosure, Goldberg rejected the idea that ''the country's financial crisis, and not, say, jihadist ideology, is at the root of Shahzad's desire to commit murder in Times Square.'' 
 I'd like to invite Pipes and Goldberg to imagine an alternative universe, a universe in which behaviors - such as planting a bomb - don't have a single ''root'' cause. In this universe, bomb-planting behavior is kind of like the bombs themselves: a number of ingredients have to come together before things get explosive. If you figure out what those ingredients are, and which of them you can control, maybe you can make bomb-planting behavior less common.In the universe I'm positing, the following scenario is conceivable:
 A Pakistani guy moves to America, goes to college, gets a job, starts a family. He grows unhappy. Maybe he's having financial problems (though I'm skeptical, for reasons outlined by Charles Lane here, that Shahzad's home foreclosure actually signifies as much); or maybe the problem is just that he doesn't find his social niche. And maybe he was a bit unstable to begin with - which would make it harder to find his niche and might intensify his reaction to not finding it.
 Anyway, for whatever reason, he feels alienated in America. He stays in touch with people and events back home in Pakistan, and this gives him another reason to dislike America: American drones are firing missiles into Pakistan, sometimes killing women and children.
 Thanks to the Internet, it doesn't take him long to find like-minded folks, or to come under the influence of a radical imam operating out of Yemen. ''Jihadi intent'' is taking shape, and eventually he comes into the fold of actual jihadis, a faction of the Taliban in Pakistan. They give him what he hadn't found in America: a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose. The basic ingredients of bomb-planting behavior are now in place.
 I'm not sure this is the story of Faisal Shahzad; we don't yet know enough to say. But this story is consistent with the facts disclosed about him so far - and, more to the point, stories like this do unfold in the world we inhabit. Various things fuel ''jihadi intent,'' and they may include the policy of firing missiles into Pakistan.
 In fact, this policy does seem to have been part of Shahzad's motivation. He reportedly told investigators he was upset about the drone strikes.
 Obviously (I hope), to say that American policies may cause terrorism isn't to say that America is to blame for terrorism. It's just to say those policies may have downsides. And, obviously, those policies may have upsides as well; drone strikes disrupt terrorist logistics, for example.
 Spelling out my reasons for thinking the downsides often outweigh the upsides is a subject for another column. For now my main point is that war-on-terror hawks need to confront the downsides, rather than act as if establishing the role of ''jihadi intent'' or ''jihadist ideology'' somehow ends the debate. They need to seriously ask whether the policies they favor have, while killing terrorists abroad, created terrorists both abroad and - more disturbingly - at home.
 These possibly counterproductive hawkish policies go beyond drone strikes - a fact that is unwittingly underscored by the hawks themselves. They're the first to highlight the role played by that imam in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in inspiring Shahzad and other terrorists. But look at the jihadist recruiting narrative al-Awlaki's peddling. He says America is at war with Islam, and to make this case he recites the greatest hits of hawkish policy: the invasion of Iraq, the troop escalation in Afghanistan, drone strikes in Pakistan, etc.
 All of these policies - not just the last of them - may have helped incite Shahzad. Back in 2004, a real estate agent recalls, he was oddly outspoken about his opposition to the Iraq war. And last year he asked his father for permission to fight Americans in Afghanistan. Only when denied that opportunity did he turn toward Times Square. (This is evidence against the theory that he was from early on a ''plant'' in America.)
 So too with the two other high-profile terrorist attacks against America over the past year: the Fort Hood shooting and the would-be underwear bombing. Both perpetrators had found in hawkish policies cause to buy into the jihadi recruiting narrative.
 Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, was enraged by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the aspiring underwear bomber, before he became an aspiring underwear bomber, was giving glimpses of his inchoate ''jihadi intent'' as a student at University College London. There he sponsored a conference on the war on terror, and on the poster advertising the conference was a picture of a prisoner at Guantanamo - hooded, handcuffed and kneeling. A jihadist pinup, courtesy of Dick Cheney.
 Unfortunately, President Obama isn't discarding the Bush-Cheney playbook that has given jihadist recruiters such effective talking points. Quite the contrary: the White House thinks the moral of the Shahzad story may be that we should get more aggressive in Pakistan, possibly putting more boots on the ground. And already Obama has authorized the assassination of al-Awlaki.
 Even leaving aside the constitutional questions (al-Awlaki is an American citizen), doesn't Obama see what a gift the killing of this imam would be to his cause? Just ask the Romans how their anti-Jesus-movement strategy worked out. (And Jesus's followers didn't have their leader's sermons saved in ready-to-go video and audio files; al-Awlaki's resurrection would be vivid indeed.)
 When you look at how much real-world evidence there is against the views of war-on-terror hawks, it's not surprising that they would construct their own little universe, a place where ''jihadi intent'' is an uncaused cause, and our only hope is to kill or intimidate the people who, through some magical process that defies comprehension, have been possessed by it.
 What is surprising is that Barack Obama, who became the Democratic nominee for president largely because he had opposed the Iraq war, seems increasingly to be taking his cues from the people who so disastrously supported it.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Alex Abrams

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Abrams, 44, is an executive vice president of the Real Estate Disposition Corporation, or R.E.D.C., of Irvine, Calif., one of the country's largest real estate auction companies.
 Working out of the company's new Manhattan office, Mr. Abrams oversees the builder division and organized the recent auction at the Solaria condominium in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
 Q Would you call the Solaria auction last winter a success? 
 A It was a big success. Solaria has 64 units, and there had been 10 sold before we got involved. We had high-bid offers on all 54 units in that project at about 91 percent of retail value. About 4,000 people went to the site in the days leading up to the auction, about 1,500 people preregistered, then 500 showed up. And we simultaneously had bidders online.
 Q How did that auction compare with other builder auctions? 
 A We've been able to achieve, on average, over the last 50 builder auctions, between 75 and 90 percent of current retail. We invariably sell 90 to 100 percent of the units that we put up for auction.
 Q Are more residential auctions planned for the region? 
 A They haven't been coming as quickly in New York as they have in other areas. Many developers in New York are still waiting and holding out to see what's going to happen in the market. But I think we're going to see a lot more auction activity by the end of the year. We're in conversation with numerous developers right now.
 Q Can you name names? 
 A I really can't. But I can tell you that we're having more conversations in the outer boroughs than in Manhattan.
 Q You don't think that we've reached a bottom yet, do you? 
 A It just doesn't make sense given all the economic indicators, and in particular the huge unsold inventory on the sidelines. Nationwide, there are 3 million units of unsold inventory and a shadow inventory of 10 million. We're talking about homes that are underwater -- where the borrower owes more than the value of the home -- who have not yet walked from those homes but it is anticipated that they will.
 Q Before R.E.D.C., you ran AS Realty, which developed condos in SoHo and on Hester Street. Why did you leave the development business? 
 A With the downturn in the market, I was trying to figure out what I was going to do next. We were finishing up the projects we had, and like most developers we weren't starting new projects.
 Q Do you recommend using auctions to jump-start sales? 
 A For the most part, the auction platform works best when you're closing out inventory, in the latter stages of the project. But in this environment, remember, there are a lot of different situations. For example, lenders have taken over entire projects where there haven't been any sales.
 Q So you're dealing with lenders as well as developers. 
 A We deal with whoever in the chain is the decision-maker.
 Q How are you compensated? 
 A We work with a standard formula that combines a broker's commission, which is our standard 3 percent, and something called the buyer's premium. So, if somebody buys a home for $100,000, the final price is $105,000. This is very standard in the auction industry.
 Q How do you reconcile conflicting agendas? You may want to set price reserves lower to facilitate sales, while developers want to get the highest prices.
 A It's a very rare case where that becomes an issue. In most instances we're dealing with very sophisticated sellers. We've done a lot of work with them prior to the auction in discussing the range of price possibilities. And once we come up with that pricing, reserves are negotiated at some discount from that.
 Q Are auctions useful in ''up'' markets? 
 A I think they will be. Even in an up market there have been, in a sense, auctions going on: when a hot building opens, a broker sometimes holds an informal version of an auction where buyers compete against each other. The overall image of auctions is changing dramatically through this environment, and that will continue into the next up cycle.
 Q There still is a stigma, no? 
 A Well, less and less and less. The more people who get involved in them, the more they see that auctions are not fire sales, but solid means of moving product quickly at prices that are really very, very competitive.
 Q Your advice for bidders? 
 A Get in early and be prepared: research the financing, look carefully at the units you want to buy -- and you have a chance of getting a very good deal.
 Q Have you ever bought a home at auction? 
 A I haven't.

HEADLINE: Gang Injunction Names Names, and Suit Follows

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
Lucio Gonzalez, a 33-year-old unemployed truck driver from a tough part of Fairfield, said he was scared to look out the door at night, but not because of the area's gangs. He thinks he will be a casualty of police efforts to control gang activity.
 ''I feel like the police are going to kick in the door,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, who has a 2-year-old son. ''Who is going to watch my kid if they take me away? I'm paranoid, looking out the window like, Are they out there right now? They take pictures of me, of my cars and my house. They constantly pull me over. They give me tickets for everything.''
To the Fairfield police, Mr. Gonzalez is a known member of the Nortenos, a violent street gang they have sought to restrict through a court-ordered civil gang injunction. 
 ''He's a threat to the community,'' said Sgt. Matt Bloesch of Fairfield Police Department's gang unit. ''He's associating with gang members, and he is an active member of a gang that's involved in drug trafficking, carrying weapons, putting up graffiti and shooting people.'' 
 Mr. Gonzalez said this characterization was false.
 Is he or isn't he? What might have been a question confined to police investigative units is now ricocheting around a far larger arena, as Fairfield and dozens of other California cities have become proving grounds for the latest legal assault on gang violence: the gang injunction.
 In Fairfield, the injunction gives a judicial imprimatur to barring gang members and gang activity from large swaths of the city, the better to ensure that violence between the Nortenos and their rivals, the Surenos, is curbed and the community is safer from the outbreaks of gunfire that have resulted in 10 killings since 1994. 
 It is no accident that the injunctions have flourished in California. There are 236,200 gang members in the state, almost one-third of the national total, according to a tracking system set up by the California Department of Justice. 
 But what makes someone a gang member? That is the question being posed by Mr. Gonzalez and Mario Huezo, 22. 
 Legally there is no single definition. To be considered a gang member under state law, a law enforcement official trained in gangs must ''validate'' membership by determining that a person falls under at least two criteria from a list that includes self-admission of gang affiliation, frequenting a gang area, gang dress and tattoos, and using hand signs associated with gangs.
 The American Civil Liberties Union, which has intervened in numerous cases of gang injunctions, put Mr. Huezo and Mr. Gonzalez in touch with Paul Feuerwerker, a lawyer representing them without a fee. In a hearing scheduled for July, a judge will decide whether the men are in fact gang members who should be named in the injunction. The judge will also decide at that time whether to make the injunction permanent.
 The issues raised by civil libertarians go well beyond the question of accurately identifying gang members. Lawyers for the A.C.L.U. have argued that civil gang injunctions violate a host of constitutional rights, including the First Amendment right of freedom of association and due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth and 14th Amendments. 
 ''Gang injunctions function like roving warrants, and they can lead to a lot of racial profiling,'' said Jory Steele, managing attorney of the Northern California chapter of the A.C.L.U.
 Fairfield's injunction, which a judge preliminarily approved in July, serves as a restraining order within defined geographic boundaries -- 4.19 square miles of downtown) -- in which gang members have restricted rights, including a mandatory curfew of 10 p.m. and rules against associating in public.
 Before filing the injunction the police department spent years assembling more than 400 pages of evidence chronicling the activities of gang members, recording tattoos, traffic violations, drive-by shootings and any misconduct dating back to 1994, the year of the first Norteno gang-related homicide in this city of 106,500.
 According to law enforcement officials, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Huezo and an estimated 250 others in Fairfield are members of the Nortenos gang, which originated in the state prison system in the 1960s. 
 In Spanish ''Nortenos'' means ''northerners,'' a name given to prisoners from the agricultural and often rural northern parts of the state by the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang largely made up of Latino prisoners from Los Angeles and more urban parts of Southern California. Allies of the Mexican Mafia are called Surenos, or ''southerners.'' 
 Over time, the gangs moved from the prisons into the streets. Law enforcement officials say the Nortenos are known for violent crime, the color red and peddling drugs like heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine within the prison system and on the street. The Surenos are involved in the same activities, but wear the color blue and have different tattoos.
 The Nortenos ''are a violent group of individuals that terrorize the city with shootings, stabbings, graffiti, the list goes on and on, and they do these criminal acts as an entity, as a group,'' said Bryan Kim, Solano County's deputy district attorney. ''This injunction is an effective tool to prevent that violence before it happens.''
 There is no Fairfield injunction involving the Surenos. 
 The first civil gang injunction was filed in 1987 by the Los Angeles city attorney against a gang known as the Playboy Gangster Crips. Since then, such injunctions have proliferated, covering parts of at least 40 cities, including five injunctions in San Francisco and one filed in February by Oakland's city attorney. 
 In 1997 the California Supreme Court upheld gang injunctions as a constitutional means to control street gangs. That case involved just four square blocks in San Jose, within which none of the gang members lived, but increasingly, gang injunction ''safety zones'' have incorporated larger swaths of cities and towns. 
 Just over 11 percent of Fairfield is within the safety zone. Many of the designated gang members in the injunction live within its borders.
 ''It's basically all of Fairfield,'' Mr. Huezo said. ''The rich neighborhoods around the perimeter of the city are the only place the gang injunction does not apply.''
 When a county judge granted the preliminary gang injunction, Mr. Huezo immediately picked up the phone. ''I was bright enough to contact the A.C.L.U.,'' he said. ''I'm not a gang member. I'm not who they depict me as. I'm not on parole or probation. If I was who they say I am, I'd be in prison, on probation or dead.'' 
 For the judge remove Mr. Huezo and Mr. Gonzalez from the injunction, each must prove that he has had no association with suspected gang members for three years. The police say both men have been seen in gang locales and in the company of gang members within that time. 
 The two men also have another option for getting off the list , using the injunction's built-in ''opt-out'' provision. In that case, it is the district attorney who must decide their status. 
 Mr. Gonzalez echoed Mr. Huezo on the effect of the injunction. ''I have so much family here, cousins and aunts and uncles, and we all live in the gang zone,'' he said. ''Now I can't see my family. I can't be out with them because if the police see us they'll try to label them gang members and harass them, too. My family is scared to be around me.'' 
 But Sergeant Bloesch said it was easy for the police to distinguish innocent associations. ''If Mr. Gonzalez is stopped on his way to church and one of his family members who is a known gangmember is in the car with him'' he said, ''then obviously they are not doing gang stuff.
 ''If he's rolling in a car at 3 o'clock in the morning, and he's with other members of the gang and some of them are drunk and they're wearing red, well now there's a problem.''
 Gang injunctions are likely to get a closer look in the coming year as the Obama administration has taken a keen interest in the problem of gang violence. 
 During a visit to Oakland last week, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said combating gang violence was ''a top priority for this administration'' and announced that next year the president's budget would include $12 million in new spending on gang and youth violence prevention. 
 While both Mr. Huezo and Mr. Gonzalez want to get off Fairfield's list of gang members, neither claim complete innocence.
 In 1994, as a teenager, Mr. Gonzalez was involved in a gang shooting in a Fairfield park. He pleaded guilty, though he was not the one holding the weapon. He spent time in a juvenile jail. Since then, he has had run-ins with the police for street fights, public drunkenness, yelling gang slogans and verbally threatening police officers while drunk. 
 ''I've made mistakes in the past,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''but I've paid for my mistakes.''

HEADLINE: Sweat Campus Golf; Who Needs Grass?

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
There's not a whole lot of grass in Manhattan, so the men's golf team at Columbia University has to be resourceful in finding practice space.
 The golfers hone swings in a converted squash court for much of the year and occasionally take a van across Harlem to the driving range on Randalls Island.
 If players, for some reason, want to work out on an actual course, starting in March a van leaves campus each weekday at 2:40 p.m. for St. Andrew's Golf Club in Hastings-on-Hudson (that means no afternoon classes for golfers). Otherwise, to practice the short game, the team heads up to the northern tip of Manhattan to pitch and chip on Baker Field, used by the football team. 
 ''The yard lines help the guys judge the yardage on their shots,'' the coach, Rich Mueller, offered gamely.
 Despite these handicaps, Columbia just won its third consecutive Ivy League championship and a bid to the N.C.A.A. championships; the team starts regional play May 20 at Yale. That is, on Yale University Golf Course, which since 1924 has given Yale's golf teams beautiful and challenging practice space a short shuttle bus ride from where the players live and study.
 ''Four of the eight Ivies have golf courses on campus, which can obviously make practicing more convenient,'' Coach Mueller said. ''We find a way to piece the whole thing together, and we wind up beating teams that have better access to resources than we do.''
 Trips to the St. Andrew's course were curtailed last week because of finals, so the team was back in the former squash court. On Monday, the players traded horror stories about exams and took turns with their putters on a less-than-smooth strip of synthetic green turf. They smacked balls into a heavy screen that displayed the projected image of a golf hole; a computer calculated the yardage, direction and trajectory of their shots.
 This is the team's clubhouse, where the golfers alternate hitting balls and books. There are redecoration plans afoot: some couches and tall wooden lockers, for that country club lounge-y feel.
 ''It's much quieter here than the library,'' Clark Granum, 20, a junior engineering major and the team's star, said as others swung - Womp! Womp! - toward the screen.
 With a lanky build and a downswing of red hair over his eyes, Mr. Granum, who is from Torrey Pines, Calif., has been the man this year: he led Columbia to the Ivy title this month with a three-under-par 67 in the final round at the famous Baltusrol Golf Club in New Jersey and made first-team all-Ivy for the third straight season.
 On Wednesday, he tried to qualify for next month's United States Open at Pebble Beach, but fell short. The next day, he took two finals: computer networking and electrical circuits.
 On Monday, he was slumped in a chair, worn out from an exam in an engineering class called Random Signals and Noise. He watched his teammate Brendan Doyle hitting 8-irons that the computer said were traveling more than 175 yards. Then he stood up and grabbed a driver and went shot-for-shot with Mr. Doyle in a long-drive contest.
 Justin Lee, a junior majoring in economics, walked in, bleary-eyed from an all-night study session for his exam in Money and Banking. Mr. Lee grew up in Tarzana, Calif. - four of the team's starting five are Californians - and his brother Jordan, a high school golf standout, plans to come to Columbia in the fall, passing up offers to play at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Berkeley.
 Columbia alumni finance fancy golf trips for the team, like one planned for August to Scotland, where the golfers will play St. Andrews and other great courses. About 30 alums showed up to watch them win at Baltusrol.
 Mr. Doyle said: ''We play with them at events and they'll always hand out business cards and say, 'Call me if you need anything,' '' in terms of employment after graduation.
 The eight members of the team have an average G.P.A. of 3.5, and all five starters are returning. Seems as if practicing on a virtual golf course and putting on a bumpy rug is a winning formula. Coach Mueller thinks the struggle just to practice whets the team's competitive edge.
 ''We turn the negatives into positives,'' he said.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Call To Action

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Josef Joffe's critique of Tony Judt's ''Ill Fares the Land'' (May 2) is as predictable as it is disingenuous. Dismissing Judt's book as left-wing romanticism or worse, Joffe forgets that the American public has been reared for decades on the largely false claim that there are no alternatives to a market-driven society, that economic growth should not be constrained by considerations of social costs or moral responsibility, and that government is the enemy of politics. 
 At the heart of this market rationality is an egocentric philosophy and culture of cruelty that sold off public goods and services to the highest bidders while simultaneously dismantling those public spheres, social protections and institutions serving the public good. This form of economic Darwinism is the real enemy of democracy. Judt has done us a great service in exposing the hit democracy takes when the state protects only the powerful and punishes everyone else.
 HENRY A. GIROUX Hamilton, Ontario The writer holds the Global Television Network chair in communications studies at McMaster University.
 To the Editor:
 The real power of Tony Judt's ''Ill Fares the Land'' is his assertive exposition of the corrosive effects of income inequality -- a problem greater in the United States than in any other Western democracy. ''Poverty,'' he says, ''is an abstraction, even for the poor. But the symptoms of collective impoverishment are all about us.'' This is evident not only in crimes committed (decreasing, as Joffe notes), but in gated communities and the incarceration of young black males, both of which erode our social fabric.
 And nowhere are the effects of income inequality more evident than in health. Judt cites Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett's recent book, ''The Spirit Level,'' which describes the relationships between poverty and ill health. Ill health begets health care spending, so it should not be surprising that the added costs associated with poverty account for as much as one-third of health care spending in dense urban centers. More than any other factor, poverty explains the geographic variation in health care that was so widely discussed but never properly diagnosed during health care reform. Judt has made the diagnosis for the United States, as Sir Michael Marmot recently did for England, where the problem is similar but not as great.
 Here, there and everywhere, the solution will require more than health insurance. It will require the kind of social reorientation that Judt calls for.
 RICHARD COOPER Philadelphia The writer is a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
 To the Editor:
 Josef Joffe claims that ''United States government spending at all levels was over 40 percent of G.D.P. last year, which puts it in the neighborhood of such nice bastions of social justice as Norway (41 percent) and Germany (45 percent).'' His sneer at ''social justice'' obligated him to acknowledge that the comparison would have presented a very different picture if he had excluded from the expenditures of the three governments those which have nothing to do with social justice: military expenditures.

HEADLINE: Still Watching a Public Course With a Premium Fee

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
The Pound Ridge Golf Club became the first Pete Dye-designed golf course in the New York area when it opened in 2008. It was a public daily fee golf course just over the New York border from Stamford, Conn., which put it in the heart of an area replete with well-known and established private golf courses. 
 The peak cost to play Pound Ridge, which has all the devilish approaches, colossal bunker complexes and strategic mounding you would expect from a Dye design, was $235. That was considerably more than the peak cost to play other high-end public courses in the region like Bethpage Black State Park on Long Island ($150), Ballyowen Golf Club in New Jersey ($135) or the Centennial Golf Club ($135) in Carmel, N.Y.
 And Pound Ridge's timing was poor, making its debut in the midst of a recession. Nearly two years later, Pound Ridge remains a much-watched experiment. Can a private-like golf course with a pricey playing fee cater to the public?
 In the short term, it appears Pound Ridge is luring at least some private club members away from their old haunts.
 Like other courses, Pound Ridge offers yearlong programs (Pound Ridge won't call them memberships) in which golfers pay $8,000 for an individual plan or $12,000 for a corporate plan offering various perks like advance reservations and discounted rates that also apply to guests. The plans have the ease of a membership and work like a debit card as the price of golf rounds (typically reduced to $195 to $150) are deducted along with food and beverage purchased.
 ''When they do the math, a private club can cost some people $400 a round,'' Pound Ridge's general manager Todd Leavenworth said. ''We had people who wanted to play just 20 rounds and wanted to bring friends or corporate guests. We made a deal for them.''
 The program began last year and lured about 25 golfers. This year the number has tripled to roughly 75, said Jason Ekaireb, the club's sales and marketing director.
 It's good news for Pound Ridge because it is attracting local business in a crowded market, but Pound Ridge was also a golf course that cost the owner Ken Wang $40 million to build. When it opened, Pound Ridge was rated among the top five new public golf courses in the United States by Golf Digest and Golf Magazine. About an hour's drive from Manhattan, it is meant to be a destination for golfers from far and wide.
 Ekaireb conceded Pound Ridge needed more business but he said the business model, which is still developing, would be successful in the long run.
 The golf world will certainly be watching.
 In the meantime, last year's rainy summer has helped mature the Pound Ridge layout, making Dye's distinctive touches somehow more playable and menacing at the same time. As Dye said with his Midwestern twang the day it opened in 2008: ''Everyone agrees it's a beautiful piece of land. You just need to bring a lot of golf balls.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Euro Zone Likes a Weaker Currency, Up to a Point

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- In Europe, businesses are generally giddy to see the euro fall and exports rise. But the currency's plunge in recent days is starting to make the Continent nervous. 
 After falling to an 18-month low relative to the dollar last week, the euro declined again early Monday, falling at one point to a new four-year low.
 For exporters like the German carmaker Daimler, the decline has been a boon. Sales of its Mercedes-Benz models surged 22 percent in the United States during the first four months of the year, and those sales in dollars are worth 15 percent more when converted to euros than they would have been at the beginning of the year. 
 But the volatility of the euro -- sliding more than 8 percent in the last month -- is unnerving managers at factories across the Continent, even at Daimler in Stuttgart. More than anything at this point, Europe longs for stability. And business people worry that the euro sell-off reflects a broader loss of faith in the common currency. 
 ''The volatility can really create a lot of problems,'' said Olaf Wortmann, a business-cycle specialist at the German Engineering Federation, a manufacturers' association. Sharp currency swings complicate contracts with foreign suppliers and upset investment plans, he said. 
 ''A cheaper euro helps us in certain markets,'' agreed Christoph Liedtke, a spokesman for SAP, a maker of business software based in Walldorf, Germany. But, he said, ''We have a strong interest in a stable currency. The stronger the currency fluctuations, the more difficult it is for all companies.'' 
 The euro's decline accelerated last week after European Union leaders agreed on a nearly $1 trillion aid package intended to guarantee that Greece, Spain and other countries could pay their debts. The European Central Bank also began buying government and corporate debt to prevent a market freeze. The moves were unprecedented. 
 Businesses generally applauded the huge commitment to stabilize the euro area, and stocks ended the week higher. But after a brief rally last Monday morning, the euro began moving in the opposite direction. Investors are concerned that the central bank's relentless focus on price stability is now in question, analysts said. 
 Investors were also shaken by the abrupt reversal in policy. On Thursday, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, had insisted that its governing council not even discuss bond purchases. 
 ''They have lost credibility because they are now acting against their own talk from before,'' said Jurgen von Hagen, a professor of economics at the University of Bonn. Faced with the need to supply cash to European banks, the central bank will have to keep its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent for the foreseeable future, said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. 
 The Federal Reserve is likely to begin raising interest rates sooner than the European Central Bank, Mr. Kramer said, making it more attractive for investors to hold assets in dollars. He predicts that inflation will rise to an annual rate of 3 or 4 percent in coming years, rather than the official target of about 2 percent. 
 Mr. Trichet insists that the central bank will never deviate from its mandate to preserve price stability. ''Those who believe -- or even worse, are suggesting -- that we will tolerate inflation in the future are making a grave error,'' he told the German magazine Der Spiegel.
 The euro, which was trading around $1.25 on Friday, is still above ''purchasing power parity,'' the point at which the currencies are aligned with how much they buy in the real world. The fair value of the euro is about $1.20, analysts say. 
 If the euro settles at something close to parity, businesses will be happy. But experience shows that rarely happens. 
 ''The exchange rates always over- or undershoot,'' said Mr. Wortmann of the Engineering Federation. ''We wouldn't be happy about an undervalued euro.'' 
 To be sure, a big euro devaluation would be good for some of the countries that have the most serious problems. Besides alarming debt levels, countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal have allowed wages to rise faster than productivity, and now have trouble competing on world markets. 
 A depressed euro would make their products cheaper in foreign markets, and help restore competitiveness. A stronger dollar would also help tourism, which is an important industry in Mediterranean countries. Bookings from the United States at Silversea Cruises are up about 10 percent, said Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio, deputy chairman of the cruise ship operator. But he attributes most of the gain to the improved American economy.
 For most exporters, though, a cheaper euro brings problems as well as advantages. Oil and raw materials, which are often priced in dollars, become more expensive. Currency hedging, like any other kind of insurance, becomes more expensive when the risk rises, as it does during big exchange rate moves. 
 Many international companies have moved some of their manufacturing abroad, in part to cushion themselves against currency fluctuations. 
 SMA Solar Technology, a maker of inverters for solar plants that is based in Niestetal, Germany, is setting up a factory in Denver that is expected to employ 700 people, partly to serve the American market but also to guard against a gyrating euro. 
 ''SMA will be able to reduce transportation and interim storage costs as well as currency exchange risks,'' Gunther Cramer, the company's chief, said in a statement. 
 For such companies, a swing in the dollar-euro rate may simply be a wash. While Daimler cars made in Germany become more profitable, Daimler S.U.V.'s made in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and exported outside the United States -- as more than half are -- become less profitable in euro terms. 
 Mr. Wortmann said that the machinery makers in the Engineering Federation were more concerned about the state of world trade and the health of the European economy than they were about the dollar-euro exchange rate. 
 ''Demand is what is decisive,'' Mr. Wortmann said. ''We are getting one or the other new contract, but it's not a flood.''
 Greece May Pursue U.S. Banks
 Greece is considering taking legal action against American investment banks that may have contributed to the country's debt crisis, Prime Minister George Papandreou said. 
 ''I wouldn't rule out that this may be a recourse,'' Mr. Papandreou said, in response to questions in an interview on CNN's ''Fareed Zakaria GPS'' on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Broadband and the F.C.C.

 BODY:
The Republican attack on the Federal Communications Commission's proposal to classify broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service sounded a lot like the G.O.P. talking points on health care reform. 
 The House minority leader, John Boehner, said it was a ''government takeover of a large portion of the private sector.'' It's a colorful statement, but wrong.
 The new classification is a measured attempt to ensure regulatory oversight over what is fast becoming the nation's most vital communications network. It was announced after an appeals court ruled against an attempt by the F.C.C. to guarantee open access to the Internet under the terms established by the Bush administration, which classified broadband as an information channel for the purpose of freeing it from regulation.
 The F.C.C.'s new classification is sensible. The pipes through which our data flow provide as much of a telecommunications service as the phone lines that carry our voices. Just the other day, The Times reported that data flowing over mobile devices surpassed voice calls. 
 These pipes are controlled by a handful of corporations. In some areas of the country, there is only one broadband provider. And service is expensive. A monthly broadband subscription in the United States costs about $8 for each advertised megabit per second, on average. In Britain it costs $1.98 and in Japan $2.33, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
 With broadband companies eager to ''manage'' the data flow on their networks, there is potential for abuse. The lawsuit that led to the F.C.C.'s reclassification arose from its attempt to stop Comcast from blocking access to peer-to-peer file-sharing sites. Classifying broadband access as telecommunication would give the F.C.C. authority to enforce much-needed rules to guarantee an open, nondiscriminatory and competitive market for Internet access and protect consumers' rights online. 
 The argument that the F.C.C. wants to take over the Internet is a red herring. The commission stated that it will invoke only a narrow set of the Telecommunications Act's provisions to regulate phone networks. It explicitly vowed not to invoke many old cumbersome provisions, such as price regulation.
 Cable and phone companies fear the F.C.C.'s forbearance will be challenged in court, and that broadband access providers risk being tied up in a mass of new regulations. But this kind of regulatory forbearance is hardly new. Indeed, it has allowed the cellphone industry to grow under a reasonable standard of regulation despite being indisputably a telecom service. 
 The reclassification of broadband might not have been needed had Comcast not challenged the F.C.C.'s authority to enforce nondiscrimination rules under the prior definition of broadband. Some broadband companies now wish it had not. But the fact remains that the dominant telecommunications network of the 21st century requires regulatory oversight. At this juncture, the F.C.C.'s path is the right path forward.

HEADLINE: Downtown Theater Company Faces Eviction

BYLINE: Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transit Authority has threatened to evict the experimental media and theater group 3-Legged Dog from its Lower Manhattan building. The authority notified the group on Friday that it would begin eviction proceedings on Monday if 3-Legged Dog did not pay the more than $306,000 it owes the authority in back rent and interest. 
The group signed a 20-year lease in 2002 for space at 80 Greenwich Street, now known as 3LD Art & Technology Center, agreeing to pay $21,666.67 per month there after its former location at 30 West Broadway was destroyed in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kevin Cunningham, 3-Legged Dog's executive artistic director, confirmed that the company had fallen behind in payments when foundations withdrew financial support because of the recession. He also said the theater had been forced to spend its own money on building maintenance, including asbestos abatement, without reimbursement from the authority. Though he said he had offered to negotiate a payment plan, the two companies have been unable to reach an agreement. The authority's spokesman, Jeremy Soffin, told The Journal, ''I don't know how anyone can justify letting this tenant rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in back rent at a time when state cuts and deteriorating tax revenues have forced the M.T.A. to lay off station agents and cut service.''

LCD SOUNDSYSTEM
 ''This Is Happening''
 (DFA)
 James Murphy, the semicomic force behind the one-man dance-rock band LCD Soundsystem, has loaded himself up with broad, juicy aesthetic problems. He makes the nature of those problems pretty clear, and so his records radiate with anxiety. 
 One problem is how to transfer the magic of one form to another. He admires the slow, additive, build-up-the-vibes process of an extended dance mix or a D.J. set, and he wants to replicate it with live instruments in a single song. (In the studio he plays all the instruments; for his live show, which will come to Terminal 5 in Manhattan for four nights starting Thursday, he uses a band.) He lays down simplistic but steady disco drumming, beautifully squelchy old synthesizer tones and a junkier version of the guitar-scratching perfected by James Brown's old guitarist, Jimmy Nolen. 
 Another is how, or whether, to be cool at an advanced age. (He's 40.) He has said that this will be his last LCD Soundsystem record, but whereas he used to take an entire song to transmit a hipster's age-consciousness -- ''Losing My Edge,'' his breakthrough from eight years ago -- now he can transmit it in a single phrase. (''Everybody's getting younger,'' he sings in ''Dance Yrself Clean,'' and we know exactly what he means.) This routine has made him a little bigger than his music, and it's become something he could potentially mine for a long time. 
 A lot of the words in and of themselves on ''This Is Happening'' -- yowled, crooned or muttered as if he's making them up on the fly -- aren't very good, except to engage you with the music. You wonder how he could share lyrics so half-baked. And paying that bit of attention brings you into the momentum and the particulars, a dry snare drum curiously low in the mix, overmodulated vocals, and extra elements brought up loudly: synth percussion, high-hat cymbals, conga drums.
 But you can't ignore those words, and the more they come to feel like branding, the more irritating they can be. Mr. Murphy specializes in circuitous or fake deep-thoughts -- ''complicated people never do what you tell them to'' -- or a kind of dopey metalanguage : ''from this position, I can see both of them/from this position, I totally get how the decision was reached.'' Sometimes he writes reveries that start strong but peter out, as if he wanted to rewrite David Bowie's ''Heroes'' but suddenly found something better to do:
 I miss the way the night comes
 With friends who always make it feel good
 This basement has a cold glow
 Though it's better than a bunch of others
 This music sounds fantastic, as usual -- clean, tight and separated in the mix -- but songwriting inspiration is in short supply. The aah-aah vocal chorus in the first track, ''Dance Yrself Clean,'' is not amazing enough to bring back again for the last one, ''Home.'' And the songs in general come from a hugely judicious mid-1970s to mid-'80s record collection: Brian Eno for the disembodied vocals; Mr.Bowie, Ultravox and the British new-romantic bands for the intellectual romance; Kraftwerk, disco and ESG for the beats; post-punk for the atmosphere. 
 And ''Drunk Girls,'' the most rock 'n' roll track on the record, grates in exactly the same way as ''North American Scum'' did on the last album: it's empty provocation with a wink. It isn't a song about drunk girls, really; it appears to be a song about a guy who's had the great idea to write a song called ''Drunk Girls'' but can't convince himself that they're any better or worse than sober girls. There's a laugh in there, but its a very short one. BEN RATLIFF 
 Sleigh Bells
 ''Treats''
 (Mom + Pop Music/NEET)
 Harsh and sweet, dense and airy, flippant and serious, blatant and subtle -- Sleigh Bells works all those polarities, and more, on its all-out blast of a debut album, ''Treats.'' Even after wide Internet exposure of their demos, and brief yet clamorous live sets, the album versions of the songs maintain or increase the impact. The tracks don't just rock -- they detonate. 
 This Brooklyn duo uses a straightforward formula. Derek Miller, below left, wallops the riffs he's assembled with guitars, electronics and drum machines and other gadgets, usually cranked up and maxed out. Alexis Krauss, below right, tops them with vocals that can be blithely melodic or vehemently chanted. She's likely to start or culminate a song without words, whether it's rhythmic heavy breathing or cooing ''ah-ahs.'' 
 A similar approach has worked for M.I.A. (whose label, NEET, released the album) and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs (particularly in Sleigh Bells' ''Infinity Guitars''). But Sleigh Bells sound louder -- as much through distortion as through volume -- and it thinks younger, regularly glancing at adolescent aspirations and romances. 
 ''Tell 'Em'' opens the album with a riff that slams like a crunk drumbeat, blares a guitar hook, throws in dance-club handclaps and a sirenlike synthesizer, then piles on twin guitars for happy overkill, while Ms. Krauss tells ''boys'' and ''girls'' that ''you can do your best today.'' In ''Rill Rill,'' which adds some girl-group chimes to guitar chords sampled from Funkadelic's ''Can You Get to That,'' Ms. Krauss sings, ''Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces.'' 
 There's nuance in the noise. One way Sleigh Bells makes its songs hit so hard is to make the beat start and stop, leaving gaps. In them, Ms. Krauss's voice might hover by itself, or Mr. Miller will reveal one of the small parts within the crashes. His tracks borrow from all over the place: trance-music synthesizer arpeggios in ''Run the Heart,'' rockabilly reverb in ''A/B Machines,'' metal power chords in ''Treats,'' hardcore guitar frenzy in ''Straight A's.'' 
 Mr. Miller has a gift for sonic irritation, like the naggingly repeating, bent guitar note that defines ''Crown on the Ground.'' But merely staying abrasive would be too single-minded for Sleigh Bells. The beat calls for dancing, and there's delight in Ms. Krauss's voice as she sings hooks that could double as pep-rally chants or incitements to a schoolyard insurrection. JON PARELES 
 Band of Horses
 ''Infinite Arms'' 
 (Columbia)
 Green Day took about two decades to make it to Broadway. Band of Horses is on a far quicker path.
 On its first two albums, what Band of Horses lacked in songwriting depth it made up for in texture. For (sometimes) better and (more often) worse, this group has been ambitious with its rural indie rock, playing loose with density and lightness, loud and soft.
 But on ''Infinite Arms,'' its third album, Band of Horses' swipes at majesty have turned lazy. The opening song, ''Factory,'' bolstered with sweeping, mourning strings and brass, comes closest to the group's best work. From there, though, the mood lightens considerably, and disruptively. ''Compliments'' has a faint whisper of country-disco, and much of the rest of the album (''Dilly'' and ''Older'') is redolent of the 1970s soft-rock folkies America. There's none of the dynamic intensity or yelping angst of the best, if overhyped, moments of songs like ''The Funeral'' and ''Our Swords'' from the 2006 Band of Horses' debut album, ''Everything All the Time'' (Sub Pop).
 Instead, the band leans on plain, incredibly legible songs that have little to hide behind; successful in a gestural way, but little more. And the songwriting of the frontman Ben Bridwell, always a little obtuse, has begun to decompose, like sketches drawn from faded memories. At times, as on ''Blue Beard,'' he lands on a stretch of trite imagery: ''The Midwestern sky was gray and cold/the sun never shined but that's all right/I couldn't find letters that you wrote me.'' 
 In several places, he pieces together fragmented scenes, as if with stage directions already in mind. ''The elevator in the hotel lobby has a lazy door,'' he sings at the start of ''Factory.'' And on ''NW Apt.,'' he coos conspiratorially, ''Somebody trapped in an underground basement/just a few blocks down the road.'' Time for a set change. JON CARAMANICA
 THE CLAUDIA QUINTET
 ''Royal Toast''
 (Cuneiform)
 The Claudia Quintet, established a little over a dozen years ago by the drummer and composer John Hollenbeck, turns out music of clockwork intricacy and crisp premeditation. But it's not a fussy enterprise, or given to pondering its own accomplishment. ''Royal Toast'' exudes the same coolly assertive air as each of the band's previous four albums, striking a similar accord between the factions of progressive jazz, classical Minimalism and low-glare experimental rock. 
 By now that balance of styles reflects an established protocol, one slightly less unusual than when the group first started. Jazz and new music and post-rock, or whatever you want to call it, have been steadily encroaching on one another's turf for a while, sharing many of the same resources, even some of the same musicians. (Mr. Hollenbeck, for one, has longstanding ties to the interdisciplinary artist Meredith Monk.) The overlap has a lot to do with textural dynamics, which is what the Claudia Quintet has always been about.
 Well, that and groove, on a cellular level. Along with Mr. Hollenbeck, an inventive and economical drummer, the band involves Chris Speed on tenor saxophone and clarinet, Ted Reichman on accordion, Drew Gress on bass and Matt Moran on vibraphone. ''Royal Toast'' also puts Gary Versace to work on piano and a second accordion: another pair of rhythm instruments in the lineup, and more grist for the harmonic mill. 
 Mr. Hollenbeck composes with an ear for passing tensions, some breezier than others. His band mates, all thoughtful improvisers, fill in the gaps, sometimes literally. ''Royal Toast'' includes brief interstitial tracks by each regular Claudia Quintet member, overdubbed with a version of himself from a separate take: so ''Ted vs. Ted'' has Mr. Reichman doubling an accordion prelude. It leads naturally into ''Armitage Shanks,'' on which he solos over a row of telegraphlike rhythmic stoppages. 
 In several tunes, that one included, a solo gradually melts into a background figure, without any clear threshold. Structure and liberty are both so integrated into the band playbook that they don't assume any kind of opposition. That's more commonplace than it used to be too, though this group still makes it feel special. NATE CHINEN

HEADLINE: Foreign Companies Chafe at China's Restrictive Policies

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Foreign companies doing business in China are increasingly feeling as if the deck is stacked against them. 
 China has filed more than a dozen trade cases to limit imports, imposed a series of ''buy Chinese'' measures and limited exports of some minerals to force multinationals to move factories to China. 
 Foreign executives in China find themselves increasingly at odds with Chinese officials over these measures, which Westerners view as protectionist and intended to give an edge to Chinese companies. Surveys by Western chambers of commerce of executives show growing disenchantment in the last year and a sense that doing business in China, never easy, is growing harder.
 Arriving in Hong Kong on Sunday evening at the start of a nine-day trade mission to China, including stops in Shanghai and Beijing, the American commerce secretary, Gary Locke, said that his agenda for discussions with Chinese officials included Western companies' difficulties in the Chinese market. 
 ''There are some policies of the Chinese government that many countries have raised concerns about, including the United States,'' Mr. Locke said at a press conference at Hong Kong International Airport.
 In January, when the Chinese government overhauled procurement rules to encourage more competition, including from foreign companies, Beijing officials exempted all public works projects, which account for half of government procurement. 
 Contracts involving state secrets or business secrets are reserved for Chinese companies, and Chinese bureaucrats have been given broad latitude to exclude companies with foreign owners even if the company has been set up in China and has all of its operations in the country.
 The trend toward favoring Chinese-owned companies, Chinese and Western executives and economists say, has been driven by a powerful combination of economic nationalism and an evolving blend of capitalism and socialism. 
 Partly state-owned corporations, armed with lobbyists, have gained considerable influence over the state. Many Chinese executives are former party cadre members whose primary concern now is making a profit, not balancing long-term international policy considerations.
 This has many multinational executives deeply worried. They say severe recessions and the near collapse of banking systems in many Western countries a year ago, coupled with China's relatively robust economic performance, have persuaded Chinese policy makers that Western policies of free trade and open markets do not work as well as previously thought, and that new industrial policies are worth trying. 
 ''They say, 'Don't show us broken models; we're looking for a completely different way,' and you see a much greater willingness to experiment with completely untested policies,'' said a senior executive at a multinational who insisted on anonymity for fear of retaliation by Chinese regulators.
 With China already struggling to limit an influx of cash that threatens to push up the value of China's currency against the dollar, the Chinese government has much less incentive these days to welcome foreign investment. 
 As foreign companies step up their complaints, the Chinese government has already begun responding on a few issues.
 In mid-April, the government announced a more open policy toward foreign investment in a few high-tech industries and in some less prosperous regions. It also delayed a plan to give preference in government procurement to products using intellectual property first registered in China. Mr. Locke said that the plan remained a concern.
 Chinese leaders are also becoming worried that China's restrictions on other countries' exports and overseas investments might set an international precedent for limiting China's own overseas expansion. This arises at a time when China has emerged as the world's largest exporter and when Chinese companies are making more international acquisitions. Chinese leaders have gone out of their way in recent days to reassure multinationals.
 ''We will endeavor to create a level playing field for all market players, foreign and Chinese enterprises alike,'' Premier Wen Jiabao said.
 Despite these signs of a softening stance, many barriers remain. 
 China has been a strong critic of anti-dumping cases elsewhere that limit Chinese exports. Yet the Chinese government itself has become quick to accuse other nations of dumping, or selling goods for less than it cost to produce them. China started 19 antidumping cases last year, tying the United States last year as the third-biggest initiator of antidumping cases, according to statistics gathered by international agencies. China and the United States trailed India and Argentina, but each started more antidumping cases than the European Union.
 When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it promised to sign as soon as possible the W.T.O.'s agreement banning discrimination against foreign companies in government procurement. Most industrialized countries have signed the agreement. But China has never actually accepted it, leaving the nation free to adopt ''buy Chinese'' policies that allow government agencies to favor Chinese-owned companies when they award contracts.
 In sectors like green technology, Chinese companies' advantages are clear. State-controlled banks are providing generous loans at near-zero interest rates to Chinese-owned companies that manufacture clean energy equipment like solar panels. And foreign-owned companies that set up wind farms in China have been banned from selling carbon-emissions credits to businesses in Europe, denying these companies millions in revenue even as Chinese-owned companies with wind farms are allowed to sell the credits. 
 Analysts point to a surge of economic nationalism across China, and not just inside government ministries, after China's heady success in the face of the global downturn.
 China's commerce ministry, for instance, had a cool but not especially confrontational initial response last autumn to President Obama's imposition of tariffs on tires. But after a weekend of furious exchanges on Chinese Internet chat rooms and suggestions that the Chinese government was not standing up to the United States, the commerce ministry issued a blistering statement describing its plans to investigate automotive and chicken imports.
 Changes in the way the Communist Party operates have also driven the pro-China measures. Starting with the military in the late 1990s, and gradually expanding to other industries since then, the party has gradually forced its members to choose: they can be military officers or ministry officials, or they can run companies, but they are discouraged from holding government and corporate jobs at the same time.
 This shift has meant that corporate executives, often former government officials or military officers who have turned into capitalists, have more of a stake in maximizing their company's profits. 
 Corporate influence is increasingly apparent. Office buildings near important ministries in Beijing are stuffed with lobbyists. They are usually on the staff of big corporations, as opposed to independent lobbying firms of the sort that populate K Street in Washington.
 Corporate executives in China now speak openly of giving instructions to their lobbyists in Beijing when they do not like a policy. When the commerce ministry started its investigation last autumn of American automotive and chicken exports, the ministry said that it was acting at the request of the industries' rivals in China.
 China has been particularly aggressive in using its position as the world's dominant exporter of some raw materials to force multinationals to move production to China.
 Sergio Iorio, the chief executive of an Italian chemical company, remembers vividly when a weeping Chinese mine owner called him in Genoa two years ago. The Chinese government had imposed a prohibitive export tax that, in a single night, quadrupled the price of yellow phosphorus, a crucial raw material for more than 2,000 phosphorus-based chemicals.
 ''I was seated, or I would have fallen down,'' Mr. Iorio recalled. 
 But Beijing officials provided a loophole: if Mr. Iorio's company, Italmatch Chemicals, manufactured its chemicals in China, they could be exported without the tax. 
 China has gradually lowered the export tax on yellow phosphorus since then. But Italmatch and other chemical companies are still responding by rushing to expand production in China.
 ''We don't know if and when this can happen again,'' Mr. Iorio said.

HEADLINE: IN FIRST SUCCESS, A TUBE CAPTURES SOME LEAKING OIL

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Henry Fountain contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- After more than three weeks of efforts to stop a gushing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, BP engineers achieved some success on Sunday when they used a milelong pipe to capture some of the oil and divert it to a drill ship on the surface some 5,000 feet above the wellhead, company officials said.
 After two false starts, engineers successfully inserted a narrow tube into the damaged pipe from which most of the oil is leaking. 
 ''It's working as planned,'' Kent Wells, a senior executive vice president of BP, said at a briefing in Houston on Sunday afternoon. ''So we do have oil and gas coming to the ship now, we do have a flare burning off the gas, and we have the oil that's coming to the ship going to our surge tank.''
 Mr. Wells said he could not yet say how much oil had been captured or what percentage of the oil leaking from a 21-inch riser pipe was now flowing into the 4-inch-wide insertion tube. ''We want to slowly optimize it to try to capture as much of the oil and gas as we can without taking in a large amount of seawater,'' he said.
 So far, the spill has not spoiled beaches or delicate wetlands, in part because of favorable winds and tides and in part because of the use of booms to corral the oil and chemical dispersants. 
 The capture operation on Sunday was the first successful effort to stem the flow from the damaged well, which has been spewing oil since a rig exploded on April 20 and sank.
 The announcement by BP came on the heels of reports that the spill might be might much worse than estimated. Scientists said they had found giant plumes of oil in the deep waters of the gulf, including one as large as 10 miles long, 3 miles wide and 300 feet thick.
 BP officials pointed out that even if the tube was successful, it was only a stopgap measure. The real goal, they said, is to seal the well permanently. 
 Preparations continued on Sunday on a plan to pump heavy drilling mud into the well through the blowout preventer, the safety device at the wellhead that failed during the accident. 
 In the procedure, called a top kill, the mud would be used to overcome the pressure of the rising oil, stopping the flow. The mud would be followed by cement, which would permanently seal the well. 
 Mr. Wells said Sunday that BP was a week to 10 days away from trying the maneuver.
 The mud would be pumped from a drill ship, the Q4000, that is in place on the surface. Mr. Wells said the ship had more than 2 million gallons of mud on board -- far more than needed -- to pump into the well, which had reached about 13,000 feet below the seabed when the accident occurred. 
 In a brief interview, Mr. Wells said that a ''junk shot,'' an effort to clog the blowout preventer with golf balls and other objects before the mud is used, was still a possibility.
 But in an apparent indication of the tube's success, BP was already building a backup version. 
 The tube is basically a five-foot-long section of pipe outfitted with rubber seals designed to keep out seawater, attached in turn to a milelong section of pipe leading from the drill ship to the seafloor.
 It was one of several proposed methods of stanching the flow of at least 210,000 gallons of oil a day that has been threatening marine life and sensitive coastal areas in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. BP officials have emphasized that none of the methods have been tried before at the depth of this leak. 
 At the briefing, Mr. Wells was asked about reports from a research vessel that discovered the huge plumes of oil. He said that he did not know anything about them, but that the Unified Area Command, the cooperative effort involving BP and state and local agencies, was seeking more information. 
 The plume reports added to the many questions that have been raised about the amount of leaking oil, which many scientists have said is far higher than the official estimate of 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gallons, a day. That estimate was reached using satellite imagery, flyovers and visual observation, company officials have said. 
 The reports also raised concerns about the use of oil dispersants underwater, which the Environmental Protection Agency approved on Friday after several tests. Normally, dispersants are used on the surface, and scientists have said that the effects of using them underwater are largely unknown.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, criticized BP, saying it had failed to respond substantively to his requests for more information about how it had reached its estimate of how much oil is leaking. He also said the company had refused to engage independent scientists who might offer a better assessment of the amount. 
 ''BP is burying its head in the sand on these underwater threats,'' Mr. Markey said in a written statement on Sunday. ''These huge plumes of oil are like hidden mushroom clouds that indicate a larger spill than originally thought and portend more dangerous long-term fallout for the Gulf of Mexico's wildlife and economy.''
 BP began trying to insert the tube on Friday, but an effort to connect the pipe leading from the drill ship to the tube failed and the device had to be brought back to the surface for adjustments. 
 ''This is all part of reinventing technology,'' Tom Mueller, a BP spokesman, said on Saturday. ''It's not what I'd call a problem -- it's what I'd call learning, reconfiguring, doing it again.'' 
 Around midnight Saturday, the tube was reinserted and worked for about four hours before it was dislodged after being mishandled by the submersibles, Mr. Wells said.
 ''At that time, we were just starting to get oil to the surface,'' Mr. Wells said.
 The oil was going to the Discoverer Enterprise, a drill ship, which has equipment for separating water from oil and can hold about 5 million gallons of oil. 
 Though that attempt failed, it was important because it demonstrated that features designed to keep hydrates from forming were working, Mr. Wells said. Hydrates, icelike structures of methane and water molecules that form in the presence of seawater at low temperatures and high pressures, forced BP to abandon an earlier effort to corral the leak with a 98-ton containment dome.

HEADLINE: Going To Extreme

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Utah Republicans have denied Robert Bennett, a very conservative three-term senator, a place on the ballot, because he's not conservative enough. In Maine, party activists have pushed through a platform calling for, among other things, abolishing both the Federal Reserve and the Department of Education. And it's becoming ever more apparent that real power within the G.O.P. rests with the ranting talk-show hosts.
 News organizations have taken notice: suddenly, the takeover of the Republican Party by right-wing extremists has become a story (although many reporters seem determined to pretend that something equivalent is happening to the Democrats. It isn't.) But why is this happening? And in particular, why is it happening now? 
 The right's answer, of course, is that it's about outrage over President Obama's ''socialist'' policies -- like his health care plan, which is, um, more or less identical to the plan Mitt Romney enacted in Massachusetts. Many on the left argue, instead, that it's about race, the shock of having a black man in the White House -- and there's surely something to that. 
 But I'd like to offer two alternative hypotheses: First, Republican extremism was there all along -- what's changed is the willingness of the news media to acknowledge it. Second, to the extent that the power of the party's extremists really is on the rise, it's the economy, stupid.
 On the first point: when I read reports by journalists who are shocked, shocked at the craziness of Maine's Republicans, I wonder where they've been these past eight or so electoral cycles. For the truth is that the hard right has dominated the G.O.P. for many years. Indeed, the new Maine platform is if anything a bit milder than the Texas Republican platform of 2000, which called not just for eliminating the Federal Reserve but also for returning to the gold standard, for killing not just the Department of Education but also the Environmental Protection Agency, and more. 
 Somehow, though, the radicalism of Texas Republicans wasn't a story in 2000, an election year in which George W. Bush of Texas, soon to become president, was widely portrayed as a moderate.
 Or consider those talk-show hosts. Rush Limbaugh hasn't changed: his recent suggestion that environmentalist terrorists might have caused the ecological disaster in the gulf is no worse than his repeated insinuations that Hillary Clinton might have been a party to murder. What's changed is his respectability: news organizations are no longer as eager to downplay Mr. Limbaugh's extremism as they were in 2002, when The Washington Post's media critic insisted that the radio host's critics were the ones who had ''lost a couple of screws,'' that he was a sensible ''mainstream conservative'' who talks ''mainly about policy.''
 So why has the reporting shifted? Maybe it was just deference to power: as long as America was widely perceived as being on the way to a permanent Republican majority, few were willing to call right-wing extremism by its proper name. Maybe it took a Democrat in the White House to give some observers the courage to say the obvious.
 To be fair, however, it's not all a matter of perception. Right-wing extremism may be the same as it ever was, but it clearly has more adherents now than it did a couple of years ago. Why? It may have a lot to do with a troubled economy. 
 True, that's not how it was supposed to work. When the economy plunged into crisis, many observers -- myself included -- expected a political shift to the left. After all, the crisis made nonsense of the right's markets-know-best, regulation-is-always-bad dogma. In retrospect, however, this was naive: voters tend to react with their guts, not in response to analytical arguments -- and in bad times, the gut reaction of many voters is to move right.
 That's the message of a recent paper by the economists Markus Bruckner and Hans Peter Gruner, who find a striking correlation between economic performance and political extremism in advanced nations: in both America and Europe, periods of low economic growth tend to be associated with a rising vote for right-wing and nationalist political parties. The rise of the Tea Party, in other words, was exactly what we should have expected in the wake of the economic crisis. 
 So where does our political system go from here? Over the near term, a lot will depend on economic recovery. If the economy continues to add jobs, we can expect some of the air to go out of the Tea Party movement. 
 But don't expect extremists to lose their grip on the G.O.P. anytime soon. What we're seeing in places like Utah and Maine isn't really a change in the party's character: it has been dominated by extremists for a long time. The only thing that's different now is that the rest of the country has finally noticed.

HEADLINE: The Great Consolidation

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
This feels like a populist moment. Americans are Tea Partying. Greeks are rioting. Incumbents are being thrown out; the Federal Reserve is facing an audit; Goldman Sachs is facing prosecution. In Kentucky, Ron Paul's son might be about to win a Republican Senate primary.
 But look through these anti-establishment theatrics to the deep structures of political and economic power, and suddenly the surge of populism feels like so much sound and fury, obscuring the real story of our time. From Washington to Athens, the economic crisis is producing consolidation rather than revolution, the entrenchment of authority rather than its diffusion, and the concentration of power in the hands of the same elite that presided over the disasters in the first place. 
 Consider the European situation. For a week after Greece's fiscal meltdown began, all the talk was about the weakness of the European Union, the folly of its too-rapid expansion, and the failure of the Continent's governing class to anticipate the crisis. 
 But then the E.U. acted, bailing out Greece to the tune of nearly a trillion dollars, and dictating economic terms to Athens that resemble ''the kind of thing a surrendering field marshal signs in a railway car in the forest at the end of a bloody war,'' in the words of the Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum. If the bailout succeeds, the E.U.'s authority over its member states will be dramatically enhanced -- and a crisis created by hasty, elite-driven integration will have led, inexorably, to further integration and a more powerful elite.
 This trajectory should be familiar to Americans. The panic of 2008 happened, in part, because the public interest had become too intertwined with private interests for the latter to be allowed to fail. But everything we did to halt the panic, and all the legislation we've passed, has only strengthened the symbiosis. 
 From the Troubled Asset Relief Program to the stimulus bill, from the auto bailout to health care reform, we've created a vast new array of public-private partnerships -- empowering insiders at the expense of outsiders, large institutions at the expense of small ones, and Washington at the expense of state and local governments. Eighteen months after the financial crisis, the interests of our financiers, C.E.O.'s, bureaucrats and politicians are yoked together as never before.
 A similar, quieter consolidation has taken place in the realm of national security. After campaigning against the Bush administration's foreign-policy overreach, President Obama has retained nearly all of the war powers that George Bush took up in the wake of 9/11. 
 Yes, some of the previous administration's more sweeping claims have been repudiated. But the basic post-9/11 architecture of executive power -- expansive powers to detain, interrogate and assassinate, claimed for the duration of an open-ended war -- looks destined to endure for presidencies to come. 
 Taken case by case, many of these policy choices are perfectly defensible. Taken as a whole, they suggest a system that only knows how to move in one direction. If consolidation creates a crisis, the answer is further consolidation. If economic centralization has unintended consequences, then you need political centralization to clean up the mess. If a government conspicuously fails to prevent a terrorist attack or a real estate bubble, then obviously it needs to be given more powers to prevent the next one, or the one after that. 
 The C.I.A. and F.B.I. didn't stop 9/11, so now we have the Department of Homeland Security. Decades of government subsidies for homebuyers helped create the housing crash, so now the government is subsidizing the auto industry, the green-energy industry, the health care sector ...
 The pattern applies to personnel as well as policy. If Robert Rubin's mistakes helped create an out-of-control financial sector, then naturally you need Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers -- Rubin's proteges -- to set things right. After all, who else are you going to trust with all that consolidated power? Ron Paul? Dennis Kucinich? Sarah Palin?
 This is the perverse logic of meritocracy. Once a system grows sufficiently complex, it doesn't matter how badly our best and brightest foul things up. Every crisis increases their authority, because they seem to be the only ones who understand the system well enough to fix it.
 But their fixes tend to make the system even more complex and centralized, and more vulnerable to the next national-security surprise, the next natural disaster, the next economic crisis. Which is why, despite all the populist backlash and all the promises from Washington, this isn't the end of the ''too big to fail'' era. It's the beginning.

HEADLINE: Mr. Gates and the Pentagon Budget

 BODY:
There has been a feeding frenzy at the Pentagon budget trough since the 9/11 attacks. Pretty much anything the military chiefs and industry lobbyists pitched, Congress approved -- no matter the cost and no matter if the weapons or programs were over budget, underperforming or no longer needed in a post-cold-war world. 
 Annual defense spending has nearly doubled in the last decade to $549 billion. That does not include the cost of the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, which this year will add $159 billion. 
 Defense Secretary Robert Gates has now vowed to do things differently. In two recent speeches, he declared that the nation cannot keep spending at this rate and that the defense budget ''gusher'' has been ''turned off and will stay off for a good period of time.'' He vowed that going forward all current programs and future spending requests will receive ''unsparing'' scrutiny. 
 Mr. Gates isn't proposing cutting his budget. He's talking about 2 percent to 3 percent real growth after inflation, compared with 4 percent a year in 2000 to 2009. Given the nation's dire financial state, it's still a lot. 
 The Obama administration has already chopped some big-ticket, anachronistic weapons. (It stood up to the lobbyists and Congressional boosters to kill the F-22 fighter jet.) There has been more investment in needed new weapons, most notably unmanned drones. The Quadrennial Defense Review talked sternly about the need for ''future trade-offs,'' although it failed to start making the hard choices. 
 Mr. Gates said he wants to trim the bloated civilian and military bureaucracy (including excess admirals and generals) for a modest savings of $10 billion to $15 billion annually. He wants more cuts in weapons spending, and he deserves credit for naming specific systems. 
 Why should the Navy have 11 aircraft carriers (at $11 billion a copy) for the next 30 years when no other country has more than one, he asked at the Navy League exposition in Maryland. He questioned the need for the Marines' beach-storming Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (vulnerable to advances in anti-ship systems) and $7 billion ballistic missile submarines for the Navy.
 We're sure the irate calls from Capitol Hill and K Street haven't stopped since. It must be noted that Mr. Gates didn't say for sure whether he would slash any of these systems -- or how deeply.
 Perhaps the most politically volatile issue is military health care costs, which rose from $19 billion to $50 billion in a decade. Active-duty military and their families rightly do not pay for health care. But what retirees pay -- $460 annually per family -- has not risen in 15 years. 
 Mr. Gates said that many retirees earn full-time salaries on top of their military retirement pay and could get coverage through their employer. We owe our fighting forces excellent care, but this is a time when everyone must share the burden. 
 Even if Mr. Gates begins to get a real handle on other costs, budget experts warn that exploding personnel costs -- wages, health care, housing, pensions -- will increasingly crowd out financing for new weapons. Once the United States commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down, Washington will have to consider trimming troop strength, beginning with the Navy and Air Force. 
 Mr. Gates is an old Washington hand and we're sure he is going into this fight with his eyes wide open. Still, if there was any doubt about what he's up against, a House Armed Services subcommittee gave him a reminder last week. It added nearly $400 million to the Pentagon's $9.9 billion 2011 request for missile defenses. That included $50 million for an airborne laser that experts agree doesn't work and Mr. Gates largely canceled last year.

HEADLINE: I.B.M.'s Future: Steady Course

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Big Blue laid out its ''Roadmap to 2015'' today at its yearly investors gathering, and Wall Street applauded.
 I.B.M. confidently predicted that it would deliver earnings per share of ''at least $20'' in 2015, or double last year's performance. The company said it intends to generate $100 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, leaving plenty of money for investment. That includes $20 billion in acquisitions, or double the pace of the last five years. 
 The company's shares rose more than 4 percent by midafternoon, up $5.31, to $132.20 a share.
 But didn't five-year plans go out with the collapse of the Eastern bloc economies? And isn't a certain amount of risk and unpredictability in a technology company's financial performance actually a sign that it is betting on innovation? Win some, lose some, after all.
 Not for I.B.M., at least as a whole, analysts say. It has transformed itself so that steady revenues from services contracts and business software licenses make it far less susceptible to the up-and-down swings of the technology industry. And the company, they add, has successfully shifted toward higher-margin software and improved the productivity in its services business, lifting profits further.
 ''With I.B.M., you are investing in stability,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, an independent technology analyst.
 In his remarks to an investor audience in New York, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.'s chief executive, said the company would be investing for future growth in areas like emerging markets abroad and business analytics technology, which helps companies and governments sift through the ever-growing sources of digital data to make better decisions. Cloud computing and I.B.M.'s so-called smarter planet initiative, which applies computing to complex physical systems like traffic management and energy use, are also earmarked for extra investment.
 The $20 billion budget for acquisitions, Mr. Palmisano said, will be focused and measured bets. ''We're not trying to be I.T.T. or G.E. in the information technology space,'' he told his audience. ''So don't think of us that way. All things to all people, all segments. No, no, we have a much more focused play.''
 Later, Mr. Palmisano summed up, ''We transformed I.B.M., and as we go forward it's an extension.'' The company plans to no big new forays. I.B.M., he said, will not ''spend $40 billion buying somebody,'' even though its pockets are deep enough to do so.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Big Risks in China for Equity Players

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
 TPG's latest deal shows why private equity firms bother with China. TPG, the American buyout firm, has been investing in the country for more than 15 years.
 TPG has made 16 times its money on a six-year investment in a Chinese lender, Shenzhen Development Bank. But such victories are hard won.
 Shenzhen Development Bank has been a model investment. TPG bought a 17 percent stake -- and effective control -- for $150 million in 2004. It cut the bank's nonperforming loans from 11 percent of the book to less than 1 percent. 
 TPG then swapped its stake for 4 percent of the insurance company Ping An, half of which it has now sold. The cash and remaining shares produce a paper profit of $2.4 billion. That implies an annualized internal rate of return of nearly 60 percent, much higher than the 15 percent goal of most buyout funds in the West.
 Yet with profit comes complexity. TPG agreed to sell out of Shenzhen Development Bank last June, but regulators took almost a year to approve the deal.
 And in accepting shares rather than cash, TPG exposed its investors to a lot of market risk. The buyout firm had a choice, but it might have upset regulators if it had demanded cash at a time when China's economy still looked wobbly.
 Meanwhile, for every tale of success there are two of anguish. Consider Bain Capital. This week, that firm's directors at the electrical appliance retailer Gome were voted off the board by a recalcitrant founder.
 Or take Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both embroiled in the messy windup of the yogurt maker Taizinai. TPG itself reportedly clashed with the former chief of Nissin, a Chinese leasing company in which it had invested, in 2008.
 China remains attractive to buyout shops, because when returns are good, they are very good. Carlyle, for example, recently closed a $2.3 billion fund, having realized a five-times paper profit on its investment in insurer China Pacific.
 But in few countries do buyout firms have to work so hard to earn their fee.
 Reforming Ratings
 Like Stuart Smalley, the character that Al Franken created on ''Saturday Night Live,'' an amendment pertaining to ratings agencies that Senator Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, sponsored last week has many fans. Yet lawmakers shouldn't take Mr. Franken's addition to financial overhaul legislation too seriously. It would embed the government more deeply in ratings. Happily, the proposal from Senator George LeMieux, Republican of Florida, which would do the opposite, is popular, too.
 Mr. Franken's amendment aims squarely at a too-cozy relationship between the rating agencies and bank sponsors of complicated structured securities. It would create an independent government-appointed panel to match rating companies with deals. The worthwhile objective is to stop the bankers from shopping around for the company that would provide the most favorable ratings.
 The problem is that the plan would also cement the notion of government-sanctioned ratings, which was the very crutch investors leaned on when they poured into risky mortgage-backed securities that the agencies had deemed highly unlikely to default.
 The three biggest agencies -- Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and to a lesser extent Fitch Ratings -- have benefited from being designated as ''nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.'' That has their ratings codified as benchmarks of investment riskiness in federal statutes, which, in turn, has encouraged investors to rely on those ratings agencies when they should have done their own thinking.
 Mr. LeMieux's amendment, by contrast, sensibly seeks to get ratings out of federal law altogether. That would encourage investors to do their own homework when buying a corporate bond, a mortgage-backed security or even Greek government debt. They would have no easy, government-sanctioned fallback to rely on.
 Take away the government's blessing, and dominant rating agencies like Moody's and S.& P. would lose some competitive advantage. Issuers would have to persuade investors, not just rating companies, of the merits of the securities they were offering. Over time, this would diminish the significance of the conflict singled out in Mr. Franken's amendment -- without adding a bureaucratic nightmare -- in addition to requiring better due diligence by investors. That's a far better outcome.
 Both proposals are part of the Senate's package of changes, though they seem contradictory. The LeMieux bill conveniently dovetails with a similar provision in the House version of the legislation. With luck, that means Mr. LeMieux's plan, not Mr. Franken's, will have the final word.

HEADLINE: Auto Dealers Campaign To Fend Off Regulation

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After nearly a quarter-century of selling pickup trucks and cars in North Dakota, Donovan Berscht had to shut one of his dealerships last year as Chrysler downsized. Now he is worried that a second financial jolt -- this time the push for toughened economic oversight in Washington -- could batter his remaining Chevrolet-Buick dealership. 
 If President Obama has his way, loans at auto dealers would be put under the purview of a new federal consumer protection authority to guard against fraud and abuse. The prospect of increased regulations, Mr. Berscht said, ''could force us out of the financing business,'' and it has him so concerned that he traveled to Washington last month to ask Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat and one of his senators, for quick relief. 
 The financial reforms being debated in the Senate have prompted resistance from a variety of businesses, but perhaps nowhere more intensely than in the already beleaguered auto industry, where dealers find themselves pitted against Mr. Obama in their aggressive campaign to exempt themselves from the new rules. 
 For some 18,000 auto dealers in the United States, who historically have made up a potent political force, the debate presents a critical test of their continued influence in Washington, as they push lawmakers to help them hold on to revenue. 
 Through their lobbying arm, the National Automobile Dealers Association, the dealers have hired a crisis communication team, taken out full-page newspaper advertisements, and organized trips to Washington for dealers like Mr. Berscht to buttonhole lawmakers and make their case. 
 Their basic message, like those of many other industries threatened by tighter regulation, is that they did not cause the financial crisis, and they should not be penalized for it through a burdensome and costly new regulatory structure. 
 A vote on the proposed exemption for the auto dealers could come this week on the Senate floor, with neither side predicting victory. 
 For Mr. Obama, the issue is his latest attempt to push through broad legislative changes in Congress partly by singling out powerful players in the private sector. 
 In his successful campaign for a health care overhaul this year, Mr. Obama went after the nation's major insurance carriers repeatedly as a symbol of why the health system needed to be fixed. 
 To try to restructure the country's federal student loan program, Mr. Obama portrayed big providers of student loans like Sallie Mae as profiting from a ''sweetheart deal'' at the expense of struggling students. As in the health care overhaul, he won that debate in Congress, too. 
 And from the start of the current push for toughened financial regulations, he has cast the fight as an attempt to rein in the big banks on Wall Street, whose ''reckless practices'' he blames in large part for the economic downturn. 
 Last week, as the debate over financial regulation neared an end in the Senate, Mr. Obama identified a new target in a formal statement: the ''auto dealer-lenders'' seeking a ''special loophole'' in the legislation through an amendment pushed by Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. 
 ''This amendment would carve out a special exemption for these lenders that would allow them to inflate rates, insert hidden fees into the fine print of paperwork, and include expensive add-ons that catch purchasers by surprise,'' Mr. Obama said. The proposal, he warned, ''guts'' the bill and encourages ''misleading sales tactics.''
 The administration also linked the auto dealers exemption to the exploitation of military personnel. Officials released a Pentagon letter saying that many service members, according to an informal military survey, had fallen victim to ''bait and switch'' tactics and other predatory practices that left them with loans they struggled to pay. 
 Mr. Obama's condemnation of unfair auto loans was the first time he has weighed in with a formal White House statement on a specific amendment of the sweeping financial regulation, and it caught many dealers and industry executives off guard. 
 Some dealers brand the White House's account of auto loan irregularities as ''pure fiction,'' saying it mischaracterizes the process by which dealers facilitate or package auto loan requests for lending companies. Moreover, they say Mr. Obama has unfairly vilified their industry. 
 ''The way the White House is portraying us as evil, it's just wrong,'' said Michelle Primm, the general manager of a family-run import dealership, Cascade Auto Group, about 35 miles south of Cleveland. 
 Ms. Primm made two trips to Washington last month to speak with both of her senators and Congressional staff members about the potential harm from the auto loan provision. 
 She and other dealers say they are already heavily regulated, mainly at the state level, through regulations that prohibit the loan abuses cited by Mr. Obama. They said the new federal regulations would only add costs to the way they arrange loans to buyers for big lending companies like GMAC. 
 But the administration maintains that the new rules are needed. 
 An administration official said on Sunday that dealers played a critical and profitable role in arranging the loan rates for many auto buyers, often at a higher rate than they qualified for. The White House also cited industry data showing that dealers made 52 percent of their profits in 2008 from financing and insurance, more than they made on the actual car sales. 
 The outcome may hinge more on influence than dueling data. On that front, the auto dealers have already proven formidable. 
 The auto dealers' association spent $3 million last year on federal lobbying as part of a broader effort by the auto industry as a whole. Auto dealers, their employees and political action committees made political contributions of more than $9.3 million in the 2008 election cycle, most of it to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group. 
 Perhaps more important than the auto dealers' money is their deep presence in local communities, which can have a powerful impact on the lawmakers whose communities they represent, political analysts and lawmakers said. 
 Brian Hart, a spokesman for Mr. Brownback, said the dealers' strong community ties had given them in-person access to many politicians to plead their case. 
 ''Every member was very receptive to talking to their local dealers,'' he said, ''because they're truly Main Street. People drive by them every day and know who they are.''
 The auto dealers already demonstrated their political muscle on the issue in October, when the House passed its version of the financial overhaul but exempted the dealers from the consumer protection provisions. The exemption was pushed by Representative John Campbell, a California Republican who is a former car dealer, and it came over the objections of Democratic leaders. 
 Mr. Berscht, the North Dakota dealer, is hoping for a quick resolution.
 ''I'm not a political guru by any means,'' he said, ''but there's a real urgency to get this amendment in there on this major bill and to provide some relief for the auto dealers.''

HEADLINE: In the Middle in Arkansas, And Hit From Both Sides

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
MAGNOLIA, Ark. -- Time was, being a moderate Democrat in Arkansas was a safe bet. After all, this is the state that produced Bill Clinton, master of the midstream. 
 But Senator Blanche Lincoln is discovering that, with the overheated political passions battering incumbents this year, being in the middle only gets you hit from both sides. 
 Republicans and conservative Democrats have excoriated Mrs. Lincoln for supporting President Obama's health care overhaul, which is often portrayed around here as a socialist plot. Meanwhile, liberal Democrats have hammered her for opposing a government-run insurance option, cap-and-trade climate legislation and a law that would have made it easier for workers to unionize. 
 ''It's damned if you do, damned if you don't,'' she said Saturday evening before threading her way through potential voters at the annual World Champion Steak Cook-Off in Magnolia, deep in southwestern Arkansas. ''We are an immediate-gratification society. People want these problems solved immediately, but they also don't want to move too fast.''
 Mrs. Lincoln argues that her middle-of-the-road stances are proof that she is not afraid to stand up to special interests. On the trail, she notes that she has introduced a bill to limit banks' ability to profit from derivatives, an idea Wall Street hates. 
 It may be a measure of the electorate's angry mood that the Democratic Senate candidate who got the biggest cheer from the steak lovers assembled amid a charcoal haze to worship charred red meat was D. C. Morrison, a former cotton farmer who wants to repeal the new health care law, seal the southern border and abolish income taxes in favor of a consumption tax. ''I think there's just a general distrust of Washington,'' Mr. Morrison explained with a touch of down-home understatement. 
 The closing campaign argument of Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, Mrs. Lincoln's strongest opponent, is largely that the rage toward Congress dooms her chances in the fall. On Sunday, he told a Pulaski County Democratic Committee forum in Little Rock, ''I clearly have a better shot.''
 Mr. Halter, casting himself as a populist, portrays Mrs. Lincoln as a captive of special interests in Washington. In Little Rock, he said Congress was dominated by campaign donations from special interests like the Wall Street bankers, who were bailed out last year while working-class people were laid off. ''That's what we are campaigning against, is this culture of Washington that is essentially broken, not representing middle-class Arkansas families,'' he said.
 Mrs. Lincoln appeared before the same group a half hour later, stressing her independence from banks and labor unions and focusing intently on jobs. She cited her success in persuading the government to increase timber sales in the state and put more lumberjacks to work.
 Mrs. Lincoln has also often reminded voters that she has achieved an influential post as the chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee in a state where farms drive a quarter of the economy. Mr. Halter has shot back with new advertisements using snippets of Mrs. Lincoln's comments at a debate on Friday to suggest that she supports cutting Medicare and Social Security, as well as providing a tax cut for the wealthy.
 Polls show Mrs. Lincoln is likely to win a plurality on Tuesday, but if she gets under 50 percent and is forced into an expensive runoff, she will be seen as a badly wounded incumbent. 
 Republicans smell blood in the water. The leading Republican candidate in Tuesday's primary is Representative John Boozman, a conservative who is running against the health care overhaul and the stimulus bill. ''We cannot borrow and tax our way into prosperity,'' he said at the cook-off. 
 Polls show Mr. Boozman easily beating any of the Democrats if the election were today, prompting an Arkansas News columnist, John Brummett, who supports Mr. Halter, to write of the primary, ''All we're doing here is picking someone to get beat in November.'' 
 Some political strategists say such predictions are premature. The state has only had one Republican senator since reconstruction, and it is hard to count out a savvy Democrat. 
 ''The Senate is up for grabs -- it's so volatile and fluid,'' remarked Gov. Mike Beebe, a popular Democrat also up for election. ''Both sides are mad. The left of the Democratic Party's upset with her. The right's upset with her. It's one of those tragic convergences.''

HEADLINE: Regulating Banks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''They Have to Do Better'' (editorial, May 11) points out that another financial catastrophe can be prevented only with tough regulatory reform that includes the power of the 50 states to adopt and enforce consumer protections against national banks. The point is more insightful than most realize. 
 The housing crisis continues to displace families, and set off the financial crisis, but it did not have to be so catastrophic. States like New York passed laws to protect borrowers well ahead of the subprime explosion, but those laws were nullified by overly aggressive federal regulators who claimed the power to pre-empt legislatures across the country from protecting their citizens against national banks.
 These banks continue to argue that multiple state consumer protection laws would be too burdensome on their multistate operations. This is myth, not fact. National banks routinely deal with different state laws in all aspects of their business -- in contract enforcement, zoning and the foreclosure process, to name a few. Only when it comes to protecting consumers are they suddenly incapable of complying with more than one law.
 The only pre-emption we need is the kind that pre-empts an appointed federal bank regulator from forcing legislatures across the country to sit on their hands while their citizens are harmed.

 The writer, the superintendent of banks for New York State, is a member of the TARP Congressional oversight panel.

HEADLINE: In Three Turbulent Primaries, Measures of Voter Discontent

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
FLORENCE, Ky. -- Rand Paul grabbed a microphone, climbed onto a short brick wall and told a gathering crowd of supporters to brace for an Election Day uprising on Tuesday.
 ''There's a Tea Party tidal wave coming. It's already hit Utah and it's coming to Kentucky,'' Mr. Paul said, delivering a confident pep talk here in the closing hours of the Republican primary for a United States Senate seat. ''The day of reckoning is coming. We cannot elect the same old politicians without getting the same old mess.''
 If his confidence is borne out by victory, it would mark one of the most important moments yet for the Tea Party, the anti-Washington, anti-big government movement that was partially inspired by the quixotic 2008 presidential race of his father, Representative Ron Paul of Texas. 
 Establishment Republicans -- including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, former Vice President Dick Cheney and the Chamber of Commerce -- have united in opposition to Mr. Paul, but optimism was diminishing that their candidate, Trey Grayson, could prevail.
 The discontent among voters has not discriminated by party in this turbulent political year. In Pennsylvania and Arkansas on Sunday, Democratic Senators Arlen Specter and Blanche Lincoln waged last-minute fights ahead of potentially career-ending primaries for each of them on Tuesday, hoping the value of seniority would counter powerful anti-incumbent challenges.
 The outcome in these three states will provide lessons that will help frame the debate for the remaining six months of the midterm election season, with Democrats fighting to hold their control of the House and Senate.
 Both parties will study the results for evidence of the Tea Party movement's ability to translate passion into votes. They will gauge the degree to which President Obama, who is backing Mr. Specter and Mrs. Lincoln, is a political liability or benefit to his party. And they will look to see what messages, if any, assuage voter anger and anxiety as politics hurtles toward the fall, the economy still in the shadow of the recession.
 Here in Kentucky, where the Republican Senate race has become a central front among Tea Party activists, Mr. Paul and Mr. Grayson are running to succeed Senator Jim Bunning, who is retiring. Mr. Grayson, the secretary of state, has never served in Washington, but his association with Mr. McConnell has made him a lightning rod in this anything-but-Washington year.
 ''On my side, I'm viewed as this proxy for McConnell. If I win or lose, it's a big victory or loss for him,'' Mr. Grayson said in an interview on Saturday at a Republican breakfast. ''I think that's an exaggeration.''
 The candidates have been deeply critical of the president's policies, particularly government bailouts of banks and auto companies and his willingness to tolerate a higher federal budget deficit. But in his final appeal to voters, Mr. Grayson returned the conversation to Kentucky issues, reprising criticism that Mr. Paul made several years ago about coal, a key industry here. Mr. Paul, in his final push, stressed dire warnings about the nation's fiscal condition.
 For more than an hour, Mr. Grayson held a pair of tongs and handed out biscuits as people passed through the buffet line at a Masonic lodge in the southern Kentucky town of Nancy. He had about 10 seconds to ask people for their vote, the time it took to break apart a biscuit and ladle on a serving of sausage gravy. 
 For all of the excitement generated outside Kentucky by this race -- Mr. Paul proudly reminded audiences that they were part of a ''national movement'' -- voter turnout here remains an uncertainty in a state with a closed primary. Election rules say that voters who did not register as Republican by Dec. 31, 2009, cannot vote in the Paul-Grayson primary on Tuesday.
 This is one of the few worries that are openly expressed by an otherwise confident Mr. Paul and his supporters, including libertarians and independents, whose ranks have grown considerably over the last five months as more voters have tuned in.
 ''Some people are going to be disappointed when they go to vote and they won't be able to vote for Rand,'' said Bernie Kunkel, a friend of Mr. Paul's who is coordinating campaign efforts in northern Kentucky.
 Democrats are also selecting their nominee on Tuesday, choosing either Jack Conway, the attorney general, or Daniel Mongiardo, the lieutenant governor. Republicans hold an advantage in the fall election, considering that Senator John McCain carried the state by 57 percent over Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential vote. Yet some party leaders worry that the general election will be more difficult if Mr. Paul is on the ticket.
 ''I think Trey Grayson would be a stronger candidate in November,'' Mr. McConnell said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''But I expect Kentucky is going to be in a pretty Republican mood this fall.''
 Mr. Paul rejects the suggestion that voters would find any of his views outside the mainstream or that he could not handily defeat a Democrat. At a rally outside his headquarters here on Saturday, Mr. Paul told supporters that he would not ''shove them aside and get rid of the Tea Party'' if he wins on Tuesday. But in an interview he acknowledged, ''Even my advisers sometimes will say, 'Oh you have to drop this Tea Party thing a little bit.' ''
 Mr. Paul, who often weaves quotations from Jefferson and other founding fathers into his speeches, said he would not intentionally be ''a fly in the ointment'' if he joined Republicans in the Senate. But he said his election would signal a new direction for the party.
 ''It's nothing new for a party to struggle for its identity,'' Mr. Paul said. ''Every generation has to renew and redefine what their political parties are. And we're in the process of doing that.''

HEADLINE: NATO Is Urged to Define Self-Defense Beyond Its Borders

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin.

 BODY:
PARIS -- NATO must be willing to fight and operate far from its borders to defend its members in a new world of terrorism, piracy and cyberattacks, according to a proposed strategy for the alliance released Monday.
 The proposal, ''NATO 2020,'' also urges the alliance to restore credibility to its pledge of collective security, which it said was a prerequisite for efforts farther afield. 
 ''NATO must be versatile and efficient enough to operate far from home,'' former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who led a team of experts in writing the report, said at a news conference in Brussels. ''In order to sustain the political will for operations outside its area, NATO must see that all its members are reassured about the security of their home territories.'' 
 One of the main purposes of the new strategy, NATO officials said, is to recommit the alliance to its core mission of collective self-defense, known as Article 5 of its original charter.
 But the report also says that the alliance must not fail in its current battle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, which NATO forces entered in collective defense of the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 ''In today's world we may have to go beyond our borders to defend our borders,'' said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the alliance's secretary general. ''I can mention Afghanistan as a case in point.''
 Already this year, 200 NATO soldiers have died in Afghanistan, according to the Web site iCasualties.org, which tracks military fatalities, compared with 119 in the same period last year.
 The report, commissioned by NATO, is meant to provide the guidelines for a new strategic concept to replace the one NATO adopted in 1999. Mr. Rasmussen will refine the guidelines and present them to the 28 member governments for comments, with the aim of adopting a new strategy at the organization's summit meeting in Lisbon in November.
 In a post-1999 world of terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the spread of missiles to more aggressive countries and even nonstate actors, like Hezbollah and Hamas, and threats to the security of energy supplies and the Internet, the alliance must reform to remain relevant, the report said. It added, ''Although NATO is busier than it has ever been, its value is less obvious to many than in the past.''
 The report also urges the alliance to improve its ties and security cooperation with Moscow, working together on areas of mutual interest like missile defense, counterterrorism, maritime security and the fight against narcotics. ''NATO should pursue a policy of engagement with Russia, while reassuring all allies that their security and interests will be defended,'' the report said.
 With Iran believed to be working to develop a nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles, partnership with Russia on missile defense makes sense, the report said. ''Missile defense is most effective when it is a joint enterprise, and cooperation between the alliance and its partners, especially Russia, is highly desirable,'' it said.
 The panel urged NATO to maintain a nuclear deterrent ''at the minimum level required by the prevailing security environment,'' rejecting arguments by some European governments that American battlefield nuclear weapons be removed from the continent.
 In a time of tight budgets, the panel said, members should spend more efficiently and do more to buy weapons jointly and to pool resources, like military transport planes. In 2008, only five NATO members met a target of spending a minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense; one of them, Greece, is in deep difficulty over its debts.
 The report also suggests that the alliance be ready to intervene in humanitarian disasters, in cases of genocide, large-scale violations of human rights and the chaos of failed states.
 A separate report, published this month by the Center for European Reform in London, says NATO needs to address the security concerns of newer members in central and eastern Europe. 
 As a gesture of nonaggression aimed at Russia, the alliance has done little planning on how it might defend newer member states like Poland and the Baltic countries from a Russian attack, whether military, naval or through the Internet. Some eastern European officials fear a Georgia-like local or regional conflict, where existing antagonisms could be manipulated.
 ''Some of the allies worry that NATO would not be able to come to their defense in a crisis,'' said Tomas Valasek, one of the authors of the London report, who also was a civilian adviser to Ms. Albright's group.
 ''If they feel secure at home,'' the report says, ''they will have less need to invest in equipment needed for self-defense and have more reasons to buy the hardware needed for far-off missions such as Afghanistan.'' And fewer reasons, the report says, to fear Russia and oppose a new NATO relationship with Moscow.

HEADLINE: Children Of The '70s

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Today you can walk around the Upper West Side of Manhattan in such ease and safety that you could get the impression it was always this way. But it wasn't.
 On July 5, 1961, a gigantic brawl broke out on 84th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues. Two policemen, caught in the middle, fired warning shots into the air to stop the fighting, but a mob of 400 engulfed them. Traffic was halted on Columbus as bottles rained down from tenement houses, lye was thrown into one man's face and knives flashed out.
 That section of 84th Street in those days was one of the most dangerous blocks in the city. The Times described it as ''a block of decaying tenements packed with poor Puerto Rican and Negro families and the gathering place of drunks, narcotics addicts and sexual perverts.'' A local minister, James Gusweller, said there were five or six stabbings every Saturday night. 
 The violence built and built. Through the '60s and '70s, crime surged. John Podhoretz captures the atmosphere of that time in a wonderful essay called ''Life in New York, Then and Now'' in the current issue of Commentary. He describes the Upper West Side of his youth as a unique small town, an integrated mixture of professors and psychoanalysts, teachers and social workers, workers and the unemployed.
 It was wonderful in some ways, but people in all classes lived in fear. ''Mugging was nothing unusual. Everybody got mugged,'' Podhoretz writes. A serial killer nicknamed Charlie Chop-Off menaced the Upper West Side, emasculating little boys and then killing them, and such was the general disorder that his crimes were barely mentioned in the city's newspapers.
 The city tried ''slum clearance'' to reduce the mayhem. Brownstones were torn down; 709 households were removed from 84th Street alone. More than 6,000 households were removed from the area between 87th and 97th Streets.
 Crime did not abate. Passivity set in, the sense that nothing could be done. The novel ''Mr. Sammler's Planet'' by Saul Bellow captured some of the dispirited atmosphere of that era -- the sense that New York City was a place with no-go zones, a place where one hunkered down.
 Things are different now, of course. By 1990, 5,641 felonies were committed in New York City's 24th Precinct, according to Podhoretz. Last year, only 987 were.
 But some of the psychological effects remain.
 We're familiar with talk about how Vietnam permanently shaped the baby boomers. But if you grew up in or near an American city in the 1970s, you grew up with crime (and divorce), and this disorder was bound to leave a permanent mark. It was bound to shape the people, now in their 40s and early-50s, reaching the pinnacles of power.
 It has clearly influenced parenting. The people who grew up afraid to go in parks at night now supervise their own children with fanatical attention, even though crime rates have plummeted. It's as if they're responding to the sense of menace they felt while young, not the actual conditions of today.
 The crime wave killed off the hippie movement. The hippies celebrated disorder, mayhem and the whole Dionysian personal agenda. By the 1970s, the menacing results of that agenda were all around. The crime wave made it hard to think that social problems would be solved strictly by changing the material circumstances. Shiny new public housing blocks replaced rancid old tenements, but in some cases the disorder actually got worse.
 The crime wave made it hard to accept the story line that the poor were always spiritually pure, noble and oppressed.
 The crime wave eroded the sense of solidarity that existed after World War II. The rich isolated themselves. The middle classes moved to the suburbs.
 Yet eventually crime was reduced, and the neighborhoods were restored. It's easy to be nostalgic for the supposedly more authentic New York of days gone by -- for Jane Jacobs's busy Greenwich Village block. But, as Benjamin Schwarz of The Atlantic recently observed, that golden image of New York really only applied to small parts of the city and only during a transition moment when the manufacturing economy of the mid-20th century briefly overlapped with the information economy of the late-20th century.
 As Podhoretz rightly notes, if you grew up in a big city in the '70s, then life is better for you now in about every respect. Today, most liberals and conservatives have more sophisticated views on how to build and preserve civic order than people did then, and there is more of it.
 The Upper West Side is still integrated. And despite all expectations, it's actually more religious now. For example, there are now 4,000 children attending yeshivas, Jewish schools and Jewish nursery schools in the neighborhood.
 The children of the '70s grew up with both unprecedented freedom and disorder, and have learned, in mostly good ways, from both.

HEADLINE: A Very Bright Idea

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
We hear a lot of talk about the importance of educational achievement and the knee-buckling costs of college. What if you could get kids to complete two years of college by the time they finish high school?
 That is happening in New York City. I had breakfast a few weeks ago with Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, to talk about Bard High School Early College, a school on the Lower East Side of Manhattan that gives highly motivated students the opportunity to earn both a high school diploma and a two-year associate of arts degree in the four years that are usually devoted to just high school.
 When these kids sail into college, they are fully prepared to handle the course loads of sophomores or juniors. Essentially, the students complete their high school education by the end of the 10th grade and spend the 11th and 12th grades mastering a rigorous two-year college curriculum. 
 The school, a fascinating collaboration between Bard College and the city's Department of Education, was founded in 2001 as a way of dealing, at least in part, with the systemic failures of the education system. American kids drop out of high school at a rate of one every 26 seconds. And, as Dr. Botstein noted, completion rates at community colleges have been extremely disappointing.
 Many bright and talented youngsters are lost along the way. ''We seldom capture the imagination and energy of young people until somewhere well along in the college years,'' said Dr. Botstein.
 A visit to the school is a glimpse into the realm of the possible. I stopped by on a gloomy, rainy morning, and the building's exterior seemed fully in synch with the weather. But inside you're quickly caught up in what seems almost the ideal academic atmosphere. In class after class, I was struck by how engaged the students were, and how much they reflected the face of the city.
 These were kids who had come to the school (mostly by subway) from every borough and from just about every background imaginable. 
 The first class I visited was a college-level biology course. The students were deep into the process of dissecting fetal pigs. One of the students, who hopes someday to be a doctor, explained to me how essential it was for the students ''to understand the organ systems in mammals.''
 In another class, a fiendishly difficult math problem was being worked out. When the class ended without the problem being brought to a satisfactory conclusion, the students groaned as if a movie had been interrupted at the climactic moment. The instructor assured them that ''we'll pick it up right here'' the next time the class met.
 The Bard High School Early College model has been around long enough and has given a first-rate education to enough students to warrant significant expansion and close study to determine just how far this promising innovation might be able to fly. (A second school, Bard High School Early College Queens, opened in 2008.) 
 Dr. Botstein would like to see 150 such schools created across the country, which would reach roughly 100,000 students.
 President Obama mentioned the Bard school last summer in a speech in which he suggested that more attention should be paid to such ''innovative approaches'' to education. An application for a grant that would help cover a national expansion of the program has been filed with the United States Department of Education.
 When you look at the variety of public schools that have worked well in the U.S. -- in cities big and small, and in suburban and rural areas -- you wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to throw a stultifying blanket of standardization over the education of millions of kids of different aptitudes, interests and levels of maturity. 
 The idea should always have been to develop a flexible system of public education that would allow all -- or nearly all -- children to thrive. One of the things Bard has shown is that kids from wildly different backgrounds -- including large numbers of immigrant children -- can thrive in an educational environment that is much more intellectually demanding than your typical high school.
 In this tough economic period, a program in which students come out of high school with up to 60 college credits already in their grasp can only be welcome. But the students I talked with were not fixated on the costs they would avoid in their college years. They were focused on the challenging work of the present moment.
 As I watched a small group of history students enthusiastically participating in a discussion of events in the post-World War II period, I thought of a comment that a student in the biology lab, Claire Fishman, had made to me earlier: ''When I get to college, I'm going to be really well prepared.''

HEADLINE: Hank Jones Is Dead at 91; A Versatile Jazz Pianist

BYLINE: By PETER KEEPNEWS

 BODY:
Hank Jones, whose self-effacing nature belied his stature as one of the most respected jazz pianists of the postwar era, died on Sunday in the Bronx. He was 91. 
 His death, at Calvary Hospital Hospice, was announced by his longtime manager, Jean-Pierre Leduc. Mr. Jones lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and also had a home in Hartwick, N.Y.
 Mr. Jones spent much of his career in the background. For three and a half decades he was primarily a sideman, most notably with Ella Fitzgerald; for much of that time he also worked as a studio musician on radio and television.
 His fellow musicians admired his imagination, his versatility and his distinctive style, which blended the urbanity and rhythmic drive of the Harlem stride pianists, the dexterity of Art Tatum and the harmonic daring of bebop. (The pianist, composer and conductor Andre Previn once called Mr. Jones his favorite pianist, ''regardless of idiom.'') 
 But unlike his younger brothers Thad, who played trumpet with Count Basie and was later a co-leader of a celebrated big band, and Elvin, an influential drummer who formed a successful combo after six years with John Coltrane's innovative quartet, Hank Jones seemed content for many years to keep a low profile.
 That started changing around the time he turned 60. Riding a wave of renewed interest in jazz piano that also transformed his close friend and occasional duet partner Tommy Flanagan from a perpetual sideman to a popular nightclub headliner, Mr. Jones began working and recording regularly under his own name. 
 Reviewing a nightclub appearance in 1989, Peter Watrous of The New York Times praised Mr. Jones as ''an extraordinary musician'' whose playing ''resonates with jazz history'' and who ''embodies the idea of grace under pressure, where assurance and relaxation mask nearly impossible improvisations.''
 Mr. Jones further enhanced his reputation in the 1990s with a striking series of recordings that placed his piano in a range of contexts -- including an album with a string quartet, a collaboration with a group of West African musicians and a duet recital with the bassist Charlie Haden devoted to spirituals and hymns. 
 Henry W. Jones Jr. was born in Vicksburg, Miss., on July 31, 1918. One of 10 children, he grew up in Pontiac, Mich., near Detroit, where he started studying piano at an early age and first performed professionally at 13. He began playing jazz even though his father, a Baptist deacon, disapproved. 
 Mr. Jones worked with regional bands, mostly in Michigan and Ohio, before moving to New York in 1944 to join the trumpeter and singer Hot Lips Page's group at the Onyx Club on 52nd Street.
 He was soon in great demand, working for well-known performers like the saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and the singer Billy Eckstine. ''People heard me and said, 'Well, this is not just a boy from the country -- maybe he knows a few chords,' '' he told Ben Waltzer in a 2001 interview for The Times. He abandoned the freelance life in late 1947 to become Ella Fitzgerald's accompanist and held that job until 1953, occasionally taking time out to record with Charlie Parker and others.
 He kept busy after leaving Fitzgerald. Among other activities, he began an association with Benny Goodman that would last into the 1970s, and he was a member of the last group Goodman's swing-era rival Artie Shaw led before retiring in 1954. But financial security beckoned, and in 1959 he became a staff musician at CBS. He also participated in a celebrated moment in presidential history when he accompanied Marilyn Monroe as she sang ''Happy Birthday'' to President John F. Kennedy, who was about to turn 45, during a Democratic Party fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden in May 1962.
 Mr. Jones remained intermittently involved in jazz during his long tenure at CBS, which ended when the network disbanded its music department in the mid-'70s. He was a charter member of the big band formed by his brother Thad and the drummer Mel Lewis in 1966, and he recorded a few albums as a leader. More often, however, he was heard but not seen on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and other television and radio programs.
 ''Most of the time during those 15 or so years, I wasn't playing the kind of music I'd prefer to play,'' Mr. Jones told Howard Mandel of Down Beat magazine in 1994. ''It may have slowed me down a bit. I would have been a lot further down the road to where I want to be musically had I not worked at CBS.'' But, he explained, the work gave him ''an economic base for trying to build something.''
 Once free of his CBS obligations, Mr. Jones began quietly making a place for himself in the jazz limelight. He teamed with the bassist Ron Carter and the drummer Tony Williams, alumni of the Miles Davis Quintet, to form the Great Jazz Trio in 1976. (The uncharacteristically immodest name of the group, which changed bassists and drummers frequently over the years, was not Mr. Jones's idea.) 
 Two years later he began a long run as the musical director and onstage pianist for ''Ain't Misbehavin','' the Broadway revue built around the music of Fats Waller, while also playing late-night solo sets at the Cafe Ziegfeld in Midtown Manhattan.
 By the 1980s, Mr. Jones's late-blooming career as a band leader was in full swing. While he had always recorded prolifically -- by one estimate he can be heard on more than a thousand albums -- for the first time he concentrated on recording under his own name, which he continued to do well into the 21st century.
 He is survived by his wife, Theodosia.
 Mr. Jones was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 1989. He received the National Medal of Arts in 2008 and a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 2009. And he continued working almost to the end. Laurel Gross, a close friend, said he had toured Japan in February and had plans for a European tour this spring until doctors advised against it. 
 Reaching for superlatives, critics often wrote that Mr. Jones had an exceptional touch. He himself was not so sure.
 ''I never tried consciously to develop a 'touch,' '' he told The Detroit Free Press in 1997. ''What I tried to do was make whatever lines I played flow evenly and fully and as smoothly as possible.
 ''I think the way you practice has a lot to do with it,'' he explained. ''If you practice scales religiously and practice each note firmly with equal strength, certainly you'll develop a certain smoothness. I used to practice a lot. I still do when I'm at home.'' Mr. Jones was 78 years old at the time.

HEADLINE: G.M. Posts Sales Gain And a Profit

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors said Monday that it earned its first quarterly profit since 2007 after last year's government-sponsored bankruptcy allowed the carmaker to wipe away many of its longstanding obligations.
 G.M. reported first-quarter earnings of $865 million as its revenue surged 40 percent, to $31.5 billion. It broke a long string of losses in North America even though industry sales remain near multidecade lows.
 The results show that G.M. is on track to become a public company again as soon as the fourth quarter, allowing the government to recover more of the billions of dollars it spent preventing the company's collapse. 
 After nearly running out of money at the end of 2008, G.M. had positive cash flow of $1 billion in the first quarter.
 ''The fact that G.M. can be profitable at this level of sales is very, very positive,'' said Charles Moore, senior managing director of Conway MacKenzie, a corporate turnaround consulting firm in Birmingham, Mich. ''There's still uncertainty in the economy, which could cause a blip in sales, but based on all of the indicators at this point, one would expect that they should be able to be profitable for the full year.''
 G.M. last turned an annual profit in 2004, when automakers sold almost 17 million vehicles in the United States. This year, most analysts expect sales of fewer than 12 million.
 ''We used to be breaking even in the middle of the cycle,'' Christopher P. Liddell, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said. ''Now we're breaking even at the bottom of the cycle.''
 Given how quickly G.M. went from bankruptcy to profits, Mr. Liddell said he was trying to keep expectations for the company from rising too high, lest it fall into its previous habit of promising more than it could deliver. But he did not dissuade predictions that the automaker would continue to be profitable, saying he sees ''nothing that I'm significantly concerned about'' standing in the way.
 Now G.M. is focused on increasing its profits through higher sales, he said, rather than through additional deep cuts.
 ''We just have to sell more cars,'' he said. ''If we can do that and the industry improves -- and we improve with it -- then we have an extremely good profit picture.''
 G.M. earned $1.2 billion before interest and taxes in North America, the region where it had sustained most of its losses in recent years. In the previous quarter, G.M. lost $3.4 billion in North America.
 G.M.'s biggest source of trouble is now Europe, where it lost $500 million, but Mr. Liddell said operations there could break even next year.
 Worldwide, G.M. earned $1.7 billion before interest and taxes. The $865 million net profit compared with a loss of $6 billion by the old G.M. in the period a year earlier.
 Mr. Liddell would not give a specific time when G.M. might begin selling its stock to the public, beyond saying it would occur ''in good time, when the company's ready and when the market's ready.''
 In April, G.M. repaid the balance of its $6.7 billion loan from the federal government, along with smaller loans from the Canadian and Ontario governments. G.M. aired commercials featuring its chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., highlighting the loan repayment, but critics, including some members of Congress, accused the company of misleading consumers into thinking all $50 billion given to the company by the United States Treasury had been repaid. 
 The Treasury Department still owns 61 percent of G.M., a stake it received in exchange for most of the money it gave to the carmaker. Taxpayers can recoup that money only through the sale of G.M. stock. 
 In preparation for that action, executives are considering re-entering the auto financing business, a move that could increase sales by expanding the pool of consumers who can qualify for attractive loans. G.M. sold control of its former financing arm, GMAC Financial Services, in 2006. GMAC is now known as Ally Financial and also handles financing for Chrysler.
 ''It's important in terms of our relationship with GMAC and with other providers that we have a free flow of funding available to all credit limits,'' Mr. Liddell said. ''That's probably cost us some sales over the last year.''
 Likewise, Chrysler, which filed for Chapter 11 protection a month sooner than G.M., is showing early signs of revival. Chrysler lost $197 million in the first quarter, but executives said last week that the recovery was progressing faster than they had forecast and projected an operating profit for the full year as well.
 The parent company of Chrysler Financial on Monday repaid $1.9 billion on a $4 billion government loan that the Obama administration had written off.
 ''I don't think anybody's ready to declare victory yet,'' said Representative Thaddeus McCotter, a Republican from Michigan who lobbied in favor of federal assistance for the industry. ''When you look at the economic conditions out there it makes the profit look more impressive. You're going to have a lot of working families that can sleep better at night.''

HEADLINE: The Children Are Bright; the Setting, Scruffy

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
The hulking three-story school building has corrugated metal siding and grates on the windows. 
 The closest playground, in the shadow of a housing project, has missing swings and peeling paint. At recess, the students play on a bare square of pavement in a public park, a thick metal chain on the gate to warn away the public during school hours. 
 At TAG Young Scholars, a citywide school in East Harlem for the talented and gifted, what goes on inside the classroom is praised by parents, but the aesthetics and facilities are, in a word, challenging. On a recent tour of the school, prospective kindergartners' parents, many of whom live miles away, asked more questions about safety than curriculum. 
 ''I want to ask about the elephant in the room,'' said Chloe Brand of Washington Heights, bringing up an Internet report that children from the local middle schools that share TAG's building were starting fights at dismissal. 
 TAG is the forgotten sibling of the two other citywide gifted schools in Manhattan. The programs are reserved for the 4- and 5-year-old children who score the highest on reasoning and ability tests. Many parents of those children avoid TAG, even though far more children qualify for these programs than there are seats.
 This is particularly true for white parents, and to a lesser extent, Asians, creating a noticeably segregated gifted school landscape. The other two schools, the Anderson School on the Upper West Side and New Explorations Into Science and Technology and Math, known as NEST+m, on the Lower East Side, are at least 70 percent white and Asian, as are the city's gifted programs as a whole. TAG is more than 80 percent black and Hispanic, and only 1 percent of its children are white.
 Change is slowly coming to TAG, however, in part as a result of its higher profile since the city mandated a citywide test as the sole factor in gifted admissions in 2008. A new generation of TAG parents, who seem to be more diverse racially and economically, are arguing that their school deserves the same facilities and programs as the other gifted and talented schools. 
 Aware that it is not city funding, but private donations and grants that plump the budgets of the best-known gifted schools, TAG parents established a dedicated fund-raising circle, a grant-writing committee and a public relations committee this year. But, in part because 63 percent of TAG children are poor enough to qualify for free and reduced-price lunches, they raised relatively little. 
 Friends of the Anderson Program, a parent-led group, raised $530,000 in 2008, its latest public 990 form shows. This year, TAG raised $12,000, up from $6,000 last year and $4,500 the year before.
 Janette Cesar, who has led the TAG program for more than a decade, initially disagreed with the new parents who were complaining about the school's resources. 
 ''What is the point of comparing ourselves to the other schools?'' she asked. ''Is that what we want to teach our children?'' She noted that the local middle schools in TAG's building, which serve poorer children than those at TAG, are just as deserving of space and services.
 But last week, after a promising meeting with a nonprofit group that may be interested in helping the school find a nicer, more spacious building, it seemed that she was starting to change her mind. She had hired an artist to guide the children in painting murals to brighten the dim hallways, and she said, perhaps optimistically, she was glad they would be on canvas, ''so we can take them when we move.''
 ''I have been focused on the academics -- what happens in the classroom,'' she said. But now that the young school's foundation is laid, and its test scores place it among the best in the city, maybe, she said, it should get more attention. ''It's time.''
 TAG has always served a predominately minority, working-class population, mostly from Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and nearby parts of Queens. It was founded in 1989 as a magnet program within the school system's District 4, and became an independent K-8 gifted and talented school in 2004. 
 The normal cutoff score for the five citywide programs (Queens and Brooklyn each have one) is the 97th percentile on the gifted test. But while the other schools have many more applicants than seats, so few parents list TAG as a preference that in past years it has had room for the handful of students in District 4 who score over the 90th percentile. 
 In an unfortunate coincidence, just as TAG's inclusion on the list of citywide gifted schools began to raise its profile, it lost space to the four other schools in its building. It no longer has an art room, library or music room for the elementary grades. Classrooms in the upper grades, which can house as many as 30 active, inquiring students in red and white uniforms, can feel busy and cramped.
 Ms. Cesar said she believed that the racial composition of her school was a result of parent choice and geography, as parents seek a place where they and their children feel comfortable.
 The issue works both ways. On the prospective student tour, the white parents focused the most on security concerns. One father, whose wife later asked that he not be named, said he would feel uncomfortable if his son were the only white child in his class.
 But Stephanie Thacker, whose son, Elijah, is in the sixth grade, said she chose TAG over Anderson four years ago in part because she wanted her son, who is black, to feel like he could be himself. ''This is a school that is as good as any other,'' she said.
 And Isis Castillo, who is encouraging her TAG fifth grader, Abigail, to attend middle school elsewhere, in part because she is worried about the behavior of children from the other middle schools, said her daughter had visited NEST+m. She saw few Hispanic faces there and told her mother, ''I feel very out of place here.''
 Diana Cornell, whose son, Forest, is one of two or three white children in the TAG kindergarten, is helping the effort for better facilities and enrichment programs, like a chess club, and the parents working with her are a diverse lot, mirroring the 5- and 6-year-olds in Forest's class. 
 TAG's kindergartners, almost all of whom can read and write, clustered one April afternoon on multicolored floor cushions with reading books, chatting happily with one another as they waited to be called to paint flowerpots.
 Emphasizing the care given to the children, Ms. Cornell said that the first person her son sees in the morning is a security guard, and that no matter where the children are, someone is watching them closely. Ms. Cesar said that despite parental fears, no child from TAG has ever been hurt.
 Gwen Randolph, a researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center and the mother of a prospective student, said that while she was intimidated by the building's prisonlike appearance at first, she liked the school after completing the tour, particularly the science program for elementary students. She plans to apply, but also has some improvements in mind.
 ''The first thing I'm going to do,'' she said, ''is get parent volunteers to give that playground a fresh coat of paint.''

HEADLINE: Euro Crisis Drifts to China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The pain of the European debt crisis is spreading as the plummeting euro makes Chinese companies less competitive in Europe, their largest market, and complicates any move to break the Chinese currency's peg to the dollar.
 Chinese policy makers reached a rough consensus early last month about breaking the dollar peg and letting the currency, the renminbi, rise in value somewhat, according to people close to Chinese currency policy makers. Uncoupling the currencies would make American goods more competitive against Chinese products. But for various reasons, China has not yet put that policy into place. 
 And in light of the euro's nose dive, such a move could be difficult. Letting the renminbi rise against the dollar would also mean a further increase in the renminbi's value against the euro, creating even more problems for Chinese exporters to Europe.
 The euro has plunged against the renminbi in recent weeks, at one point Monday reaching its lowest level since late 2002. 
 The steep rise of the renminbi prompted a Commerce Ministry official in Beijing to warn Monday that China's exports could be threatened. 
 The official's comments were the most explicit yet on the implications for China of Europe's recent financial difficulties. The comments also suggest that even China -- the world's fastest-growing major economy and increasingly the engine of global growth -- is not immune to the crisis that started in Greece and threatens to spread across much of Europe.
 ''The yuan has risen about 14.5 percent against the euro during the last four months, which will increase cost pressure for Chinese exporters and also have a negative impact on China's exports to European countries,'' Yao Jian, the ministry's spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing, according to news services, using another term for China's currency.
 It is a potentially awkward moment. The American secretary of commerce, Gary Locke, is in China this week leading the first cabinet-level trade mission of the administration of President Obama. 
 Some economists warn that China may face more problems. The biggest reason Chinese exports plunged early last year was not weakening demand in industrialized countries but a sudden, temporary disappearance of trade finance from Chinese and foreign banks. The availability of trade finance could easily become a serious problem again soon, said Dong Tao, the chief Asia economist at Credit Suisse.
 Chinese exporters rely very heavily on bank letters of credit to finance their shipments. The availability of the letters of credit is closely linked to overnight lending rates between banks. When banks have trouble borrowing money themselves -- as has been happening as a result of worries about European banks' possible losses from the region's sovereign debt crisis -- they tend to cut sharply the issuance of letters of credit for trade finance. 
 The banks see that as a quick, easy way to conserve cash without violating the terms of other financial obligations, like established lines of credit for big corporations.
 Interbank lending rates surged late last week and on Monday and must now come back down very quickly to persuade banks to keep issuing letters of credit, Mr. Tao said. ''Without trade finance, trade won't happen,'' he said.
 The Shanghai stock market plunged Monday, with the composite index falling 5.1 percent on worries about global demand as well as concerns about possible further moves in China to limit a steep rise in real estate prices this spring.
 Some Chinese companies are already running into difficulty because of the euro's fall against the renminbi.
 ''We have been receiving calls from some European clients who signed contracts with us earlier this month, and they all want to cancel their orders, since the depreciation of the euro has eroded all their margins and then some,'' said Elvin Xu, the sales manager of Guangdong Ouyi Electrical Appliance in Zhongshan, China, which makes gas stoves, heaters and water heaters.
 ''They say they cannot increase the prices at their end to their customers, given intense competition in their marketplace,'' Mr. Xu added.
 The renminbi is rising along with the dollar against the euro. The Chinese government has continued to intervene heavily in currency markets in recent weeks to prevent the renminbi from rising against the dollar, maintaining an informal peg of 6.827 renminbi to the dollar, the level since July 2008.
 Because American companies in particular compete in the Chinese market with European companies in many industries, the euro's weakness against the renminbi is putting American companies at a disadvantage. The American commerce secretary, Mr. Locke, said Monday in Hong Kong that Mr. Obama's goal was to double American exports by 2015. Short-term currency fluctuations do not detract from that goal, he said in an interview, adding, ''Who knows what the euro will be next month, six months from now or a year from now?''
 Steve Jennings, one of the American executives traveling with Mr. Locke, said that the weakness of the euro would help European companies compete against American companies in export markets all over the world.
 ''As the euro continues to decline, they're going to have some advantages,'' said Mr. Jennings, the chief marketing officer of BPL Global, a company based in Oregon that manufactures electricity monitoring equipment.
 Chinese leaders reached a consensus in early April to break the renminbi's peg to the dollar. That ended a dispute that had spilled into public view in March when Commerce Ministry officials warned in speeches and interviews in Beijing and Washington about the dangers of any change in the renminbi's value. The ministry halted those warnings immediately after the consensus was reached, and Chen Deming, the commerce minister, even reversed himself publicly by saying that China's trade deficit in March was nothing to worry about.
 But events since then have delayed adoption of the consensus, including public attention paid to a visit to Beijing by the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, followed by the Qinghai earthquake and now the euro's slide.
 The United States is far from alone in calling for China to let the renminbi rise. 
 Government officials in Singapore, India and Brazil have also called publicly in the last three weeks for the Chinese government to break the renminbi's peg to the dollar. 
 Continued Chinese inaction would antagonize many commercial rivals of China, and could fuel pressures in Washington for Congress to draft trade legislation threatening restrictions on Chinese exports.
 The euro's difficulties have also inflicted tens of billions of dollars in losses on the value of China's $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, according to Western economists. China had been trying to limit its dependence on United States Treasury securities for those reserves in recent years, fearing that the United States might someday suffer from budget problems or inflation, and did so by expanding its holdings of European government bonds.
 But China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which administers the reserves, does not have to mark them to market daily -- record their fluctuating value -- so it is not clear what effect, if any, the losses will have on policy.

HEADLINE: Blight Made Right

 BODY:
There is a well-understood but impolite thing to be said about America's suburbs, particularly the old ones. They can be beautiful in places but ugly in far too many others, especially in the desolate commercial spaces that shoppers and time forgot. The failed strip malls, closed warehouses, abandoned big-box stores and moon-cratered parking lots. The light industry in heavy decline. 
 Long Island has lots of these places, many in old train-station downtowns, and in a bad economy, they breed. There's little impulse to redevelop them because there are other lots and green spaces to build on.
 Two interesting efforts are trying to shake the island into making itself over. One is in Brookhaven Town, a huge chunk of eastern Suffolk County with some of America's worst exhibits in the art of thoughtless planning. The town supervisor, Mark Lesko, has begun a ''Blight Into Light'' campaign to lure new development to old properties with tax incentives and streamlined approvals. He's made a video that shows Brookhaven at its ugliest to press the point: almost anything would be better than what's there. He's not an old L.I. pol but a former federal prosecutor, which may explain his optimism. 
 The Rauch Foundation, a forward-thinking, private family outfit, is attacking what it calls ''a crisis of imagination'' with a contest called ''Build a Better Burb.'' The best ideas to revive suburban downtowns will win a total of $22,500 in cash. It could be anything -- houses, parks, farms, bus shelters -- as long as it's bold and appealing. 
 Good redevelopment ideas have died a million times on Long Island. Entrenched forces -- inertia, fear of change, low aesthetic expectations -- usually manage to drag dreams back to dreary reality. Mr. Lesko and the Rauch Foundation are trying to plant optimism. Somebody has to, and we're eager to see what grows.

HEADLINE: The Euro's Lost Promise

BYLINE: By DAVID MARSH. 
David Marsh, the chairman of an international consulting company, is the author of ''The Euro: The Politics of the New Global Currency.''

 BODY:
Singapore
 THE dream of monetary union across Europe has turned into a nightmare. Led by France and Germany, European countries have decided to spend colossal sums of taxpayers' money they cannot afford to heal mounting internal disparities they cannot conceal to shore up an edifice many believe cannot stand. On Monday, that skepticism briefly pulled the value of the euro down to a four-year low against the dollar. 
 A little over a week ago, European Union leaders approved a rescue package worth 750 billion euros (nearly $1 trillion) for weaker members like Greece, Portugal and Spain, backed by the International Monetary Fund and the American government. The present crisis extends well beyond its immediate causes: bad decisions in Athens, lack of European leadership and a poor economy. These are but the latest twists in a drama that began more than two decades ago. 
 The underlying story of how 16 diverse European currencies were fused into the euro combines the contorted fortunes of two powerful German politicians who sought to tame Europe's past and shape its future, along with a French president who wished to fasten economic shackles around the might of a reunified Germany. Ultimately, too, it is the story of how the Old Continent struggled to break free from the uncertain political and economic embrace of the United States. 
 The pivotal moment in the formation of Europe's monetary union came in December 1991 at a meeting in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands. Two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, European leaders set a political path toward a Europe-wide currency -- a holy grail that had been pursued since the Roman Empire. The new money would complete the European program of liberalized cross-border trade, promote the old dream of political unity, rival the dollar as an international reserve currency and -- the most complicated objective -- prevent an enlarged Germany's domination of Europe by bringing its currency under European control. The mighty Deutsche mark needed to be cast into the furnace of European unity and forged into the euro.
 In the vanguard of the effort was none other than Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man who had driven German reunification with miraculous speed. He knew he had to enshrine the larger Germany in a new European order to ease its neighbors' fears. The euro would be the monetary equivalent of the ugly yet necessary military compact between NATO and the Warsaw Pact that supervised East and West Germany after World War II.
 To his credit, just before the Maastricht meeting, Chancellor Kohl noted that a monetary union without a corresponding political union would be ''a castle in the air.'' His remark echoed the concerns of the Bundesbank, his country's statutorily independent central bank, that unless it involved greater political and economic anti-inflationary discipline and solidarity among weaker and stronger states, a monetary union would be doomed. 
 Of course, the Bundesbank was also reluctant to cede its mastery of European monetary affairs to a new European Central Bank. And ordinary Germans were not eager to give up the mark, the guarantor of their prosperity.
 Yet Mr. Kohl fought for the monetary union, and the euro started on schedule, three months after he was voted out of office. (Eleven countries adopted the currency on Jan. 1, 1999; five more, including Greece, joined later.)
 Mr. Kohl's partner in redrawing the contours of Europe was President Francois Mitterrand of France, who provided Mr. Kohl with the political incentive to create the monetary union, arguing that unified Germany had to participate in deeper European integration. Mr. Kohl agreed, but egged on by the Bundesbank applied conditions that to this day remain deeply irksome to France -- principally that the new currency had to be run by a European Central Bank that would be at least as independent as the Bundesbank. 
 The deeply held French view was that the state, not unelected central bankers, should have ultimate power over a nation's money. Shortly before he died in 1996, Mitterrand told a confidant that his agreeing to the independence of the European Central Bank had been a terrible error. 
 The third principal character in the story of the euro is Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's 67-year-old finance minister -- a courageous, quick-thinking man suspended between the past and the present, between hope and tragedy. A paraplegic since being shot by a deranged assailant at an election rally in 1990, Mr. Schauble served as Mr. Kohl's Chancellery minister, applying connivance and calculation in dealings with East Germany and, later, as interior minister, deftly negotiating the 1990 reunification treaty. It was Mr. Schauble who, with forbearance and persistence, played a central part in carrying out Mr. Kohl's wish that the new Germany be integrated into a new Europe by the binding power of a common money.
 Mr. Schauble is now the key member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, and the euro imbroglio presents him with his most exacting test. Yet during recent months of mounting tension caused by the debts of the southern members of the euro zone, he has been confined to a hospital bed for weeks on end. (He made it to Brussels earlier this month for a vital finance ministers' meeting, but was rushed to the hospital there after suffering an allergic reaction to medication.) The ministers' decision to offer nearly $1 trillion in aid and guarantees, with taxpayers from Germany bearing the largest share, was made without him.
 The huge amount of money aside, the significance of the rescue package was that, for the first time, power over the European Central Bank started to move to the politicians. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, a longtime critic of the bank's sway, joined forces with another Frenchman, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to impose political supremacy over the euro zone. 
 Decisive backing came from President Obama, who on the eve of the Brussels meeting telephoned Mrs. Merkel to warn her that Europe's failure to act could set off another worldwide credit crunch. His intervention was incongruous in the extreme: an American president urging the German chancellor to shore up a currency union that was meant to bolster Europe's financial independence from the United States.
 But this is not the only way in which the euro has defied expectations. Germany has long warned that southern euro states, no longer able to improve their competitiveness by devaluing their own currencies, could run into severe financial trouble. The red ink from their increasing trade deficits has been flowing for more than a decade. These countries have borrowed far too much for too long at too cheap interest rates. The current account deficits for Greece and Portugal average an unsustainable 10 percent of gross domestic product. 
 Yet even as it predicted the trouble, Germany failed to anticipate that the countries running a trade surplus would inevitably need to finance the southern states' shortfalls. The five most heavily indebted euro members owe German banks an estimated 700 billion euros (nearly $900 billion), and these German surpluses, once regarded abroad as a symbol of great strength, have emerged as a dangerous source of vulnerability. Most sickeningly for the Germans, the indebted nations are likely to say that their debts need to be reduced or restructured in the name of European solidarity. 
 A German revolt against the attenuated independence of the European Central Bank appears likely, and could jeopardize parliamentary approval for the rescue package. The Germans feel mistreated by a monetary system that makes them pay for others' largely self-inflicted misfortunes.
 And the trouble is far from over. The austerity programs for errant southern states ordained by European governments and the International Monetary Fund are likely to lead to severe unemployment and civil unrest. Some southern euro members may choose to return to their former currencies -- or they may be asked to do so by other states. 
 An overarching structure for political control over the euro is now being erected. But it is likely to be resisted by Germany, the main paymaster, which rejects any idea that German strength is a root cause of recent disequilibrium. 
 Not for the first time in European history, differing perceptions of German power contain the seeds of much potential unrest. Monetary union was once the bright hope for laying to rest Germany's demonic ability to unhinge Europe. Now it appears to be doing just the opposite.

HEADLINE: Big Nation. Big People. It's Clearly A Big Deal.

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
There are two Americas. 
 One is a ruling minority of the healthy few who rely on vegetable gardens, personal trainers and spa getaways to stay fit. The other is the majority of Americans, who are overweight or obese, many of whom risk their own form of assisted living -- XXXL clothes, mobility scooters and diabetes treatments that can tip over $50,000 a year. 
 ''One Nation, Overweight'' is a CNBC documentary on Tuesday that provides a chilling portrait of a health epidemic that endangers all Americans -- without being overly alarmist or too sanguine. And while that doesn't sound like a big deal, this program stands out in a landscape cluttered with mixed messages and grossly distorted images of reality. 
 Television used to ignore obesity; now it wallows in it. But the effort to portray the problem -- and the solutions -- mirrors the way most Americans eat: the most basic facts are larded with sugary entertainment and creamy dollops of instant gratification. 
 Weight-loss reality shows like ''The Biggest Loser'' turn obesity into a contest, painting the solitary, often costly struggle against obesity as an exhilarating and financially rewarding team sport. Even do-good missions feed the appetite of viewers accustomed to supersize entertainment. The British chef Jamie Oliver tried to tame the eating habits of an entire town in West Virginia, called the fattest place in America, for his reality show, ''Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution.'' Not surprisingly, French fries won.
 Meanwhile, series like ''Drop Dead Diva'' and ''Glee,'' which recently devoted an episode to a character's battle with her weight, try to preach self-acceptance by showcasing plus-size heroines who learn to value their physiques. Mostly, they present an unrealistic image of a world populated by whippet-thin women, each of whom has one large friend.
 ''One Nation, Overweight'' isn't a treat, but it's rich in salutary warnings. It begins at the Cleveland Clinic, one of the top destinations for growing numbers of patients -- some weighing 500 and 600 pounds -- who want to have their stomachs stapled. (There were 220,000 such procedures done in 2009, according to CNBC.) The corridors of the bariatric ward, filled with hugely fat people who can barely walk, provide the kind of flesh-and-blood look into the future that was the apocalyptic message of the animated movie ''Wall-E.'' 
 And that future may not be so far away. Kenneth E. Thorpe, a health economist at Emory University, discusses a study he published that warns that if current trends continue, the cost of treating weight-related illnesses will double to $344 billion a year by 2018. 
 The CNBC correspondent Scott Wapner interviews experts who describe obesity as a disease, but the obese people he speaks to rarely blame their size on genetic predisposition or other extenuating circumstances. 
 ''I did to this myself,'' says Henry Butler, 62, who was 330 pounds when he went to the Cleveland Clinic. ''Who said I had to eat all that?'' 
 School cafeterias are part of the problem, and CNBC visits a school in Virginia where snack carts sell sticky buns, candy bars and chips three times a day. The principal explains that the profits go to help after-school sports programs, a vicious -- and viscous -- cycle. 
 There are schools and workplaces that are trying to fight back, including the owner of a car dealership who pays for his overweight employees to join a $2,500 weight-loss program -- he says it saves him tens of thousands of dollars in health costs. An inventor demonstrates his answer to a sedentary work force: a machine that allows an employee to work at a computer terminal while walking on a slow-moving treadmill. 
 Over all, CNBC provides a broad, sensible look at a problem that is not new, but is increasingly dire. There are a few journalistic lapses, however. 
 The film spends quite a bit of time on a promising weight-loss drug, Qnexa, that is awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration. It helps suppress appetite and has had better results than similar drugs in clinical trials, according to the documentary. 
 Mr. Wapner interviews Leland F. Wilson, the chief executive of Vivus, the maker of Qnexa, who is predictably bullish. So is the only research scientist shown on camera, Dr. Michelle Look, a sports medicine specialist who is a lead clinical trial investigator on Qnexa and a paid consultant to Vivus. 
 A deputy director of the F.D.A. is interviewed but doesn't say much about Qnexa, except to explain that his agency is under pressure from advocacy groups to speed up approval of anti-obesity drugs.
 Particularly because so many viewers are overweight and desperate for a medical breakthrough on obesity, CNBC should have also interviewed an independent scientist who could have added a grain of salt to Mr. Wapner's boosterish report. 
 And credibility, once shaken, is hard to restore. Jim Trudeau, a small-business owner from Madison, Wis., who attended a weight-loss program at the Biggest Loser Resort at Fitness Ridge in Ivins, Utah, lost 200 pounds, but has another 200 or so to lose, since he started at 600. Mr. Trudeau is an articulate and sympathetic figure, but it's hard not to wonder if he was picked for his personality, or because ''The Biggest Loser'' is on NBC, a sister network to CNBC. 
 ''One Nation, Overweight'' takes a serious look at a serious problem, and it would be better if it showed more discipline in curbing its own weaknesses.

HEADLINE: Godard, With That Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi at the Cannes Film Festival

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

DATELINE: CANNES, France 

 BODY:
If I am remembering clearly -- and my head is filled with so many densely layered words and images, it is hard to unpack them -- the first image in ''Film Socialism,'' the new movie by Jean-Luc Godard, is of two red-headed parrots, side by side on a tree limb. The parrots are among a handful of animals that appear in the movie, which had its press premiere Monday morning at the Cannes Film Festival, including a pair of hilariously talkative cats (whose meows are, in turn, parroted by a young woman watching them on a laptop), as well as a llama and a donkey. Surrounding these animals is a menagerie of talking, quoting, babbling human beings, speaking in French, German, Russian, English and Arabic, among other tongues. 
 Wittily, perversely, contrastingly, the final words in the movie are ''no comment,'' which appear in large English letters like a declaration, bringing this 1 hour and 41 minutes of sights and sounds to an abrupt close. Mr. Godard, 79, was scheduled to appear at a press conference after the screening, but made good on these last words by not showing up. Though the rumor that he would be a no-show had circulated before the screening, several dozen journalists trooped to the press room to see if a representative might appear with an explanation. Nothing. Not even a note. No comment. 
 According to the French newspaper La Liberation, Mr. Godard sent a fax to the festival's director, Thierry Fremaux, saying that ''problems of the Greek type'' (''des problemes de type grec,'' perhaps referring to Greece's financial crisis) had prevented him from attending and that he would go to his death for the festival, but not one step more: ''Suite a des problemes de type grec, je ne pourrai etre votre oblige a Cannes. Avec le festival, j'irai jusqu'a la mort, mais je ne ferai pas un pas de plus. Amicalement. Jean-Luc Godard.''
 Any new Godard movie is a noteworthy occasion, and this initial screening was packed with an audience primed for difficulties of some kind. On Friday the British newspaper The Independent reported that the movie's English-language subtitles would be in what was characterized as ''Navajo English,'' to replicate the fractured words spoken by Hollywood-style American Indians in westerns (and in the sitcom ''F Troop''): ''If a character is saying, 'Give me your watch,' the subtitle will read, 'You, me, watch.' '' In the 1950s Mr. Godard worked in the Paris publicity office for 20th Century Fox and knows how to stir things up. (He had already tempted us with a trailer in which the movie appears in hyper fast forward; the complete film can be viewed through Wednesday on the Web site FilmoTV.fr.) 
 My thoughts on the movie -- which looks as if it were shot in both low-grade video and high-definition digital -- are tentative and, for now, brief. Structurally , it can be divided into three sections, the first set on Mediterranean cruise ship on which the mostly white passengers eat, mingle and gamble. Among the travelers are several men and women, as well as a teenage girl and younger boy, who speak to one another and themselves in largely untranslated languages. As promised, the English-language subtitles are sparse, with words sometimes joined together or widely spaced: ''nocrimes noblood''; ''German Jews black''; ''impossible story''; ''Kamikaze divine wind''; ''right of return.'' Every so often, Patti Smith appears, singing in a cabin and strolling on deck or below with an acoustic guitar. 
 The second section is set in and around a small gas station and adjoining house, where two women, a white journalist, perhaps, and a black camera operator, are lurking around the garage owners, a French family of four. (An exterior wall is emblazoned with the name J. J. Martin.) Here, the discussion turns to the liberte, egalite, fraternite, and with these ideals the French revolution is invoked.
 The third section turns to different places: Egypt, Palestine, Odessa, Hell As (more on that in a moment), Naples and Barcelona. ''Hell As'' refers to Hellas, the Greek word for Greece, but might also be a punning reference to the French word for alas -- helas -- and an earlier Godard film, ''Helas Pour Moi,'' which retells the myth of Amphitryon and Alcmene. Along the way, Jews, Hollywood and the Holocaust are referred to. 
 Obviously, it will take many more viewings of ''Film Socialism,'' an improvement in my French and many more fully translated subtitles before I can begin to get a tentative grasp on it. Such are the complicated pleasures of Mr. Godard's work: however private, even hermetic, his film language can be, these are works that by virtue of that language's density, as well as the films' visual beauty and intellectual riddles, invite you in (or turn you off). I imagine it will be awhile before the movie travels to the United States, but if you want to prepare, I suggest you look at a Thursday (May 13) interview with Mr. Godard from Telerama.fr that includes this quotation from the movie: ''Les Americains ont libere l'Europe en la rendant dependante,'' which translates as ''the Americans liberated Europe by making it dependent.''

HEADLINE: In an Ancient Mexican Tomb, High Society and Human Sacrifice

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Last month, in their second season at the site of an ancient settlement in southern Mexico, archaeologists digging into the ruins of a pyramid came upon a row of large, flat stones -- the wall of a tomb. Inside, they found skeletons of a prominent man, possibly a ruler, and two human sacrifices. Another apparently elite adult was on a landing just outside the tomb.
 The archaeologist in charge, Bruce R. Bachand of Brigham Young University in Utah, determined from the style of ceremonial pottery in the tomb that the burials occurred about 2,700 years ago. He said that could be several centuries earlier than any richly decorated burials previously found in Mesoamerican pyramids. 
 Dr. Bachand said recently in an interview by telephone from the site that the two principal skeletons bore the hallmarks of persons ''at the very top of society.'' The one in the tomb was coated with red pigment and adorned with hundreds of jade ornaments, the teeth inlaid with white jade or marine shell. The skeleton outside the tomb, possibly that of a woman, was decorated with jade, pearl and amber, and the upper teeth inlaid with pyrite, commonly known as fool's gold. The sacrificial skeletons, an adult and a child, were unadorned and lacked ritual offerings.
 Anthropologists who specialize in pre-Columbian cultures of Mexico and Central America said it was premature to assess the find's full significance but agreed with Dr. Bachand that it was an important early example of social ranking in the region's cultures and the rising political centralization under chiefs.
 The discovery was made near the top of a 30-foot-tall pyramid, the highest structure at the central plaza of the ancient site at Chiapa de Corzo in the state of Chiapas, not far from the Guatemala border. The excavations were supported by the National Geographic Society.
 The tomb raised a difficult question: What culture was responsible for it? At the time, around 700 B.C., the region was occupied by several societies trading and raiding, exchanging traditions and ceramics and otherwise interacting. Their elites forged alliances and perhaps intermarried.
 The Olmec, renowned for their monumental sculpture, spread their influence far inland from their base on the Gulf Coast and were once thought to be the dominant culture. The Maya were emerging in the south. Around Oaxaca, the Zapotec were creating an advanced culture. And Chiapas was home then, as it still is, to people sharing the Zoque language.
 Dr. Bachand noted that many artifacts in the tomb were similar or identical to those found at the imposing Olmec ruins of La Venta, in Tabasco. ''Did these people come from La Venta?'' he said. ''Or were they local people who simply reflected their interactions with the Olmec? This is the $10 million question.''
 But aspects of the burials differed from the Olmec culture, he said. Some pottery and ritual practices appeared to be in an indigenous style. The tomb's construction -- a stone wall on one side, clay on the others -- was unlike that of the few known Olmec tombs.
 In a preliminary interpretation, Dr. Bachand said the culture of the tomb builders had Olmec roots, suggesting a need for further research at La Venta. But he raised the possibility that the discovery evoked beginnings of a distinct Zoque culture, in which case, he said, the origin of some early Mesoamerican traditions may not be Olmec or Maya but Zoque, a previously underrated society.
 Elsa M. Redmond, an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said evidence from the Chiapa de Corzo tomb ''definitely supports'' an emergent consensus among Mesoamerican scholars that the Olmec influence in this formative period, though widespread, was not singular. The view of the Olmec as a ''mother culture,'' she said, has been generally replaced by a ''sister culture'' model.
 This school of thought, elaborated by Kent V. Flannery and Joyce Marcus, anthropologists at the University of Michigan, holds that many contemporaneous cultures in ancient Mexico shared technologies and traditions arising not so much from one source, like the Olmec, as from independent responses to needs and beliefs or through a complex mix of social and economic interactions.
 In these ''parallel developments,'' Dr. Redmond said, ''similar kinds of architecture, ritual and elaborate tomb paraphernalia appeared in their particular cultures.''
 She praised Dr. Bachand's excavations at a site that has long been neglected, and was curious to find out the identity of the woman on the landing beyond the inner sanctum. If she was the ruler's wife, as her lavish accouterments might indicate, why was she left to spend eternity outside her husband's tomb?

HEADLINE: Scaled-Back Summer For Metropolitan Opera

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Tough economic times have kept the Metropolitan Opera to a reduced summer season for the third year in a row. The Met said on Monday that it would put on six free recitals in parks across the five boroughs of New York, from July 12 to July 29. It called the performers, to be accompanied by piano, ''rising stars''; the established star Nathan Gunn will sing on the first program. The Met stopped its tradition of presenting full-length operas in concert after the summer of 2007 for budgetary reasons, presenting a gala concert in 2008 and recitals in 2009. The Met also said it would show 10 high-definition broadcasts in the Lincoln Center Plaza, Aug. 28 to Sept. 6, with free first-come seating. Details are available at metopera.org/parks.

HEADLINE: Catholic Museum's Angels Fail to Save It

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN and ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
In many ways, the opening of the National Museum of Catholic Art and History in East Harlem was a kind of miracle.
 It was founded by a single mother without a college degree, much experience in arts administration or any affiliation with the New York Archdiocese. But the woman, Christina Cox, had a deep passion for the project and a number of powerful friends.
 Over the years, her friends helped the museum take in more than $9 million in revenue, almost half of it in grants from New York State, which predicted that the institution would bring tourists, jobs and vitality to East Harlem.
 But after five years in operation, few visitors and mounting debt, the museum quietly closed last year. The building, on East 115th Street, is for sale, with a list price of just under $5 million, and Ms. Cox said she hoped to use any proceeds to relocate to Washington. 
 ''The museum is not over,'' she said, ''so the money is not wasted.''
 Not everyone in East Harlem agrees. 
 Despite the money and the promises, ''we end up with nothing,'' said Rafael Merino, director of marketing for the nonprofit East Harlem Business Capital Corporation. 
 The Catholic museum was never a prominent cultural attraction. But its short life in New York is a parable of what can go wrong in the distribution of public funds for the arts.
 From the outset, the museum was an improbable pursuit. Its collection was spotty, Ms. Cox's training was slim, and the chosen site, in an old parish school building, was far from the culture world's beaten path. 
 Nonetheless, Ms. Cox's supporters included prominent people. Alfred E. Smith IV, the chairman of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, sat on the museum board. The developers Donald Trump and Jerry Speyer gave it money. Bill Clinton and Regis Philbin attended a fund-raiser for the museum. Rao's, the famous Italian restaurant around the corner, often did the catering. 
 Chief among Ms. Cox's benefactors was Edward J. Malloy, a labor leader who, until recently, led the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, which represents more than 200,000 workers. Mr. Malloy has long had relationships with mayors and governors alike, and it was he, as chairman of the museum, who pushed for money to renovate the old school.
 ''Upon completion, the museum will become an important cultural institution in the city,'' Mr. Malloy wrote Deputy Mayor Randy Levine in November 1999, ''and part of the economic revitalization of East Harlem.''
 New York City provided $173,000 in operating subsidies over the years. The federal government gave $260,000 in empowerment zone grants. The big boost, though, came from Gov. George E. Pataki, who arranged for $2 million in financing in 2002 and another $2 million in 2003. 
 The first state money to Ms. Cox's museum came just months after the attorney general's office found that she had made $86,000 worth of ''inappropriate and extravagant expenditures,'' including on personal travel, furnishings and entertainment, with museum funds, a sum she agreed to pay back.
 The museum opened in 1995, occupying temporary space in several Manhattan office buildings. In 1998 it moved to East Harlem, where it began leasing and renovating the former Our Lady of Mount Carmel School, a rundown building that private donations, government grants and donated labor from unions helped transform into a state-of-the-art exhibition space. The museum's Web site, nmcah.org, values the renovations at $15 million, though Ms. Cox said the cost may have been less.
 After the building opened to the public in 2003, visitors found an eclectic collection held together by its mission of illustrating Roman Catholic influence on art and history: bronze angels by Salvador Dali; a portrait of John F. Kennedy; a collection of 17th- and 18th-century Latin American paintings; a gallery of works that depicted nuns, including one of Sally Field as the Flying Nun.
 The pride of the collection was ''The Betrayal of the Christ,'' one of four painted depictions of Christ's arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane that have been attributed to Anthony Van Dyck, the Flemish master. It was lent in 1994 by Charles R. Walters, the owner of a medical supply company, who said he had no room for the large painting in his home.
 But even this part of the museum's story is not without its complications. Three months ago a lawyer from California sued the museum in federal court in Manhattan, asserting that the painting was really his. The lawyer, Barney Shiotani, said he had been awarded it in 1992 as a creditor of a bankrupt company.
 The suit contends that the painting disappeared, apparently from storage, through the actions of ''unknown third parties'' who obtained it through ''theft, conversion or fraud.''
 Mr. Walters and Ms. Cox said the suit took them by surprise.
 ''I had the painting for 16 years,'' Ms. Cox said. ''There was never a problem.''
 Mr. Walters said he bought the painting sight unseen from the Gallery Rodeo in Beverly Hills, Calif., and had it shipped directly to the museum. The former owner of the gallery, Stephen M. Thompson, said he got the painting from a dealer in the Netherlands.
 ''I'm sure we vetted the provenance on it extensively before we represented it,'' he said.
 Mr. Shiotani's suit does not suggest that the museum, Mr. Walters or the gallery had a role in any misappropriation. After the suit was filed, Ms. Cox gave the painting back to Mr. Walters, who said he had it in storage. 
 Experts have debated whether the painting is really by Van Dyck or is a copy. Mr. Walters said he was aware of the dispute before he bought it.
 ''It's believed by some people that Van Dyck did not paint the whole picture,'' Mr. Walters said, and that students painted part of it.
 The museum, though, presented it unequivocally as a Van Dyck. Ms. Cox said the museum had researched the painting and decided it was not a copy.
 Van Dyck or not, the collection did not draw in East Harlem, though Catholic school groups were regular visitors. In 2005 the museum ran up a nearly $1 million deficit, according to its tax returns. In 2006, the last year for which the museum has filed a return, it reported losing $434,000.
 ''It was hard to pull up there,'' she said. ''It worked for a long time until we had the economy crash.''
 No one seems more disappointed by the outcome than Ms. Cox. She says the idea for the museum came to her in the early 1990s while in St. Patrick's Cathedral, where it struck her -- she sees the hand of God in this -- that America needed an institution devoted to Catholic culture. 
 She said she subsequently traveled to Rome and secured Pope John Paul II's blessing. But officials of the Archdiocese of New York later tried to block her use of the term Catholic in the museum's name because it did not want people to think it was affiliated with the church. 
 Ms. Cox's previous experience in the visual arts was as a sales representative at Dyansen Gallery in Trump Tower and what she described as additional work arranging exhibits for embassies. She had also worked as an actress and a model after leaving Rockland Community College in 1970 without her degree.
 In 2001, a year before the state began aiding the museum, The Village Voice published articles that questioned her credentials. But she defended them in an interview several weeks ago. 
 ''I know how to write a press release, how to hang, have a fund-raiser and how to manage,'' she said. ''I have a passion, a personal concern for what to do with all this Christian art.''
 Ms. Cox, who received more than $100,000 a year in salary for several years as director, said she now earned nothing for her work for the museum. The building, which the museum bought from the parish for $725,000 in 2007, was put on the market more than a year ago.
 Warner Johnston, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, which administered the grants made by Governor Pataki, said that under the terms of the grants, the museum was free to sell the building, and the state was not entitled to any proceeds. A lawyer for the museum, Walter Ciacci, said that as a nonprofit organization, the museum must have the sale approved by the attorney general's office.
 The building is priced at $4.9 million, down from $7.9 million, and is under contract. The prospective buyer is a school, Ms. Cox said. Mr. Ciacci estimated that, after paying off the mortgage and other debt, the museum would, at best, clear several hundred thousand dollars from the sale. 
 Ms. Cox said she would use what was left to relocate the museum to Washington, where the organization was putting on three exhibitions this year. ''I want to be national,'' she said.
 State Senator Jose M. Serrano, a Democrat who represents East Harlem and is chairman of the Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation Committee, said the plan to relocate was disappointing.
 ''I believe the government should be involved in helping arts organizations and naturally occurring arts communities to thrive, because they do generate revenue, but,'' in this case, he said, ''it does not sound like we got a huge return on our investment.''

HEADLINE: European Vote Nears on Tighter Rules for Foreign Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The growing power of European Union institutions has long been anathema for many British Conservatives. Now those institutions could be a lifeline for the Tories as they battle to keep the hedge fund industry based in London.
 George Osborne, the newly appointed Conservative chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain's coalition government, is heading for his first major challenge as most of the European Union's governments prepare a crackdown on overseas hedge fund managers who do business in Europe. 
 The finance ministers are scheduled to hold a preliminary vote on Tuesday in Brussels on a version of the rules that would require hedge funds to register separately in each European Union country.
 Those rules have been the subject of a fierce lobbying battle over the last eight months by British officials who fear that the rules will erode the position of the City of London as a global financial hub while doing little to protect the financial system.
 Criticism also has come from the United States, where Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has warned that the measures could be discriminatory.
 Even so, Mr. Osborne should be able to rely on a French commissioner for financial services, Michel Barnier, and on a powerful committee from the European Parliament to ensure that the final results mostly reflect London's wish that foreign fund managers continue doing business across the 27-member bloc without more impediments.
 Regulators and lawmakers worldwide are tightening their scrutiny of hedge funds and private equity firms on the grounds that they may have been partly to blame for the worst financial crisis in a generation. Many in Europe also see the hedge fund and private equity industries as too opaque and secretive.
 That has raised a serious challenge to London, which is the headquarters for the managers of many non-European Union funds and where about 70 percent of hedge funds in Europe are based.
 Britain already won a reprieve in March, when European Union finance ministers delayed a decision on new rules for hedge funds that are part of draft legislation called the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.
 That reprieve allowed Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, to campaign during the general election this month on promises to continue fighting for hedge fund rules that suited Britain.
 But countries like Germany, France and Spain have continued to back tougher rules on foreign funds.
 Elena Salgado, the Spanish finance minister, told reporters Monday that she expected governments to make a preliminary decision on hedge funds on Tuesday.
 The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said in comments reported Monday that governments would have to outvote Britain on hedge funds on Tuesday.
 Even so, Britain probably will be able to lobby other branches of the European lawmaking structure as efforts get under way this week to create a single version of the bill.
 Ideally, British officials would like rules that allow funds based in countries with roughly equivalent standards of financial regulation to be given automatic permission to operate in Europe.
 In reality, Britain probably will have to settle for a system that puts somewhat higher thresholds on foreign funds and gives a European agency -- probably the European Commission -- the responsibility to decide which funds from which countries are eligible to do business across the bloc.
 Mr. Barnier, the commissioner who will continue to have a role in helping to draft the bill, suggested Monday that he favored a version of the legislation under consideration by the European Parliament and currently favored by British officials.
 ''I assure you I am still in favor of equal treatment between fund managers,'' Mr. Barnier said at a news conference in Brussels.
 ''That's why we put forward this idea of a passport,'' said Mr. Barnier, referring to one version of accreditation for managers to do business across Europe on the same basis as funds based in the Union.
 The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, agreed late on Monday on its version of the legislation, which includes some of the concessions sought by Britain, including the passport provision.
 A final agreement could take some months. Mr. Barnier said he would seek a ''dynamic compromise,'' and he emphasized that his views on how to regulate hedge funds were far closer to those of the parliamentary committee than to those of governments like Spain's.

HEADLINE: U.S. Visit Gives Calderon Chance to Show Resilience to a Concerned Neighbor

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- If President Felipe Calderon of Mexico looks a little preoccupied during the state dinner President Obama has planned for him in Washington this week, it would not be hard to understand why.
 One of Mr. Calderon's close friends was recently kidnapped. Blood was found in the man's vehicle. His whereabouts remain unknown.
 Beyond that, a candidate from Mr. Calderon's center-right National Action Party in the state of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas, was shot dead last week, one of a plethora of gory attacks that have appeared on the front pages of the Mexican newspapers and are presumed to be drug related. 
 When Mr. Calderon addresses a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, he will face a tricky task: How can he discuss the violence in his country with enough urgency to secure more assistance from Washington but also reassure American lawmakers that Mexico is not spinning out of control? 
 The answer, his aides say, is to walk a fine line, acknowledging the problem while highlighting the progress that has been made: Arrests, drug and gun seizures and extraditions to the United States are all up significantly since Mr. Calderon came to office. 
 But drug-related violence is up as well, a trend Mr. Calderon attributes to desperate organized crime groups fighting among themselves and lashing out at the authorities as the government boxes them in. 
 Mr. Calderon's government says it expects the bloodshed to decline in the coming months as it finally brings the drug cartels under control. The Drug Enforcement Administration, while a big cheerleader of Mr. Calderon's crackdown, is somewhat less optimistic. It predicts it will take into next year to quell the violence. Critics consider both those estimates to be unrealistic.
 On immigration, Mr. Calderon will make clear that he opposes Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants. He probably will not mention that the issue is a personal one, since he has relatives, some of them who crossed the border illegally, living in the United States.
 ''Much like you,'' he told supporters a few years back in the state of Zacatecas, which sends many migrants to the United States, ''I have cousins in California, in-laws in New Mexico and uncles in Chicago that emigrated, that struggle and that live in the United States, many of them hand to mouth.''
 Though the two governments are at odds on a variety of issues, including the immigration crackdown and a dispute over allowing Mexican trucks to enter the United States, relations between Mr. Calderon and Mr. Obama are close, say aides on both sides. The state dinner that Mr. Obama will hold for Mr. Calderon on Wednesday is evidence, since such events have been rare in the Obama presidency.
 Here at home, Mr. Calderon finds his government criticized for every decapitation, for every shootout, for every kidnapping that occurs across Mexico, and there have been many.
 ''The only battle in which we are not advancing well is the battle of perception,'' Mr. Calderon acknowledged in an interview with Reuters last week.
 He brushed aside criticism of his frontal assault on the drug cartels, in which he has deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to hot spots across the country to buttress police forces that are considered infiltrated by organized crime. Mr. Calderon's critics contend that his approach has been too militaristic and not focused enough on reducing the economic conditions that make it easy for criminals to recruit young people.
 ''This has to be done because the alternative is to leave people in the hands of criminals, to turn a blind eye, pretend nothing is happening, leave them open territory so they end up finishing off communities,'' Mr. Calderon said of his approach during the Reuters interview. ''That I will not allow.''
 Mr. Calderon keeps a close eye on the drug war, holding regular strategy sessions with his national security staff and even personally intervening on law enforcement matters. He played a role last week in the quick release of the wife of one of Mexico's top traffickers because of concern that her detention would prompt a round of reprisal attacks, said officials briefed on the matter.
 Lately, Mexico's heavily armed traffickers appear to be taking aim at politicians and political hopefuls. 
 Jose Guajardo Varela, who was running for mayor of Valle Hermoso, a Mexican border town near Brownsville, Tex., was in his farm supplies business on Thursday when gunmen barged in with guns blazing, killing him and his son. He had ignored warnings to drop out of the race.
 The disappearance of Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, a power broker and friend of Mr. Calderon who ran for president in 1994, comes amid a spike in drug-related killings, which approach 23,000 since Mr. Calderon began his drug war in 2006.
 Mr. Calderon, who delayed his trip to Spain on Saturday to monitor reports of Mr. Fernandez de Cevallos's disappearance, said he had ordered his public security heads to conduct a thorough investigation of the case.
 Mr. Calderon will almost certainly remind Congress that the American public's demand for illicit drugs and the many American guns smuggled across the border into Mexico fuel the violence gripping his country. 
 ''He should ask members of Congress what they would do if 6,000 Americans were killed'' in drug-related violence ''by guns that came from Mexico,'' said Robert Pastor, co-director of the Center for North American Studies at American University in Washington. ''We would say, 'You close down those gun shops.' '' 
 But Mr. Calderon may also argue that the situation in Mexico is not as bad as it appears from following the doom-and-gloom news media. 
 Speaking in Spain on Sunday, Mr. Calderon said Mexico was nowhere near as threatened by drug interests as Colombia was when presidential candidates were killed and vast swaths of the country were controlled by the cartels. 
 Mr. Calderon also often points to the homicide statistic for Mexico as a whole, which at 12 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants translates into a lower murder rate than the city he will visit this week: Washington, D.C.

HEADLINE: Democrats Shifting Focus Back to Jobs Creation

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Perhaps the only thing slower than the economy in creating new jobs is the process by which the White House and Congress are creating new jobs bills.
 A year that Democrats decreed would be about ''jobs, jobs, jobs'' has produced a far different check list as its sixth month nears: health care, financial regulation, energy, a nuclear arms treaty and a Supreme Court vacancy, as well as investigations into a mine accident, a calamitous oil spill, a failed terrorist attack in Times Square and alleged Wall Street fraud.
 That crowded calendar of priorities largely explains why the employment bills have languished, Democrats say. They hope to change that starting this week. 
 The House, which in December narrowly passed a $154 billion stimulus package that hit a wall in the Senate, plans to debate a substitute of at least that size that Democratic Congressional leaders have negotiated; it would extend myriad popular business tax breaks and aid for the unemployed and hard-hit states.
 And on Tuesday, President Obama will head out of town -- to a steel-pipe plant near Youngstown, Ohio -- to highlight the local benefits of the original $787 billion, two-year recovery act and to show that he is indeed thinking about jobs.
 But the legislative lassitude to date is due to more than the Democrats' distractions. With Republicans nearly united in opposition, a bigger factor is the Democrats' divisions both in Congress and within the White House over what and how much to do for an economy that has begun creating jobs, if too slowly for the politicians in an election year, and over where to find the revenues to offset the costs of more tax cuts and spending.
 Those disputes in turn are rooted in the contradictory demands of these unusual economic times, when the nation is sluggishly emerging from a recession just as it is entering a long-predicted period of rising debt due to an aging population and inadequate revenues. 
 Many economists agree that the economy needs a final infusion from the government to encourage skittish employers to hire, banks to lend to small businesses, and states and cities to keep their teachers and others on the public payroll. 
 Yet even before the European Union and the International Monetary Fund bailed out Greece to prevent another financial contagion, the mounting debt of the United States was prompting calls at home for major reductions in the budget deficit, including from the administration and some Democrats in Congress.
 With the economy showing signs of growth, juggling the competing demands for short-term deficits and long-term deficit reduction has gotten much harder for Mr. Obama and his allies in Congress. 
 ''It's very important for policymakers to provide significant support to the economy -- by which I mean deficit spending -- until employment is definitively moving along,'' perhaps late this year, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com. He recommended at least $80 billion more for aid to states and the unemployed, which would bring total stimulus spending and tax cuts to more than $1 trillion.
 ''But,'' he added, ''I think it is time to be more disciplined. I think it's time to pay for it.''
 That is just what many moderate and conservative Democrats have demanded as the price of their support, in keeping with a new pay-as-you-go law mandating offsetting savings for new spending or tax cuts. 
 But that breaks with the economic theory that it is counterproductive for the government to raise taxes or cut spending when it is trying to stimulate job creation. And after weeks of backroom debates, Congressional Democrats say they tentatively have agreed that ''pay-fors'' will not be required to offset some safety net programs -- an extension through this year of emergency unemployment compensation, subsidies for those who pay to keep the health insurance they had on the job, and perhaps Medicaid assistance for states.
 Even so, the remaining costs for business tax breaks, especially for struggling small businesses, outstrip the sources of revenues that Democrats can easily agree to.
 Yet so great is the election-year appetite to help small business, and to show toughness toward Wall Street, that Senate Democrats may drop their opposition to House Democrats' repeated calls for higher taxes on managers of hedge funds and private equity firms.
 The proposal, which has White House support, would raise up to $25 billion over 10 years by requiring that partners pay ordinary income tax rates -- up to 39.6 percent, assuming the Bush tax cuts expire this year -- on their ''carried interest'' in the profits of a partnership. Investment managers now pay the lower capital gains rate, a maximum of 15 percent.
 That would pay most of the cost for this year of extending the business tax cuts, including a perennial credit for corporations' research and development expenses. Then, however, lawmakers must figure out how to pay for two or three additional measures on Democrats' agenda. First is a package for small businesses, including an exemption from capital gains taxes for investors in qualified ventures. Next up, if there is time and offsetting savings, is a ''green jobs'' bill with tax incentives for manufacturers of energy-saving products.
 A priority for some Democrats, however, is a proposal from Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Representative George Miller of California for $25 billion to avert layoffs of teachers; a small amount would go to retain firefighters and police officers. Estimates suggest up to 300,000 teachers could lose jobs for the coming school year, starting weeks before election day.
 Some Democrats complain that Mr. Obama has been ineffective in speaking out, while administration officials say the legislative dawdling confuses voters. And a campaign of the Democratic National Committee to label Democrats as the ''Results Party'' has been widely criticized, since unemployment remains near 10 percent.
 ''It says you're out of touch,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a party pollster. Based on voter surveys, he and John Podesta, the former Clinton administration chief of staff, are urging a populist message that Democrats are fighting for the middle class against corporations. 
 Working-class voters, Mr. Greenberg said, ''are desperate for a message about who we're for.''

HEADLINE: Senate Votes For a Clear Credit Score

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Anyone rejected for a credit card, car loan or department store charge account has most likely discovered a frustrating aspect of the government-mandated, free credit reports: the glaring absence of the numerical credit score that lenders rely on to make their decisions. 
 That now stands to change as a result of an amendment adopted by the Senate on Monday as it moved closer toward completing a sweeping financial regulatory bill. 
 The Senate, by a voice vote, approved a proposal by Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, to require that credit reports include the numerical score, which by the most common measure ranges from 300 to 850. Obtaining a score from the major credit reporting bureaus that calculate them typically costs up to $15.95 for each score. 
 ''This I believe will empower consumers, it will increase the financial literacy in our country,'' Mr. Udall said. ''It's a win-win.'' His proposal would require the score to be provided if it was used to deny credit, required a higher interest rate on a loan, or prevented an applicant from being hired for a job. 
 Mr. Udall's proposal was one of several amendments addressed Monday in the financial regulations bill, which may be wrapped up later this week. 
 By voice vote, the Senate also approved an amendment to ease proposed restrictions that critics said would cut off so-called angel investing -- in which individual investors provide start-up capital to small businesses that typically do not have access to more traditional financing. 
 The original bill included provisions intended to root out fraud, including a 120-day waiting period for certain investors to allow for a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but supporters of the amendment said the restrictions would block crucial start-up capital.
 By voice vote, the Senate also approved an amendment by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Commerce Committee, that preserves the existing authority of the Federal Trade Commission in enforcing consumer protection laws and requires the commission to coordinate with a new consumer financial protection bureau that would be created by the regulatory legislation. 
 By a vote of 94-0, the Senate also approved a largely symbolic amendment by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, seeking to prevent federal money from being used by the International Monetary Fund to bail out foreign governments. 
 Mr. Cornyn's proposal may not survive when the Senate bill is reconciled with the version of the financial regulation legislation approved by the House in December. But it is part of an overall Republican political strategy to keep attention focused on unpopular government bailouts, which are helping to foster an anti-incumbent mood. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, is intent on finishing the financial regulatory legislation this week. And in a speech on Monday he warned about the consequences of delay, a message clearly intended for Republicans who have worked to draw out the debate even though they agree with the bill and expect it to be adopted. 
 ''The end must come,'' Mr. Reid said. ''The time has come to begin work sending this to conference so we can have a bill go to the president.'' 
 Mr. Reid also emphasized other bills awaiting work by the Senate including a jobs measure, supplemental spending bills, federal emergencies like the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and a long list of presidential nominees awaiting confirmation. 
 The requirement that credit reports include a numerical score has little to do with the broader regulatory legislation, which is intended to address the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. But its adoption, by an overwhelming margin, underscored the keen desire by lawmakers to support pro-consumer initiatives in an election year. 
 Currently, the free, government-mandated credit reports show the status and payment history of outstanding loans and other obligations, including credit cards, charge accounts, mortgages and car loans, as well as delinquencies like unpaid medical bills, that have been referred to a collection agency. Such information is used by the credit reporting bureaus to devise a credit score, but the score is not disclosed in the free report.
 The broader legislation would impose the most far-reaching overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory since the aftermath of the Great Depression. 
 It would bring new transparency and tight rules to the trading of derivatives, the complex instruments at the center of the 2008 collapse. It would require hedge funds to register for regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And it would create a consumer protection bureau to police lenders and their business practices. 
 But most of the more than 1,400 pages of legislation offer little that is tangible to regular consumers -- a point that was highlighted by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, in pushing for another amendment that would gave states the right to limit credit card interest rates, regardless of where the issuing bank is located. 
 ''This bill that we're looking at right now is very esoteric and technical,'' Mr. Whitehouse said in a speech on Monday. ''It engages in things like trying to rebuild the Glass-Steagall firewall, trying to properly regulate collateralized debt obligations, trying to put the appropriate leverage limitations on banks.'' 
 Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era bill that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in the investment business, had largely been dismantled by legislation in 1999. 
 Mr. Whitehouse added, ''Here's a deliverable that they can take right home, that they will see a difference as soon as their states respond. They can be protected from these outrageous 30 percent interest rates as a result of this bill.'' 
 Mr. Whitehouse's proposal, to be voted on this week, effectively seeks to overturn a 1978 Supreme Court decision allowing credit card companies to charge interest rates allowed in the state where they are located, regardless of where cardholders live. As a result, cardholders often do not benefit from state limits on interest rates.

HEADLINE: Today's Primaries Offer New Clues

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
It's decision day for voters in Pennsylvania, Arkansas and Kentucky, where the outcome of Senate primary contests on Tuesday will deliver more clues to the puzzle that is the midterm election of 2010.
 Two Democratic senators, with combined Washington experience of nearly 50 years, will discover if they have assembled strong-enough coalitions to withstand an anti-incumbent surge or if their careers will effectively end. And an open Senate seat in Kentucky will help show whether Tea Party advocates can produce an electoral victory.
 The contests, taken together, offer the biggest trove of information so far this year about the mood of the electorate. Here are some of the top races - and places - to watch. 
 Pennsylvania
 Senator Arlen Specter, a Democrat, will learn if the political survival skills he has called upon so many times during his five-term career in the Senate are still operable. A year ago, he was a Republican, but he switched parties with the blessing of the White House. Voters in the Democratic primary will decide whether they believe his conversion.
 First, this is a test of Mr. Specter's dexterity and his ability to persuade the voters of Pennsylvania that his seniority brings value to the state. But it also poses a test for President Obama - and the political arm of the White House - to help deliver a victory.
 Representative Joe Sestak, who ignored the demands of several party leaders to stay out of the race, has been steadily gaining ground on Mr. Specter. A final television advertisement by Mr. Sestak - showing George W. Bush endorsing Mr. Specter six years ago - has been run repeatedly, amplifying doubts that were already in the air about the political expediency of Mr. Specter's party switch.
 A special election to choose a successor to Representative John P. Murtha, a Democrat, who died in February, is also taking place in the state's 12th Congressional District. It is an early test for themes of the fall campaign, like, have Democrats done enough to improve the economy?
 But the Specter-Sestak race has drawn the most attention. The winner faces Pat Toomey, a former Republican member of Congress, in the fall.
 Mr. Obama filmed television and radio advertisements for Mr. Specter, but he chose not to dash off to Pennsylvania in the closing days of the campaign, as he has for many other Democratic candidates. (Mr. Specter asked, aides said, but the White House opted not to send him.) Mr. Specter is relying on a strong showing in Philadelphia that can outweigh Mr. Sestak's advantages among liberal voters in cities across the state.
 Arkansas
 Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat, has endured an unusually fierce storm. Organized labor has lined up against her, with unions investing nearly $7 million (most of it in stinging television advertisements) to deny her a third term. Her opposition to a climate change proposal and her vote against the final step of the health care bill increased her vulnerability by alienating many liberals, but her role in demanding tougher regulations of banks may have helped revive her candidacy.
 Lt. Gov. Bill Halter drew the support of nearly every left-leaning group in his primary challenge to Mrs. Lincoln. He does not have a legislative voting record - a godsend in this political environment - but he has sought to make the case that he would be a truer Democrat than their current senator.
 Mr. Halter was responsible for the bringing the state a lottery that finances college scholarships. His constituency could well include grateful parents whose children are in college because of his persistence.
 A variety of polls show that Mrs. Lincoln has managed to withstand an onslaught of attacks. But the question is not only whether she will win, but also whether she will surpass the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff election on June 8.
 As the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Mrs. Lincoln is hoping for a strong showing in rural areas, while Mr. Halter has focused on Democrats in Little Rock, Fayetteville and other cities.
 A spirited race has also unfolded on the Republican side, which will determine whether Representative John Boozman or one of several challengers will face the winner of the Lincoln-Halter primary. In the fall, the seat could still be the Republicans' to lose.
 Kentucky
 Rand Paul, an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, has become one of the most visible symbols of the Tea Party. A victory in the Republican Senate primary, he tells his audiences, will help demonstrate the power of Tea Party advocates, many of whom were first drawn to him through the popularity of his father, Representative Ron Paul, the Texas Republican whose 2008 presidential bid helped inspire the movement.
 Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state, has not served in Washington, but he earned the endorsements of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, and a variety of other establishment party leaders in his quest to fill the seat held by Senator Jim Bunning, who is retiring.
 ''If Rand were Randy Smith, he wouldn't have the money or media connections of his dad,'' Mr. Grayson said in a weekend interview, lamenting the tough atmosphere. ''I get lumped into this 'It's an anti-incumbent year,' but I'm not an incumbent.''
 Mr. Greyson, who is from the heavily-populated northern part of the state, is hoping to remain competitive with Mr. Paul there but deliver a stronger showing in the Republican strongholds in rural areas and southern Kentucky.
 If there is one wrinkle in this race, it could come from Kentucky election law.
 The state has among the most restrictive voting rules in the country. To participate in the Republican primary, voters had to register with the party by Dec. 31, which could exclude libertarians, independents and even disaffected Democrats who may have been attracted to Mr. Paul's candidacy in the last five months.
 If Mr. Paul prevails, he faces the winner of the Democratic primary: Jack Conway, the state attorney general, or Daniel Mongiardo, the lieutenant governor. And if he ultimately wins in the fall, would Senator Rand Paul, who relishes his reputation as a rabble-rouser, support his home-state senator, Mr. McConnell, as the Republican leader?
 ''I have never really said I would not support him,'' Mr. Paul said in a weekend interview. ''I don't see myself as going up there and being the one fly in the ointment.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: End of 'Law & Order'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''A Separate but Equally Important Loss'' (news article, May 15), you highlight the economic hole left in New York by the cancellation of ''Law & Order.'' 
 But the emotional loss is just as palpable; simply put, it was really cool to see them filming in front of your office or apartment. The crew was always courteous, the actors gracious (though focused), and the producers seemed to do everything humanly possible to minimize the disruption to the neighborhood.
 Rather than cordon off entire streets, Dick Wolf, the show's producer, seemed to understand that if you treat New Yorkers respectfully, they'll pretty much stay out of your way and let you do your job.
 Mr. Wolf was once quoted as saying, ''The light in California is different.'' By filming on the streets of the city, he let the real star of the show shine brightly.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS SKEPTICAL ON IRANIAN DEAL FOR NUCLEAR FUEL

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MICHAEL SLACKMAN; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Michael Slackman from Cairo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States, Europe and Russia responded with extreme skepticism to Iran's announcement on Monday that it had reached an agreement to ship roughly half of its nuclear fuel to Turkey, saying they would continue to press for new sanctions against Tehran. 
 Nonetheless, officials from several countries said that the deal, negotiated with the leaders of Turkey and Brazil, was a deftly timed attempt to throw the sanctions effort off track. 
 The terms were similar to those of an accord made with the West last October that fell apart when Iran backtracked. Since then, Iran has added considerably to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, meaning that it would keep on Iranian territory about half of its current supply -- or about enough fuel for one nuclear weapon if it chose to make one. The earlier deal was attractive to Washington because it would have deprived Tehran of enough known fuel to make a weapon, leaving breathing space for negotiations.
 Rejecting the new deal, however, could make President Obama appear to be blocking a potential compromise. And the deal shows how Brazil and Turkey, which for their own economic interests oppose sanctions, may derail a fragile international consensus to increase pressure on Iran. 
 The sanctions are aimed primarily at an issue that the deal does not address: Iran's refusal to halt further enrichment, as the United Nations Security Council has demanded for four years, or to answer international inspectors' questions about evidence suggesting research into possible weapons designs and related experiments. The inspectors have also been blocked from visiting many suspect facilities and laboratories, and from interviewing key scientists and engineers. 
 The deal agreed to Monday in Tehran calls for Iran to ship 2,640 pounds of low-enriched uranium to Turkey, where it would be stored for one year. In exchange, Iran would have the right to receive about 265 pounds of uranium enriched to 20 percent by other countries for use in a reactor that makes isotopes for treating Iranian cancer patients.
 But the White House noted that even while striking the deal, Iran insisted on Monday that it would continue its new effort to enrich fuel at a higher level, taking it closer to bomb-grade material. ''While it would be a positive step for Iran to transfer low-enriched uranium off of its soil as it agreed to do last October, Iran said today that it would continue its 20 percent enrichment, which is a direct violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.
 Mr. Gibbs made clear that the administration would continue to press forward with sanctions until, as he said, Iran demonstrates ''through deeds -- and not simply words -- its willingness to live up to international obligations or face consequences, including sanctions.'' 
 A senior administration official who has been deeply involved in the Iran standoff said the agreement announced Monday ''is not a solution for the core of the Iranian enrichment program.'' 
 Sergei B. Ivanov, the deputy prime minister of Russia, was similarly skeptical at a lunchtime speech in Washington. He said he expected the sanctions resolution to ''be voted in the near future,'' and said that the new Iranian accord should not be ''closely linked'' to the sanctions effort. ''Iran should absolutely open up'' to inspectors, he said. That statement was significant because Russia had been reluctant to join sanctions several months ago. China, which has also been hesitant, issued no statement. 
 White House officials were clearly angered at the leaders of Turkey and Brazil, whom Mr. Obama had met personally in Washington during last month's Nuclear Security Summit to urge them to be careful not to give the Iranians a pretext to avoid complying with United Nations demands. Mr. Obama followed up those meetings with detailed letters in the last week of April outlining specific concerns, a senior administration official said. But those letters appeared to have limited influence on the outcome.
 Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Namik Tan, described the agreement as a ''confidence-building measure,'' and said he was disappointed in the Obama administration's reaction. ''I would have expected a more encouraging statement,'' he said. 
 ''We don't believe in sanctions, and I don't believe anybody can challenge us, and certainly not the United States,'' Mr. Tan said. ''They don't work.''
 Iranian officials applauded the deal as a breakthrough, with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saying at a news conference in Tehran that the agreement would be ''to the benefit of all nations who want to live freely and independently.''
 Iranian officials said they would send a letter confirming the deal to the International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations within a week. 
 ''This shows that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons, but rather peaceful nuclear technology,'' said Ramin Mehmanparast, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a televised news conference. ''Such interactions must replace a confrontational approach.'' 
 Diplomats in Vienna said the atomic agency had not been formally notified about the deal, but added that Tehran's agreement to a swap outside its own territory was potentially significant. 
 Yet many analysts suggested that the deal was meant to transfer blame for the conflict to the West, while derailing sanctions that had appeared possible within weeks. 
 ''Iran has a history of forging a deal and then going back on it,'' said Emad Gad, an expert in international relations at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''It lets the situation get really tense and then reaches an agreement.''
 There appear to be reasons to be skeptical. In Tehran, the Foreign Ministry spokesman told a person attending the news conference that Iran would not, for example, suspend its program to enrich uranium to 20 percent -- closer to weapons grade. 
 Iran has said that its nuclear program is peaceful, while the West has charged that it is aimed at building weapons. 
 As international pressure for new sanctions grows, Iran is preparing for the June 12 anniversary of last year's disputed presidential election, which led to months of protests and conflict. 
 The earlier agreement fell apart under political pressure in Iran when nearly every political faction criticized it as compromising Iran's right to nuclear energy. Then and now, Iran's negotiating team argued that the deal was in the nation's interest because it effectively confirmed Iran's right to enrich uranium.
 If successful, the agreement would enhance and underscore the continued rise of Turkey and Brazil as global forces. Ferai Tinc, a political analyst writing in the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, said, ''Ankara was neither a full supporter of Iran nor an advocate of violence and sanctions against it, but stood strongly for promoting a diplomatic resolution.''
Online Correction: May 17, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Earlier versions of this article misidentified the newspaper running an article by the Turkish analyst Ferai Tinc. The newspaper should be Hurriyet, not Millyet.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours in Learning: Creating Travel Itineraries Across the Curriculum

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | "36 Hours" in geology, history, social studies, civics, language arts, science, health and fine arts. Developing curricular projects using the "36 Hours" template from the New York Times Travel section. 

 BODY:
Overview | How can looking at curricular material through the lens of travel illuminate crucial themes and ideas in any subject? In this lesson, students consider the elements of The New York Times travel series "36 Hours," and then do their own "36 Hours" projects. They conclude by holding a "travel fair" to share their real or virtual itineraries. 
Materials | Student journals, copies of New York Times articles, research materials.
Warm-Up | Students respond to the following prompt in their journals:
Imagine that out-of-town friends or family members who have never been to our city are coming to visit for a day and a half (36 hours). What would you want to make sure you showed them? Make a list of destinations - interesting sites, fun activities, good restaurants and shops, etc. Start by brainstorming and then, if necessary, whittle down your list to a manageable size for a 36-hour visit.
If necessary, encourage students to think about where to go during the day and evening, fair- and foul-weather options and so on, and to think about the list as an actual itinerary for a day-and-a-half visit.
After a few minutes, bring the class together. Have students share their favorite destinations, and list them on the board. Ask: Why did you choose these destinations? What criteria did you use? Are there any popular local sites that you left out? If so, why? What do you notice about our master list? Did you tend to nominate the same sites, or was there a bit of variety? Why do you think that is? Would your list differ if the "visitors" were not friends or family, but instead strangers, like a potential employer or a college interviewer? Would your criteria change? How would your list change if your visitors had more time to spend?
Related | The article "36 Hours in Kansas City, Mo." is a travel plan for visitors. (You may wish to substitute another piece from the "36 Hours" series, like one about a nearby location or a place your class has studied.) In the piece, Charly Wilder provides an overview of the local flavor before delving into specific recommendations:
Kansas City is known for its barbecue, bebop and easy-does-it Midwestern charm. But a decade-long effort to revitalize the city's downtown has transformed this former jazz mecca, which straddles the Kansas-Missouri border, back into a culturally rich metropolis. The city's standing will be further bolstered next year when the much-anticipated Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts opens, giving a sleek new home to the symphony, opera and ballet. True, Kansas City is no backwater, but don't expect high polish. In fact, it's the city's unvarnished grit that may be its best asset.
Read the article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Can you identify a theme in the destinations that the author chose to highlight?
        
How do think the recommended choices reflect the local vibe? What sense of the place would visitors come away with after following this itinerary?
        
What type of person do you think would enjoy these particular destinations? Why?
        
Which of these destinations do you think would be your favorite? Why?
        
How do you think this travel plan would be different if it were written by a teenager?
Activity | Explain to students that they will use the "36 Hours" template to explore a course topic. Choose from among the following multidisciplinary ideas, or use these suggestions as a jumping-off point for another project. Students should include text as well as photographs, maps and perhaps multimedia, if possible, in their "36 Hours" projects.
And if you do a "36 Hours" project with your students, let us know what you did and how it went.
Geography
Create a 36-hour travel plan for a city, country or region you are studying, being as specific and descriptive as possible. Include detailed coverage of special customs as well as cultural, religious and historical sites of note. Ideas: "36 Hours in Southeast Asia" or "36 Hours in Central America."
History
Create a 36-hour plan to help amateur historians uncover the history of a topic or historical era that you are studying in class. For example, if you are studying personal history, you could create a plan entitled "36 Hours in ______ Family History," focusing on genealogy, including immigration records, grave sites, etc. Or they might focus on a period of crisis like the Bay of Pigs invasion or the start of World War II. Other ideas: "36 Hours in Ancient Rome" or "36 Hours in the Civil War."
Social Studies
Develop a thematic "36 Hours" itinerary that identifies and describes cultural hot spots in your world for real or virtual visitors who are unfamiliar with your way of life or identity. Include relevant "stops," like your kitchen table, a place of worship, a sports field or court, even your computer or cellphone. The goal is to provide sociological insight into your life and world. Or focus on an element of life in the world, like a cultural group or institution. Ideas: "36 Hours as a Freshman" or "36 Hours in the Stock Market."
Civics
Create a travel plan for a visitor who has 36 hours to spend learning about American government. Focus on one crucial physical location with sites relevant to government and rights. Describe what happens at each destination. Who works at these places? What are their responsibilities? What will visitors see when they arrive? Are there symbols they should know? What do these symbols mean? Ideas: "36 Hours in Washington, D.C." or "36 Hours in Philadelphia."
Language Arts
Create a 36-hour travel plan through the setting of a novel or other literary work you are reading in class. If visitors are "traveling" to the novel's setting from a different time or place, be sure to inform them of customs that they should know before arrival. Who might they see in their travels? What symbols might they encounter? Are there places they should avoid? Why? Ideas: "36 Hours in West Egg" or "36 Hours in the Greek Isles."
Science
Create a 36-hour travel plan through a part of the natural world (or universe) that you are studying (a human organ, a cell, a tidal pool, etc.) or that visitors could expect if they were tagging along with another organism (a bee, a raindrop, a piece of food eaten by a human, etc.). Identify any dangers that should be avoided or approached cautiously. Ideas: "36 Hours in the Digestive System," "36 Hours on the Great Barrier Reef" or "36 Hours in a Black Hole."
Health
Illustrate how sugar, alcohol, drugs or another substance affects the human body in the form of a 36-hour travel plan. Once the substance is ingested, what bodily destinations will it visit? How will the body react and change? Ideas: "36 Hours of Cigarette Use" or "36 Hours on a High-Sugar Diet."
Fine Arts
Create a 36-hour travel plan for a visitor who has the power to travel into a work of fine or performance art that you have been studying in class. What specific areas in this piece of art should the visitor be sure to see? Are there symbols that you can help them decipher? Will some places they go be lighter or darker than others? How will the landscape look different than they are used to (will everything look like it is made of cubes or dots, for example)? Ideas: "36 Hours in 'Guernica' " or "36 Hours in the Rodin Sculpture Garden."
Going Further | Hold a "36 Hours" travel fair for the entire class, and consider inviting others to view the projects and/or post them on a school Web site. Invite feedback from visitors, and debrief the process with students. Ask: How did the "36 Hours" template shape your approach to your subject and material? How did it help you? How did it limit you? What did it illuminate?

HEADLINE: Concerns Over Europe Flare Again, Pushing U.S. Shares Lower

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and DAVID JOLLY; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street fell on Tuesday and the euro retreated to a new low, in part after Germany moved to impose tighter regulation of financial markets.
 Germany's Finance Ministry said it would ban naked short-selling in shares of 10 of its most important financial institutions. The ban, which would take effect early Wednesday, would also apply to credit-default swaps and euro government bonds.
 Though a government ban on short-selling is not unprecedented, analysts said Germany's move raised questions that the crisis was getting worse, not better, and that European governments were being forced to take other measures on top of the sweeping rescue package. 
 ''You are pointing a finger at speculators but not addressing the real problems,'' said Win Thin, a senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. ''It is giving a sense to the market that policy makers are flailing. Greece is insolvent; that is what they should be concentrating on.''
 Short-selling allows traders to borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a cheaper price and profit from the difference. In a naked short sale, they sell without borrowing the shares first. 
 News of the ban emerged late in the day in Europe. Earlier, the euro had stabilized and helped to lift stocks, despite indications that the German economy might not be as strong as economists had thought. The euro later fell to 1.2176, its lowest level since April 2006.
 ''The short-selling news is causing another dislocation,'' said Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading for Guggenheim Partners. He added, ''I think that is what has put the selling pressure back into the euro. The euro was having a pretty positive day until then.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 114.88 points, or 1.08 percent, to 10,510.95. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 16.14 points or 1.42 percent, at 1,120.80 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 36.97 points, or 1.57 percent, to 2,317.26.
 All of the components in the Dow were down except Wal-Mart, which rose 98 cents, to $53.71, after it reported quarterly profits were up 10 percent. 
 Financial, materials, technology and consumer-goods sectors were among those that lost ground. Among the most actively traded stocks, Citigroup shares fell 13 cents, to $3.73, and Bank of America dropped 40 cents, to $15.95. Home Depot shares fell 86 cents, to $34.73.
 Commodity prices also fell. Crude oil prices slipped 67 cents, to $69.41 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold was down $2.70 at $1,225.15 an ounce.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1 6/32, to 101 9/32. The yield fell to 3.35 percent, from 3.49 percent late Monday.
 The FTSE 100 index in London was 0.9 percent higher at 5,307.34, and the DAX in Germany was up by 89.01 points, or 1.47 percent, at 6,155.93. The CAC 40 in France was up 73.77 points, or 2.08 percent, at 3,617.32. 
 Uncertainty in the United States market over Europe has been tempered in the last few weeks by economic data that points to an economic recovery, but the new housing and producer price figures released on Tuesday did not send a clear enough message to provide any momentum.
 Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company, said new economic data and corporate results were mostly positive but could not counteract the euro's impact on equity markets. ''The real negative catalyst is what is going on with the euro,'' Mr. Hogan said.
 Housing numbers from the Commerce Department suggested that construction plans had slowed, and the producer price index suggested a benign picture for inflation.
 ''Inflation is not really moving one way or another at this point,'' said James O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global.

HEADLINE: Escapist Fare, Sure, But With Undercurrent

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT and BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
FOR more than two years, the state of the economy has been Topic A on television, from morning shows like ''Today'' to talk shows like ''Oprah'' to news shows like ''60 Minutes.'' But there is one time period from which discussions of the recession, the financial crisis and the other economic woes of the nation -- and the world -- have been virtually absent: prime time.
 As the TV industry spends this upfront week offering advertisers previews of the series planned for the 2010-11 season, there are few programs for prime time that look as if they will reflect economic reality, at least overtly. The big networks are hoping that media buyers will not be interested in dwelling on the bad economic news. 
 But the shows being sold to advertisers do acknowledge -- in quieter, gentler and sometimes indirect ways -- what life in America is like in the second decade of the new century. 
 Themes and story lines involving the economy are subtle, but they are ''definitely there,'' said Steve Sternberg, an independent television analyst who writes a blog, The Sternberg Report.
 For instance, NBC has scheduled a sitcom, ''Outsourced,'' about a young executive who is transferred to India after his Midwestern novelty company moves its call center there. In a clip shown during the NBC upfront presentation on Monday, the dismissed American call center workers were not shown; viewers instead saw the bricks they had tossed through office windows to protest being fired.
 And two hourlong dramas on the NBC schedule, ''Harry's Law'' and ''Outlaw,'' are about powerful legal figures -- one a patent lawyer, the other a Supreme Court justice -- who quit their jobs to fight for the little guy.
 The economy and its implications were not a factor in determining what kinds of shows NBC is placing on its prime-time schedule, Curt King, a spokesman for NBC, part of the NBC Universal unit of General Electric, said on Tuesday in an e-mail message. 
 Similarly, Sal Petruzzi, a spokesman for the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner, said in an e-mail message that the TBS and TNT cable channels, which are to describe their fall schedules at a presentation on Wednesday, ''do not have any new shows that address or look at the economy'' or ''people's changed attitudes about life, work, materialism as a result of the recession.''
 Among the series that those channels have already announced they would introduce for 2010-11 are ''Franklin & Bash,'' an hourlong comedy-drama for TNT about a pair of young, street-wise lawyers, and ''Glory Daze,'' an hourlong comedy for TBS about college students in the 1980s.
 (It is unclear whether the setting for ''Glory Daze'' will be in the recession years of the early '80s, the boom years of the mid-'80s or the bumpy economy of the end of the '80s.) 
 ABC, owned by the Walt Disney Company, announced on Tuesday that it would schedule three shows that take economic conditions into account. 
 One show is a revival of ''Secret Millionaire,'' which Fox Broadcasting ran for six episodes in late 2008. The reality series, based on a British hit, asks wealthy executives and entrepreneurs to live incognito in poor communities and give away cash to worthy residents.
 ''Off the Map,'' an hourlong medical drama that ABC intends to introduce in midseason, is about idealistic doctors who leave the United States to work at a clinic in South America. 
 And a new police drama for the fall from ABC, ''Detroit 1-8-7,'' is about a homicide unit in the city that has arguably been worst hit by the economic downturn -- a city whose mainstay industry, automobiles, is providing far fewer advertising dollars to the TV networks than during the boom years.
 ''We're really excited about looking at this American city in transition,'' Stephen McPherson, president at the ABC entertainment group unit of ABC, said in a telephone interview, adding that ''Detroit 1-8-7'' would be ''taking over the 'N.Y.P.D. Blue' spot of old,'' at 10 p.m. on Tuesdays. 
 To be sure, there is no federal law that requires the plot lines of prime-time television shows to be relevant to the times. TV has from the beginning been a primarily escapist medium.
 During the civil rights era, for instance, shows with black leading characters like ''I Spy,'' ''Julia'' and ''Room 222'' were scarce. And while ''M*A*S*H'' decried the futility of war during the Vietnam War, the series was set during the Korean War.
 There is also no guarantee that viewers will want to watch prime-time series with topical themes that may hit too close to home. For example, last fall, ABC introduced a sitcom, ''Hank,'' about an unemployed executive, played by Kelsey Grammer. The show was canceled after two months because of poor ratings.
 ''I think the network schedules for next season are loaded with escapist fare,'' Mr. Sternberg, the analyst, said, citing new series like ''Undercovers'' on NBC, about a married couple of super-spies.
 When CBS presents its 2010-11 season on Wednesday, the newcomers are expected to include such purposely escapist fare as an updated version of ''Hawaii Five-O,'' the police drama that was a big hit for the network from 1968 to 1980, and the first sitcom to feature William Shatner, a familiar TV face from popular series like ''Star Trek,'' ''T. J. Hooker'' and ''Boston Legal.''
 The escapist bent is particularly evident in series that are returning from last season, Mr. Sternberg said, like ''Human Target,'' an action drama on Fox. Those shows were developed and introduced when the economy looked more dire than now.

HEADLINE: For Baltimore, Arts District Offers Hope

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- On a recent Sunday afternoon, the Camden Yards complex, containing Oriole Park and the Sports Legends Museum, was crowded. So was the 1st Mariner Arena, where the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus was performing. But a few blocks from the arena, on North Eutaw Street, the sidewalks and most of the storefronts were empty.
 Asked whether this was the proposed arts district, employees of the nearly deserted Starbucks on the corner at 1 North Eutaw Street looked puzzled. But an arts district is what the city hopes the neighborhood will become, with support from state and federal governments. 
 In a letter last March to the National Endowment for the Arts, the city requested a $250,000 grant to help determine the outlines of the district. The letter said Baltimore's ''population, diversity, density and physical size make it an ideal incubator and test ground for new ideas about the intersection of art and community in the 21st century.'' 
 Still, the arts district is very much a 20th-century idea. Ever since SoHo in Manhattan went from industrial to postindustrial chic in the 1970s and '80s, cities have hoped to lure the creative people who bring street life, commerce and, eventually, high real estate prices. And cities have been willing to spend tax money to do so.
 Maryland already has 18 state-approved arts districts, including two in Baltimore. In each district, developers receive property tax reductions for building or renovating arts-related properties. In addition, artists are exempt from Maryland income tax for work created in the district.
 But according to a state official, there was no way to know how much that exemption costs the state each year. Wallace A. Eddleman, an assistant director of the office of the comptroller, said the design of the state income tax form (on which some boxes serve multiple purposes) and computer program limitations made the calculation impossible.
 ''Based on our system constraints right now, we would not be able to identify the dollar amount of subtractions claimed for this credit,'' Mr. Eddleman said. He said in a later e-mail message that a new integrated tax system under development could make that possible in the future.
 Whatever the costs of arts districts, Maryland is now facing a $2 billion budget shortfall. Sean O'Donnell, a graduate student in law and ethics at the University of Baltimore and a blogger on fiscal responsibility, wrote that the proposed district ''would be financed by tax revenue that the city doesn't have.'' In a phone interview, he described optimism about the plan as ''idealism without reason.''
 Elkton, a town of 15,000 in the northeast corner of the state, designated a downtown arts district in 2003. At the time, said Mary Jo Jablonski, the director of the Elkton Alliance, there were 33 vacant spaces in the neighborhood. Now there are just two or three, she said, ''which is pretty good in a recession.'' She attributed the change directly to the arts district designation.
 One of Baltimore's existing arts districts, Highlandtown/Patterson Park, was created in 2003. Nearly seven years later, said Sam Sessa, who covers local entertainment for The Baltimore Sun, it ''hasn't seen a sliver of the artistic explosion and revitalization that was supposed to happen,'' Mr. Sessa wrote in an article. He continued, ''Where are all the galleries and performance spaces that were supposed to open? Where are the low-budget theaters?'' 
 Bill Gilmore, executive director of the Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts, said the Highlandtown/Patterson Park district ''has had a slow start.'' Among the causes, he said, are the absence of a full-time director and the inclusion of too many residential buildings when the district's boundaries were drawn.
 To Mr. Sessa, the city ''should focus on building up the two arts districts it already has,'' rather than creating a third one.
 The Sun's editorial board disagreed, writing that city officials ''are to be applauded for moving ahead with plans to create a new arts and entertainment district on Baltimore's West Side.'' The board cited the Lower East Side of Manhattan as an example of the ''kind of grass-roots development that has transformed once-blighted neighborhoods into trendy cultural meccas and tourist destinations.''
 In April, Baltimore learned it would not get the grant from the National Endowment for the Arts that the city had hoped to use to complete the West Side Arts District proposal. 
 ''We would have liked to have gotten the federal grant, but we feel like can move it along without it,'' Mr. Gilmore said. 
 J. Buck Jabaily, the director of the Greater Baltimore Cultural Alliance, also supports the new arts district. He said he moved to Baltimore to open a nonprofit theater company, the Single Carrot Theater, three years ago, after considering ''literally 50 cities.'' The presence of an arts district, he said, means the theater's landlord can pass along tax savings in the form of lower rent.
 Mr. Jabaily said many graduates of the Maryland Institute College of Art, which is just over a mile north of the proposed arts district, would like to stay in Baltimore after they graduate. And while the tax incentives might not matter to young artists just starting out, he said, ''for people who want to move from underground to above ground, these incentives do make a difference.''
 Geoffrey L. Mackler, a principal of H&R Retail, the broker representing the owners of several retail properties in the area, said an arts district might be ''the ''shot in the arm'' the neighborhood needed. Mr. Mackler said that large retailers might not benefit directly from the designation, but that ''they benefit indirectly from increased traffic.''
 The idea for a west side arts district has been around at least since the administration of Kurt L. Schmoke, Baltimore's mayor from 1987 to 1999. Over the years, the city took steps to improve the area, though without official arts district designation. 
 One step was to turn the old Hippodrome Theater at 12 North Eutaw Street into the France-Merrick Performing Arts Center, which opened in 2003. Another was converting the century-old Bromo Seltzer Arts Tower, at 21 South Eutaw Street, which was modeled on the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, into artists' studios.
 Mr. Schmoke, now dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, said that while he had not seen specific plans for the new arts district, he supported the idea generally.
 He acknowledged that there was some downside, including the loss of tax revenue, which he said would be exacerbated if a large number of nonprofit groups moved into the district.
 ''Having to give away so much to attract businesses,'' he added, ''is the bane of urban policy makers. But it's better than having vacant buildings.''

HEADLINE: Bordeaux: A Red Goes Gray

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
THE hyperbole over 2009 Bordeaux began building even before the harvest last fall. Ripples of praise grew into waves this spring as critics and the trade descended on Bordeaux for the annual ritual of tasting the most recent vintage from barrels. Their ecstatic reviews reverberated through Britain, which takes its claret extremely seriously. They rang out in Hong Kong, the leading edge of what Bordeaux hopes will be a huge Asian market.
 In the United States, the huzzahs resonated with collectors and wine investors, and with high-end restaurants whose clients don't mind spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on renowned bottles. These people paid attention when Robert M. Parker Jr., the wine critic whose opinions most influence Bordeaux prices, wrote, ''For some Medocs and Graves, 2009 may turn out to be the finest vintage I have tasted in 32 years of covering Bordeaux.''
 But for a significant segment of the wine-drinking population in the United States, the raves heard around the world were not enough to elicit a response beyond, perhaps, a yawn. For these people, Bordeaux, once the world's most hallowed region and the standard-bearer for all fine wines, is now largely irrelevant. 
 What happened? Plenty of Bordeaux is still consumed in the United States. In 2009, 1.29 million cases of Bordeaux wine were imported, accounting for 0.46 percent of all still wines, domestic and foreign, distributed in the country. While this percentage rises and falls year to year, it is still a far cry from its highs in the mid-1980s. Bordeaux shipments accounted for 1.69 percent of all still wines distributed in the United States in 1985, for example.
 While the drop stems from far more competition in the lower-priced market, it also reflects a shift in the demographic of Bordeaux aficionados. For young Americans in particular, Bordeaux has become downright unfashionable. 
 Not so long ago, young wine-loving Americans were practically weaned on Bordeaux, just as would-be connoisseurs had been for generations. It was the gateway to all that is wonderful about wine. Now that excitement has gone elsewhere, to Burgundy and the Loire, to Italy and Spain. Bordeaux, some young wine enthusiasts say, is stodgy and unattractive. They see it as an expensive wine for wealthy collectors, investors and point-chasers, people who seek critically approved wines for the luxury and status they convey rather than for excitement in a glass. 
 ''The perception of Bordeaux for my generation, it's very Rolex, very Rolls-Royce,'' said Cory Cartwright, 30, who is a partner in Selection Massale, a new company in San Jose, Calif., that imports natural and traditional wines made by small producers, and who writes the Saignee wine blog. ''I don't know many people who like or drink Bordeaux.'' 
 But the lack of interest is not just a question of perception. Nor is it solely a reflection of the weak economy, which drove down sales of most higher-priced wines in the last two years. 
 The more troubling sign for Bordeaux is that it has largely lost the loyalty of people like sommeliers and neighborhood wine shop proprietors, who can help build an audience for wines. The high-end, big-name wines will always have a market, but the less expensive, less familiar names, the natural points of embarkation for young wine explorers, may not fare as well without the support of those crucial intermediaries.
 ''I don't know any young sommelier who I've encountered in the last 15 years who is a Bordeaux hound,'' said Paul Grieco, an owner of the restaurant Hearth as well as two innovative wine bars, Terroir and Terroir Tribeca, all in Manhattan. Mr. Grieco has been a mentor for many young sommeliers. He himself learned about fine wine by drinking Bordeaux. Nonetheless, at his wine bars, he serves 50 wines by the glass, and not one is a Bordeaux. His shift has left him with mixed feelings.
 ''I think, 'I'm a history guy, how can I not revere Bordeaux?' '' he said. ''If even one person came in and said, 'I want a glass of Bordeaux,' I might think I really have to serve a Bordeaux. But not one person has said that. Not one! That's pretty sad.''
 For many younger sommeliers and wine lovers, the new standard of excellence is Burgundy.
 Unlike Bordeaux, where many of the best-known chateaus are run by corporations or wealthy absentee owners, Burgundy is full of estates, including many of the leading ones, that are essentially small businesses. Dealing with Bordeaux often requires working with middle management and marketing specialists. It's much easier to visit a Burgundian estate and find the one person who has dirt on the boots, wine on the hands and a name on the bottle.
 ''For people of my generation, 30 to 50, I don't think we've had the same magical Bordeaux moments, not in the same way we've connected to Burgundy or even the Rhone,'' said Laura Maniec, who runs the wine programs for more than 15 restaurants in the B. R. Guest group. 
 She still buys a lot of Bordeaux for restaurants like Primehouse, a Manhattan steakhouse, and Blue Water Grill, a Manhattan seafood restaurant that hosts plenty of corporate parties where Bordeaux is nearly obligatory. ''But there's a passion and a spark and a personal connection that are missing,'' she said.
 For restaurants 30 years ago, having a serious wine list meant offering a lot of Bordeaux. That's no longer the case, except for steakhouses and very high-end restaurants. Nowadays, people in the wine trade say, Bordeaux is sold largely through retail establishments like Sherry-Lehmann in New York, Zachys in Westchester and K & L Wine Merchants in California. 
 ''Young people are not exposed to Bordeaux in restaurants as much,'' said Clyde Beffa Jr., vice president of K & L, one of the country's leading sellers of Bordeaux. ''Sommeliers, they want to find their own little thing, it drives me crazy. They can have five gruner veltliners or rieslings because they're discovering these things, and they're not recommending Bordeaux as much. And, it's the price thing.''
 Good Bordeaux might start at $35 to $50 retail, and $85 to $100 in a restaurant, and soar from there -- far more than, say, reds from the Loire, Beaujolais or Alto Adige, darlings of the sommeliers and neighborhood wine shops. 
 Another significant barrier between young wine drinkers and Bordeaux is the absence of a charismatic advocate for the wines. The audience for Mr. Parker and the other leading wine critics tends to be older and more established. Meanwhile, boutique wine importers and distributors like Kermit Lynch, Neal Rosenthal and Louis/Dressner, who have won passionate followings, do very little business in Bordeaux, which has long been the domain of big companies.
 For younger startup importers like Mr. Cartwright, the size and complexity of the business is the reason he is not searching for Bordeaux wines to bring in.
 ''Everything is too commerce-driven,'' he said. ''You're never sure who is making the wine. I think for me and people my age, we're going back to grower-producers -- people who are there the whole way -- and Bordeaux seems the opposite of that.''
 While Bordeaux may have lost much of its mystique and allure, it still has its defenders, even among the sommelier crowd. Belinda Chang, the wine director at the Modern in Midtown Manhattan, acknowledges that Bordeaux has become a brand name, and that it's often too expensive, but argues that its intrinsic high quality and classic appeal make it irreplaceable. 
 ''I'm a fan and I'm not afraid to say it,'' Ms. Chang said. ''Who would not be excited to have a glass of Chateau Petrus, if you're not footing the bill?''
 Exactly right.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Claims Grew in Time, Colleague Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Former Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut found it puzzling: over time, his friend Attorney General Richard Blumenthal kept revising how he talked about his military service during the Vietnam War. At first, in the 1980s, he was humble. He played it down, Mr. Shays recalled, characterizing it as humdrum desk work. 
 Over the last few years, however, more sweeping claims crept into Mr. Blumenthal's descriptions, he said: that Mr. Blumenthal had served in Vietnam and had felt the sting of an ungrateful nation as he returned. 
 ''He just kept adding to the story, the more he told it,'' Mr. Shays said. 
 Mr. Shays said he became alarmed enough by the discrepancies that he at times considered mentioning the issue to Mr. Blumenthal, who on Tuesday said he took ''full responsibility'' for the occasions when he ''misspoke'' about his military history. 
 As it turned out, Mr. Blumenthal never served in Vietnam, but over time, his identification with veterans of war became so strong that some of those around him, like Mr. Shays, just assumed he had. He made it a point to attend the funeral of every active soldier from Connecticut killed in the line of duty, and he rearranges his schedule so he can speak at the ceremony for soldiers about to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 As attorney general, he created a special division focused on veterans' affairs and has become a national spokesman for veterans' rights. 
 ''Oh my God, this guy is relentless; he is nonstop when it comes to veterans,'' said Michael Pizzuto, a veteran of the first Iraq war, who has spoken with Mr. Blumenthal at parades and news conferences for veterans in Connecticut. 
 Mr. Blumenthal discussed his past statements about his military service after The New York Times reported Monday night on its Web site that he had falsely said in March 2008 that he had served in Vietnam, and had repeatedly failed to correct media reports that perpetuated the claim. 
 At a news conference on Tuesday in West Hartford, where he was surrounded by veterans, Mr. Blumenthal, 64, a Democratic candidate for Senate, said he had never intended to mislead the public. 
 But in interviews, several military historians and social scientists said the Blumenthal story reflected the strained and unsettled relationship some men of his generation have with the Vietnam War. Some of them, driven by guilt or pride, begin to embellish their role, even if they did not serve in the war or played no heroic role, they said.
 ''There is a lot of anecdotal evidence of this phenomenon of exaggerating military service by people who feel nostalgic because they missed their war,'' said Brian McAllister Linn, a professor at Texas A&M University who specializes in military history.
 Mr. Shays, a conscientious objector who avoided the Vietnam War, has his own theory about Mr. Blumenthal's evolving descriptions of his service: ''I think that it was a way that he quickly bonded with people I am sure he admired and respected.'' 
 ''It's very seductive,'' he added, recalling his own visits with American service members in Iraq before he left Congress after losing re-election in 2008 as a Republican.
 Although they are from different political parties, and Mr. Shays received campaign donations when in Congress from Linda McMahon, who is now seeking the Republican Senate nomination in the state, the two men enjoy a friendly relationship: Mr. Shays describes Mr. Blumenthal as a ''straight shooter,'' and Mr. Blumenthal has praised Mr. Shays's work on behalf of veterans.
 Politicians have always shown deference to veterans, but for Mr. Blumenthal, it seemed to be a calling. Colleagues said he relished marching in Veterans Day parades and visiting veterans halls, where he would chat about their tours of duty.
 Far from hiding his military resume, as some who did not see combat might do, he highlighted it. The biographical page of his Senate campaign Web site prominently displays a photo of a young Mr. Blumenthal, in his crisp blue and white uniform. 
 In Hartford and in Washington, Mr. Blumenthal's advocacy for veterans' rights is unyielding. He has lobbied the General Assembly to grant unemployment benefits to the spouses of military personnel, and advocated for the creation of a Hispanic affairs advocate within the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs. 
 The father of a Marine, he frequently speaks about the experience of attending the funerals of local service members who died in Iraq and Afghanistan. ''The ceremonies are a powerful combination of wrenching grief and soaring pride,'' he said in 2006. 
 In 2007, when he set up the veterans advocacy division of the attorney general's office, he declared, ''My office will fight for those who fought for us.''
 In interviews, several veterans from around the state said the office had helped them penetrate the thick bureaucracy of the state's benefits system, and applied a personal touch. 
 When Paul Kingman, a Navy veteran who lost feeling in his feet after chemotherapy, called Mr. Blumenthal's office in 2007, he was trying to get a hearing for disability payments from the Social Security Administration. So it came as a surprise when Mr. Blumenthal himself got on the line.
 ''He's a nice guy; he was cordial,'' Mr. Kingman, 50, said from his home in Naugatuck. ''Busy people like him, with all the rest going on in the state, I was surprised he'd have time for little old me.''
 A week after his conversation with Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Kingman learned that his hearing, which he had been trying to get for nearly four years, had been scheduled. 
 ''I don't know who he talked to, but next thing you know, I had a hearing,'' said Mr. Kingman, who at the time was living on $200 a month and food stamps. ''He stood up for me.''
 Cecelia Louis had a similar story: after five years trying to obtain health care from the Connecticut Veterans Affairs Department for her 78-year-old husband, a Korean War veteran, she reached out to the attorney general's office, which resolved the issue in a matter of weeks. 
 ''He realizes, especially now with all the veterans coming home with great needs, how important this is,'' she said. 
 Mr. Shays also spoke with affection and admiration for Mr. Blumenthal, whom he called ''a person of high integrity.'' That is why the former congressman regrets not speaking up before.
 A few weeks ago, Mr. Shays attended a ceremony with Mr. Blumenthal in Bridgeport, to honor workers killed during an accident. When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Blumenthal at one point brought up the subject of his military service and lamented that when ''we returned from Vietnam'' Americans had spit on soldiers, Mr. Shays recalled.
 ''He is the kind of person I cared enough about that I wish I had nipped this in the bud when it was fomenting,'' Mr. Shays said.

HEADLINE: With Elite Monmouth Meet, New Jersey Hopes to Make Money by Spending Money

BYLINE: By BILL FINLEY

 BODY:
OCEANPORT, N.J. -- Horse racing has long been criticized for being unable to make meaningful changes and for clinging to unworkable formulas. So when the horsemen and management at Monmouth Park took a look at the future, they didn't like what they saw and decided to do something different. 
 On Saturday, Monmouth Park will kick off a 50-day ''Elite Summer Meet'' that will offer the richest daily purse structure in the sport's history, with an average of $1 million a day paid out. The goal is nothing less than the revitalization of the thoroughbred racing industry in New Jersey. 
 ''This is something that was a long time in coming to ensure quality racing and full fields and to catch the interest of the public both from an attendance and betting point of view,'' said Dennis Robinson, the president and chief executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the state agency that runs Monmouth. ''I think it's a great opportunity. I see this is a new beginning.''
 It became apparent that something needed to be done after the once-profitable state-owned racetracks, Monmouth and the Meadowlands, began losing money because of declining interest in horse racing and the slumping economy. Gov. Christopher J. Christie hinted he might shut down the tracks if they did not find a way to turn a profit.
 In 2009, there were 141 days of thoroughbred racing between Monmouth and the Meadowlands; Monmouth offered a daily average of $330,000 in purses over 93 dates. Much of the racing was poor, with small fields, the kind that bettors shun. So horsemen and racing officials made a decision to funnel most of the available purse money into a super meet that would attract full fields and top horses and trainers, in an effort to entice bettors across the country.
 ''It's the bettor who is going to decide whether this is a good idea,'' said the trainer John Forbes, who heads the local horsemen's group. ''If we all search our memory banks for the last decade, we will remember article after article, study after study, blog after blog that says this is what the customer is asking for. We're going to try to give it to them.''
 Monmouth's normal schedule will consist of racing only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, with as many as 13 races a day. The minimum purse will be $30,000, and even races for maidens (horses that have never won a race) will be worth $75,000. The purse for a similar race at Belmont Park is $51,000. 
 The summer elite meet will conclude on Labor Day. Afterward, Monmouth will race 21 more days with purses dipping to about $250,000 a day. There will be no thoroughbred racing at the Meadowlands this year.
 The experiment will be labeled a failure if the betting handle does not increase enough to offset the costs involved with the higher purses. Monmouth's general manager, Bob Kulina, estimated that the on-site handle would increase 15 percent, and off-track wagering would be up by 22 percent.
 ''Those are the kind of numbers we need,'' he said. ''But maybe we can be up 30 to 40 percent. We just don't know. We think the upside could be huge.''
 Kulina projected a 15 to 20 percent attendance increase: ''I think we can bring back people who haven't been here in five years. I think we can make coming here something really special.''
 Early signs have been promising. ABC announced that it would televise the Haskell Invitational for the first time, and a sponsor, Izod, has signed on for the duration of the summer meet. Garrett Gomez and John Velazquez, two of the sport's top jockeys, have announced that they plan to ride regularly at Monmouth this year. ''What's going on here is amazing,'' Gomez said.
 Several top trainers have shipped horses to Monmouth, and New York regulars like Todd Pletcher, Nick Zito and Rick Dutrow have said the Monmouth meet will be a top priority. 
 That could be bad news for the New York Racing Association, which is threatening to shut down some time after the June 5 Belmont Stakes because it is about to run out of money. A shift of betting dollars from Belmont to Monmouth would only add to New York's problems.
 ''If it turns out that this is a challenge to any of the neighboring racing jurisdictions, that was never the intent,'' Forbes said. ''The intent was to do this here to help Jersey racing survive.''
 The signature event of the meet will be the Aug. 1 Haskell, which will remain at the 2009 purse level of $1 million. The connections of the Kentucky Derby winner Super Saver and of the Preakness winner Lookin at Lucky have said winning the Haskell is among their goals.

HEADLINE: As Violence Continues, Thai Tourism Falls Sharply

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- Some of the city's grandest hotels are shut and ringed with coils of glittering razor wire. Foreign visitors have deserted its temples and backpacker haunts. Military roadblocks hem in some of its famous nightspots.
 Arrivals at Bangkok's international airport are down by at least one-third, and hotel occupancy rates hover around 20 percent to 30 percent.
 Thailand's tourism industry, built on an image of gentleness, pleasure and smiles, is suffering its worst setback in decades -- perhaps the worst in its history, according to tourism officials. 
 As scenes of the country's violent uprising have spread around the world -- bombs and bodies, street fights and gunfire -- people abroad are asking whether it is safe to visit Bangkok.
 The brief answer, from embassies and security experts and even some people in the tourism industry, is: not right now.
 At least 37 people have died in five days of fighting between the military and antigovernment demonstrators, known as the red shirts. The potential for more violence remains, especially after troops began breaking up the barricades of the protesters' encampment on Wednesday morning.
 Forty-seven nations have told their citizens to be cautious about travel to Thailand, and several, including the United States, have warned them to stay away.
 The violence has been confined so far to a relatively small, though central, area of Bangkok. But the city is tense. Roadblocks, checkpoints and shutdowns of public transportation have made travel difficult. Taxi drivers refuse to go to some parts of the city.
 On Saturday, the United States Embassy issued an advisory that said, ''All United States citizens should defer all travel to Bangkok and defer all nonessential travel to the rest of Thailand.'' It said all nonemergency government workers and their families were authorized to leave.
 On Tuesday, the Tourism Authority of Thailand issued its own advisory, saying, ''Visitors and tourists are advised to be vigilant, follow news developments, exercise extra caution and avoid areas covered by the declaration of a severe emergency situation'' -- areas that include not only the capital, Bangkok, but also 21 provinces.
 In fact much of Bangkok is peaceful, as are virtually all parts of the provinces covered in the advisory, and many Thais are disturbed to see their country portrayed as a place of violence. ''When you get out from those areas of political turmoil, things seem to move as smoothly as ever,'' said Korakot Punlopruksa, a travel writer and photographer. ''We still live peacefully, we still love good food, and the sea is still beautiful.'' Thais try to break away from thoughts of the conflict, she said. ''Otherwise, we would go crazy.''
 On Khaosan Road, a low-budget haven that is far from the fighting, the calm weighed like a heavy cloud over half-empty bars and souvenir shops and hostels. Rows of three-wheeled tuk-tuk taxis stood idle in front of empty Internet cafes and foot-massage parlors.
 ''It's annoying,'' said Muk Singh, 50, the proprietor of a tailor shop called Novo Fashion, referring to the political violence. ''It's affecting us. We have expenses to meet and rent to pay.''
 Most visitors seemed to shrug off the city's tensions. ''We went to the train station today to buy tickets, and we saw soldiers with guns and police on barricades and SWAT teams,'' said Jake Frieda, 19, from Britain, who was traveling before attending college. ''But I think they're not bothering tourists. They're leaving tourists alone.''
 On Soi Cowboy, a street filled with bars where women dance in skimpy outfits, Bobby Edwards, 50, a retiree from Britain, said he had come here rather than to the more famous Patpong Road because of the protests.
 ''Patpong is the sex entertainment center of Bangkok,'' he said. ''The red shirts have basically closed it down because it's located near of the center of their protests.''
 He added: ''It's safe for me. I've got white skin, which is like natural Kevlar, and Thais are so hospitable to white foreigners.'' 
 Rebecca Hinckley, 33, a legal secretary from Ireland, said she was terrified Saturday night when she found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
 ''Two bombs went off, and we started running,'' she said. ''We could hear the crowds coming towards us, we could hear gunfire, we just started running like crazy. Everybody was very, very great to us. They were shouting, 'Run, run, run!' They were running with us.''
 But still, she added: ''I love Thailand. I still feel safe here. Unfortunately we were stupid enough to be out walking last night. It seems like everywhere else is quite normal.''
 Tourism, one of Thailand's most sophisticated and successful industries, accounts for 6 percent to 7 percent of the country's economy. Twenty percent of employment in Thailand is directly or indirectly linked to tourism, according to the Thailand National Statistical Office.
 Two weeks ago, before the worst of the violence erupted, Tourism and Sports Minister Chumpol Silapa-archa estimated that the number of tourists would slide by 10 percent, to 12.7 million this year, from 14.1 million last year. Earlier, officials had projected a rise to 15.5 million.
 Charoen Wangananont, a spokesman for the Federation of Thai Tourism Associations, told The Bangkok Post: ''What is certain is that the recovery process will be long and costly. This is the worst crisis ever faced in the history of the Thai tourism industry.''
 Bangkok is already planning its cleanup operation once the protesters move out of the high-end shopping area they have occupied. The city administration said it would clean roads, sewers and water mains; remove garbage; and bring in 1,000 monks to chant and accept alms. Surveillance cameras, disabled by the protesters, will be repaired.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Posts Slower Growth as Luxury and Home Goods Rebound

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
It was an encouraging start to the year for a broad swath of the nation's retailers. Major chains like Home Depot and Saks reported earnings on Tuesday that suggested the beginnings of a rebound in categories hit hard by the recession, like home improvement and luxury goods. 
 At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores, a winner amid the downturn as consumers sought low prices, reported sluggish growth at its stores in the United States. 
 Retailing analysts said that as the economy recovered, consumers who flocked to Wal-Mart in the depths of the recession were shifting some of their spending to other chains. 
 ''Did we lose some of the customers that we picked up before?'' Thomas W. Schoewe, Wal-Mart's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. ''Possibly yes.'' 
 But Mr. Schoewe said a more meaningful reason for the chain's 1.4 percent sales decline at stores open at least a year was that gas prices were up more than 40 percent from last year -- which prevented Wal-Mart's core customers from shopping as often and spending as much. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer and a barometer of American spending habits, said that, despite broader signs of economic recovery, the poorest American consumers remained under pressure. Wal-Mart cited as one example its customers' use of food stamps, which it said was up significantly over last year.
 ''More than ever, our customers are living paycheck to paycheck,'' Mr. Schoewe said. ''They're very concerned about their own personal finances.'' 
 Even so, Wal-Mart's earnings climbed about 10 percent thanks to strong international growth and cost cuts. 
 ''The low-income consumer appears to be the last coming out of the recession,'' said Bill Dreher, a senior research analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. ''But despite this sluggishness, the company showed an impressive earnings performance.'' 
 For the three months that ended April 30, Wal-Mart made a profit of $3.32 billion, or 88 cents a share, up from $3.02 billion, or 77 cents a share, last year. Sales for the quarter, the first of Wal-Mart's fiscal year, increased 6 percent, to $99.1 billion. Sales at United States stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, declined 1.4 percent from a year ago.
 While high unemployment and gas prices were a drag on Wal-Mart's domestic results, there were other factors. One was that the company stopped carrying some brands to streamline the appearance of its shelves. In a recorded call, Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart's United States operations, said the company was restoring some of those brands, including 300 grocery items. 
 ''If we made some mistakes, we'll correct those,'' Mr. Schoewe said. ''We'll listen to the customer, and we'll do the right thing.'' 
 Weak sales of discretionary merchandise, particularly apparel, which has been a trouble spot for the company, also dampened the results. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said it also faced stiff competition during the quarter. To set itself apart, the company is offering more price reductions, which it calls ''rollbacks.'' Whether they are effective will not be known until the next reporting period. 
 Wal-Mart shares rose 1.85 percent on Tuesday, to close at $53.71.
 Also on Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation's biggest home improvement retailer, said that for the three months ended May 2, it made a profit of $725 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with a profit of $514 million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago. Sales for the quarter, the first of Home Depot's fiscal year, increased 4.3 percent from a year ago, to $16.9 billion. Same-store sales rose 4.8 percent. Same-store sales in the United States increased 3.3 percent -- the first quarter of growth since the end of 2005. 
 Sales grew in almost every Home Depot region, even Florida and California. Every department had sales growth, too. Home Depot, which is based in Atlanta, attributed much of its growth to sales of seasonal goods like fertilizer, landscaping tools, grills and lawn mowers.
 While the results beat analysts' expectations, executives tempered their enthusiasm. Sales of higher-priced discretionary items, like special-order kitchens, were soft. And while professional business -- goods bought by contractors and builders -- is improving, it is still weak. 
 Transactions for receipts of $900 and more, which represent about 20 percent of Home Depot's sales, were down 1.4 percent in the quarter. In the United States, the average receipt for the quarter declined 1.3 percent, to $52.01. Home Depot shares fell 2.42 percent on Tuesday, to close at $34.73.
 Another sector on the upswing is luxury goods. 
 Saks, the upscale chain, posted a profit of $18.8 million, or 11 cents a share, for the three months that ended May 1, in contrast to a loss of 5.1 million, or 4 cents a share, last year. Sales for the quarter, the first of Saks's fiscal year, were $667.4 million, compared with $624.3 million last year. Same-store sales rose 6.1 percent from a year ago. 
 Saks's shares fell 4.28 percent on Tuesday, to close at $8.94.
 Stephen I. Sadove, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the results exceeded his expectations and that Saks, which is based in New York, was shifting gears ''from defense to offense.'' While luxury sales are not what they were at the peak of the boom, Saks said its customer traffic was higher, more merchandise was being sold at full price, and sales of clothing, handbags, shoes and jewelry were strong. 
 ''I feel very good about the outlook for the sector,'' Mr. Sadove said Tuesday. ''A year and a half, two years ago, people were asking 'Is luxury dead? Will people ever pay full price again?' What we've learned this year, certainly this last quarter, is that they're paying full price, they're responding to the concept of scarcity and they love brands.''
 Other retailers that reported earnings on Tuesday included Abercrombie & Fitch, the upscale apparel store for teenagers, and TJX Companies, which owns discounters, including TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods. 
 For the three months ended May 1, Abercrombie & Fitch posted a loss of $11.8 million, or 13 cents a share. Last year it lost $59.2 million, or 68 cents a share. During the recession, Abercrombie & Fitch ceded market share to lower-priced clothing retailers. TJX, which thrived as consumers traded down for name-brand bargains, made a profit of $331 million, or 80 cents a share, for the three months ended May 1, compared to $209 million, or 49 cents a share, a year ago.

HEADLINE: H.P. Profit Rises on Demand for Computers

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard said Tuesday its profit rose 28 percent in the latest quarter as demand for computers improved. 
 The company also raised its 2010 forecast, sending its shares higher. 
 The results underlined the continued growth in profit at the company, the world's No. 1 maker of personal computers and printers. Although Hewlett had been making money even during the height of the recession, its net income had been getting smaller each quarter. But for three straight quarters now, net income has been growing.
 The numbers show how deeply dependent Hewlett is on PCs even as it expands aggressively into more profitable areas, like technology services and computer networking.
 Hewlett said after the market closed Tuesday that it earned $2.2 billion, or 91 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $1.7 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Excluding special items, it earned $1.09 a share. Analysts had expected $1.05 a share on that basis.
 Revenue in the period, which ended April 30 and was the second quarter of Hewlett's fiscal year, rose 13 percent to $30.8 billion, better than the $29.8 billion that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected. In the same quarter a year earlier, revenue was $27.4 billion.
 For 2010, Hewlett is now predicting profit of $4.45 to $4.50 a share, excluding special items. That is higher than its previous forecast of $4.37 to $4.44 a share. 
 Hewlett, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said last month that it was buying the smartphone pioneer Palm for $1.4 billion in a bid to beef up its mobile phone business. Hewlett's $2.7 billion acquisition of the 3Com Corporation extended its operations in computer networking.
 Hewlett's PC division posted a 21 percent revenue increase over last year.
 Cathie Lesjak, Hewlett's chief financial officer, said in an interview that Hewlett had an increase in orders from smaller businesses and the financial services industry. But spending by large corporations to update their PC equipment would remain weak until the second half of this year, Ms. Lesjak said.
 Hewlett is increasingly focused on its services business, which was bolstered with the $13.9 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems in 2008. 
 Hewlett shares rose $1.15, or 2.5 percent, to $47.94 in after-hours trading Tuesday.

HEADLINE: One Moos and One Hums, but They Could Help Power Google

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Hey diddle diddle. Guess what the cow has done this time?
 America's dairy farmers could soon find themselves in the computer business, with the manure from their cows possibly powering the vast data centers of companies like Google and Microsoft. While not immediately intuitive, the idea plays on two trends: the building of computing centers in more rural locales, and dairy farmers' efforts to deal with cattle waste by turning it into fuel. 
 With the right skills, a dairy farmer could rent out land and power to technology companies and recoup an investment in the waste-to-fuel systems within two years, Hewlett-Packard engineers say in a research paper to be made public on Wednesday. 
 ''Information technology and manure have a symbiotic relationship,'' said Chandrakant D. Patel, the director of H.P.'s sustainable information technology laboratory, which wrote the report. ''And having these data centers locally will give farmers a new opportunity.''
 Companies have historically tended to build their large computing centers -- often called server farms -- in or near large cities and industries. As this practice has continued over the years, it has become difficult for companies building the largest data centers to find enough cheap electricity and real estate to meet their needs.
 The rise of higher-speed data transfer networks, however, has given technology companies a chance to move farther from large populations and still be able to get information to them as quickly as they need it. So companies like Google, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Microsoft have been engaged in a mad dash to find spots in the United States that have plenty of electricity and land. As a result, more data centers have been built in states like Washington, Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma. If those locations are near dairy farms, so much the better.
 Rather than being an alternative energy convenience, this approach could benefit companies operating in countries like China and India that need to find an economical way to power their computing centers.
 Back on the farm, dairy producers have increasingly been looking to deal with their vast collections of smelly cow waste by turning it into something called biogas.
 To make biogas, a farmer needs to buy specialized equipment that runs the manure through an anaerobic digestion process, which results in a large quantity of methane that can be used as a natural gas or diesel replacement.
 ''The average cow makes enough waste per day to power a 100-watt light bulb,'' said Michael Kanellos, editor in chief at Greentech Media, a research and publishing firm.
 According to H.P.'s calculations, 10,000 cows could fuel a one-megawatt data center, which would be the equivalent of a small computing center used by a bank. Mr. Kanellos has tracked both the data center and green technology industries and agreed that there was some convenient overlap. Computing equipment produces a lot of heat as a waste product, and the systems needed to create biogas require heat. So, there is a virtuous cycle of sorts possible. 
 ''The cows will never replace the hydroelectric power used by a lot of these data centers,'' Mr. Kanellos said. ''But there is interest in biogas, and this presents another way to make manure pay.''
 While many strapped farmers initially tried to create their own biogas plants, they have since found that it's more economical to sell their manure to a shared biogas producer.
 ''It turned out that the small projects didn't make sense,'' said Rocky C. Costello, the president of R. C. Costello & Associates of Redondo Beach, Calif., which provides design services for people looking to create biogas plants.
 California and Texas could benefit from the manure idea, Mr. Costello said, because they have large numbers of dairy cows, ties to the technology industry and centralized biogas centers. California, Wisconsin, New York, Idaho and Pennsylvania were the top dairy producers last year; according to the Agriculture Department.
 Still, Mr. Costello cautioned that this form of alternative energy faced familiar practical challenges. ''This just becomes less enticing as the price of natural gas gets lower,'' Mr. Costello said. ''Natural gas is so easy to get.'' 
 H.P. has long experimented with different ways to operate data centers more efficiently, including having robots that travel around buildings keeping tabs on the temperatures of computers. 
 Mr. Patel said his grandfather in India burned cow manure for fuel in his village; the hope is that a more modern take on this practice could help support the build-out of India's technology infrastructure. 
 It would cost a dairy farmer about $5 million to purchase the equipment needed for the biogas system and $30,000 to run it each year, Mr. Patel said. 
 H.P. has yet to construct its own manure-burning system, but may consider one for data centers in California or Texas, he said. ''Stay tuned,'' Mr. Patel said. ''We are pushing ahead.''

HEADLINE: Iran, the Deal and the Council

 BODY:
Every time it looks as if the big powers have finally run out of patience with Iran's nuclear misdeeds, Tehran's leaders suddenly decide they're in the mood to compromise. And every time the big powers let up on the pressure, Tehran's compromises turn to smoke.
 It was no surprise on Monday when Iran announced it was ready to accept a deal to ship some of its nuclear fuel out of the country -- similar to the deal it accepted and then rejected last year. So it is welcome news that the United States, Europe, Russia and China will press ahead with new United Nations Security Council sanctions. 
 The deal to exchange enriched uranium -- which could, with more enrichment, be used in a weapon -- for fuel rods is worth pursuing. We also are sure that there is no chance of reining in Iran's nuclear ambitions without sustained unified pressure by the major powers. 
 The resolution, circulated late on Tuesday, takes aim at Iran's financial institutions, including those supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which runs much of the nuclear program. It would also require countries to inspect ships or aircraft into or out of Iran if there are suspicions they are carrying banned materials. 
 Like the three resolutions that preceded it, it is probably not tough enough to change minds in Tehran. But the fact that Russia and China -- Iran's longtime enablers -- have signed on is likely to make some players in Iran's embattled government nervous. (We know we can't wait to hear what changed Beijing's mind.)
 Several European governments have signaled that they are ready to impose tougher bilateral sanctions after the Security Council moves, and that might unsettle Iran's shaky political and economic system even more.
 Since 2006, Tehran has defied repeated demands from the Security Council to curb its nuclear program. It continues to churn out more nuclear fuel, block international inspectors from visiting suspect nuclear sites and refuses to answer questions about possible research into weapons designs.
 The 11th-hour agreement announced this week with the leaders of Brazil and Turkey was much like one reached with the big powers last fall. Iran would transfer about 2,640 pounds of its low-enriched uranium to Turkey within one month and receive -- within one year -- fuel rods for use in a medical research reactor. 
 There are big differences, however. In October, 2,640 pounds represented nearly 80 percent of Iran's stock of enriched uranium. Now it is only about half of its supply. 
 The original deal was intended to measurably delay Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon while opening the door to serious negotiations. The current deal leaves Iran with too much fuel, puts no brakes on enrichment at a higher rate, lets Tehran take back the fuel stored in Turkey when it wants and makes no commitment to talks.
 Brazil and Turkey -- both currently hold seats on the Security Council -- are eager to play larger international roles. And they are eager to avoid a conflict with Iran. We respect those desires. But like pretty much everyone else, they got played by Tehran. 
 American officials have not rejected the deal completely. They say that Iran will have to do more to slow its nuclear progress and demonstrate its interest in negotiating, rather than just manipulating the international community. 
 Brazil and Turkey should join the other major players and vote for the Security Council resolution. Even before that, they should go back to Tehran and press the mullahs to make a credible compromise and begin serious negotiations.

HEADLINE: German Move Sows Confusion

BYLINE: By PETER THAL LARSEN and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
The short-selling ban just announced by Germany misses the point. The country's plan to stop naked shorting of some financial stocks and European government bonds as well as related credit-default swaps, starting Wednesday, may score political points. But it sows confusion, and will hardly help tackle the causes of Europe's financial woes.
 The German ban appears to apply to shares of the country's 10 largest financial institutions, European government bonds and European sovereign default swaps. The first is fairly harmless, the second seemingly pointless and the third downright confusing. 
 It is not uncommon for regulators to ban naked shorting of stocks. American investors, for example, have long been prevented from selling shares short unless they have agreed to borrow an equivalent amount of stock. In this respect, the German plan is not such a big deal. The only question is why it does not apply to the entire stock market.
 The decision to focus on European government bonds is more surprising. Euro zone politicians have taken to blaming speculators betting on sovereign defaults for the financial crisis. But short-selling of government bonds isn't widespread.
 Even trading in more liquid sovereign credit-default swaps -- where investors buy protection against a euro zone country defaulting on its debt -- hardly suggests a speculative frenzy. In the week ending May 7, net outstanding default swaps on Greek debt totaled $7.7 billion, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. A year earlier, the figure was $7.8 billion.
 The naked credit-default swap ban is also hard to enforce, even in the markets under Germany's control. Regulators will somehow have to distinguish between investors who are hedging from those speculating.
 It is also hard to see what Germany can do by acting alone. Unless other European countries follow its lead, there will be little to stop investors from shorting euro zone sovereign debt elsewhere. News of the ban caused confusion in financial markets on Tuesday. It seems unlikely to achieve much else.
 Overseas Cash Piles
 It has become a rite of passage for young and ambitious computer wizards to pack their bags for California. But giants like Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Google have tens of billions of dollars trapped outside the United States. Perhaps the young techies should consider basing or at least incorporating their new technology businesses overseas if they want the best chance of selling out to an industry leader.
 Google's purchase of Global IP Solutions, which is based in San Francisco and listed in Oslo, announced on Tuesday, is just the latest example. And the technology aristocracy has plenty of overseas firepower. Cisco, Microsoft and Apple, for example, had $120 billion of cash and investments on their balance sheets at the end of last quarter, and very little debt.
 While many companies don't break out the figures, much of this is stuck overseas. EBay, for example, had 75 percent of its hoard in foreign countries at the end of 2009. If the companies were to bring the money home to the United States, they would have to pay the United States tax rate on repatriated profits, rather than the typically lower taxes elsewhere.
 These overseas piles are growing, too. Technology spending is increasing at a fast clip in places like China and Russia. The tech companies' costs, however, are still weighted toward the United States.
 So what are the tech giants to do? They can lobby for another tax amnesty, the last one of which came in 2004. Another solution is to use the trapped cash to buy overseas rivals. Cisco, for example, acquired Tandberg, based in Norway, earlier this year for $3.4 billion.
 Sure, Google wanted Global IP Solutions primarily for its voice technology, not the small tax benefit of using its overseas cash. And the tech industry has traditionally clustered in California because there's lots of engineering talent, venture capital and specialized services that add value for businesses based there. Yet at the margin, there may be an edge for an entrepreneur looking to sell out if the big boys can use their overseas cash.
 Silicon Valley has long counted on talented Asian and European immigrants for much of its innovation and growth. The tech giants' trapped cash piles might be something that encourages them to maintain their ties with their home countries.

HEADLINE: A Simple Swab Can Make You A Lifesaver

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The cure for someone else's terrible illness could start with a swab rubbed in the cheek of a stranger. Here's a Someone Else: Sophia Lopez, now 6 months old, of the Bronx. When she was 10 weeks old, she came down with a fever of 104. Her parents ran her to the emergency room at Mount Sinai Hospital and learned that she had a rare blood disease with a long biochemical name and the initials HLH. It is a catastrophe rolling downhill. 
 Sophia joined a crowd of babies, children, men and women with illnesses like HLH and leukemia and blood cancers who need new bone marrow. They can get the marrow from anyone, family member or stranger, who has similar traits. 
 To begin with, this requires a swab from the inner cheek, which is used to identify possible donors and stored in a bone marrow registry.
 On Saturday, a donor drive run by DKMS Americas will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Public School 71, 3040 Roberts Avenue, in the Pelham Bay neighborhood of the Bronx. People who can't go in person to the drive can register online, at www.getswabbed.com.
 ''We're trying to reach out to everyone to participate, but we're especially trying to reach out to our Hispanic community, because we make up only 10 percent of the bone marrow registry,'' said Denise Lopez, Sophia's mother. Her daughter is of Puerto Rican and Ecuadorean descent. Sophia has two brothers, 2 and 11, who dote on her, but no one in the family is a match for her. 
 About a year ago, another bone marrow drive was held in Lower Manhattan. One of the people who signed up was Carlos Segura, the father of twins. The registration was a painless process that involved filling out forms and having a quick swab of the cheek with cotton on a stick. ''All the parents in the area went,'' Mr. Segura said. ''Six months later, I got a call that I was a match for someone with a blood cancer. All they told me was that it was a 4-year-old boy.''
 The method of extracting marrow has improved considerably from when a long needle was stuck into a bone. Now, a donor can take medicine for five days, which makes the blood richer with the most valuable cells. These are harvested with little pain. 
 ''You go into a hospital and they take the blood out of one arm, run it through a machine that takes out the cells, and then puts it back in the other arm,'' Mr. Segura said. 
 Born in Colombia, Mr. Segura moved to New York 20 years ago. He was puzzled by the shortfall of Latinos in the registry. (African-Americans are also underrepresented.)
 ''I think there's not that much information about this, and you really don't hear about it,'' Mr. Segura said. ''My mom never heard about it. Some people think it's painful, but it's much better with the medicine they use now to get the cells. They make it easy.''
 Ms. Lopez thought that fear might also be a factor. ''Maybe because they're filling out a form, they worry about it's something for immigration, or maybe it's the lack of knowledge about what is it that it entails,'' she said. ''A lot of people are afraid. It's just a simple swab test.''
 Millions of people donate blood every year, but very few are asked to have their mouths swabbed to see if they might match someone in need of bone marrow. Blood is a far more valuable economic commodity than marrow because it can be separated into parts and used even without perfect matches between donor and recipients. 
 Another very promising source of fresh cells for sick people is also squandered. The blood taken from the umbilical cords of newborn children is rejected less often than adult cells, but only a fraction of the supply is preserved. Millions of umbilical cords are simply disposed every year as medical waste.
 Even in a hospital crib, Sophia Lopez is still kicking and full of babbling fun, her mother reports. ''She's talking today to the nurses she recognizes and smiling at them,'' her mother, Denise Lopez, said on Tuesday. ''And to my sister.''
 Carlos Segura said he would not hesitate to donate again. ''I have two kids, and God forbid, you go through that,'' he said. ''Whatever little discomfort I went through was nothing compared to what the parents and the kid are going through.''

HEADLINE: The Battle Over Taxing Soda

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 The classic way for lobbyists to defend their client's interest is to insist that they are not actually defending their client's interest. Really, they say, they are just looking out for ordinary Americans.
 Tobacco lobbyists spent years fighting regulation by claiming to be defending individual freedom, not the profits of tobacco companies. Detroit's lobbyists did much the same to push back against seat belt and pollution laws. Wall Street has spent months opposing the financial regulation bill in the name of families and small businesses.
 The latest example comes from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the rest of the soda industry, which is trying to defeat a soda tax now before the District of Columbia Council. The industry has succeeded recently in beating back similar taxes in New Yorkand Philadelphia, and in keeping one out of the federal health overhaul bill. But the Washington Council seems to be seriously considering a penny-per-ounce tax on nondiet sodas, energy drinks and artificial juices. Council members are set to vote on the issue next week. 
 This soda debate is probably going to be around for some time. Cities and counties, desperate to find money to pay for schools and roads, are starting to see a soda tax as a way to raise revenue. The tax also appears to be one of the most promising ways to attack obesity, given the huge role sugary drinks play in the epidemic.
 ''It's wrong for the government to stand idle in the face of an epidemic of obesity that's hurting the quality of life and the health of our residents,'' says Mary Cheh, the Council member who has proposed the tax, ''when we have policy choices in front of us that can materially affect the problem.''
 The soda industry, of course, is fighting back with newspaper and radio advertisements, among other things. It says a tax would most hurt ''hard-working, low- and middle-income families, elderly residents and those living on fixed incomes'' and would destroy jobs. Ellen Valentino, an industry official, recently told The Washington Post that companies would spend ''whatever it takes'' to make their case.
 The argument for a soda tax is the same as the argument for a tax on tobacco, pollution or, for that matter, banks that take big, expensive risks. When an activity imposes costs on society, economists have long said that the activity should be taxed. Doing so accomplishes two goals: it discourages the activity, and it raises money to help pay society's costs. 
 In the case of soda, those costs come in the form of medical bills for diabetes, heart disease and other side effects of obesity. We're all paying these bills, via Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance premiums. Obesity has become a significant cause of our swelling long-term budget deficit.
 And soda is a huge reason the country is so much more obese. The typical American consumes almost three times as many calories from sugary drinks as in the late 1970s. This increase accounts for about half the total per-capita rise in calorie consumption over the same period. Remember, many of these drinks have zero nutritional benefit -- unlike meat, cheese or juice.
 As Kelly Brownell, a Yale researcher, says, the link between obesity and soda is scientifically stronger than the link between obesity and any other type of food or beverage. 
 We're drinking more soda for several reasons. Above all, the inflation-adjusted price has fallen 34 percent since the late 1970s, largely because it can be manufactured more cheaply than in the past. Meanwhile, the average real cost of fruits and vegetables has risen more than 30 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Coincidentally, Ms. Cheh's proposed tax would roughly reverse the drop in the price of soda over the last three decades, at least for the popular 12-pack of cans. An extra penny per ounce on a 12-pack would add $1.44 -- or about 30 percent -- to the current typical $4.75 price. (The tax rate would be lower for single-serve bottles and higher for bulk purchases.)
 Most of the revenue would then be used to improve the miserable quality of many school lunches in Washington. One blog, Better D.C. School Food, has taken to documenting these lunches, with a series of photographs of bland bread, processed cheese and reconstituted beef. 
 So what about Coke's and Pepsi's arguments against the tax?
 They are certainly right that less soda consumption could cost the soda industry some jobs. But it would eliminate jobs from the overall economy only if people put the money they had been spending on soda into their savings accounts. That's highly unlikely. Instead, people will probably spend more on other food and drinks or, say, go to the movies more often -- and create jobs in those industries. 
 The argument that the tax will hurt the poor is a little more serious. The average American now drinks almost a gallon of sweetened beverages each week. If the tax passes, any Washington resident who continued to do so would have to pay about $1.20 each week in soda taxes. 
 Yet even that number overstates the cost, because the tax would surely affect how much soda many people drank. One of the lessons of the recent rise in cigarette taxes is that big price changes can lead to big behavior changes, even with an addictive product like tobacco. Teenagers, the biggest soda drinkers of all, are especially price sensitive. People who cut their soda drinking from a gallon a week to merely three-quarters of a gallon -- that's still 96 ounces, more than twice the consumption level of the late 1970s -- would be spending no more on soda than they are now.
 I suspect that some Washington Council members, in the face of opposition from the soda makers and distributors, may be tempted to support a weakened version of the tax. One option would simply be to extend the normal 6 percent sales tax to sweetened beverages. Like food, they are currently exempt. 
 But here's the problem with that idea: small tax changes don't always change behavior, as a recent study by the RAND Corporation found. So a small soda tax could actually have a worse impact on some families' budgets than a substantial one -- by raising the price of soda without affecting consumption. No wonder the American Heart Association supports the penny-per-ounce proposal.
 Such a tax would certainly raise the cost of living for some heavy soda drinkers, just as cigarette taxes have stretched the budgets of some smokers and mandatory seat belts have added costs to car production. But consider the benefits from those other public health initiatives. They have vastly outweighed the costs.
 Someday, we will probably look back on our gallon-a-week soda habit the way we now look back on allowing children to ride without seat belts or listening to doctors who endorsed Camel cigarettes. We will wonder what we were thinking. 
 Coke and Pepsi, unfortunately, seem willing to do whatever it takes to delay that day.

HEADLINE: High-End Retailers Are Scouting Sites in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Brooklyn, the new bastion of cool for many New Yorkers, is poised to go mainstream chic. The announcement that Barneys Co-op will open its first store in Cobble Hill has cleared the way for other nationally recognized high-end retailers to make a similar move across the bridge, according to brokers who specialize in representing luxury clothiers.
 With the news in March that the Co-op, Barneys New York's younger, more accessible line, would lease 10,465 square feet on two floors at 194 Atlantic Avenue in Cobble Hill, a number of other retailers who in the past have been more at home in SoHo or on Madison Avenue have begun touring Brooklyn. These include the jewelers Swarovski Crystal, and the clothiers Anthropologie and North Face.
 ''Someone needed to be first, and now that Barneys Co-op has done it, others will follow,'' said Karen Bellantoni, an executive vice president for the retail brokerage firm Robert K. Futterman & Associates. Ms. Bellantoni said that after the Barneys announcement, a boutique based in Manhattan and a national clothing chain, neither of which she would name, hired her to look for space in Brooklyn. 
 While it isn't unusual for national retailers to open Manhattan outposts and then expand to Brooklyn -- American Apparel and Urban Outfitters, for example, have been in the borough for several years -- the $200 T-shirts and $300 jeans at the Co-op are aimed at wealthier shoppers. 
 ''Brooklyn has the demographics to support this kind of retail, but until now, no national store was willing to take the chance,'' said Joanne Podell, the executive director of retail services at Cushman & Wakefield. 
 One reason for the moves is that the retail industry may be on the mend. Retail sales surged 8.8 percent nationally in April compared with April 2009, according to the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, consumer confidence rose to 57.9 in April, its highest level since September 2008, according to the Conference Board. 
 Retail rents have remained relatively low, too, creating the perfect climate for expansion, say analysts. ''Retailers with better balance sheets will expand in this market because they are seeing sales strengthen,'' said Suzanne Mulvee, a real estate strategist for the research firm CoStar Group, ''while at the same time rental rates are still incredibly low, allowing them to steal market share from competitors who are being more conservative.'' 
 Because of its strong demographics and heavy foot traffic, the Cobble Hill area is the most likely target for upscale retailers. ''The economics of Cobble Hill are as good as the Upper East Side or Upper West Side,'' said Noel Caban, a vice president for retail at CB Richard Ellis who, with Richard Hodos, an executive vice president there, represented Barneys in the transaction. Stephen J. Bartha of S. J. Bartha Consulting Group also represented Barneys. 
 Cobble Hill is in the heart of brownstone Brooklyn, where apartment prices regularly top $1 million and the average household income is more than $109,000, according to the Census Bureau's 2008 American Community Survey. In comparison, the average household incomes on the Upper West Side and SoHo -- where two of the three Barneys Co-ops in New York are located -- are $177,000 and $181,000, respectively. The other is in Chelsea.
 Cobble Hill is close to downtown Brooklyn and the thousands of office workers there. More than 100,000 people live within a mile of the new Barneys Co-op, and numerous subway lines converge there. It is also near the Fulton Street Mall, which is visited by 100,000 shoppers daily and where a hotly anticipated H&M clothing store is expected to open next year. 
 As for Barneys New York, it seems to be riding the wave of an improving industry. The company said its sales grew 20 percent in March, after smaller gains in January and February. In addition to the Brooklyn site, it plans to open another Co-op in Santa Monica, Calif. 
 It chose Brooklyn because, after analyzing its customer database, it discovered that many of its customers already lived in the area. It also helped that several Barneys executives were residents of the borough. Company officials say they chose Atlantic Avenue after roughly one year of looking at its demographics, its proximity to the busy retail corridor on Smith Street, and its location on the same block as Trader Joe's and Urban Outfitters.
 ''We are opening the Brooklyn store for the same reason we opened our location on the Upper West Side: it's where our customers are living, and they appreciate us coming to their neighborhoods,'' said Dawn Brown, the vice president of publicity for the retailer. 
 The asking rents in Cobble Hill are roughly 20 to 25 percent of what is available in prime Manhattan spots like SoHo. Two Trees Management, the landlord at 194 Atlantic Avenue, was initially asking $85 a square foot for the 10-year lease but ''the space was a little off of center and they weren't on a corner, so Barneys ended up with a nice value,'' said Mr. Caban of CB Richard Ellis, who declined to give the specific taking rent. Caroline Pardo, director of leasing for Two Trees, represented the landlord. 
 Sandra Dowling, the owner of Brooklyn Heights Real Estate, said she welcomed the store. ''We are developing more and more residential space on Atlantic, bringing a significant high-end customer to the neighborhood,'' she said, ''and there just isn't enough retail shopping for them.'' 
 But while brokers say there is increased interest in Cobble Hill as a high-end retail destination, there are still stumbling blocks. Most notable is the paucity of spaces big enough for national retailers. There are few options on Atlantic Avenue, and Smith Street, while desirable, has mostly stores in the 1,000-square-foot range. Williamsburg, which offers roomier retail options, is less appealing because of its lack of density and access to mass transportation. 
 Among the potential Brooklyn tenants that haven't yet made the move, Apple may be the most famous. It has looked ''for years,'' said Marty Markowitz, the borough president, who has been trying to lure the retailer.
 In his most recent effort, he created a video last month on his iPad to promote the combined forces of the borough and the store, sending the results to Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. ''I must not have won any acting awards, since I've yet to get any response,'' Mr. Markowitz said. He said he was considering traveling to Cupertino, Calif., where Apple is based, ''and hanging out outside until Mr. Jobs agrees to see me.''
 Amy Barney, a spokeswoman for Apple, said, ''We have made no announcement about a store in Brooklyn.'' Still, while there may be some challenges getting a critical mass of exclusive retailers into the borough, there is certainly a surge in interest. ''There is an aggregating affect taking place in the area, with H&M at one end and Barneys Co-op at the other,'' said Joe Chan, the president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership. ''Atlantic Avenue may not turn into Madison Avenue, but will other high-end retailers come here? Most definitely.''

HEADLINE: An Urban Farming Pioneer Sows His Own Legacy

BYLINE: By TRACIE McMILLAN

 BODY:
JOHN AMEROSO didn't hoe the rows of vegetables that help feed the Bronx at the Padre Plaza Success Garden in the borough's Mott Haven section. He didn't pick any tomatoes from the vines at the Brooklyn Rescue Mission's farm. And he didn't turn the composting bins that kept East New York Farms! fertile ground for collards, cilantro and chard. 
 But he's responsible for all of it, along with the rest of more than 18 tons of produce grown in city lots for market last year.
 You have most likely never heard of Mr. Ameroso. Yet from a rubble-strewn vacant lot in Brooklyn where he showed New Yorkers how to grow food in 1976 to a three-acre stretch of Governors Island that he's helping to sow now, he has been behind nearly every organized attempt to grow and sell food in the city, as well as many of the city's best-known food organizations. 
 He was New York City's first extension agent focused on farming, and now probably its last one. Mr. Ameroso formally retired in March and will spend the 2010 growing season removing himself from the daily work of city farms and making sure his colleagues -- many of whom he's trained -- can carry on without him. 
 ''Anybody doing urban agriculture today should thank him personally,'' said Michael Hurwitz, director of Greenmarket, the system of farmers' markets that began the same year that Mr. Ameroso started tilling Brooklyn soil. As a founder of Added Value, a group that has coordinated an urban farm in Red Hook since 2003, Mr. Hurwitz got advice from Mr. Ameroso about crop plans and starting a farm stand. ''If there hadn't been a John Ameroso,'' Mr. Hurwitz said, ''they wouldn't be doing what they are today.''
 Mr. Ameroso's work, as a Cornell University Cooperative Extension agent, started in 1976, when Representative Fred Richmond, Democrat of Brooklyn, -- a gardening enthusiast who'd installed a vegetable plot outside his Capitol Hill office -- got money for an extension office in New York City, to show that urban food gardens could help feed inner-city neighborhoods. By 1994, the project, called the Urban Gardening Program, had expanded to 23 cities and was producing $16 million worth of food each year.
 Its progeny have continued in all five boroughs. 
 On Decatur Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the Brooklyn Rescue Mission's managers were recently looking for help transplanting a fig tree. 
 ''We've got to move this,'' said the Rev. DeVanie Jackson, gesturing at the potted sapling. ''You've got to recommend a spot.'' Ms. Jackson and her husband, Robert, have enlisted Mr. Ameroso's help since 2005, when they began growing vegetables to make up for the poor quality of food being delivered to their food pantry. By last year, they were supplying the neighborhood's weekly farmers' market (which they helped found) and an upscale pizza spot, Saraghina, with herbs, vegetables and figs.
 ''Which way is your sun going?'' asked Mr. Ameroso reproachfully. ''It goes that way,'' he said, drawing an arc tracing the sun's likely path through the sky. The best location would be wherever the tree would get the most light -- something Mr. Ameroso clearly thought should have been obvious. ''How long have you been here?'' he asked. Ms. Jackson laughed, and asked his advice on handling slugs. She'd heard she could put out a pan of beer, which would attract and then drown the pests.
 ''You use Pabst Blue Ribbon,'' Mr. Ameroso replied. ''It's been proven. It was a long-time study.'' 
 Ms. Jackson raised her eyebrows. 
 ''I'm not making it up!'' he said.
 In Far Rockaway, Queens, Mr. Ameroso and his colleague, Robert Lewis, special assistant for market development of New York State's Department of Agriculture and Markets, pulled up to the Culinary Kids Urban Farm at Beach 31st Street and Seagirt Avenue. The corner lot held urban farming paraphernalia: a rounded greenhouse, a narrow chicken coop, wood-framed vegetable beds. But what caught Mr. Ameroso's attention was a crew of volunteers building a roofed structure. 
 ''Oh, please, why are you making gazebos?'' he muttered. ''Why do they build structures on these things that take away growing area?''
 Marion Moses and Malisa Rivera, who started the farm last year, greeted Mr. Ameroso and Mr. Lewis and took them on a tour. The structure, with its pitched roof, they explained, would harvest rainwater. Mr. Ameroso looked relieved and later offered a small mea culpa: ''I didn't realize they didn't have a hydrant. I thought they were going to build a stupid gazebo.''
 His response to frippery like gazebos isn't surprising, given his rugged training grounds. 
 The son of a welder and supermarket cashier, Mr. Ameroso has spent little time in tranquil settings since getting an agricultural degree from the University of Georgia in 1968. After college he worked for the International Voluntary Service teaching farmers to grow hybrid rice in the Mekong Delta during the war. Returning to the States in 1972, he took odd jobs for four years until he went to work in Brooklyn.
 Albert Harris Jr., the extension office director who hired him, said that Mr. Ameroso could talk to anyone and persuade them to grow almost anything. He got the Latino and African-American families to grow bok choy. ''Nobody knew what bok choy was,'' Mr. Harris said. ''I guess he got it from Vietnam, but I guess it grew well in the soil we had.'' 
 Growing food was always what Mr. Ameroso cared about, though beautification efforts would insinuate themselves. ''To me the exciting stuff was, people are producing food to produce it, not, 'Oh, look at how pretty my flowers are,' '' Mr. Ameroso said, trundling along the Gowanus Expressway in his two-tone Ford Ranger pickup to a farm he helps manage in Staten Island. 
 In 1994, federal money for New York's urban food production dropped by 80 percent, forcing the extension to cobble together a salary line for Mr. Ameroso from various projects. To qualify for economic development money he began growing food for sale, an impetus to New York's contemporary food movement. 
 Mr. Ameroso and a group of other food activists -- Mr. Lewis, Peter Mann, Kathy Lawrence and Joan Gussow -- embarked on project after project, while Mr. Ameroso handled the dirty business of actually growing food. 
 In 1995, they helped found Just Food, a nonprofit group that now offers technical assistance to urban growers and cooking and nutrition education, and is an advocate for the use of local food. Mr. Ameroso still sits on its board and helped start its first big program, City Farms. Then came the New Farmer Development Project, in 2000, to find land upstate for farmers from the city. In the early 2000s, he helped found the city's two largest urban farm projects, East New York Farms! and Added Value. 
 Now that Mr. Ameroso is retiring, what will the city's farmers do without him? 
 Cornell will probably transfer some of Mr. Ameroso's duties to other agents, said Don Tobias, executive director of the cooperative extension in New York City. And Mr. Ameroso may consult on a part-time basis. Without a program or funding line dedicated to urban agriculture, however, the era when one phone call could bring time-tested food-growing advice to your doorstep may be ending.
 But Mr. Ameroso has trained a steady stream of interns, who today help run urban agriculture efforts across the country. (He's married to one of his first interns, Linda.) And with Mr. Ameroso's help, Just Food's City Farms program has trained 29 gardeners as urban agriculture experts so they can operate as an informal extension office. Mr. Ameroso hopes that will be enough to let them continue without him.
 The farmers aren't so sure. 
 There are other horticultural programs, Ms. Jackson said: ''You call them, you get the intern. You know what I'm saying?'' But without Mr. Ameroso, she added: ''Who's going to actually come when you call them? I don't know where we're going to go for answers.''

HEADLINE: The Senate at the Finish Line

 BODY:
It is a bad sign, as the Senate enters the home stretch on financial regulatory reform, that there are so many unresolved issues since weaknesses and ambiguities in the legislation play into the hands of opponents of reform at this late date. It is especially disturbing that the vital area of reform -- the regulation of derivatives trading -- is being left to last. 
 This multitrillion-dollar market in largely unregulated derivatives was at the heart of the speculation that inflated the bubble, amplified the bust and led to the bailouts. Unless they are reined in, derivatives are bound to endanger the financial system again, no matter what other reforms are adopted. 
 Many derivatives are now traded as private, bilateral contracts, outside the purview of regulators and other investors. Lack of oversight has fostered recklessness and abuse. It also fostered huge profits, as the five banks that dominate the business -- JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup -- have been able to keep clients in the dark about what other clients pay for similar products and services. 
 The central reform of derivatives is a provision that would require most derivative contracts to be traded on transparent, regulated exchanges and to be processed, or cleared, through a third party to guarantee payment if one of the participants was unable to pay. Banks also would be forced to move their derivatives businesses into separate entities or affiliates, to separate risky derivatives from federally insured deposits.
 Virtually every effort to weaken the bill involves watering down or undoing those reforms, either explicitly or by adding fiendishly convoluted language that obscures the reforms' purpose.
 A must-pass amendment by Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat of Washington, would state clearly that it is illegal to enter into a derivatives deal that has not been cleared and exchange traded. Only specifically defined transactions would be exempt. The amendment would ensure that regulators and investors would be able to stop or undo a transaction if banks knowingly or recklessly violated the trading requirements.
 Another reform, which the banks want to kill, is one that would impose a fiduciary duty on them when they enter into derivative deals with pension funds, retirement plans, government entities and endowments. The need for this rule is made clear by the municipalities and other investors that have been damaged by derivatives deals they clearly did not understand. The only change to the provision should be to tighten the language to clarify that the obligation to put the client's interest first applies when a bank gives advice and makes recommendations, not when it is merely providing financial services. 
 Finally, the banks do not want to spin off their lucrative derivative dealings, and Senator Christopher Dodd has filed an amendment that would allow them to put off even partial restrictions for at least two years. That would put bank profits ahead of protecting the system and taxpayers. 
 Banks don't want clarity because clear rules are hard to evade. Which is all the more reason for senators to clarify and strengthen the derivatives regulation while there is still time to do so.

HEADLINE: Don't Sink Diplomacy

BYLINE: By JOEL S. WIT. 
Joel S. Wit, a former State Department official, is a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University and the founder of its Web site 38north.org.

 BODY:
IN 1998, I led a team of American government experts to an underground installation to determine if North Korea was cheating on a 1994 agreement to eliminate its nuclear weapons program. Pyongyang had recently tested a long-range missile, and relations were tense. 
 For a week, we passed barking guard dogs and shouting soldiers doing their synchronized morning exercises to wander through a maze of tunnels. Once, when a team member violated the rules for the inspection (by sketching some of the buildings) we were locked in a room surrounded by troops with bayonets drawn while I argued for hours with the base commander. When we were finally allowed to leave, a van equipped with loudspeakers blasted anti-American slogans at our bus. 
 Nevertheless, we were able to complete our investigation, which found no nuclear activities, because Pyongyang had a stake in maintaining a relationship with us: the North Koreans were expecting William Perry, the former defense secretary and the first presidential envoy to visit their country. Mr. Perry would pave the way for President Bill Clinton to meet a top-ranking North Korean official in Washington. 
 In the 16 years I have worked with North Korea, I have made 18 trips there, and I remain convinced that sustained diplomatic engagement is the only way to encourage the North to moderate its threatening behavior. The alternative is far worse: an isolated North Korea that is heading down a path of defiance.
 This lesson has been forgotten. When President Obama took office he pledged to engage rogue states in dialogue, but he didn't follow through with North Korea. Confronted by its provocative nuclear and missile tests, he secured international sanctions, stepped up cooperation with South Korea and Japan and even garnered some support from China, the North's closest friend. All that made sense as far as it went. 
 But then American officials neglected to re-engage Pyongyang. Instead of using last summer's extraordinary meeting between former President Clinton and Kim Jong-il to jump-start dialogue, they lashed themselves to a set of hard and fast preconditions for talks, demanding that Pyongyang pledge to give up its nuclear arsenal and return to multilateral nuclear negotiations. Last December, Ambassador Stephen Bosworth was sent to North Korea to keep communications open, but his visit was wasted as Washington spent months debating about whether to hold another meeting. 
 As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton travels to Asia next week, amid reports that a South Korean investigation has found the North responsible for sinking the South's warship Cheonan, the administration persists in playing a waiting game -- Mrs. Clinton calls it ''strategic patience'' -- based on the assumption that time is on our side. The more Pyongyang is plagued by political instability, food shortages and a declining economy, the theory goes, the more likely it will be to yield to American demands. 
 Yet Kim Jong-il remains in control. Food shortages exist, but harvests from the past two years have been relatively good. Industrial production grew last year and, thanks to ties with China, trade declined only slightly. And the North believes its nuclear security blanket makes it less vulnerable to American threats. 
 Officials in Pyongyang who have hard-line tendencies welcome American strategic patience. It enables North Korea to keep its nuclear weapons, build new ones and export dangerous technologies. (The Internet makes exporting a bomb design as easy as pressing the send button.)
 The Cheonan sinking makes clear the dangers of playing a waiting game. The sinking -- probably the North's effort to retaliate for past clashes and to humiliate the conservative South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak -- shows how unwise it is to leave stability on the peninsula hostage to Pyongyang's goodwill.
 What should the Obama administration do instead? Since Mr. Kim has said publicly that he is open to talks, the United States should do nothing to shut what may be a window of opportunity. Now that North Korea has been found responsible for the Cheonan sinking, Seoul will demand -- and the United States should support -- punishing Pyongyang. 
 But the Cheonan sinking also provides an opportunity for the Obama administration to shift its approach to North Korea. Now, we should avoid steps that might lead to a major escalation of tensions. One reasonable response would be to seek condemnation by the United Nations Security Council, while expanding military defenses against the North and strengthening cooperation with Japan.
 And instead of demanding new preconditions for talks -- an apology for the Cheonan, for example -- we should mount a gradual pragmatic effort to engage in new discussions, not as a reward for bad behavior or to talk for the sake of talking, but to make us more secure. 
 We should not delude ourselves into thinking that Kim Jong-il will soon give up his nuclear arsenal, even for financial rewards; it is too important to his vision of a strong North Korea. 
 But Mr. Kim's vision is not set in concrete. While growing political and economic ties with China have benefited the North, he is probably uncomfortable with his country's increasing dependence on Beijing. Concerned about inter-Korean tensions and about a nuclear-armed North, China would also be supportive.
 So a serious initiative to build better relations could eventually make headway. And it is very possible that, as relations improve, the North Koreans may be persuaded to accept a step-by-step process of increasingly tight, verifiable controls on their nuclear program, and on their dangerous exports. 
 While this process would not eliminate all of North Korea's nuclear weapons right away, as trust is restored, the North may reach a point where it no longer sees them as vital to its national security. But our immediate focus should be on the journey toward denuclearization, not on the final destination. 
 Negotiations with North Korea can be frustrating, but dialogue can work. It worked in 1994, when intelligence suggested that an unconstrained North could have bomb-making material for almost 100 nuclear weapons by 2000. The agreement reached months later prevented that. By the time that accord collapsed, in 2002, the North had enough material for only six weapons. Even limited success is better than none at all.
 In the aftermath of the Cheonan sinking, the United States and South Korea must recognize that a return to dialogue would serve our interests. It is the only realistic way to rein in North Korea's objectionable activities.

HEADLINE: A Past Love and a Little Wine in a Vineyard in Greece

BYLINE: By DAVID ROONEY

 BODY:
The spirit of Dionysus inhabits ''Lascivious Something,'' set in a vineyard on a remote Greek island, where the thorniest confrontations are fueled by wine. But Sheila Callaghan's frustrating play, produced at the Julia Miles Theater by the Women's Project and the Cherry Lane Theater, is too intoxicated by its own mysteries. Like a host with a limited booze supply, it withholds when it should pour freely. 
 A writer for Showtime's ''United States of Tara,'' Ms. Callaghan laces the drama with playful time shifts, setting the action in fall 1980 but referring to the current economic turmoil in Greece. The news of Ronald Reagan's election to his first term as president is announced in a BBC radio bulletin that wryly fast-forwards through three decades of economic growth, deregulated industries and overspending, seeding a worldwide financial crisis of which Greece will be a major casualty. This echoes a device by which the playwright rewinds key exchanges between her characters to reach different outcomes.
 There's a sour note to the delusions of August (Rob Campbell), an American expatriate and compromised Marxist idealist, who abruptly departed the United States in the 1960s and believes that America, despite its wealth, is dead. He's convinced that his humble vineyard's new approach to winemaking will be the start of something revolutionary. 
 He talks about how good it is to be ''in on the ground level.'' 
 ''I can actually do something,'' he says.
 When his girlfriend and fellow anti-establishment activist back then, Liza (Dana Eskelson), turns up unexpectedly, seeking answers, a tense romantic triangle forms with August's wife.
 Ms. Callaghan spends an inordinate amount of time having Liza and August dance around each other and around August's pregnant young wife, Daphne, a willowy Greek beauty played with cool charisma by Elisabeth Waterston. Throwing in the married couple's psychosexual games with an androgynous teenager (Ronete Levenson) does little to clarify the relationship dynamics. 
 The writing could use more of Daphne's frankness, not to mention some foreshadowing of the tragic secret Liza reveals, and while Christopher Akerlind's lighting splashes the rocky set with searing sunshine and moon glow, Daniella Topol's production lacks emotional illumination. For too much of this distancing play's running time, the audience is left to wonder what it's actually about.
 ''Lascivious Something'' continues through June 6 at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.

HEADLINE: Specter, Running as Democrat, Ousted in Pennsylvania Primary

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and CARL HULSE; Shaila Dewan contributed reporting from Little Rock, Ark., Kate Zernike from Bowling Green, Ky. and Katharine Q. Seelye from Philadelphia.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who left the Republican Party a year ago in hopes of salvaging a 30-year career, was rejected on Tuesday by Democratic primary voters, with Representative Joe Sestak winning the party's nomination on an anti-incumbent wave that is defining the midterm elections.
 In Kentucky, Rand Paul, the most visible symbol of the Tea Party movement, easily won the Republican Senate primary and delivered a significant blow to the Republican establishment. His 24-point victory over Trey Grayson, who was supported by the most powerful Republican on Capitol Hill, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, underscored the anti-Washington sentiment echoing across the country.
 The outcomes of both contests, along with a Democratic primary in Arkansas that pushed Senator Blanche Lincoln into a runoff election in June, illustrated anew the serious threats both parties face from candidates who are able to portray themselves as outsiders and eager to shake up the system. 
 ''I have a message, a message from the Tea Party, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words,'' Mr. Paul said in his victory speech in Bowling Green, Ky. ''We have come to take our government back.''
 In a bright spot for Democrats on Tuesday, the party retained the seat of the late Representative John P. Murtha in southwestern Pennsylvania.
 The outcome, in a district that Senator John F. Kerry carried for the Democrats in the 2004 presidential race and Senator John McCain for the Republicans four years later, gave Democrats confidence that they can hold off Republicans in hotly contested regions, despite the difficult political climate for them and President Obama.
 It was the biggest primary day so far in the midterm election year, as voters in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Oregon selected Congressional candidates for the fall, providing fresh opportunities for Republicans and Democrats to vent their anger over the size of government, the federal budget deficit and many policies of the Obama administration. 
 The primary elections on Tuesday helped set the stage for a turbulent five-month campaign, with Republicans hoping to wrest control of the House and Senate from Democrats and win several governors' races across the country. 
 The results were sobering for both parties, amounting to a rejection of candidates selected and backed by leaders in Washington who found themselves out of step with their electorates.
 Republicans and Democrats alike are now left to learn the lessons from the frustration being expressed by voters, and to unify behind nominees who face daunting general election campaigns. 
 On the Democratic side, organized labor, which invested millions into the races in Pennsylvania and Arkansas, did not achieve a victory in either state. On the right, another show of Tea Party strength left the Republican party leadership scrambling to reconnect with the grassroots.
 As Mr. Paul's victory was announced Tuesday evening, a crowd of supporters gathered around the fireplace at his victory party at the Bowling Green Country Club erupted in cheers. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Paul led Mr. Grayson by 24 percentage points.
 ''It's just a tremendous mandate for the Tea Party,'' Mr. Paul said. ''It cannot be overstated that people want something new, they don't want the same old, same old politicians. They think the system is broken and needs new blood.''
 In November, Mr. Paul will face Jack Conway, the Kentucky attorney general, who won the Democratic nomination.
 Mr. Specter, 80, lost his bid for a sixth term despite the backing of a wide swath of the Democratic Party leadership, from Mr. Obama and the White House to Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania. 
 ''It's been a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania,'' said Mr. Specter, looking drawn and downcast as he delivered a brief concession speech. With nearly all the vote counted, Mr. Sestak had 54 percent, compared with Mr. Specter's 46 percent.
 Mr. Specter won the backing of the White House after his decision last year to switch parties and help provide Democrats with a 60-vote majority in the Senate, but Mr. Sestak embarked on an aggressive campaign that sought to remind voters of what he portrayed as his opponent's politically expedient change.
 Mr. Specter was trying to make the case that his seniority and experience were needed in Congress to help his economically struggling state while Mr. Sestak, in a cuttingly effective television advertisement, tried to raise trust and credibility questions about Mr. Specter because of his long history as a Republican.
 Though Mr. Obama made an automated telephone call on Mr. Specter's behalf and was featured in advertisements, he did not make a final visit to the state on the senator's account and made an appearance on Tuesday in Ohio instead.
 Mr. Sestak, smiling broadly on Tuesday evening, declared victory by pointedly noting that he had stood up to his own party ''when that party doesn't get it right for us.''
 ''It's no surprise that people wanted change,'' he said. ''When I went to Congress just a few years ago, after 31 years in the wonderful United States Navy, I found too many career politicians are a bit too concerned about keeping their jobs, rather than serving the public and rather than helping the people.''
 Mr. Rendell, in an interview before the polls closed, cautioned against drawing broad conclusions from the results, and said Mr. Specter and most incumbents were running in a difficult environment. He said Mr. Specter and Mr. Sestak had cast similar voters over the past year, particularly on the health care and economic stimulus bills. 
 ''In fairness to Arlen,'' Mr. Rendell said, ''if the economy was ok and there was no anti-incumbent wave, this wouldn't have been a close election.''
 In addition to the primary contests, the special election in Southwestern Pennsylvania suggested that Democrats were able to score victories in this challenging political environment. Mark Critz, a former aide to Mr. Murtha, defeated Tim Burns, a Republican businessman. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Critz had 53 percent, compared with 45 percent for Mr. Burns.
 Though Democrats dominate in the district, its voters are blue-collar conservatives and it is exactly the type of swing district carried by Senator John McCain in the 2008 presidential race that Republicans must win if they are to reach their goal of taking control of the House in November. The loss dealt a blow to Republicans, who have been raising expectations for the fall.
 ''If you can't win a seat that is trending Republican in a year like this, then where is the wave?'' asked Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, who said Republicans will need to examine what went wrong.
 Yet other Republican leaders hailed the primary outcomes in the Senate on Tuesday evening as a sign that the anti-government mood echoing across the country will benefit the party in November. 
 Senator Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Conservative Fund, an organization that has been supporting conservative candidates in Republican primaries, hailed Mr. Paul's victory in Kentucky as a defeat of the Washington political establishment. 
 ''The Washington establishment threw everything they had at him and yet he prevailed,'' Mr. DeMint said. ''Rand's victory is part of an American awakening that is taking place across the country as people embrace the principles of freedom that are the backbone of our country.'' 
 Mr. Paul, the son of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, whose quixotic bid for president in 2008 helped inspire the Tea Party movement, built his campaign on a message of term limits and smaller government. 
 ''It's just a tremendous mandate for the Tea Party,'' Mr. Paul said. ''It cannot be overstated that people want something new, they don't want the same old, same old politicians. They think the system is broken and needs new blood.''

HEADLINE: Obama Tells Ohio, 'Our Economy Is Growing Again'

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- President Obama came Tuesday to this area long synonymous with economic distress to take a few strides on a victory lap for the policies he credits with helping create jobs and to knock Republicans for standing in the way. 
 ''Despite all the naysayers in Washington, who are always looking for the cloud in every silver lining, the fact is our economy is growing again,'' Mr. Obama told an audience of several hundred workers in a cavernous -- and expanding -- pipe-making plant, citing four months of job growth. 
 The president mocked Republicans in Congress who voted in near unanimity against his economic stimulus plan but at home participate in ribbon-cuttings for the job-creating projects it has helped finance. 
 ''If the 'just say no' crowd had won out,'' he said, ''if we had done things the way they wanted to go, we'd be in a deeper world of hurt than we are right now.''
 Mr. Obama's expressions of confidence in the economy and his political swipes at the opposition have both become more pronounced lately. Last year, even amid early signs of recovery, the president tempered his boasts because jobs continued to be lost, though in decreasing numbers. He has stepped up his attacks on Republicans as they have continued to dig in against his agenda, and as the midterm elections grow closer.
 Mr. Obama has been trying to get out of Washington at least once a week to call attention to the effects of his economic policies. His visit on Tuesday was to V&M Star, which boasts of being North America's leading producer of seamless pipe for the oil and gas industry. The trip had the unintended effect of calling to mind the moratorium he recently approved, since the gulf oil spill, on his proposal earlier this year to open more coastal waters to drilling.
 Donning a hard hat and a flame-retardant jacket, Mr. Obama toured the plant, chatting with company and state officials amid the roar, sparks and heat of an 85-ton blast furnace and massive machines firing orange-hot, 18-foot steel cylinders made from melted scrap. 
 Mr. Obama said a politician can get ''jaded'' after touring numerous factories, but this one, he marveled, is ''like off of a movie set.''
 Owners of the factory, which has been adapted from a former steel works dating to the early 1900s, in an industrial corridor dotted with rusted and long-abandoned plants, recently announced plans to invest $650 million to expand by a million square feet. Mr. Obama called that the biggest manufacturing investment in Ohio since the 1960s.
 According to the company and the White House, V&M's decision came about in part because the state is using $20 million from last year's $787 billion stimulus act to prepare the site for the plant's expansion and to rebuild a nearby rail yard so the company can move freight to the main rail line.
 That construction work has created 35 jobs to date. Far more jobs will stem from the company's investment -- 400 for constructing a new mill and then 350 positions for workers there, doubling the workforce by the end of next year.
 Mr. Obama was accompanied by Ohio's governor, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, and three Democratic congressmen from the area -- Representatives Charlie Wilson, John Boccieri and Tim Ryan. He saluted them for supporting the stimulus law in the face of Republicans' attacks, telling the workers, ''They've got bumps all over the backs of their heads.''
 The mostly male audience applauded often, but reflecting the region's decades of losing jobs overseas, the workers were most enthusiastic when Mr. Obama called for ''free and fair trade.'' 
 A number of employees applauded only rarely. One worker, Robin Jackson, a 61-year-old crane maintenance worker, said he did not clap because he was ''praying for the economy.'' 
 ''His message was excellent,'' added Mr. Jackson, who said he did not vote for either Mr. Obama or his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, in 2008. 
 Ron Williams, 51, said ''there's a lot of enthusiasm from this area'' for the stimulus spending and tax cuts, ''because the economy's been so down and out here and the steel mills have been shut down for so long.''

HEADLINE: U.S. STRIKES DEAL ON NEW PENALTIES BY U.N. FOR IRAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations, Peter Baker from Washington, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration announced an agreement on Tuesday with other major powers, including Russia and China, to impose a fourth set of sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, setting the stage for an intense tug of war with Tehran as it tries to avoid passage of the penalties by the full United Nations Security Council.
 The announcement came just a day after Iranian leaders announced their own tentative deal, with Turkey and Brazil, to turn over about half of Iran's stockpile of nuclear fuel for a year, part of a frantic effort to blunt the American-led campaign for harsher sanctions. 
 ''This announcement is as convincing an answer to the efforts undertaken in Tehran over the last few days as any we could provide,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, describing the agreement as a ''strong draft.'' 
 But even if the Security Council adopts the new sanctions, it is unclear whether the provisions -- including a mandate to inspect Iranian ships suspected of entering international ports with nuclear-related technology or weapons -- would inflict enough pain to force Iran to halt its uranium enrichment and cooperate with international inspectors. None of the previous three sets of sanctions passed by the Council during the Bush administration succeeded in their goal: forcing Iran to end its enrichment of uranium and to answer the many questions posed by international inspectors related to their suspicions about Iranian research into nuclear weapons.
 Some of the toughest proposals were barely even discussed as the United States sought support from China, which is a major trading partner with Iran and has been the most resistant to new sanctions. Along with the Russians, the Chinese blocked any measure that would stop the flow of oil from Iranian ports or gasoline into the country. President Obama himself had raised the possibility of such sanctions during the 2008 campaign.
 In the end, a deal was reached by the five permanent, veto-wielding members of the Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- plus Germany. They agreed on sanctions against Iranian financial institutions, including those that supported the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Members of the Guard Corps are responsible for overseeing the military aspects of the nuclear program and have assumed commanding roles in the broader Iranian economy. 
 The newest element of the sanctions would require countries to inspect ships or planes headed into or out of Iran if there were suspicions that banned materials were aboard. But as in the case of sanctions against North Korea, there is no authorization to board ships forcibly at sea, a step officials from many countries warned could touch off a larger confrontation.
 Another new element bars all countries from permitting Iran to invest in nuclear enrichment plants, uranium mines and other nuclear-related technology. That appeared to be aimed at halting rumored Iranian ventures with Venezuela and Zimbabwe, or with companies in Europe.
 The agreement came months later than the administration had hoped, and after a hectic week of diplomacy, capped by a last-minute phone call by Mrs. Clinton to Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, to confirm whether Moscow was on board, a senior American official said. 
 The United States believed that it was close to a deal last week, said the official, who did not want to be identified by name while discussing internal negotiations. But it could not resolve the final points with Russia over conventional, nonnuclear arms sales to Iran, and with China over its energy investments there.
 The American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, said, ''We will seek a vote as soon as the conditions are right and Council members have had an opportunity to consider it.'' Several officials said that moment would not come until next month, at the earliest.
 Even if the proposed sanctions survive without being watered down, administration officials concede that they are unlikely to alter Iran's behavior, unless they are combined with considerable additional pressure.
 The previous three sets of sanctions were simply ignored by many of Iran's trading partners. ''The devil has been in the implementation,'' Patrick Clawson, the deputy director for research at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies. 
 The draft resolution faces resistance from Brazil and Turkey, which have seats on the Council and brokered the deal to transfer some of Iran's nuclear fuel out of the country. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey sharply criticized the continued push for sanctions by the United States. Mr. Erdogan worked with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil to reach the accord with Iran on Monday.
 Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Brazil's ambassador to the United Nations, said, ''Brazil is not engaging in any discussion about this draft resolution, because we are sure there is a new situation.''
 Turkey and Brazil have considerable business dealings with Iran, and are seen as eager to flex their muscles on the international stage. The ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Council, speaking with reporters at the United Nations, said that they respected the compromise that the countries had reached with Iran but that it did not address their core concern: Iran's continuing efforts to enrich uranium.
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, said that the draft resolution contained ''language we can live with, because it is focused adequately on nonproliferation matters.'' 
 Li Baodong, the Chinese envoy, said the resolution should signal to Iran that it needs to cooperate with the United Nations' atomic energy agency. ''The purpose of sanctions is to bring the Iranian side to the negotiating table,'' he said, while praising the initiative taken by Brazil and Turkey.
 Iran's announcement that it would ship what is believed to be roughly half of its nuclear fuel to Turkey for further enrichment appeared to be a bid to undercut the American efforts to bring along China and Russia. The offer resembled an accord made with the West last October that fell apart when Iran backtracked. 
 Iran has said its nuclear program is intended to produce civilian energy, but American and European officials have pointed to work that seems unrelated to simply producing power.
 A senior administration official said that one of the most critical sections of the proposed sanctions was modeled on a resolution passed last year against North Korea, after its second nuclear test. That resolution authorized all nations to search cargo ships heading into or out of the country if there were suspicions that weapons or nuclear technology were aboard.
 In North Korea's case, there have already been some modest successes. In one case, North Korea sent one of its ships back to port, rather than risk having it boarded and inspected.

HEADLINE: Clients Worried About Goldman's Dueling Goals

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
''Questions have been raised that go to the heart of this institution's most fundamental value: how we treat our clients.'' -- Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's C.E.O., at the firm's annual meeting in May
 As the housing crisis mounted in early 2007, Goldman Sachs was busy selling risky, mortgage-related securities issued by its longtime client, Washington Mutual, a major bank based in Seattle.
 Although Goldman had decided months earlier that the mortgage market was headed for a fall, it continued to sell the WaMu securities to investors. While Goldman put its imprimatur on that offering, traders in the same Goldman unit were not so sanguine about WaMu's prospects: they were betting that the value of WaMu's stock and other securities would decline.
 Goldman's wager against its customer's stock -- a position known as a ''short'' -- was large enough that it would have generated at least $10 million in profits if WaMu collapsed, according to documents recently released by Congress. And by mid-May, Goldman's bet against other WaMu securities had made Goldman $2.5 million, the documents show. 
 WaMu eventually did collapse under the weight of souring mortgage loans; federal regulators seized it in September 2008, making it the biggest bank failure in American history.
 Goldman's bets against WaMu, wagers that took place even as it helped WaMu feed a housing frenzy that Goldman had already lost faith in, are examples of conflicting roles that trouble its critics and some former clients. While Goldman has legions of satisfied customers and maintains that it puts its clients first, it also sometimes appears to work against the interests of those same clients when opportunities to make trading profits off their financial troubles arise.
 Goldman's access to client information can also give its traders an advantage that many of the firm's competitors lack. And because betting against a company's shares or its debt can create an atmosphere of doubt about a company's financial standing, Goldman because of its size and its position in the market can help make the success of some of its wagers faits accomplis.
 Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, declined to say how much the firm earned on its bets against WaMu's stock. He said his firm lost money on its bets against the other WaMu securities. In an e-mail reply to questions for this article, he said there was nothing improper about Goldman's wagers against any of its clients. ''Shorting stock or buying credit protection in order to manage exposures are typical tools to help a firm reduce its risk.''
 WaMu is not the only Goldman client the firm bet against as the mortgage disaster gained steam. Documents released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations show that Goldman's mortgage unit also wagered against Bear Stearns and Countrywide Financial, two longstanding clients of the firm. These documents are only related to the mortgage unit and it is unknown what other bets the rest of the firm made.
 Goldman also bet against the American International Group, which insured Goldman's mortgage bonds, and National City, a Cleveland bank the firm had advised on a sale of a big subprime mortgage lender to Merrill Lynch.
 While no one has accused Goldman of anything illegal involving WaMu, National City, A.I.G. or the other clients it bet against, potential conflicts inherent in Wall Street's business model are at the core of many of the investigations that state and federal authorities are conducting. Transactions entered into as the mortgage market fizzled may turn out to have been perfectly legal. Nevertheless, they have raised concerns among investors and analysts about the extent to which a variety of Wall Street firms put their own interests ahead of their clients'.
 ''Now it's all about the score. Just make the score, do the deal. Move on to the next one. That's the trader culture,'' said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University and former counsel to the Federal Reserve Board. ''Their business model has completely blurred the difference between executing trades on behalf of customers versus executing trades for themselves. It's a huge problem.''
 Goldman has come under particularly intense scrutiny on such issues since the financial and economic downturn began gathering momentum in 2007, in part because it has done so well, in part because of the power it wields in Washington and on Wall Street, and in part because regulators have taken a keen interest in its dealings.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud suit against the firm last month, contending that it misled clients who bought a mortgage security that the regulators said was intended to fail. Goldman has said it did nothing wrong and is fighting the case. Legislators in Washington are also considering financial reforms that limit potential conflicts of interest in the way that firms like Goldman trade and invest their own money.
 Still, Goldman's many hats -- trader, adviser, underwriter, matchmaker of buyers and sellers, and salesperson -- has left some clients feeling bruised or so wary that they have sometimes avoided doing business with the bank.
 During the early stages of the mortgage crisis, Goldman seems to have unnerved WaMu's former chief executive, Kerry K. Killinger, according to an e-mail message that Congressional investigators released.
 In that message, Mr. Killinger noted that he had avoided retaining Goldman's investment bankers in the fall of 2007 because he was concerned about how the firm would use knowledge it gleaned from that relationship. He pointed out that Goldman was ''shorting mortgages big time'' even while it had been advising Countrywide, a major mortgage lender.
 ''I don't trust Goldy on this,'' he wrote. ''They are smart, but this is swimming with the sharks.''
 One of Mr. Killinger's lieutenants at Washington Mutual felt the same way. ''We always need to worry a little about Goldman,'' that person wrote in an e-mail message, ''because we need them more than they need us and the firm is run by traders.''
 Mr. Killinger does not appear to have known that Goldman was selling short his company's shares. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. But because Bear Stearns, National City, Countrywide and WaMu all were hammered by the mortgage crisis, any bets Goldman made against each of those firm's shares were likely to have been profitable.
 Even though Goldman had frequently shorted the shares of other firms, it, along with another bank, Morgan Stanley, successfully lobbied the S.E.C. in 2008, at the height of the mortgage collapse, to forbid traders from shorting financial shares, sparing its own stock.
 CONFLICT OF PRINCIPLES
 As Trading Arm Grows, a Clash of Purpose
 When new hires begin working at Goldman, they are told to follow 14 principles that outline the firm's best practices. ''Our clients' interests always come first'' is principle No. 1. The 14th principle is: ''Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business.''
 But some former insiders, who requested anonymity because of concerns about retribution from the firm, say Goldman has a 15th, unwritten principle that employees openly discuss.
 It urges Goldman workers to embrace conflicts and argues that they are evidence of a healthy tension between the firm and its customers. If you are not embracing conflicts, the argument holds, you are not being aggressive enough in generating business.
 Mr. van Praag said the firm was ''unaware'' of this 15th principle, adding that ''any business in any industry, has potential conflicts and we all have an obligation to manage them effectively.''
 But a former Goldman partner, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the company's view of customers had changed in recent years. Under Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, and a cadre of top lieutenants who have ramped up the firm's trading operation, conflict avoidance had shifted to conflict management, this person said. Along the way, he said, the firm's executives have come to see customers more as competitors they trade against than as clients.
 In fact, Mr. Blankfein and Goldman are quick to remind critics that Wall Street deals with sophisticated investors, who they say can protect themselves. At the bank's shareholder meeting earlier this month, Mr. Blankfein said, ''We deal with the most demanding and, in some cases, cynical clients.''
 Even Goldman's mortgage department compliance training manual from 2007 acknowledges the challenges posed by the firm's clients-come-first rule. Loyalty to customers ''is not always straightforward'' given the multiple financial hats Goldman wears in the market, the manual notes.
 In addition, the manual explains how Goldman uses information harvested from clients who discuss the market, indicate interest in securities or leave orders consisting of ''pretrade information.'' The manual notes that Goldman also can deploy information it receives from a wide range of other sources, including data providers, other brokerage firms and securities exchanges.
 ''We continuously make markets and take risk based on a unique window on the market which is a mosaic constructed of all of the pieces of data received,'' the manual said.
 Mr. van Praag, the Goldman spokesman, said that the ''manual recognizes that like many businesses, and certainly all our competitors, we serve multiple clients. In the process of serving multiple clients we receive information from multiple sources.''
 ''This policy and the excerpt cited from the training manual simply reflects the fact that we have a diverse client base and give our sales people and traders appropriate guidance,'' he added.
 CREATIVE DESTRUCTION 
 Fostering a Market Then Abandoning It 
 Even now, two years after a dispute with Goldman, C. Talbot Heppenstall Jr. gets miffed talking about the firm.
 As treasurer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a leading nonprofit health care institution, Mr. Heppenstall had once been pleased with Goldman's work on the enterprise's behalf.
 Beginning in 2002, Goldman had advised officials at U.P.M.C. to raise funds by issuing auction-rate securities. Auction-rate securities are stock or debt instruments with interest rates that reset regularly (usually weekly) in auctions overseen by the brokerage firms that sell them. Municipalities, student loan companies, mutual funds, hospitals and museums all used the securities to raise operating funds.
 Goldman had helped to develop the auction-rate market and advised many clients to issue them, getting an annual fee for sponsoring the auctions. Between 2002 and 2008, U.P.M.C. issued $400 million; Goldman underwrote $160 million, while Morgan Stanley and UBS sold the rest.
 But in the fall of 2007, as the credit crisis deepened, investors began exiting the $330 billion market, causing interest rates on the securities to drift upward. By mid-January 2008, U.P.M.C. was concerned about the viability of the market and asked Goldman if the hospital should get out. Stay the course, Goldman advised U.P.M.C. in a letter, a copy of which Mr. Heppenstall read to a reporter.
 On Feb. 12, less than a month after that letter, Goldman withdrew from the market -- the first Wall Street firm to do so, according to a Federal Reserve report. Other firms quickly followed suit.
 With the market in disarray, the interest rates that U.P.M.C. and other issuers had to pay investors skyrocketed. Rather than pay the rates, U.P.M.C. decided to redeem the securities.
 Although Goldman had fled the market, it refused to allow a redemption to proceed, Mr. Heppenstall said, warning that its contract with the hospital barred U.P.M.C. from buying back the securities for at least another month.
 U.P.M.C. had to continue paying lofty interest rates -- as well as Goldman's fees, even though the firm was no longer sponsoring the auctions, according to Mr. Heppenstall.
 Goldman had been U.P.M.C.'s investment banker for about six years, Mr. Heppenstall noted in an interview, but this incident marked the end of that relationship. He said that the other Wall Street firms that had underwritten U.P.M.C.'s auction-rate securities, Morgan Stanley and UBS, had allowed it to redeem them. Goldman was the only firm that did not.
 ''This conflict was the last straw in our relationship with Goldman Sachs and we no longer do any business with them,'' he said.
 Mr. van Praag, the Goldman spokesman, declined in his e-mail message to respond in detail to U.P.M.C.'s complaints, other than to say that a contract is a contract and that governed how Goldman interacted with the hospital.
 ''The legal agreements that governed U.P.M.C.'s A.R.S. securities did not allow U.P.M.C. to bid for its own securities in the auctions,'' he said.
 MUNI MANAGEMENT
 Brokering State Debt and Advising Against It
 A state assemblyman in New Jersey named Gary S. Schaer also has had unsettling encounters with Goldman.
 Mr. Schaer, who heads the New Jersey Assembly's Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, said he became wary in 2008 when he learned that Goldman, one of the state's main investment bankers, was encouraging speculators to bet against New Jersey's debt in the derivatives market. (At the time, a former Goldman chief executive, Jon Corzine, was New Jersey's governor).
 Goldman had managed $4.2 billion in debt issuance for the state since 2004, receiving fees for arranging those deals.
 A 59-page collection of trading ideas that Goldman put together in 2008, and which was reviewed by The New York Times, shows the firm recommending that customers buy insurance to protect themselves against a debt default by New Jersey. In addition to New Jersey, Goldman advocated placing bets against the debt of eight other states in the trading book. Goldman also underwrote debt for all but two of those states in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Mr. Schaer complained to Mr. Blankfein in a letter in December 2008. A response came back from Kevin Willens, a managing director in Goldman's public finance unit; he argued that Goldman maintained impermeable barriers between its unit that had helped New Jersey raise debt and another unit that was urging investors to bet against the state's ability to repay that debt. Mr. Schaer replied that he doubted the barriers were impenetrable.
 ''New Jersey taxpayers cannot be expected to pay tens of millions of dollars in investment banking fees while another department of the very same firm -- albeit one clearly and strategically walled off -- actively or aggressively advocates the sale of the very same or similar bonds in the aftermath,'' Mr. Schaer wrote.
 Mr. Schaer said in an interview that he tried to get regulations passed to prevent banks from playing such dual roles in state finances, but has made little headway.
 ''I hope the federal government will undertake this problem, and it is a problem,'' he said. ''It's unrealistic to think the wall -- no matter how thick or how tall -- will be effective.''
 Goldman's many financial roles have raised concerns well beyond the state level. Over the years, it has played the role of adviser and fund-raiser for a diverse range of countries, while occasionally drawing criticism for simultaneously betting against the ability of some countries, like Russia, to repay their debts.
 TRADING MATRIX
 As Client Positions Sour, Goldman Defends Own
 Goldman's powerful and nimble trading desk has become a reliable fountain of profits for the firm. But it has also instilled fear among some clients who say they believe, as Mr. Killinger and others at Washington Mutual did, that Goldman trades against the interests of some of its clients.
 Trading desks make big bets using the firm's and clients' money. Goldman's trading operation has grown so pivotal and influential that many analysts say the firm as a whole now operates more like a hedge fund than an investment bank -- another benchmark of the firm's internal evolution that can create new friction with clients.
 For example, if Goldman makes a proprietary bet in a particular market, as it did in early 2007 when it amassed a huge wager against mortgages, what stops it from positioning itself against clients who operate in that market?
 Bear Stearns, a now defunct investment bank, is a case in point.
 With the housing crisis gathering steam in March 2007, Goldman created and sold to clients a $1 billion package of mortgage-related securities called Timberwolf. Within months, investors lost 80 percent of their money as Timberwolf plummeted.
 Bear bought a $300 million slice of Timberwolf through some of its funds, and the investment was disastrous. The funds collapsed under the weight of Timberwolf and other errant investments, beginning a downward spiral for Bear itself that ended a year later with the firm forced into the arms of JPMorgan Chase to prevent a bankruptcy.
 Goldman, however, benefited from the problems its securities helped to create, Congressional documents show. Around the same time that Bear was investing in Timberwolf, Goldman was placing a bet that Bear's shares would fall. Goldman's short position in Bear was large enough that it would have generated as much as $33 million in profits if Bear collapsed, according to the documents.
 Mr. van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, declined in the e-mail message to say how much the firm earned on those bets or whether they were still on when Bear finally collapsed.
 Goldman was busy with other clients as well during 2007, including Thornburg Mortgage, a high-end lender. Goldman was one of 22 financial companies that lent money to Thornburg; it was using about $200 million of a Goldman credit line backed by mortgage loans.
 In August 2007, Goldman was the first firm to begin aggressively marking down the value of Thornburg assets used as collateral for the loan. Goldman said the assets were not valuable enough to repay the loan if Thornburg defaulted. Goldman demanded more cash to shore up the account.
 According to five people briefed on the relationship who requested anonymity because they didn't want to damage continuing business relationships, Goldman told Thornburg that the request was justified because the value of similar mortgages traded by other parties had been priced at lower levels. But Goldman, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, had not actually seen such trades.
 Thornburg officials, however, pushed back on Goldman's request, questioning the values the firm put on Thornburg's portfolio. ''When we tried to negotiate price, they argued that they were aware of transactions that were not broadly known on the Street,'' said a former Thornburg employee briefed on the talks with Goldman. ''That was their justification for why they were marking us down as aggressively as they were -- that they were aware of things that others were not.''
 Even as Goldman pressured Thornburg for cash, a Goldman banker pitched Thornburg to hire the firm to help it raise new funds. Thornburg turned elsewhere.
 Thornburg wasn't the only firm Goldman pressured this way. It made similar demands -- using similar arguments -- of A.I.G., the insurer that stood behind many of Goldman's mortgage securities. Ultimately, Goldman's demands drained the insurer of so much cash that a hobbled A.I.G. required a taxpayer bailout in September 2008. Meanwhile, Goldman had been buying protection against a possible debt default by A.I.G. at the same time that it was pressuring A.I.G. to pay it additional cash. Because Goldman's own cash demands were weakening A.I.G., Goldman had a front-row seat to the distress the company was experiencing -- giving Goldman added insight that buying default insurance on A.I.G. was probably a shrewd investment.
 Although Goldman's financial insight derived from proprietary dealings with A.I.G., and included facts that others in the market most likely didn't have, Mr. van Praag, the Goldman spokesman, said that his firm was not capitalizing on nonpublic information.
 Like A.I.G., Thornburg found that arguing with Goldman was fruitless, because the firm had favorable contracts with Thornburg governing disputes. So Thornburg accepted Goldman's valuations, but then established credit lines with other banks.
 Although Goldman lost a customer, its mortgage unit had gained a victory: the firm could cite the valuations that Thornburg accepted as proper pricing for mortgage securities when it got into similar disputes with other clients.
 ''If they could move our positions, they could then argue with A.I.G. or some of their other big positions that our marks were where the market was,'' the former Thornburg employee said. ''They could have this sort of client arbitrage going on.''
 Mr. van Praag, the Goldman spokesman, said his firm's dispute with Thornburg was about differing standards for valuing collateral, nothing more.
 ''We are a 'mark to market' institution and we mark our positions on a daily basis to reflect what we believe is the current value for a security if we decided to sell it,'' he said. ''Those marks are verified by our controllers department, which is independent from the securities division.''
 Goldman said that the mortgage collapse and Thornburg's financial problems vindicate the posture it took on how to value Thornburg's collateral. ''Subsequent events clearly indicated that our marks were accurate and realistic,'' Mr. van Praag said.
 Indeed, soon after Goldman demanded more funds from Thornburg, analysts began downgrading its shares on news of the collateral calls. Beaten down by the broader mortgage collapse, Thornburg filed for bankruptcy protection on May 1, 2009.

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Call Reform Bill a 'Takeover' of the Banking Industry

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday unleashed a barrage of criticism at the far-reaching financial regulatory legislation being debated on the Senate floor, indicating that many of the party's leaders were prepared to vote against the bill.
 Republicans accused Senate Democrats and the Obama White House of orchestrating a ''government takeover'' of the financial industry and suggested that the bill would severely harm businesses on Main Street. 
 A procedural vote to wrap up debate is set for Wednesday, and despite the sharp Republican rhetoric, the legislation is expected to be approved. It would then need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House in December. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the main sponsor of the regulatory bill, put forward an amendment hoping to broker a compromise over a controversial provision that would force the biggest Wall Street banks to spin off their lucrative derivatives business. 
 Under Mr. Dodd's proposal the new restrictions on derivatives trading would be delayed for two years until after they have been studied by a council of federal regulators. The council would probably kill the provision, and Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, the author of the rules, said that she would fight efforts to weaken them. 
 Mrs. Lincoln, who was home in Arkansas on Tuesday battling for her career in a tough primary race, issued a statement saying she would not back down. 
 ''I'm proud of the support my provision has received both inside and outside the Senate and will defend it should there be a debate on the Senate floor,'' Mrs. Lincoln said.
 The remarks by Republican leaders on Tuesday suggested they saw no benefit in joining with the Democrats even to impose tougher rules on Wall Street. At a news conference, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, blamed the White House. 
 ''The marching orders are coming from downtown: push the bill as far to the political left as possible,'' he said. ''Look at the last 15 months. They're running banks, insurance companies, car companies, taking over the student loan business, taking over health care, now, apparently doing to the financial services industry what they did to the health care industry.'' 
 ''This is a massive government overreach,'' Mr. McConnell said, adding that Republicans were confident about their political prospects. ''The American people are saying, 'enough' and I think that's why everyone is anticipating a major midcourse correction this November.'' 
 The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, countered by accusing Republicans of doing the bidding of big banks. 
 ''We have a strong bill to crack down on Wall Street gamblers, end too big to fail and protect consumers,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Republicans have made it clear that they have no interest in accountability or fairness.'' 
 Mr. Reid said the Republicans had tried ''time and time again, to weaken these Wall Street reforms, and shield those big banker friends that they have. The Senate rejected those efforts.'' 
 But given the deep public anger over the 2008 financial collapse, at least a handful of Republicans who are up for re-election are expected to support the legislation. And some Republican aides said party leaders might still support the bill, if they win additional concessions before a final vote, perhaps Thursday. 
 With the race on to complete the bill, lawmakers battled furiously to get votes on their amendments. 
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, clashed with his fellow Democrats to get a vote on an amendment to outlaw so-called naked credit default swaps, by which investors buy insurance on bonds they do not own. 
 Mr. Dorgan, who is retiring after this year, criticized lawmakers in both parties for trying to block a vote on his plan, which he said would curb risky behavior by financial companies. ''It's a purely speculative gamble,'' Mr. Dorgan said. ''There's not one social or economic benefit.'' 
 He added, ''There's about $10.9 trillion in credit default swaps held by commercial banks. Those are institutions, by the way, whose deposits are insured by us, by the American taxpayer.'' His amendment was defeated, 57 to 38. 
 In other floor action, the Senate, by a vote of 80 to 18, approved an amendment that would ease proposed restrictions on the federal government's ability to prevent states from adopting and enforcing their own, tougher standards on federally-regulated banks.
 The amendment, sponsored by Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, relaxed some of the proposed restrictions on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's ability to override state banking laws. The overall intent of the broader bill, however, is to make it tougher for the federal government to do so.
 While approving the measure, the Senate rejected, by a vote of 55 to 43, a more sweeping proposal by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, that would have restricted state attorneys general from enforcing rules to be issued by a new federal consumer financial protection bureau.
 With primary elections being held in several states on Tuesday, Republican Senate leaders seemed intent to portray Democrats as growing the federal government. 
 ''Increasingly, the majority seems to be doing what they did on health care now to Main Street,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican. ''It looks like another Washington takeover.''

HEADLINE: Mired in Canada's Oil Sands

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Clifford Krauss reported from Alberta, and Elisabeth Rosenthal from New York.

 BODY:
CONKLIN, Alberta -- Beneath the subarctic forests of western Canada, deep under the peat bogs and herds of wild caribou, lies the tarry rock that is one of America's top sources of imported oil.
 There is no chance of a rig blowout here, or a deepwater oil spill like the one from the BP well that is now fouling the Gulf of Mexico. But the oil extracted from Canada's oil sands poses other environmental challenges, like toxic sludge ponds, greenhouse gas emissions and the destruction of boreal forests.
 In addition, critics warn that American regulators have waived a longstanding safety standard for the pipelines that deliver the synthetic crude oil from Canada to refineries in the United States and have not required any specific emergency plans to deal with a spill, which even regulators acknowledge is a possibility.
 Oil sands are now getting more scrutiny as the Obama administration reviews a Canadian company's request to build a new 2,000-mile underground pipeline that would run from Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast and would significantly increase America's access to the oil. In making the decision, due this fall, federal officials are weighing the environmental concerns against the need to secure a reliable supply of oil to help satisfy the nation's insatiable thirst. 
 The gulf accident adds yet another layer of complexity. Regulators and Congress are weighing new limits on drilling off the coastline after the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, increasing the pressure to rely more heavily on Canada's oil sands. At the same time, political consciousness of the risks has grown.
 Canadian oil sands are expected to become America's top source of imported oil this year, surpassing conventional Canadian oil imports and roughly equaling the combined imports from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm.
 In a new report, it projects that oil sands production could make up as much as 36 percent of United States oil imports by 2030. ''The uncertainty and the slowdown in drilling permits in the gulf really underscores the growing importance of Canadian oil sands, which over the last decade have gone from being a fringe energy source to being one of strategic importance,'' said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and chairman of IHS CERA. ''Looking ahead, its importance is only going to get bigger.''
 Last week, a phalanx of Canadian diplomats took advantage of a previously planned trip to Washington to promote oil sands as a safer alternative to deepwater drilling because leaks would be easier to detect and control.
 In an interview afterward, Alberta's premier, Ed Stelmach, said he was not trying to capitalize on the gulf disaster, but merely promoting ''what we have to offer, which is security of supply'' and ''a safe stable government.''
 From a supply standpoint, there is much to recommend oil sands, also known as tar sands. Canada has 178 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, virtually all in oil sands. Only Saudi Arabia has more proven oil reserves.
 The United States produces about five million barrels of oil a day and imports 10 million more. Canada accounts for about 1.9 million barrels of the daily imports, roughly half of it from oil sands.
 ''If you need crude to fuel your economy, you'd really better be thinking about Canada,'' said Chris Seasons, president of the Canadian unit of Devon Energy, an oil company based in Oklahoma City. Devon is already producing 35,000 barrels a day from oil sands around Conklin. It expects to expand its production to 200,000 barrels a day by 2020, in part through a second project, with BP. That would be roughly equivalent to current imports from Kuwait.
 To increase delivery of oil sands crude, TransCanada is building the Keystone pipeline system. Two Keystone pipelines have been approved, with the first one delivering oil to Illinois in June. A much longer pipeline to Texas, called Keystone XL, is still under federal review. If fully developed as proposed, the system would allow Canada to export an additional 1.1 million barrels of oil a day.
 In a world in which so many oil-producing nations are far away, unstable or hostile to the United States, Canadian oil sands hold great political appeal.
 ''It is undeniable that having a large supply of crude oil available by pipeline from a friendly neighbor is extremely valuable to the energy security of the United States,'' said David L. Goldwyn, coordinator for international energy affairs at the State Department. The department is scheduled to decide this year whether to approve Keystone XL.
 Complicating the calculation is the fact that Canada's backup market for its oil is probably China. Plans are already under way for pipelines from Alberta to Canada's western coast for shipments to Asia. Although those could take up to a decade to build because of land considerations, Mr. Stelmach, Alberta's premier, flew to China on Friday on a trade mission to Shanghai, Beijing and Harbin. He said one of his messages was, ''We've got energy.''
 Whatever the advantages, serious environmental problems and risks come with producing oil from oil sands.
 Most of the biggest production sites are huge mine pits, accompanied by ponds of waste that are so toxic that the companies try to frighten birds away with scarecrows and propane cannons.
 Extracting oil from the sands produces far more greenhouse gases than drilling, environmental groups say, and the process requires three barrels of water for every barrel of oil produced because the dirt must be washed out. Already, tailing pools cover 50 square miles of land abutting the Athabasca River.
 The mines are also carving gashes in the world's largest intact forest, which serves as a vital absorber of carbon dioxide and a stopover point for millions of migrating birds.
 Proponents of oil sands acknowledge the dirtiness of the extraction process. But they say that newer projects are using more efficient technologies.
 For example, instead of surface mining, the Devon project injects high-pressure steam into the reservoir to enable the heated oil sands to be pumped out of the ground as a fluid, which is less invasive of the forest. Shell is also experimenting with ways to capture some of the carbon emissions, and other companies are trying to use solvents to heat the steam more efficiently.
 Some analysts argue that imports from oil sands will replace conventional oil from places like Venezuela and Mexico, where heavy oil requires so much refining that it produces a comparable amount of greenhouse gas emissions. For the United States, ''in the grand scheme of things, the actual emissions impact is very small,'' said Michael A. Levi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 But environmental groups are unmoved. ''Having tar sands in our energy mix is simply inconsistent with the kind of climate and environment promises we've heard the Obama administration make,'' said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, who works on the issue at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 The high-pressure pipelines that transport the oil give rise to separate safety and environmental concerns, which have been spotlighted by local ranchers and other opponents during the current comment period on the State Department's environmental impact statement for the proposed pipeline expansion.
 One big question is whether TransCanada should get waivers to use thinner pipes on Keystone XL than is normally required in the United States.
 The Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which oversees oil pipelines, gave such waivers to TransCanada for the first two Keystone pipelines. TransCanada says the thinner pipes have been allowed in Canada for decades and pose no extra risk.
 But Cesar de Leon, a former deputy administrator of the pipeline and safety administration who is now an independent pipeline safety engineer, said the thinner standard is appropriate only if pipelines are being aggressively monitored for deterioration. Although the safety administration required such monitoring in the Keystone permits, it ''didn't have the people to monitor compliance,'' he said.
 In a report in March on the agency's broader permitting practices, the Transportation Department's inspector general found that, in many cases, the agency had failed to check the safety records of permit applicants and had not checked to verify that permit terms were being followed.
 Officials of the safety administration did not respond to interview requests. But in written testimony to a House committee in April, the agency's new administrator, Cynthia L. Quarterman, acknowledged problems and promised to improve. ''As you know,'' she said, ''we inherited a program that suffered from almost a decade of neglect and was seriously adrift.''
 Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said the whole situation was alarmingly reminiscent of the permit waivers that were routinely granted to offshore oil wells, including the BP well leaking in the gulf. ''I think it is incumbent on myself as a policy maker to say 'hold it,' '' Mr. Tester said.
 In another sign of concern among policy makers, on April 29 South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission rejected TransCanada's request for an exemption from a state requirement to notify affected landowners about spills of less than five barrels.
 The gulf spill haunted local public hearings on the Keystone project last week in Murdo, S.D., and York, Neb.
 Some people along the path of the proposed and existing pipelines complained that no one had required TransCanada to produce an emergency plan for a spill, even though the new pipes would traverse pristine territory, including the Ogallala Aquifer, which supplies water to a wide swath of the nation's breadbasket and where even a small spill could have grave consequences.
 Others demanded that thicker steel be used. And some asked how the pipeline would be monitored for wear and tear.
 At the York hearing on May 10, Jim Condon, an engineer from Lincoln, Neb., said the amount of oil spewing from the leaking BP well was just a small fraction of what would be passing through the Keystone XL pipeline. ''A rupture of the pipeline would be a huge problem,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Stocks in Retreat After Sharp Gains in 2009

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- After a spectacular rise last year, China's stock market has plummeted on what analysts say are growing concerns about Europe's debt crisis and expectations that Beijing is about to take strong action to slow the nation's booming economy and prevent it from overheating.
 Investors are worried that Chinese exports to Europe will slow in the coming months and that government efforts to tame this country's economy by tightening credit will hamper a wide array of industries, including the nation's fast-growing real estate market. 
 Although share prices in Shanghai rose modestly Tuesday after falling 5 percent Monday, the Shanghai composite index remains near its lowest level in a year, down about 21 percent this year.
 Stock prices have also fallen sharply over the last few months in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, largely because Beijing is expected to raise interest rates and tighten bank lending to help rein in inflation and soaring property prices.
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index is down about 9 percent this year.
 China's economy has been red hot since late 2009, when Beijing's huge economic stimulus package began to kick in along with record lending by state-owned banks. In the first quarter of this year, China said its economy grew 11.9 percent.
 The aggressive lending helped revive China's building boom and sent Chinese stock prices soaring. Last year, the Shanghai composite rose about 80 percent, making it the world's best-performing major stock market.
 But now, with mixed signals about the prospects of a solid global recovery by the end of this year, analysts say Chinese investors have grown cautious.
 ''This doesn't really reflect what's happening in the economy now, but it reflects what investors think will happen in the future,'' said Zhao Xinge, an associate professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. ''The new policies could cool the real estate market. And the real estate market plays a major role in the economy -- not just steel and construction companies, even home appliances.''
 Although China's economy is still roaring, many economists expect growth to slow modestly in the latter part of this year, partly because of tighter monetary policies. And some warn of potentially bigger trouble ahead, particularly if exports to the United States and Europe -- China's two biggest markets -- are weak, and government stimulus money dries up.
 Perhaps in anticipation, some investors are already pulling back from the stock market.
 ''This was a cash-driven rally, and now liquidity's being driven down a bit,'' said Stephen Green, a Shanghai-based economist at the Standard Chartered Bank.
 Henry Cao, a professor of finance at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, says some Chinese investors are already looking to invest overseas.
 ''They're hoping returns there might be better,'' Professor Cao said.
 But other analysts caution that the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets are known for attracting speculators and, unlike the more stable Hang Seng index, are prone to volatile price swings. 
 In late 2007, the Shanghai composite soared as high as 6,036 before collapsing in 2008 and falling to about 1,717. Only late in 2009 did it start sprinting forward again. The Shenzhen index is down about 17 percent this year.
 And yet, there is often a sense of optimism among investors in China, particularly in Shanghai, that any slowdown is just a breather before the next great stock rally.
 That was evident Saturday, when this city unveiled a huge bronze sculpture of a charging bull and placed it in the Bund financial square. The sculpture is a replica of the one located in New York, on Wall Street. Both were produced by the Italian-American artist Arturo di Modica.

HEADLINE: The Hurdles of Foster Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''What's in a Name? A Lot, as It Turns Out'' (news article, May 10) did an outstanding job of calling national attention to the identity issues and the precarious life experiences of youth in foster care. 
 For thousands of children languishing in our nation's foster care system, the road to adulthood is paved with daunting hurdles and hardships that profoundly affect their lives long after they exit foster care and contribute to higher than average rates of homelessness, criminality, drug abuse and unemployment.
 Max Pauson's encouraging personal story of survival and his promising future as a talented cartoonist are resounding evidence of the imperative need for foster youth to have a lifeline of connections to a network of supportive adults and continuing financial resources to ensure a successful transition to a healthy and productive life after foster care.
 Thankfully, the federal and state governments are making progress on addressing these needs.

HEADLINE: City Hall's Economic Development Chief to Step Down

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Robert C. Lieber, the former Wall Street executive who has guided the Bloomberg administration's economic development efforts during the recession, told his staff on Wednesday that he would step down as deputy mayor in June.
 Mr. Lieber, 55, who has been in the job since January 2008, has focused on projects including the redevelopment of Coney Island, the city's takeover of Governors Island and the rezoning of Willets Point in Queens. He also has pushed the city's economic development strategy beyond big real estate deals to include smaller entrepreneurial initiatives and a number of growing industries.
 ''He recognized that economic development is much more than real estate development,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City. ''He understood the importance of establishing working relationships with industry leaders and aligning city policies and programs with their needs.'' 
 One significant result of meetings with media and technology companies was the creation of an incubator for small information technology companies in the Hudson Square area of Manhattan.
 Mr. Lieber said he had not intended to leave City Hall, but an old friend and former client, Andrew L. Farkas, had offered him a spot at the Island Capital Group, a merchant real estate bank that recently acquired a company that, he said, would be at the center of sorting out troubled real estate loans.
 ''I told the mayor this is the toughest decision I ever had to make,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''I love the job. I'm most proud of having taken a lot of these projects that had been put in the oven but not baked and gotten them done, whether it's Coney Island, Willets Point or the World Trade Center.''
 To his regret, Mr. Lieber was unable to overcome opposition in the City Council to turning the city-owned Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping mall. Some Council members, unions and community groups had sought to require prospective employers there to pay workers at least $10 an hour, a sum that both the developer and Mr. Lieber said would have put the mall at a competitive disadvantage. 
 Mr. Lieber was well known in business circles when he took the job, but he did not have the same high profile as his predecessor, Daniel L. Doctoroff, who was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's first deputy mayor for economic development. Armed with a broad vision of the city's future, Mr. Doctoroff was often the public face of the administration as he spearheaded the city's ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, worked on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center and rezoned the Far West Side of Manhattan and the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn for high-rises. 
 In January 2007, Mr. Doctoroff recruited Mr. Lieber, then the managing director for the private equity division of Lehman Brothers, to become the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. When Mr. Doctoroff resigned a year later, Mr. Lieber moved to City Hall.
 Mr. Lieber is the third deputy mayor to announce his departure at a time when city government is cutting budgets and is less able to embark on grand plans. In March, Edward Skyler announced that he was leaving for Citigroup, and Kevin Sheekey said he was headed to Bloomberg L.P.
 Mr. Bloomberg has not been shy about going outside of government ranks for their replacements. He appointed Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis and a management expert, to Mr. Skyler's job as deputy mayor for operations, despite his unfamiliarity with New York.
 But replacing Mr. Lieber may be another matter. The city lost roughly 150,000 jobs during the recession, and the unemployment rate is 10 percent. Modest job growth has been reported recently, but much of it has been at the lower end of the pay scale.
 ''They need a replacement who is able to hit the ground running in order to implement much-needed economic development initiatives,'' said Ross F. Moskowitz, a former city economic development official who is now a partner at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. ''Resources are scarce, and there's an immediate need for action.''
 City officials say they are looking at candidates inside and outside the administration. Prospects include the current president of the Economic Development Corporation, Seth W. Pinsky, and two former leaders of the agency, Josh Sirefman and Carl B. Weisbrod. 
 Mr. Lieber was criticized at times by real estate executives for what they called a lack of vision and for failing to push hard enough for their proposals or to overcome objections from rival departments at City Hall. 
 Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for small businesses who opposed the city's plan to redevelop Willets Point and to use eminent domain to gain control of the land, said that Mr. Lieber's approach failed to account for the collateral damage to the neighborhood.
 ''The deputy mayor and his agency have proceeded in a recession to promote a project that is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and displace scores of small businesses and thousands of workers without any conceivable plan or a developer to implement it,'' Mr. Lipsky said.
 In April, John C. Liu, the city comptroller, released an audit showing that the Economic Development Corporation, which Mr. Lieber oversees, had kept more than $125 million in payments, taxes and fees rather than turning them over to the city's general fund.
 Mr. Bloomberg praised Mr. Lieber on Wednesday. ''Bob came to our administration with a reputation for getting things done, and he certainly has,'' he said in a statement. ''Bob helped set the path for growth that will benefit New Yorkers for generations.''

HEADLINE: Teachers Facing Weakest Market For Jobs in Years

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
PELHAM, N.Y. -- In the month since Pelham Memorial High School in Westchester County advertised seven teaching jobs, it has been flooded with 3,010 applications from candidates as far away as California. The Port Washington District on Long Island is sorting through 3,620 applications for eight positions -- the largest pool the superintendent has seen in his 41-year career. 
 Even hard-to-fill specialties are no longer so hard to fill. Jericho, N.Y., has 963 people to choose from for five spots in special education, more than twice as many as in past years. In Connecticut, chemistry and physics jobs in Hartford that normally attract no more than 5 candidates have 110 and 51, respectively. 
 The recession seems to have penetrated a profession long seen as recession-proof. Superintendents, education professors and people seeking work say teachers are facing the worst job market since the Great Depression. Amid state and local budget cuts, cash-poor urban districts like New York City and Los Angeles, which once hired thousands of young people every spring, have taken down the help-wanted signs. 
 Even upscale suburban districts are preparing for huge levels of layoffs. School officials and union leaders estimate that more than 150,000 teachers nationwide could lose their jobs next year, far more than any other time, including the last major financial crisis of the 1970s.
 Juliana Pankow, who just graduated from Teachers College at Columbia University, has sent out 40 resumes since January. A few Saturdays ago, she went to a school in Harlem because she heard the principal would be there (she was invited back to teach a demonstration lesson, but it may be for naught since the city has a hiring freeze). Now, Ms. Pankow said she might have to move back in with her parents in Scarsdale, N.Y., and perhaps take up SAT tutoring. 
 ''I can't think of anything else I'd rather do,'' said Ms. Pankow, 23, as she waited outside the principal's office at Pelham Memorial last week, among 619 people applying for one English position. ''Which is a problem, because I might have to do something else.''
 At Teachers College, so many students like Ms. Pankow are looking for work that two recent job fairs attracted a record 650 students and alumni, up from 450 last year. Last month, the college added a job fair focusing on schools in Harlem.
 But job postings are down by half this year, to one dozen to two dozen a week, mostly in charter schools, said Marianne Tramelli, the college's director of career services. 
 Charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently run, are practically the only ones hiring in New York and elsewhere because of growing enrollments amid expanding political and economic support for school choice. Even so, they do not have nearly enough jobs to go around.
 In New York, where the Success Charter Network is hiring 135 teachers for its seven schools in Harlem and the Bronx, some of the 8,453 applicants have called the office three times a day to check on their status. Veteran teachers have also offered to work as assistant teachers.
 ''It's heartbreaking -- there's much more desperation out there,'' said Eva S. Moskowitz, a former councilwoman who is the network's founder and chief executive. 
 KIPP, another charter school network with 82 schools nationwide, has received 745 applications since January at its seven schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, compared with 385 last year. 
 At the University of Pennsylvania, most of the 90 aspiring teachers who graduated last weekend are jobless. Many had counted on offers from the Philadelphia public schools but had their interviews canceled this month after the district announced a hiring freeze. 
 ''We're trying to encourage everyone to hold on,'' said Kathy Schultz, an education professor at Penn. ''But that's very difficult because students have taken out loans and want to be assured of a job.''
 Michigan State University has pushed its 500 teaching graduates to look out of state. As local jobs have dried up, it started an internship program in Chicago, a four-hour drive from campus. Professors now go with students to the annual campus job fair to make sure they do not hover around the Michigan tables, but walk over to, say, North Carolina, Texas or Virginia.
 ''We have a culture of people wanting to stay here and teach where they went to school, but we also want them to get jobs,'' said Suzanne Wilson, the chairwoman of the department of teacher education. 
 Along with five other former teachers, Jade Stier, 27, finally gave up and enrolled in a nursing program last fall, after three years of looking for an elementary school job. She sent out hundreds of resumes, only to land one interview a year. She settled for working as a substitute teacher, earning $85 a day with no benefits.
 ''Spending $50,000 for an education you can't use is really frustrating,'' Ms. Stier said. ''I definitely miss teaching, but I felt like I had no other choice.''
 If there is an upside to the shortage of teaching jobs, it is that schools now have their pick of candidates.
 Teach for America, which places graduates from some of the nation's top colleges in poor schools, has seen applications increase by nearly a third this year to 46,000 -- for 4,500 slots. From Ivy League colleges alone, there are 1,688 would-be teachers.
 Here in Pelham, a well-regarded district where teaching salaries range from $50,000 to $134,000, high school administrators and teachers have spent recent weeks winnowing applicants' resumes. Candidates with grade point averages below 3.0 were eliminated (3.3 in some departments), as were those who missed the April 30 application deadline. Almost 200 were invited for interviews.
 ''It's very difficult,'' said Jeannine Clark, the high school principal in Pelham. ''More so than in years past because there are so many very qualified candidates.''
 While Ms. Clark and the English supervisor were meeting with prospective teachers last week, candidates for the social studies job were down the hallway typing a 40-minute timed essay on the French Revolution. Upstairs, interviews for physics and biology teachers were being conducted. 
 ''People will come in here begging for anything,'' said Dennis R. Lauro Jr., the superintendent, who started closing his office door this year because out-of-work teachers would drop in unannounced to hand him resumes. ''We've never seen these kinds of numbers before.''
 Top candidates will be asked to return several more times to meet with Dr. Lauro, parents and students and to teach a demonstration class.
 Ms. Pankow is hoping she will be among them. 
 ''It would be unbelievable,'' she said. ''I would love it here, but I'm not necessarily putting all my eggs in this basket.''

HEADLINE: In Arizona's Latest Twist, Voters Follow G.O.P. Governor and Approve Tax Increase

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- It is not every day that a Republican candidate for governor promotes and celebrates a tax increase here in the state many believe helped give rise to the modern conservative movement.
 But there was Gov. Jan Brewer, who is seeking a full term in a crowded, competitive primary, beaming to supporters from a middle school stage Tuesday night. Off to her left, large screens displayed the news that fueled her smile: Arizona voters overwhelmingly supported a one-cent rise in the sales tax to help stave off sharp cuts in education and other services.
 ''Doing the right thing almost always means doing the hard thing, and today, you did the hard thing,'' Ms. Brewer said at the election night rally before a couple of hundred people, some of whom conceded that they held their nose as they voted for it. 
 Arizona joins about half the other states in the nation that, facing plummeting revenue, have raised taxes to soften the blow of deep cuts. At least one other state, Oregon, also successfully placed a general tax increase before voters, who in January approved an additional levy on corporations and the wealthy.
 Most of those levies have been on individual things like cigarettes, candy and soda, though Wyoming approved a $1-per-megawatt-hour excise tax on wind energy producers. Kansas also raised its sales tax by a penny, but through legislation.
 Although there may be signs of recovery in the national economy, it typically takes the states much longer to dust themselves off, particularly those like Arizona, a fast-growing state struck particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis. Unemployment, for instance, depresses state revenue while driving up the need for public services.
 ''The states are the last place where you see the impact of the economic recovery,'' said Susan K. Urahn, managing director of the Pew Center on the States, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. ''This is a recession that has a long tail.''
 Ms. Urahn said the increases are a test that ''show some willingness from the public to pay for certain things.''
 Here, the sales tax increase, a temporary rise to 6.6 cents per dollar for the next three years, is expected to raise nearly $1 billion in the first year, two-thirds of which will go to education. It won approval by 64 percent of voters, though only a third of eligible voters turned out.
 It does nothing to erase cuts already made, including the loss of all-day kindergarten, health care reductions for the poor, and the closing of several state parks and highway rest stops, precipitated by a 30 percent decline in revenue.
 But Ms. Brewer, and a coalition of politically odd bedfellows, including the state teachers' union, business groups and office holders from both major parties, sold it as a necessary evil to avoid teacher layoffs and cuts to public safety.
 The measure's supporters raised more than $2 million, while opponents mustered only $1,215 and ended up billing themselves as grass-roots.
 The governor's proposing and supporting of the tax increase left conservatives, her political base, angry and, in the eyes of analysts, contributed to her decision to sign a tough immigration enforcement bill that has dominated public discourse here for the past month.
 The law, which hands state and local police broad power to enforce immigration law and makes it a state crime for immigrants not to have legal status, is particularly popular with conservatives, who typically vote heavily in primaries.
 ''It has been Brewer's salvation to have this come along,'' said Tom Patterson, chairman of the Goldwater Institute and a former state legislator who opposed the temporary sales tax increase. ''Just when she was foundering over the tax issue she got to sign this bill, and all the credit falls to her and she is up in the polls.''
 Constantin Querard, a veteran Republican political consultant here, agreed that the immigration law helped Ms. Brewer's standing. But he pointed out that she already was improving her lot with conservatives by signing a number of bills to expand gun rights, restrict abortion, support school choice and bar ethnic studies programs in schools.
 ''Even if you are unhappy about the tax, that goes away in three years,'' he said. ''These other things stay.''
 Mr. Patterson said he believed the sales tax victory also bolstered Ms. Brewer's leadership credentials; she has been seen as something of the accidental governor after unexpectedly rising from secretary of state when Janet Napolitano left last year to become the Department of Homeland Security secretary.
 ''The result of the sales tax vote is not a big make or break thing but helps more'' with passage, he said. ''It fills in the puzzle, like she can get things done.''
 Ms. Brewer scoffed at such notions, telling supporters Tuesday, ''This has never been about me, it was always about Arizona.''
 ''This,'' she said, ''is the beginning of Arizona's comeback.''

HEADLINE: Florida Worries About Effect on Tourism

BYLINE: By CATHARINE SKIPP

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Off Florida's Gulf Coast, the seas are calm and the king mackerel are running. Capt. Joe Meadows's telephone should be ringing with bookings for his 42-foot sport-fishing boat for the summer season. Instead, the calls are from reservation holders wondering if they should cancel. 
 In a state already reeling from foreclosures and unemployment, those whose livelihood depends on visitors lathered in sunscreen are trying to persuade tourists scared off by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to reconsider. 
 For now, Florida tourism is living and dying in 72-hour increments. While no oil from the spill -- sheen, slick, blobs or balls -- has washed ashore on Florida beaches yet, the state's Department of Environmental Protection is guaranteeing such conditions for only three days at a time.
 Hotel operators in the Panhandle say they are frustrated by headlines forecasting a ''black tide'' hitting Florida beaches. 
 ''People are acting like there is a huge oil slick that is going to wash in and cover the buildings,'' said Dana Powell, general manager of the Paradise Inn in Pensacola Beach. ''But right now, we don't have any oil and we are still playing.'' 
 Then again, there is cause for concern at her 55-room hotel on a barrier island off the Florida Panhandle. 
 ''We are all terrified because they really don't know how big it is, where it's going to go, how bad it's going to be,'' Ms. Powell said. ''It is a great unknown.''
 Scientists have warned that crude oil leaking from the blown well off the Louisiana coast is drifting toward an area where it could be swept into the Florida Keys and the Atlantic Ocean within the next two weeks. 
 The state's Department of Tourism has tried to alleviate any public concern about the beaches by posting information about Florida's destinations on its Web site in real time with beach Webcams, Twitter feeds and photos. Gov. Charlie Crist said he had secured $25 million from BP, which was leasing the oil well that exploded, to finance the tourism advertising campaign after an initial $25 million went to disaster preparation and response.
 Still, bookings to destinations on Florida's West Coast declined around 15 percent in the three weeks after the spill, compared with the three weeks before the spill, said Katie Deines Fourcin, a spokeswoman for Expedia.com. She said the trend was slightly worse for the Panhandle region.
 Many travelers have already decided to avoid the area for now. 
 Robert Baldari, 60, and his four brothers had chosen Key West for a week of scuba diving and dining for their annual vacation, but they postponed their trip this week. 
 ''We've been following the oil slick,'' Mr. Baldari said. ''But when it started moving, we decided it was too much money to spend if we weren't going diving.'' 
 Under normal circumstances, most hotels in the Panhandle would be fully booked by now for Memorial Day weekend -- the traditional start of the peak summer tourism season. This year, plenty of rooms are still available. 
 ''The pace of new reservations is down 70 percent,'' said Julian MacQueen, chief executive of Innisfree Hotels, which operates four hotels along the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast. 
 The same situation is playing out hundreds of miles away at Florida's southern tip. When asked if new reservations were down at her Key West hotel, Carol Wightman, owner of the Marquesa, laughed and said, ''Have you heard the phone ringing?'' 
 There is disagreement among scientists, government and industry experts about the potential risk of oil pushing onto Florida's coastline. Peter Ortner, director of the Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies at University of Miami, said he would be surprised if a surface spill made it to the Florida Keys, Miami and Fort Lauderdale beaches. 
 ''I'm feeling better and better about it,'' he said. ''It's more than three weeks later, and even the leading edge is now older. Older is better, because the most toxic stuff evaporates off and readily disappears.'' 
 But the spill could still have a substantial effect on fish populations, Dr. Ortner said. 
 ''I am concerned that a lot of species' larvae -- snapper, lobster, blue fin tuna, dolphin, billfish -- are out on the edge of the Gulf Stream and loop,'' he said, referring to the powerful current that carries warm water in a clockwise motion from the Yucatan Peninsula into the northern Gulf of Mexico, then south of the Florida Keys and out into the Atlantic. ''Newborns and larvae are much more sensitive that adults. They are vulnerable.'' 
 Damage to those populations would be more bad news for Captain Meadows and the $5.2 billion sport fishing industry. ''That would wipe out my business for a few years,'' Captain Meadows said.
 There remains one other looming threat: Hurricane season opens June 1.
 ''All bets are off if a hurricane blows across the shelf,'' Dr. Ortner said.

HEADLINE: Use of Firm With Mob Link Shows M.T.A. Problem in Vetting Subcontractors

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
On most weekdays in recent years, giant tractor-trailer and dump trucks loaded with tons of rocks, earth and sludge have been rumbling out of the Sunnyside, Queens, railyards in low gear and turning onto Northern Boulevard.
 The trucks, sometimes 80 to 100 of them a day, have been carting away the dirt and debris spewed out by two enormous tunnel boring machines that have been cutting through bedrock and soil some 12 stories underground. The result, by 2016, will be a new Long Island Rail Road tunnel to Grand Central Terminal. It is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's East Side Access plan, at $7.3 billion one of the biggest public works projects in New York.
 It is lucrative work, especially in an economy where there has been a substantial downturn in construction. But the company doing the hauling, New York Dirt Contracting, a subcontractor that has been paid more than $2 million for its work on the project since 2007, is winding down its operation, though the undertaking is far from completed. 
 That is because the city's Business Integrity Commission has concluded that the company has been too cozy with organized crime figures and revoked its authority to do business in the five boroughs, an action that was endorsed by a State Supreme Court justice last month. 
 The decision was based in part on affidavits and wiretaps that detail a clandestine meeting in a nursing home between company officials and an influential mob figure, who boasted that he had helped them get a contract on another huge public works job in the city and arranged for them to dump debris from it in a Westchester cemetery. The company's owner denied wrongdoing.
 A transportation authority spokesman said that New York Dirt's removal from East Side Access would have no impact on the project and that another company, which he would not name, was expected to begin hauling away the debris next month for the tunneling contractor, a joint venture between Dragados USA and Judlau Contracting.
 But New York Dirt's withdrawal from the huge job underscores what some critics say is the authority's persistent failure, despite its budget problems, to aggressively vet subcontractors in an industry where corruption, fraud and abuse are widespread.
 In recent years, a steady stream of troubled companies have done work for the authority, which oversees the city subways; the commuter rail lines to Long Island, the counties north of the city and Connecticut; and many of the city's bridges and tunnels.
 The authority's inspector general, Barry L. Kluger, has been lobbying to standardize the vetting process for contractors and subcontractors since 2008, when a moving company rejected by one of the authority's constituent agencies because its owner had been convicted of racketeering was hired by another.
 That case, Mr. Kluger said in a report last year, ''brought to light certain systemic inconsistencies among M.T.A. agencies involving the depth of their due diligence reviews.'' And, noting that well over 50 percent of the construction work for the authority was done by subcontractors, he said in an interview on Wednesday, ''More attention must be given to the vetting of subcontractors in terms of both integrity and their performance on prior jobs.''
 The authority defends its procedures for evaluating subcontractors.
 ''Each firm that participates in an M.T.A. Capital Construction project as a subcontractor responds to a series of questions prior to the start of work,'' said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the authority. ''In order to see if there is anything that would lead us to believe a firm is ineligible, M.T.A. Capital Construction staff examine their responses and cross-check them against a number of lists of debarred or otherwise troubled vendors.''
 But M.T.A. Capital Construction, the agency overseeing the East Side Access project, does not require subcontractors to fill out a questionnaire under oath, as the agency's prime contractors are required to do. That is perhaps the most basic tool in vetting companies and ensuring integrity.
 The subcontractor questionnaire is one of a number used by the various entities that make up the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operate under an uneven patchwork of standards and procedures.
 It was the Capital Construction questionnaire that New York Dirt would have been required to fill out before it was awarded its subcontract in 2007, an authority official said. That award came two years after the first newspaper report citing the allegations that the company was involved with organized crime.
 The company and its owner, Edward Raffetto, fought the revocation of their authority to do business in New York City in court, noting that Mr. Raffetto had testified against the organized crime figure with whom he was accused of associating, Gregory DePalma, a Gambino crime family captain. And the prosecutor in that case wrote a letter to city regulators citing that cooperation.
 But the Business Integrity Commission decision, signed by the agency's chairman, Michael J. Mansfield, and the five other members of the panel, dismissed Mr. Raffetto's defense, saying he voluntarily sought out Mr. DePalma, asked him for help with his business and made cash payments to him, knowing of his role in the mob.
 Mr. Raffetto's lawyer, Peter Sullivan, said, ''It's unfortunate that the government elected to de-emphasize history of New York Dirt's assistance in prior matters.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Expanded 1.2% in 1st Quarter

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Japanese economy grew at a healthy clip of 1.2 percent in the first quarter, the government said on Thursday, hinting that Japan's recovery from a crippling recession was finally gathering momentum. 
 Japan's real gross domestic product rose 1.2 percent in the January-March period from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. That is an annualized growth rate of 4.9 percent, according to preliminary figures released by the Cabinet Office. It was the Japanese economy's fourth quarterly gain in a row; it expanded 1 percent in the last three months of 2009. 
 Japan's latest numbers exceeded an annualized 3.2 percent growth rate in the United States economy in the first quarter, though it missed a median forecast of 5.5 percent by 21 economists polled by Bloomberg News.
 Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the economy, grew 0.3 percent in the quarter, while exports rose 6.9 percent. Economic recovery in Japan has been bolstered by a rebound in Tokyo's mainstay exports of cars and electronics, which posted the fourth year-on-year rise in March. The rebound finally appears to be filtering through to domestic production and wages. 
 Exports have been spurred by a rise in demand from China, which has lifted profits at companies like Toyota Motor and Sony.

HEADLINE: Where God and the Devil Once Lived

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
IS nothing sacred? Once, this neo-Gothic landmark in Chelsea was the Church of the Holy Communion, with Gilded Age titans like Cornelius Vanderbilt among its high Episcopal parishioners.
 In the 1970s, its congregation having long moved on to more verdant pastures, the church became a drug rehab center. A decade later, it was Limelight, the nightclub-slash-den of depravity, its strobes and multiple video screens casting an unholy glow on throngs of revelers writhing on the dance floor in a great communal rave.
 Today that fabled nightclub is a mall. 
 The Limelight Marketplace flung open its winglike doors this month to receive the faithful: tourists in scuffed Nikes, teenage boys in hoodies and slouchy jeans, lithe shoppers in pricey tracksuits -- all gathered to gape at the fusion of theme park and treat shop housed beneath its roof. Far above them, where scaffolding once climbed, bathed in an infernal light, the walls are tarted up with white lacquer. And Limelight's former bat-cave interior, once reeking of damp flesh and mildew, has given way to a fragrant retail multiplex scented with lavender candles.
 Entering by a side door, one young woman patently ignorant of the place's tainted past, glanced around bewilderedly. ''I thought that this was a house of God,'' she murmured.
 Well, no, child. But it is a cathedral of sorts, consecrated these days to untrammeled consumption.
 Limelight's soaring nave, lancet windows and whitewashed beams now form the pristine backdrop to a dizzying warren of sweet shops and perfumeries, T-shirt stands and novelty stalls offering winged heart pendants, floppy beach hats, pastel-tinted peignoir sets and tins of Russian caviar.
 The mall was conceived to encourage loitering and, presumably, the savoring of a radically scaled-down Disney experience. And so you find yourself trudging obediently up the narrow stairs (there are no elevators) and past a stained-glass St. Cecilia to pick up a perfumed soap from Caswell-Massey; then wandering down again to the charcuterie to stock up on olive-and-almond jam; then heading up a flight to sample a vial of Nasomatto Hindu Grass at Avery Perfumes.
 This renovation, dreamed up by the developer Jack Menashe, cost $15 million. The project was conceived in the spirit of the meandering, hugely popular Chelsea Market on the western rim of Manhattan. Its treehouse-like leased berths, some measuring no more than 100 square feet, are home to about 60 vendors, their presence lending the new market the sketchily improvised feel of a crafts fair.
 Commanding prime real estate on the ground floor near the entrance is Olatz, an outpost of opulence, the diminutive sibling to Olatz Schnabel's shop of the same name in the West Village. The shop offers coral-bordered bed linens, monogrammed hand towels, Lana Turner negligees and the designer's signature striped cotton pajamas.
 Their price? You had to ask. As with many of the wares at Limelight, it wasn't marked. But a salesclerk offered brightly that the pajamas would set you back a stinging $750.
 Just as strenuously chic is the Hunter Boots shop, the first in Manhattan, with its covetable wellies, rubber clogs and combat boots in caution yellow, silver and sky blue. Less stylishly compelling is Silly Souls at the rear of the arcade, stocked with baby bibs and snap suits emblazoned with slogans like ''Rock Star.'' 
 A lingering recession seems but a distant memory in this marketplace. Deep-pocketed families are welcome, not to say solicited. Even Laddie and Spunker can indulge, at Sophie & Teddy's Doggie Delight, in a packet of Freshbreath treats.
 If a common thread unites the myriad disparate elements gathered under Limelight's eaves, you miss it. The place seems haphazardly vetted. ''Curated''? Forget it.
 ''It's like a boy band,'' said one dazed visitor. ''You know, the kind where a group of gangly teenagers who never met and have nothing in common are forced together by some overbearing producer hell-bent on inventing rock's next big thing.''
 Never mind. Limelight's real draw is meant to be the space itself, which ought to feel expansive. It does not. No amount of fresh white paint can dispel the sensation of being trapped inside a chambered nautilus. Succumbing, apparently, to a fit of claustrophobia, a small boy clutched at his mother's hand as she searched vainly for the exit. ''This is depressing,'' he muttered with a scowl.
 STILL, Limelight offers its distractions, not least among them a makeshift mezzanine-level photo studio where one can document one's 15 minutes ''in the limelight,'' as a hastily mounted placard announced.
 Crazy reality-show-worthy attractions abound; the other day they included the spectacle of Amanda Lepore, encased in pink sequins, tramping up and down the stairs, a camera crew recording every flicker of her strangely immobilized expression.
 The rationale behind such retail madness? Hard to say. ''What is the point of it all?'' a bag-laden shopper was heard to grouse as she staggered toward the main door. Long sigh. ''I guess it's just more shopping.''
 Limelight Marketplace
 656 Avenue of the Americas (20th Street); (212) 359-5600
 AMBIENCE Vertigo-inducing. A hybrid of theme park and mall, it is best navigated with a compass.
 SERVICE Cheerfully accommodating if sometimes sketchy. Price inquiries may be answered in the tentative. Asked the cost of a woven beach bag, a salesclerk ventured, ''I'm feeling like it's $65?''
 PRICES Variable. A diminutive booklight is a wallet-friendly $3.95; an amusing
 silver necklace strung with tiny tools is $45. But there are few bargains.
 HIGHLIGHTS Novelties, kitschy or sublime, include monogrammed tea towels at Olatz; MarieBelle chocolates, their cheery wrappers emblazoned with calendar girls; and the collected sayings of the artist Shepard Fairey, assembled in a handy coffee table tome.

HEADLINE: Diplomatic Storm Brewing Over the Korean Peninsula

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- South Korea's formal accusation that a North Korean torpedo sank one of its warships, killing 46 sailors, will set off a diplomatic drumbeat to punish North Korea, backed by the United States and other nations, which could end up in the United Nations Security Council.
 On Thursday morning in Seoul, the South Korean government presented forensic evidence, including part of a torpedo propeller with what investigators believe is a North Korean serial number. 
 They said it proved that the underwater explosion that shattered the 1,200-ton corvette, the Cheonan, in March near a disputed sea border with the North was caused by the detonation of a torpedo.
 On Monday, South Korea is expected to push for the case to be referred to the United Nations, and the United States plans to back Seoul ''strongly and unequivocally,'' according to Obama administration officials.
 The investigation ''points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that North Korea was responsible for this attack,'' the White House said in a statement after the report was released in Seoul. ''This act of aggression is one more instance of North Korea's unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law.'' 
 The big question, the officials said, is whether China, North Korea's neighbor and a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, will go along with yet another international condemnation of the North. China backed sanctions against North Korea last year after the North tested a nuclear device, but it has reacted with extreme caution since the ship sank on March 26.
 North Korea dismissed the findings as a fabrication and warned that it would wage ''all-out war'' if it were punished, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency reported.
 The sharp escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula complicates a trip to China by a delegation of senior American officials, led by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, to hold a so-called Strategy and Economic Dialogue.
 Nearly 200 American officials will travel to Beijing this weekend to consult with their Chinese counterparts on an array of issues, including sanctions against Iran, China's exchange rate, climate change policy and exchanges between the American and Chinese militaries.
 The American delegation will include officials as diverse as Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and the commander of the United States Pacific Command, Adm. Robert F. Willard.
 The South Korean report, which essentially accuses the North of the worst military provocation on the Korean Peninsula since the end of the Korean War, injects a potentially combustible element into these talks. Among other things, it raises the question of how hard the United States plans to push Beijing to support a new Security Council resolution.
 For weeks after the sinking of the Cheonan, China urged caution in pointing fingers at North Korea, even though the evidence pointed strongly in that direction. On Wednesday, South Korea briefed Chinese diplomats, as well as those of other countries, about its findings.
 ''China has always tried to avoid making choices between North and South Korea, but an incident like this doesn't allow that,'' said Victor Cha, a former Bush administration official, responsible for North Korean policy, who now teaches at Georgetown University. ''They have to choose.''
 For the United States, the calculus is also complicated. The Obama administration just won China's backing for a fourth round of United Nations sanctions against Iran related to its nuclear program. That, some analysts said, was the administration's main strategic priority at this point. 
 Still, the United States has been deeply involved in the South's investigation of the sinking. It sent a team from the Navy's Pacific Command to take part in the search for clues, officials said, headed by an expert in submarine escape and rescue, Rear Adm. Thomas J. Eccles.
 Australia, Canada, Britain and Sweden also took part in the investigation and will endorse its conclusions, officials said. South Korea, the officials said, wanted to have an international team so it would be harder for the North to dismiss the inquiry as politically motivated.
 South Korea is weighing other measures against North Korea, which could include cutting imports of raw materials from the North. Those shipments have already been constricted since the North closed several North-South joint-venture companies north of the border.
 South Korea could also undertake naval exercises in its coastal waters as a form of muscle-flexing, Mr. Cha said, perhaps in cooperation with the United States. 
 But the world's leverage over North Korea is extremely limited, analysts said. The North has little trade with its neighbors, aside from China. It no longer admits United Nations inspectors to visit its nuclear facilities and announced in 2003 that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 On Thursday, Japan said that the report on the sinking would make it harder to resume six-party talks with North Korea over the fate of its nuclear program.
 Add to the uncertainty are the motivations, health and even state of mind of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, remained cloaked in mystery. Mr. Kim recently met in Beijing with President Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and other leaders.
 Kurt M. Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said he discussed Mr. Kim's visit with Chinese officials earlier this week. He predicted that it would be a prime topic for Mrs. Clinton when she meets with Dai Bingguo, a state councilor in charge of foreign affairs.
 ''A central issue of discussion for Secretary Clinton and her Chinese interlocutors, Dai Bingguo and also the Chinese leaders, will be on their assessments of developments in North Korea and their reaction to the report,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Deere Raises Its Outlook After Profit Goes Up 16%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Deere & Company said on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit rose 16 percent as sales of farm and construction equipment improved, and it raised its outlook for the second time this year. 
 The company said it generated $547.5 million in net income, or $1.28 a share, up from $472.3 million a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $7.13 billion, from $6.75 billion in the same period a year earlier. 
 Part of that increase came from price increases and favorable currency exchange rates, but sales of large tractors and combines have improved, and construction equipment sales are starting to rebound from historic lows as the economy recovers, the company said.
 The results topped analysts' expectations for a profit of $1.09 a share on revenue of $6.6 billion.
 The company now expects sales for the year to grow 11 to 13 percent and net income to reach $1.6 billion. Last fall, Deere officials predicted a $900 million profit for fiscal 2010, and in March, the company predicted a $1.3 billion annual profit.
 ''John Deere is exceptionally well positioned to help meet the world's increasing need for farm commodities and other renewable resources as well as for shelter and infrastructure,'' the chief executive, Samuel R. Allen, said.
 Deere is predicting that agriculture equipment sales this year will increase 25 percent in South America because of strength in Brazil and Argentina. Sales in the United States and Canada are expected to grow 5 to 10 percent in 2010.
 The company said those increases would offset weakness in Western Europe, where agriculture equipment sales were expected to fall 10 to 15 percent in 2010.
 Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill., said it expected its sales of construction equipment to rise 30 percent worldwide in 2010.

HEADLINE: New York State Voters Approve 92% of School Budgets

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
New York voters passed 92 percent of the school budgets across the state on Tuesday, stamping out any concerns of a backlash against districts that are seeking to raise property taxes and reduce their staffs and programs next year. 
 In all, voters approved 619 school budgets and rejected 51, according to results reported by the state's Education Department on Wednesday. Many of the defeated budgets appeared to be in districts that had sought large tax increases to help offset reductions in state aid. (The five largest school districts, including New York City's, did not hold budget elections.)
 New York's election results were a striking contrast to last month's vote in New Jersey, where residents rejected a record 58 percent of the school budgets amid anger over escalating taxes and resentment toward teachers' unions for not agreeing to wage freezes or concessions. 
 Timothy G. Kremer, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association, said the high approval rate in New York was an endorsement for districts that had to put together spending plans in a tough climate of expected state aid reductions, school layoffs and program cuts. ''I think that a lot of people came out and said, 'Despite what is happening around us, we are going to support public education,' '' he said.
 Still, the 92 percent approval rate for budgets was a decrease from a record 97 percent last year, when school districts were able to maintain their staffs and programs without large tax increases because of an infusion of nearly $2 billion in federal stimulus money. In districts where budgets failed, school officials now have to decide whether to hold a second budget vote on June 15 or adopt a contingency budget that will hold their spending flat in many areas.
 In Westchester County, the Mount Vernon district, with 8,565 students, saw its proposed $202 million budget -- with a tax rate increase of 8.6 percent -- defeated. It will now adopt a contingency budget of $1 million less, with additional cuts in high school sports and a ban on equipment and furniture purchases. It will also begin charging community groups to use school buildings.
 ''Unfortunately, given the present dire economic times we are in -- coupled with our high percentage of renters and foreclosed homes -- the community could not support this budget,'' said W. L. Sawyer, the superintendent. 
 On Long Island, budgets were defeated in 10 districts, including Garden City, Herricks, Levittown and Wyandanch. In recent weeks, a citizens' group, Long Islanders for Educational Reform, had urged residents to vote against budgets in districts that did not freeze either teachers' salaries or school taxes.
 Fred Gorman, a founder of the group, said the effort had not been more successful because his group had been unable to match the resources of local teachers' unions, many of which put up posters and mobilized parents to support budgets.
 ''We can't be disheartened,'' Mr. Gorman said. ''Unfortunately, we are still the barbarians facing the Romans and they are going to beat us silly until we are as well armed and as effective as they are -- and that's going to take a long time.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Germany's Moves to Restrict Trades

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and DAVID JOLLY; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street declined on Wednesday as a German measure meant to thwart speculators in the European debt markets revived concerns about the debt crisis in Europe.
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished about 67 points lower after earlier falling as much as 186 points, taking much of its direction from the value of the euro.
 Europe's financial troubles have been buffeting equities worldwide for weeks, and on Wednesday overshadowed economic data that showed inflation well under control in the United States and strong earnings reports from discount retailers. 
 The euro fell to a new four-year low in early trading, but rebounded after speculation surfaced of intervention in the currency markets by the Swiss National Bank to shore up the value of the currency. 
 Nicolas Haymoz, a spokesman for the Swiss central bank, declined to comment on currency market developments. The bank has said in the past that it would act to prevent any excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc.
 ''There is a lot of speculation that there is a concerted effort to put a floor into the value of the euro,'' said Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners. But the decline in stocks reflected ''a lack of confidence in the overall plan.''
 He added, ''I think the longer-term view is that the euro goes lower.'' 
 The euro rose to $1.2387 from $1.2176 late Tuesday in New York.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.58 points, or 0.63 percent, to 10,444.37. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 5.75 points, or 0.51 percent, at 1,115.05, and the Nasdaq was down 18.89 points, or 0.82 percent at 2,298.37.
 The euro and stocks worldwide were driven lower by the ban imposed by the German financial regulations agency, BaFin, on naked short-selling in shares of 10 of the country's most important financial institutions. 
 The ban also applies to naked short-selling of euro zone government bonds and the use of uncovered credit-default swaps. The measure, which took effect Wednesday, will last through March 2011. 
 In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and profit from the difference. In a naked short sale, they sell without borrowing the shares first. Such bans were enacted at the height of the crisis in autumn 2008, but analysts said Germany's move suggested that the situation might be getting worse.
 Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said the German ban and the prospect of other hasty financial regulations fed on the market mood. 
 ''And the backdrop is the euro story, which today looks a little better,'' Mr. Behravesh said. 
 He added: ''It is a mixed bag, and the markets are getting a little carried away with pessimism. Day to day it is a little hard to say what piece of news is going to influence market opinion. Today the mood is a little less downbeat. Less piling into gold, and less piling into dollars. It could change tomorrow.''
 In American economic news, the Labor Department said consumer prices fell in April for the first time since early last year, and inflation rose at its slowest rate since the 1960s. 
 The report suggested that the Federal Reserve has leeway to keep its benchmark interest rate low to help stimulate economic growth.
 Two retailers, Target and BJ's Wholesale Club, posted increases in profit and sales in the first quarter.
 The chief executive of Target, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said the results came in a ''stronger-than-expected economic environment.''
 Stock in Target fell 19 cents, to $54.03 a share. Stock in BJ's rose $1.51, to $38.95 a share. Financial stocks were up, while industrial and energy stocks traded lower. 
 Caterpillar shares were down $1.75, to $61.44. Boeing was $1.51 lower, at $66.21. Citigroup was up 8 cents, at $3.81, and Bank of America was up 36 cents, at $16.31.
 Major European stock indexes were all down about 3 percent. 
 Crude oil rose 46 cents, to $69.87 a barrel, and gold fell $31.40, to $1,193.75 an ounce. 
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 6/32, to 101 3/32. The yield rose to 3.37 percent from 3.35 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Waning Star of Air Travel Struggles as a Solo Act

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
FORT WORTH -- Has American Airlines, for decades the industry's leader, been backed into a corner?
 First, Delta Air Lines' merger with Northwest Airlines two years ago knocked American to No. 2. Now, the proposed union between United and Continental Airlines would push American down to third. 
 All this leaves American with some of the industry's highest costs, as well as poor labor relations and a smaller network of routes. Some analysts contend that the airline has few options other than merging with US Airways, which was left out when United decided to go for Continental. Others see American as the ''Ugly Betty'' of the industry, an airline struggling to find a suitable partner.
 ''American has been used to cruising at 55 miles per hour ahead of everyone, but now two competitors that are very well capitalized, with much larger networks, have suddenly passed them over,'' said Hunter K. Keay, an airline analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ''The critical question is whether this is not time for American to speed up.'' 
 American's executives counter that they will not be forced into making a rash move, nor into blindly following the industry's matchmaking trend. Instead, they argue that being a little smaller will allow their airline to be more nimble. 
 ''We are not ceding anything to anyone, but we are trying to build something that we believe will be able to be profitable,'' Gerard J. Arpey, the airline's chairman and chief executive, said in a recent interview at its headquarters in Fort Worth.
 Rather than trying to compete everywhere with everyone, American seeks to focus on five major cities in the United States -- Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. It is more important to be big in cities that account for a significant portion of the nation's air travel, its executives reason, instead of spreading itself too thinly. 
 Overseas, American is betting on its international alliance, Oneworld, to expand its reach in Europe and Asia, because of partnerships with British Airways and Japan Airlines. 
 ''Our strategy is not driven by ranking but by making sure we have a network and a group of partners around the world that will be as strong -- if not as big,'' Mr. Arpey said.
 By most measures, American remains a formidable airline. It flies about 286,000 people each day, employs 87,000 people, and along with its regional carrier, American Eagle, operates around 3,400 daily flights to 250 cities and 40 countries. 
 At its shareholders' meeting on Wednesday, American said it expected that the Oneworld alliance would mean $500 million for AMR, the airline's parent. It also has an impressive history, introducing coast-to-coast jet service in the 1950s, pioneering electronic reservations in the '60s and offering the first major frequent-flier program in the '80s. 
 But the last decade has been brutal for American and the rest of the industry. Airlines suffered from terrorist attacks, global pandemics and recessions that have curtailed air travel. Oil prices soared. For every dollar-a-barrel increase in the price of oil, American's annual fuel costs increased by $70 million. Fares, meanwhile, have been kept in check because of pressure from low-cost competitors. 
 As a result, American was profitable for only three of the last 10 years. It racked up losses of $10 billion over that period. 
 But critics on Wall Street and among the company's unions say they doubt the company can turn its fortunes around. They say American's management is too timid and unwilling to cut unprofitable routes, and it has failed to rein in costs, among the highest in the industry. The United-Continental deal is just the latest blow. 
 Lloyd Hill, the head of American's pilots union, the Allied Pilots Association, said the company suffered from a ''leadership vacuum.'' And in a conference call last month, one Wall Street analyst publicly dressed down the company's executives for a lack of passion. 
 Shares of AMR are down 9 percent this year, the worst performance by a major airline and well below the sector's average gain of 13 percent. By contrast, shares of UAL, United's parent, have gained 46 percent; Delta is up 20 percent in the same period.
 Bob McAdoo, a senior airline analyst at Avondale Partners, said that American lags its peers. ''Everybody else has seen improvements in recent years, and American hasn't really done much of that,'' he said.
 American is one of only three major carriers that have never filed for bankruptcy, along with Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines. As a result, the company is hobbled with much higher costs than its competitors, most of which have used bankruptcy proceedings to rewrite their labor contracts and airplane leases, terminate pensions and health benefits, and restructure their debt. If it had contracts similar to Delta's or Continental's, the company estimates its expenses would be $600 million lower each year. 
 Mr. Arpey defends his record. ''I still believe in principles in a business that will often push you to compromise your principles,'' he said. ''I believe in the long run it will serve our institution and our stakeholders that we honored our commitment to our creditors, funded our pension plans and have done our very best to do everything consensually. But that remains to be seen.''
 The company anticipates that once other airlines start to renegotiate their contracts, labor costs will rise through the industry, narrowing American's cost disadvantage. That, in turn, may put more pressure on rival airlines to increase fares.
 Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant, said American had a strong domestic network and dominant routes to South America. He also praised the company's decision to buy new fuel-efficient planes and ground less efficient ones. 
 ''All the talk where they have to find a domestic partner, and where they have to be the biggest, does not make a lot of sense,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''Remember, the brontosaurus was a really big dinosaur.'' 
 While American has not ruled out a merger, its executives have said on many occasions that they feel no need to consolidate. Instead, the airline is counting on its international alliance with Oneworld to catch up with Delta and United, which have been able to cash in on their competing alliances for years. 
 American's application for antitrust immunity for a joint venture across the Atlantic with British Airways, first submitted 13 years ago, was granted this year by the Transportation Department, and European authorities are also expected to give their green light this year. 
 American hopes to replicate its major cities strategy in the United States by focusing on a handful of major global hubs -- including London and Tokyo. 
 ''If you spread yourself too thinly, you win fewer battles,'' said Dan Garton, American's chief marketing officer. He said that it was more valuable for American to add flights to London and expand its depth of service than to stretch itself to smaller markets like Venice or Kiev. ''We try to fly to markets that have the biggest bang for our bucks,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Is the Fed Missing Early Signs of Recovery?

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
 The rich may be different. But they could also be a leading economic indicator.
 The corridors of wealth and finance are alive with new optimism. The Federal Reserve, though, doesn't seem to share it. The central bank has not indicated any intention of raising interest rates soon. The trouble is, if the Fed is behind the game, there's a good chance everyone will suffer.
 All seems well indeed atop the food chain. Whole Foods, purveyor of richly priced organic onions and other groceries, last week raised its best estimate for same-store sales growth this year to as much as 7 percent from as little as half that. Its shares have gained 45 percent this year, while those of price-conscious Wal-Mart are down a bit. 
 Other anecdotes tell a similar story. The chief executive of one of America's biggest banks contends that the strength of the American economy will surprise everyone. The hedge fund manager John A. Paulson has been busy telling investors he is seeing the upward side of a V-shaped recovery. His investments in banks and other economy-driven stocks back up the view.
 These could be the observations of a cloistered few. And it's true a big bank executive's views are cushioned by the relatively robust health of customers like Mr. Paulson and multinational corporations reporting higher profits and balance sheets bulging with cash.
 Then again, Mr. Paulson's arguments, echoed in big company boardrooms, have evidence. Indicators including California housing prices, American household net worth and bank lending practices back up the idea of a sharp recovery.
 Still, one important indicator has yet to turn convincingly positive -- job growth. It is the one that matters most in Washington and on Main Street. That's still a crucial factor influencing politicians, and, it would seem, the Fed's desire to keep interest rates near zero.
 The Fed's caution may prove well founded. Maybe the rich do live in a bubble. But the risk is they are simply seeing the recovery first.
 If robust growth is just below the surface, a failure to bring interest rates into line early enough could bring about an inflationary cycle. That wouldn't just hurt the rich, but everyone else, too.
 Beyond Short-Selling
 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has vowed that Greece will not be Europe's Lehman Brothers. Yet her country's unnecessary short-sale restrictions are eerily redolent of the paranoid and fruitless campaign that the Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman's chief, waged from his Seventh Avenue aerie before his firm collapsed. Fighting the market the way Mr. Fuld did won't solve Europe's woes.
 The German Ministry of Finance on Tuesday banned naked short-selling of the stock of Germany's 10 largest financial institutions as well as government bonds and sovereign credit-default swaps.
 Rather than reducing volatility, it sent markets into a tizzy. One worry is that Germany's government fears things are about to take a turn for the worse.
 But that's not the only troubling aspect to Mrs. Merkel's move. Graveyards of financial history are cluttered with tombstones of executives who chose to blame speculators rather than address the underlying causes. There is no more salutary example than Mr. Fuld.
 Weeks before Lehman went bust in September 2008, he was telling visitors the firm's true enemies were the short-sellers betting against it. Questions about shrinking Lehman's overextended balance sheet or raising new capital were quickly turned into pugnacious arguments about the need to restrain the shorts.
 True, some investors stood to gain from Lehman's demise. But their arguments, like the one Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn put forth about the realistic value of commercial property on Lehman's books, proved accurate. Mr. Fuld simply tried to shoot the messenger.
 Mrs. Merkel is, of course, in a far different position. Germany isn't the Lehman here: the country's finances are in good shape. And previous restrictions on short-selling in the ostensibly more market-oriented United States and Britain give her some cover.
 Still, the euro zone's problems don't exist only on the trading screens of hedge funds. They rest in the economies of Greece and other nations that have tied their fortunes to the single currency but failed to keep their finances in order.
 Until these are addressed, banning shorts won't help. Market forces will still find a way to issue their harsh judgment. ROB COX

HEADLINE: Sanctions Effort May Open Door to Press Iran Central Bank

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- Buried in the sanctions resolution now being debated in the United Nations Security Council lies the possibility of a new effort to pressure Iran over its nuclear program: a call for countries to ''exercise vigilance'' in dealing with Iran's central bank.
 American and European officials said Wednesday that the reference, passing though it is, could give them a legal basis in the future for choking off finanical transactions between Iran and banking centers in Europe and elsewhere. Previous sanctions have taken aim at specific banks suspected of financing proscribed nuclear activity, but never anything as pivotal as dealings with the central bank itself. 
 What is notably absent from the draft resolution, however, is any binding restriction on transactions with Iran's central bank. Among the many compromises that the United States accepted to get China and Russia to back new sanctions against Iran was an agreement to limitany reference to the bank -- or Iran's entire energy sector, for that matter -- to the introductory paragraphs rather than the sanctions themselves, according toAmerican officials and other diplomats, yielding a weaker resolution than the United States would have liked. 
 The haggling over the central bank illustrates both the opportunities and the frustrations that American and European officials see in the resolution. One the one hand, it provides an opportunity to expand the range of financial activity that the West can try to impede. On the other, it provides a loophole for any nation that wants to continue relations with Iran, allowing it to argue that a cut off is not mandatory. 
 The standoff between Washington and Beijing over what economic measures to include in the final resolution consumed the last 10 days of the negotiations, diplomats said. China expressed concern that if you singled out the central bank for sanctions it would paralyze the entire Iranian economy, they said. 
 Even so, both Obama administration officials and diplomats underscored the mention of the central bank as an important tool to try to limit any trade with Iran that contributes to nuclear proliferation. 
 Security Council diplomats expressed confidence that they had at least 10 votes on the 15-member council, and maybe more depending on how negotiations unroll. Turkey and Brazil, both current members, have said they will not engage in talks on the draft, and Lebanon is also expected to sit out the vote. The position of other members, especially Nigeria and Uganda, remain unclear since they are awaiting instructions from their capitals, diplomats said. 
 Iran reacted with outrage on Wednesday to the proposed new sanctions, particularly since the agreement was announced just a day after the Islamic republic had been trumpeting a compromise agreement on nuclear enrichment for an experimental reactor in Tehran that had been worked out with Brazil and Turkey. 
 Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said ''there was no chance that the resolution would be approved,'' given that Tehran had agreed to ship a chunk of its enriched uranium to Turkey, the Fars news agency reported. He described the countries favoring the draft as a minority, Fars said.
 Mojtaba Samareh-Hashemi, an adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, dismissed the draft as having ''no legitimacy,'' the news agency reported. All of the new sanctions come under the umbrella of limiting activity linked to nuclear proliferation, and Iran maintains its program is strictly peaceful but it is suspected of trying to develop a nuclear bomb. 
 The carefully worded compromise emerged after the United States said it would not support the passage of any resolution that did not at least mention the central bank and Iran's lucrative energy sector, while the Chinese were equally adamant that no economic targets be singled out. 
 In the end, both the energy sector and the central bank were mentioned with somewhat tortured wording in the preamble, with the draft noting the ''potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector'' and possible financing for its nuclear program.
 That is enough to pursue companies dealing with either the banks or the energy sector, American officials said. Whenever the negotiations stalled, Ambassador Susan E. Rice, the American envoy, warned the Chinese that any measures passed by Congress in the absence of a United Nations resolution would likely have much greater consequences for Chinese banks and its trade relations with the United States, one United Nations diplomat said. 
 Russia generally supported the Chinese position, although Moscow focused its attention on the arms embargo. The United States and its European allies in the talks --Britain, France and Germany -- had proposed a total arms embargo, which Russia rejected. 
 The final compromise required a telephone call from President Obama to President Dmitry Medvedev to break the deadlock, one United Nations diplomat said. Russia then accepted the wording in the resolution, which bans the sale of all heavy combat equipment to Iran, namely battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, missiles or missile systems.
 That would seem to include the S-300 surface-to-air missiles that Russia sold to the Islamic Republic in 2005 but has repeatedly delayed delivering. Diplomats were divided on whether the sanctions actually covered the deal, but one noted that it gave Russia a convenient excuse to further delay -- its hands were tied by the Security Council. 
 The White Hosue said Wednesday that President Obama called Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey, in what appeared to be an effort to mollify the Turks after they negotiated a deal with Iran to place about half of the country's uranium stockpile on Turkish territory for a yar, while they awaited fuel for a research reactor used to produce medical isotopes.
 Turkish officials say that together with Brazil, they believed they were coaxing Iran back to the terms of a confidence-building agreement with Iran that fell apart last year. But White House officials were disparaging of the effort, noting that Iran would continue to enrich uranium at high levels, and made no commitment to negotiate over the key demands made by the Security Council over the past four years -- including answering all questions put to Tehran by international nuclear inspectors.Mr. Obama apparently reinforced that point. The Whtie Hosue said that he ''stressed the international community's continuing and fundamental concerns about Iran's overall nuclear program as well as Iran's failure to live up to its international obligations.'' Mr. Obama said he would continue to negotiate over the new round of sanctions against Iran -- a step that clearly surprised and miffed the Turks and the Brazilians, who thought their agreement would short-circuit that effort, at least for now.
 Previous Iran resolutions have taken up to six weeks between the time they were agreed to by the permanent members and then passed by the full council. Among the hardest remaining issues is the list of Iranian companies and individuals to subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. 
 A Western list that runs to some 10 pages has been circulating for months, one diplomat noted. But many of the listings refer to multiple names of a single organization, switching names being a favorite tactic in avoiding sanctions. 
 The Americans seek passage as fast as possible and the European Union hopes the new resolution will be in place before a summit of their leaders in mid-June, which would allow them to discuss broader European sanctions against Iran.

HEADLINE: Inflation Rose in April at Lowest Rate Since the '60s

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Consumer prices fell in April for the first time since early last year, and inflation rose at its slowest rate since the 1960s, a new government report said.
 Consumer prices over all fell in April by 0.1 percent, the Labor Department said in its monthly report on Wednesday. The decline was the first since March 2009. Prices rose by 0.1 percent in March 2010.
 The downturn was led by a decline in energy prices, especially for gasoline and natural gas, the report said. Energy prices fell by 1.4 percent in April, the department said. 
 Food prices rose 0.2 percent, mostly because of higher costs for meat, poultry, fish and eggs. 
 But without the volatile prices for food and energy, the core index for consumer prices remained flat, as they did in March. Over the 12-month period that ended in April, the core index rose 0.9 percent, which economists said was the lowest it has been since the 1960s.
 Other costs that fell in that period included housing, down 0.7 percent, and apparel, down 0.9 percent, the largest decline of all the nonenergy components. 
 ''I think what you are seeing is a continuation of a very soft trend,'' said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Economics. ''And there is no evidence that it is about to turn around any time soon.''
 Altogether, the figures suggested that the government would be under no pressure to raise benchmark interest rates to curb inflation.
 Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said that core inflation pressures remained ''benign'' and would remain so throughout the middle of next year, giving the Federal Reserve leeway to keep rates where they are.
 The Consumer Price Index has increased 2.2 percent in the last year, and some costs have risen. The costs for fuel oil rose 2.3 percent in April. The price of medical care and used vehicles also rose.
 The report suggested that government stimulus efforts had not spurred the undesired effect of inflation. 
 Subdued prices suggest that a more pressing concern could be deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. But whether deflation arises depends on the strength of the economic recovery and whether demand can remain strong even as government stimulus efforts expire.
 ''I don't think it's a major risk,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''I think that if the economy were weaker, then it would be a concern. But I think we have enough demand to keep things on an even keel.''
 Mr. Feroli said that if the economy continued to get closer to deflation, there was the risk that debt service burdens could go up. He said he thought that from the Federal Reserve's perspective, ''the best inflation is between 1.5 and 2 percent, and you are below that and moving further down.''
 ''I think if the economy continues to click along here we should escape any problems from this,'' Mr. Feroli said. ''I think that is the baseline view. Hopefully demand continues to grow and that will keep prices supported.''
 The unfolding of the debt crisis in Greece along with concerns about the economic recovery in Europe contributed to a stronger dollar, and that also exerted deflationary pressure in the United States, according to Gregory Daco, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
 ''This month's low reading of the core inflation index is a clear indication that the Fed should continue to promote a very accommodative monetary policy stance,'' Mr. Daco said in a research note. ''With no signs of inflation on the horizon, the Fed should continue to support the economic recovery by keeping rates exceptionally low for an extended period of time.''

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Ponders A Plan for Asset Sales

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve indicated that it would wait until after it started raising interest rates before selling the huge store of assets that it acquired in response to the financial crisis. The goal would be to gradually complete the sales about five years after they begin. 
 While that strategy is not yet definitive, it is preferred by a majority within the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, according to minutes released Wednesday from the committee's most recent meeting, on April 27 and 28. 
 But the minutes also revealed disagreements over when the sales should begin and how quickly the assets should be sold. 
 According to the minutes, a minority on the committee preferred announcing a schedule for asset sales, without necessarily waiting for the Fed to raise interest rates. A few wanted to start sales ''relatively soon.'' 
 Most committee members seemed to think that the sales should start slowly, but increase gradually to let the markets adjust. But a few thought that the sales could be completed over three years, and that ''a relatively brisk pace of sales'' would reduce the risk of inflation expectations being set off. 
 For now, the committee did not make any decisions, agreeing that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which conducts the Fed's open market operations, should continue its current practice of rolling over Treasury securities as they mature and of allowing the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt to mature and the mortgage bonds to be prepaid over time. 
 If that practice were to continue without any change in policy, it could take decades for the Fed's balance sheet to return to normal. 
 The Fed more than doubled its balance sheet, to about $2.3 trillion, since the start of the crisis. It acquired mortgage-backed securities, debts owed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and longer-term Treasury securities in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates. To buy those assets, it used its power to print money to create a large pool of bank reserves. 
 A foremost monetary policy concern at the Fed has been how to deal with the bloated balance sheet -- and the related question of how to drain reserves so that they are not available for banks to lend too quickly, which would expand the money supply. 
 The Fed has held the benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008, and has repeatedly said that the federal funds rate is expected to stay at that level for ''an extended period.'' Inflation and inflation expectations have been low by historic standards as the United States continues to emerge from recession, with the unemployment rate near 10 percent. 
 The committee revised its quarterly, three-year forecast to reflect a greater degree of optimism about the economy than it had in January.
 The committee expects real gross domestic product to grow 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent this year, up from 2.8 percent to 3.5 percent in January. 
 The group also lowered its projection for its most important measure of inflation -- the price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy -- to 0.9 percent to 1.2 percent for this year, down from 1.1 percent to 1.7 percent in January.
 The lowering of inflation expectations led some economists to predict that the Fed might wait even longer to start raising the benchmark fed funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. 
 ''It is clear that U.S. rates will be on hold at near-zero for some considerable time, perhaps even until 2012,'' said Paul Dales, United States economist for Capital Economics. 
 The minutes did not suggest that the European debt crisis was a source of alarm for the committee members, though their views might have evolved in the three weeks since they met. 
 The minutes found that strengthening economic conditions in Asia had contributed to gains for American exports, but that ''the escalation of fiscal strains in Greece and spreading concerns about other peripheral European countries'' were weighing on financial conditions and confidence in the euro area. 
 ''Some participants expressed concern that a crisis in Greece or in some other peripheral European countries could have an adverse effect on U.S. financial markets, which could also slow the recovery in this country,'' the minutes stated.

HEADLINE: The Limbaugh Victory

BYLINE: By ZEV CHAFETS. 
Zev Chafets is the author of the forthcoming '', Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One.''

 BODY:
THERE are many theories for why very conservative Republicans seem to be doing so well lately, taking their party's Senate nominations in Florida, Kentucky and Utah, and beating Democrats head-to-head in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Virginia. Some attribute this to a generalized anti-incumbent mood. Others say it reflects the tendency of parties in power to falter in midterm elections. Recently it has been fashionable to ascribe right-wing success to the Tea Party movement.
 But the most obvious explanation is the one that's been conspicuously absent from the gusher of analysis. Republican success in 2010 can be boiled down to two words: Rush Limbaugh. 
 Mr. Limbaugh has played an important role in elections going back to 1994, when he commanded the air war in the Republican Congressional victory. This time, however, he is more than simply the mouthpiece of the party. He is the brains and the spirit behind its resurgence.
 How did this happen? The Obama victory in 2008 left Republicans dazed, demoralized and leaderless. Less than six weeks after the inauguration, in a nationally televised keynote address to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Limbaugh stepped into the void with a raucous denunciation of the new president's agenda and a strategic plan based on his belief that real conservatism wins every time. He reiterated his famous call for Mr. Obama to fail and urged the party faithful to ignore the siren song of bipartisanship and moderation and stay true to the principles of Ronald Reagan. 
 Democrats responded by branding Mr. Limbaugh -- whom they considered self-evidently unattractive -- as the leader of the opposition. The day after the conservative conference, Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, went on ''Face the Nation'' and described Mr. Limbaugh as the ''voice and the intellectual force and energy'' of the G.O.P.
 Mr. Limbaugh loved being tossed into this briar patch. He mocked the notion that he was the titular leader of the Republicans even as he was becoming the party's top strategist and de facto boss.
 His strategy was simple. With Democrats controlling Congress, Mr. Limbaugh saw that there was no way to stop the president's agenda. He dismissed the moderates' notion that compromising with the president would make Republicans look good to independents. Instead he decreed that the Republicans must become the party of no, and force Democratic candidates -- especially centrists -- to go into 2010 with sole responsibility for the Obama program and the state of the economy. And that is what has happened. 
 Mr. Limbaugh was not just the architect of this plan, he was (and continues to be) its enforcer. Dissenters like Arlen Specter, whom Mr. Limbaugh disparaged as a ''Republican in Name Only,'' found themselves unelectable in the party primaries. Moderates like Michael Steele, the party chairman, were slapped down for suggesting cooperation with the administration. When Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia had the temerity to suggest that Mr. Limbaugh was too uncompromising, he was met with public outrage and forced into an humiliating apology.
 When the Tea Party movement emerged, Mr. Limbaugh welcomed it. The movement's causes -- fighting against health care reform, reducing the size and cost of government, opposing the Democrats' putative desire to remake America in the image of European social democracies -- were straight Limbaughism. A very high proportion of the Tea Partiers listen to Mr. Limbaugh. Sarah Palin's biggest current applause line -- Republicans are not just the party of no, but the party of hell no -- came courtesy of Mr. Limbaugh. (Ms. Palin gave the keynote address at the first national Tea Party convention.) Glenn Beck, who is especially popular among Tea Partiers, calls Mr. Limbaugh his hero.
 So why the lack of attention? Mr. Limbaugh has studiously refrained from claiming credit for the movement. His only intervention thus far has been to quash talk about the Tea Party becoming a third party. He wants a unified, right-wing G.O.P. in 2010, and by all appearances he is going to get it.
 Rush Limbaugh came along after the age of Ronald Reagan. He has never really had a Republican presidential candidate to his ideological satisfaction. But if the party sweeps this November under the banner of Real Conservatism, Mr. Obama will find himself facing two years of ''no'' in Washington and, very likely, a Limbaugh-approved opponent in 2012.

HEADLINE: Paul's Victory Poses Test for Tea Party on Defining Principles Beyond Protest

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. -- Rand Paul's win in the Republican Senate primary here is the first authentic Tea Party victory -- a candidate from the movement, powered by it.
 But Mr. Paul's campaign from now to November will present the young movement its toughest test yet -- as voters focus on what the Tea Party is for, rather than what it is against. 
 Voters will have to decide whether they will embrace what Mr. Paul acknowledges are ''tough choices'' -- like his proposals to raise the age of Social Security eligibility, to slash spending deeply enough to balance the budget every year even while cutting taxes and relying more on charity to provide the social services that the government has since the New Deal.
 So far, the Tea Party's victories have come largely as the result of voter protests. In Utah, Tea Party supporters helped vote out Senator Robert F. Bennett because they opposed his support of the bank bailout. They helped elect Senator Scott Brown in Massachusetts to stop the health care bill. And while Tea Party backers helped Marco Rubio drive Gov. Charlie Crist from the Republican Senate primary in Florida, Mr. Rubio is not from the movement. 
 In contrast, Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist, was an early adherent of the Tea Party -- if they issued cards, he said in an interview last month, ''I'd be a card carrying member.'' 
 And his campaign is a microcosm of the unlikely, and sometimes contradictory, mashup that created the Tea Party movement, one that brings together idealistic and largely young supporters who espouse the small-government ideas of the Austrian economic school and public choice theory, with largely older voters who fervently want change in Washington but who also think big government programs like Social Security and Medicare are worth the costs. 
 Democrats have already begun shifting the debate to what Mr. Paul and Tea Party ideology say about the role of government.
 Groups like FreedomWorks, which has helped mobilize the Tea Party movement, and supporters who came to the party through the quixotic presidential campaign of Mr. Paul's father, Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, embrace arguments that government should not provide what individuals can provide for themselves. So, police and public safety are acceptable functions of government, but government should not take from one person's income to provide for another's health or well-being. 
 ''Capitalism is freedom, it means the freedom to voluntarily exchange goods, and retain the fruits of your labor,'' Mr. Paul told supporters in Bowling Green on Tuesday night.
 Likewise, when Mr. Paul and Tea Party supporters define ''constitutionally limited government'' they argue that much of the New Deal, as well as social programs like Medicare that were enacted later, were a gross violation of the founding document.
 Those ideas may be hard to sell in a general election, even to Republicans here. 
 Kentucky has two Republican senators now, the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Jim Bunning, whom Mr. Paul is seeking to succeed.
 But Stephen Voss, a political scientist at the University of Kentucky, said Republican voters here tend to be social conservatives, with a long populist streak.
 ''Paul's constitutional Republicanism is not bring-home-the-bacon McConnell-style Republicanism,'' he said. ''There's a lot of people who return McConnell to office when he runs because they think the state needs that money. Paul can't appeal to those people very easily.''
 To win in November, Mr. Paul will also have to win over Democrats, who could not vote in the Republican primary but make up the bulk of Kentucky voters. 
 Democrats are trying to portray Republicans who win with Tea Party support as being out of the mainstream.
 They wasted little time in calling Mr. Paul an ''extreme candidate,'' as Tim Kaine, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released a Web advertisement highlighting Mr. Paul's statements that he would eliminate the Department of Education, cut taxes on corporations and capital gains and raise the retirement age, even as he has said that he does not want to cut payments to doctors like himself who take Medicare patients. 
 ''While Kentucky struggles with a still recovering economy and with high unemployment throughout the state,'' the committee said in a statement, ''Rand Paul's policies are more about helping himself than helping Kentuckians.''
 Voting in the Republican primary in Mr. Paul's precinct here, Martha McKenzie, 84, said Mr. Paul was too idealistic. ''He says things, and I wish they could be that way, but I know they're not,'' she said. ''I don't mind paying taxes. Not when it's to help people. We didn't get this way in a few years, we're not going to get out of it in a few years. You can't cut things all of a sudden, not without hurting people.''
 Her niece Donna Wolbe, 57, said she worries about what she called Mr. Paul's ''my-way-or-the-highway'' politics. ''You want to feel like the person you're voting for is going to be effective,'' she said. ''You're not effective if you alienate people.''
 Even many people who support the Tea Party say the benefits of government programs like Medicare and Social Security are worth the cost to taxpayers; in a New York Times/CBS News poll last month, about 6 in 10 people who identified themselves as supportive of the movement said so, and 72 percent of those 65 and older did. 
 Mr. Paul is honest with his supporters about how difficult it will be to balance the budget in practice. 
 ''In order to preserve our great nation, tough choices will have to occur,'' he told supporters here on Tuesday night. ''So many Republicans have been elected. and they say, 'We'll cut your taxes, but then we'll bring you home the pork.' It's coming to an end because we can't manage this debt.''
 The television cameras focused on the message he said he brought from the Tea Party: ''We have come to take our government back.'' 
 But many of the cameras were gone as he argued against government regulation of banks. ''When we had a crisis and things were teetering in the balance, people blamed capitalism, wrongly so,'' he said. ''It's the government that needs to be regulated. It's the Federal Reserve that needs to be restrained.''
 Mr. Paul's campaign manager, David Adams, who was the M.C. of what is known as the first Kentucky Tea Party in March, called the victory ''a good day for the Tea Party,'' but acknowledged the work ahead.
 ''The budget is out of whack; the debt is large and growing,'' Mr. Adams said. ''The reason for this excitement is to build up a head of steam so we can fix the problems. It will be difficult. The only thing we've proven today is that we have the ability to do it.''
 The campaign will have until November to prove that other people agree.

HEADLINE: Vote Keeps Reform Bill In Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Wednesday rejected an effort by Democratic leaders to complete work on a sweeping financial regulatory bill as two key Democratic holdouts said it still did not tighten rules on Wall Street enough. 
 The holdouts -- Senators Maria Cantwell of Washington and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin -- joined with 39 Republicans to block an effort by the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, to wrap up debate on the bill. The measure would enact the most far-reaching overhaul of the financial regulatory system since the aftermath of the Great Depression. 
 Two Republicans, Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, voted with Democrats in favor of ending debate. And Senator Arlen Specter, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who lost his primary race on Tuesday, was not in Washington on Wednesday, denying Democrats a critical vote. 
 In that sense, Mr. Reid demonstrated to Republicans that he would have the 60 votes needed to advance the bill once he addresses the concerns of Ms. Cantwell and Mr. Feingold and Mr. Specter returns to Washington.
 The vote was 57 to 42, with Mr. Reid switching to ''no'' at the last minute in a procedural maneuver that allows him to call for a new vote at any point. 
 Ms. Cantwell, in a floor speech after the vote, said she was mainly fighting for a vote on an amendment to tighten proposed rules for the trading of derivatives, the complex instruments that were at the center of the economic crisis. 
 Her proposal would make it illegal to enter into a derivatives contract that had not been cleared through an exchange, other than contracts specifically exempt from the law. It would also empower regulators and investors to stop or undo a derivatives deal if banks knowingly violated the trading requirements. 
 Without her amendment, Ms. Cantwell said the legislation would be left with a dangerous loophole. ''Even something like Hoover Dam with all of the great concrete and all of the great engineering and all the great things that make that structure work, still has a problem if somebody drills a hole in the bottom of it,'' Ms. Cantwell said in her speech. 
 ''If you don't have a regime of exchange trading and clearing you will have money seeping into the continuation of a dark market,'' she added. 
 Ms. Cantwell said she would also like a vote on another amendment she proposed, with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that would restore the Glass-Steagall Act, which maintained a firewall between commercial banking and investment banking from the 1930s until it was repealed by Congress in 1999. In a statement, Mr. Feingold said he favored restoring that firewall.
 ''After 30 years of giving in to the wishes of Wall Street lobbyists, Congress needs to finally enact tough reforms to prevent Wall Street from driving our economy into the ditch again,'' Mr. Feingold said. ''We need to eliminate the risk posed to our economy by 'too big to fail' financial firms and to reinstate the protective firewalls between Main Street banks and Wall Street firms. Unfortunately, these key reforms are not included in the bill.''
 Proponents of the legislation say it includes adequate safeguards that are more appropriate for the modern banking and financial industry than the old Glass-Steagall approach.
 At a news conference after the vote, Mr. Reid criticized Republicans for standing in the way of tougher regulation of Wall Street. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the bill's main author, joined in blaming Republicans, saying they were obstructing the legislation even after having a strong role in drafting it and winning adoption of a number of amendments. 
 ''Unfortunately our Republican friends took a walk on this, even on their own propositions,'' Mr. Dodd said. 
 To underscore the Democrats' point that Republicans were the ones blocking the bill, Mr. Dodd returned to the Senate floor asked for unanimous consent of the Senate to allow a vote on Ms. Cantwell's derivatives amendment. Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, objected. 
 Democrats also said that Senator Scott Brown, the freshman Republican of Massachusetts, had broken a promise to vote in favor of ending debate. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Brown said that he voted against ending debate because the bill still needed to be improved. 
 But the disagreement that mattered on Wednesday was among Democrats, and the failed effort to close debate was a jarring setback for Mr. Reid. He proved unable to address the concerns of all of his caucus members, including some with serious policy concerns about the legislation -- even as he insisted that it was time to get to a final vote.
 Senate Democrats had emerged from a special caucus meeting on Wednesday afternoon tense and clearly divided.
 Mr. Reid had planned to hold a vote to wrap up debate at 2 p.m., but it was postponed and the caucus meeting quickly convened after it was clear that Mr. Reid did not have the needed 60 votes.
 Exiting the meeting, Ms. Cantwell tersely announced that she would oppose ending the debate. After doing so, she sat stone-faced at her desk in the chamber, rejecting entreaties to change her mind. 
 Republicans leaders are in no particular hurry to end debate on the bill, which they have criticized harshly this week. The Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has said he expects debate to continue until next week, and given the high-stakes election year he has little reason to let Democrats move on to the next items on their agenda. 
 In a floor speech , Mr. McConnell denounced the bill, saying ''it uses this crisis as yet another opportunity to expand the cost and size and reach of government.''
 Later on Wednesday, the Senate, by a vote of 60 to 35, rejected an amendment by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, that would have required credit card companies to comply with limits on interest rates in the states where their cardholders reside. Under current law, companies must only abide by the limits in the state where the company is located.

HEADLINE: White House Now Embraces Upstart Who Ousted Specter

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
This article is by Katharine Q. Seelye, Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny.
 Shortly after Representative Joe Sestak won an improbable victory Tuesday over Senator Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania's Democratic Senate primary, President Obama called Mr. Sestak to congratulate him. The president pledged his full support, aides said later, and offered to campaign for him in the fall -- if Mr. Sestak believes it will help.
 Nothing makes friends like winning. It was not long ago, Mr. Sestak said Wednesday in an interview, that White House officials were so eager to muscle him from the race that they offered him a job if he would drop out. 
 Mr. Sestak remains mum on the details, except to say that it was a high-ranking post -- secretary of the Navy has been mentioned as a possibility -- and that it happened last summer. The White House, which had backed Mr. Specter, has denied the assertion. 
 What is clear is that Mr. Sestak, 58, a former Navy admiral with a reputation as a hard-charging and demanding taskmaster, has no hesitation about defying the White House or other powerful interests.
 His seemingly quixotic yearlong quest to win the Democratic Senate nomination pitted Mr. Sestak against an array of Democratic power brokers, from the White House to the governor to organized labor to the party apparatus to Democratic donors.
 ''You have the whole world telling him he's crazy to do this,'' said Neil Oxman, a founder of the Campaign Group, the media firm in Philadelphia that made Mr. Sestak's much-heralded television commercials. ''It's pretty remarkable when you can stand up against those odds and take on the longest-serving senator in Pennsylvania history.''
 Now Mr. Sestak -- despite an initially rambling and occasionally bewildering speaking style -- appears to be one of the Democrats' best hopes for keeping control of the Senate. How a relatively obscure member of Congress, with a consistently liberal voting record, made it this far says a great deal about who he is.
 Mr. Sestak was born in Delaware County, the suburban Philadelphia area he represents now in Congress, and grew up as one of eight children in a closely knit Catholic family.
 His mother, Kathleen, who has retired as a high school math teacher, worked on his campaign. His father, Joseph Sestak Sr., who died last year, had emigrated from Czechoslovakia in the 1920s and was a particular inspiration. The son, who was valedictorian of his high school class, followed in his father's footsteps to the Naval Academy. He graduated in 1974, second in his class.
 He went on to earn his Ph.D. in political economy from Harvard in 1984 and rose in the Navy to become a three-star admiral and the highest-ranking military officer ever elected to Congress.
 Mr. Sestak demonstrated his perseverance when he met his future wife on a trip to the Soviet Union in 1990.
 ''We knew each other for two days, and he asked me to marry him and I said no,'' Susan Clark-Sestak, 50, an environmental analyst at a national security research group, said Wednesday. ''He said, 'I've never felt like this before, but I know it's right.' '' They married eight years later.
 During his Navy career, he commanded the George Washington aircraft carrier battle group during combat operations in Afghanistan. He also served in administrative roles, as a defense adviser for the National Security Council during President Bill Clinton's administration and as a senior official in Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's Pentagon during George W. Bush's administration.
 Mr. Sestak's superior, Adm. Vernon E. Clark, had assigned him to find ways to make the Navy meaner and leaner for the 21st century, a project that fell squarely into line with Mr. Rumsfeld's early attempts to ''transform'' the armed forces for what he called ''the threats and challenges of this new century.''
 The task took on added importance after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Mr. Sestak was assigned as director of Deep Blue, the Navy program tasked with devising new strategies to combat terrorism in the post-9/11 era.
 In an interview, Admiral Clark said he regularly encouraged Mr. Sestak to produce proposals that went against the grain of formal plans submitted by other officers -- and, as often as not, he said, ''he did.'' 
 Mr. Sestak developed a reputation, which still stands, for work night and day.
 ''He's a hard worker and expects the same of his staff,'' said Adm. Edmund P. Giambastiani Jr., a superior who oversaw some of his work analyzing fleet strategies, and who went on to be a vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2005 to 2007. ''He was very capable. He put together an incredibly capable staff.''
 But in interviews, current and former Pentagon officials and associates also said his staff frequently complained of a punishing work load that at times bordered on unreasonable -- a complaint that followed him to Congress. Mr. Sestak dismissed such complaints as often anonymous carping.
 When Admiral Clark was succeeded as chief of naval operations by Adm. Mike Mullen -- now chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff -- Mr. Sestak's naval career hit a wall.
 Mr. Mullen reassigned him almost immediately upon taking Mr. Clark's post, and a report in The Navy Times at the time paraphrased an anonymous source as saying that the change was being made because of a ''poor command climate'' in his division.
 Admiral Clark, in an interview on Wednesday, took responsibility. ''I put him in that environment where he was in a position to create enemies,'' he said, adding, ''I should have given him better top cover.''
 Mr. Sestak said Wednesday that it was only natural that Mr. Mullen would want a new team for his new command. Sestak aides said that he was ready to resign to help care for his daughter, Alex, who had brain cancer. 
 Regardless, the ''poor command climate'' line made its way into an advertisement of Mr. Specter's. But it did not appear to gain much traction; Mr. Sestak countered with a rally at which fellow veterans accused Mr. Specter of Swift Boat tactics and being disrespectful to those who served.
 Mr. Sestak's Republican opponent in November, former Representative Pat Toomey, said he did not foresee making a similar issue of his service. ''I'm much more interested in focusing on our policy differences,'' Mr. Toomey said. ''Joe and I have very, very different views on what the federal government ought to be doing and how.''
 Mr. Sestak entered politics in 2006, when he challenged Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican who was first elected in 1986. Mr. Sestak beat him and then handily dispatched a Republican challenger in 2008.
 He was mulling a run for the Senate when Mr. Specter dropped a political bombshell. On April 28, 2009, he announced he was switching to the Democratic Party because he could not win re-election in a Republican primary. The move would give the Democrats a 60th vote in Congress, and President Obama agreed to endorse Mr. Specter and welcomed him in a ceremony at the White House.
 ''We are thrilled to have you,'' Mr. Obama told Mr. Specter during a private telephone conversation, aides to both men said at the time. And the president promised to campaign for him.
 Initially, few party strategists paid attention to Mr. Sestak's shoestring campaign. His brother and sister helped him with logistics, and even as he declared victory on Tuesday, he still had no campaign manager and was calling most of the shots himself.
 One powerful ally for Mr. Sestak was Mr. Clinton, his former boss. Last spring, Mr. Sestak was visiting his house in Washington to ask his advice about running for the Senate; it turned out to be the day Mr. Specter announced he was switching parties.
 Mr. Specter, 80, took the classic approach in his campaign. He tried to define Mr. Sestak early, chastising him for missing votes in Congress and raising questions about his Navy record.
 Mr. Sestak was making little headway, but he was an energetic and indefatigable campaigner. He routinely drove the six-hour trip from one end of the state and back again in a 24-hour turnaround just to keep himself in the state's two major media markets.
 ''We were trying to squeeze every minute we could out of a workday,'' Mr. Sestak said. ''We would leave Philadelphia at 10 p.m., get to Pittsburgh at 3 or 4 in the morning, grab sleep for two hours, have our first meeting at 7:30 in the morning, then go all the way back to Philadelphia.''
 He had told Mr. Oxman that he had just $4 million to spend on television commercials, and they decided to spend $1 million a week for the last four weeks of the campaign. Mr. Oxman said that the first commercial, a 60-second biographical spot introducing Mr. Sestak, started to close the gap in the polls.
 ''That ad said there's a real alternative to Arlen Specter and he's not a kook,'' Mr. Oxman said. 
 Then, 12 days before the election, they started running a commercial linking Mr. Specter to former President Bush, and replaying Mr. Specter's admission that he changed parties so he could get re-elected. Gov. Edward G. Rendell, who backed Mr. Specter, said the commercial was ''brilliant and devastating.''
 In addition, Mr. Sestak hammered a consistent message throughout the campaign: that Mr. Specter's party switch showed him to be an opportunist.
 By the last week of the campaign, the landscape had shifted drastically from a year before, when the White House had first embraced Mr. Specter. The race was dead even, and Mr. Sestak had the momentum.
 Mr. Specter requested a last-minute presidential visit -- a trip that would have filled local television with images of Air Force One flying into Pennsylvania with Mr. Obama standing at Mr. Specter's side -- but strategists said that every analysis of the race suggested it was futile.
 At the same time, the White House came to see Mr. Sestak as a more disciplined candidate -- resolving one of the early questions about him -- and decided he would be stronger in November against Mr. Toomey in a year of deep incumbent resentment.
 ''There were a lot of Democrats who had a hard time getting their arms around Specter as the Democratic nominee, since they had voted against him for three decades,'' David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Obama, said in an interview Wednesday.
 Mr. Obama still taped a radio advertisement and appeared in a much-seen commercial with Mr. Specter. But at the end of the campaign, he stayed away.
 ''It's a tough time to be a long-term incumbent of either party, and switching parties exacerbated that,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
 ''It was a hard case to make.''

HEADLINE: Profits Rise For Target And BJ's

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Two discount retailers posted higher quarterly profits and sales on Wednesday, providing more evidence that consumers were increasing spending. 
 The Target Corporation's net income climbed almost 29 percent in the first quarter, helped by an improvement in its credit card business and higher sales of more profitable items. 
 BJ's Wholesale Club said its profit rose 7 percent.
 The chief executive of Target, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said Wednesday that the results came in a ''stronger-than-expected economic environment.''
 The company, based in Minneapolis, said it had net income of $671 million, or 90 cents a share, up from $522 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended May 1, rose 5 percent, to $15.59 billion from $14.83 billion.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 86 cents on sales of $15.58 billion.
 Target's revenue at stores open at least a year rose 2.8 percent for the period. The measure is a crucial indicator of a retailer's health because it excludes the effect of expansion.
 That offered a contrast to Wal-Mart Stores, which reported on Tuesday that its same-store sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.
 To turn around sales after the downturn, Target has emphasized its low prices in advertising and expanded its food offerings. 
 BJ's Wholesale Club said its first-quarter income rose 7 percent, partly helped by gasoline sales. Its shares rose 4 percent to end at $38.95.
 BJ's, which operates warehouse stores, also lifted its full-year earnings forecast.
 BJ's net income rose to $26.1 million, or 49 cents a share, for the three months ended May 1. That compares with a profit of $24.3 million, or 45 cents a share, reported a year earlier. The performance topped the 43 cents forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
 Revenue rose 13 percent, to $2.61 billion, from $2.31 billion. 
 Revenue at warehouse clubs open at least a year climbed 7.8 percent including gasoline sales.

HEADLINE: Voter Insurrection Turns Mainstream, Creating New Laws of Politics

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
Americans have been cursing their incumbents -- and periodically rising up to eject them from office -- since angry Bostonians took a bucket of tar and some feathers to their customs commissioner in 1774. Such uprisings have become an almost cyclical occurrence in Washington, and after this week's primaries in Arkansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, 2010 seems destined to be one of those years. 
 Word has reached Washington that an anti-incumbent tsunami is roaring its way, and frightened politicians are already trying, sometimes comically, to put some distance between themselves and the tide. ''My gosh, these people in Washington are running the country right into the ground,'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented this week, despite having lived and worked there for the last 34 years. 
 But to suggest that this week's primaries are just part of the latest revolt against incumbency, brought on by pervasive economic angst, is to miss some deeper trends in the electorate that are more consequential -- trends that have brought us to an unprecedented disconnect between, on one side, the traditional shapers of our politics in Washington and, on the other, the voters who actually make the choices. 
 The old laws of politics have been losing their relevance as attitudes and technology evolve, creating a kind of endemic instability that probably is not going away just because housing prices rebound. Nor is that instability any longer driven only by ideological mini-movements like MoveOn.org or the tea parties, as some commentators suggest. Voter insurrection has gone as mainstream as Miley Cyrus, and to the extent that the parties in Washington take comfort in the false notion that all this chaos is fleeting, they will fail to internalize the more enduring lessons of Tuesday's elections.
 The first is that this age-old idea of ''clearing the field'' for a preferred candidate, so as to avoid divisive primaries, is now, much like the old party clubhouse, a historical relic. This should have been clear to everyone after 2008, when Barack Obama, shunned by most of his party's major contributors and its Washington establishment, simply shrugged off endorsements and raised more than half a billion dollars from his own constituencies. 
 Now the Obama effect has trickled down to the likes of Rand Paul, who beat his party's preferred Senate candidate in Kentucky, and Joe Sestak, who toppled the new-and-improved Senator Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania. (It makes you wonder whether Mr. Obama and his aides really thought they could ''clear the field'' for Mr. Specter, as they suggested, or whether they knew from their own experience how wishful that was and were just bent on to luring him across the aisle.) 
 A new generation of politicians has been raised with more consumer choice and less loyalty to institutions, and they are no more likely to take their orders from, say, party leaders like Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, than they are to drive a Malibu just because some car magazine tells them to. Nor, thanks to the Web, are they reliant any longer on the party structure to raise the necessary cash.
 A second, related lesson is that less affinity for parties makes incumbent politicians less safe, generally. That's because when fewer people bother to engage in party politics, it takes a smaller group of ultra-motivated activists to overturn the traditional order of things. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman found this out in 2006, when an unknown but jaunty cable executive named Ned Lamont -- and a capable army of bloggers and antiwar crusaders -- drummed him out of the Democratic Party in Connecticut. (Mr. Lieberman won re-election that November as an independent.) Mr. Lamont, who is now running for governor, was the prototype for Mr. Paul and Mr. Sestak and scores of other primary candidates this year.
 A final truism to emerge from Tuesday's primaries is that the politics of issues, the stuff of which parties have most often crafted their core identities, has now been largely displaced by a politics of personal conviction. In other words, Tuesday's results were less about the ideological purging of either party than they were about a rejection of the culture of both, a sense that Washington acts from expedience and little else. 
 So while Mr. Specter may have thought he was being transparent by announcing to the world that he was switching parties in hopes of continuing to pursue his life's work, what a lot of voters probably heard is that his beliefs were fungible in the service of his own ambition -- a vulnerability that Mr. Sestak exploited with one of the most eviscerating advertisements in recent history. (''My change in party will enable me to be re-elected,'' Mr. Specter said in a clip shown several times in the ad.) 
 Similarly, the sober-minded Senator Blanche Lincoln, running for re-election to the Senate in Arkansas, may not have helped herself much in the closing weeks of her primary, when, under assault from unions over her centrist record, she took an uncharacteristically populist stand against Wall Street in the debate over regulating the financial industry. The move appeared calculated for political gain, which, after all, is the very impression of Washington that may be fueling much of the resentment to begin with.
 What all this probably means is that we are living in the era of the upstart. Thirty years ago, when you needed a party infrastructure to make a serious run for higher office, taking it to the establishment was quixotic venture undertaken on the national level, where a Jesse Jackson or a Pat Buchanan could at least make a powerful statement along the road to obliteration. (Recall Jimmy Carter's indictment of Jerry Brown in 1976: ''Don't send them a message, send them a president.'') 
 Those days are gone. The intraparty rebellions now will be increasingly local, sufficiently financed and built around credible candidates -- the kind of campaigns that made Barack Obama president and that may yet give us Senator Paul or Senator Sestak. My gosh, these people in Washington are in for it now.

HEADLINE: House Victory Lifts Democrats' Hopes for Fall

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats on Wednesday seized on their special election victory in a Pennsylvania House district and other primary results as evidence that they can stem Republican political momentum, as both parties sifted through Tuesday night's returns for lessons to learn and mistakes to avoid heading to November.
 After hearing for months that they were on the verge of losing control of the House, Democrats said the decisive victory by Mark Critz, a Democrat, in the blue-collar district formerly represented by the late John P. Murtha, showed they remain competitive in the kinds of hotly contested regions Republicans need to win to have a real chance of capturing the House. 
 ''We are going to maintain our majority,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, said. ''Obviously the president's party historically loses seats, but we are going to lose a lot fewer than people think.''
 Chastened Republicans conceded that they had made some missteps in the race and said they would make course corrections as they tried to capture Democratic swing districts, many of which have close parallels to the one retained by Democrats on Tuesday. 
 ''We have got a lot of work to do,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader. ''I still think the environment is there. There were just some things that we should have seen that we didn't see. But we will learn from it.''
 As Republicans regrouped, they still had some fundamental forces working in their favor, including a stubbornly high unemployment rate, growing distrust of government and the tendency of the party that controls the White House to lose Congressional seats in midterm elections.
 Mr. Obama has been losing support among independents and is struggling to convince voters that the benefits of his signature legislative achievements -- the health care overhaul and the economic stimulus bill -- will outweigh the costs and drawbacks. 
 Democrats say that in the Pennsylvania race, they were successful in pushing the party message that the economy is improving and that jobs are returning because of steps taken by the Democratic-controlled Congress and Mr. Obama. They say Republicans were unable to define the race around the national issues they hope will carry them in the fall, despite an effort to tie Mr. Critz to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Obama and the Democratic health care legislation. 
 Senator John Kerry carried the Murtha district in 2004 as the Democratic presidential nominee, but Senator John McCain won it for the Republicans in his presidential campaign four years later. This makes the district a good laboratory for both parties to hone their messages.
 ''Republicans test-drove their November strategy in Pennsylvania and it crashed,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said.
 As they assessed the outcome in the House contest, as well as in Senate races in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Arkansas, members of both parties acknowledged that they faced an angry electorate willing to take out its wrath on either party. 
 But each party's officials argued that it would be their rivals who would bear the brunt of it. Democrats said Republicans were nominating overly conservative candidates who could be beaten in November. Republicans said Democrats would pay for failing to heed voter concerns and for pushing through expansive and expensive legislation over public objections.
 ''From my perspective, I think what people want is checks and balances instead of single-party government,'' Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said. ''I think that bodes well for our chances to pick up some seats.''
 One of Tuesday's primaries was left unresolved. Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, is headed for a June 8 runoff with a fellow Democrat, Bill Halter. The winner will face Representative John Boozman, who won the Republican nomination outright. Mr. Boozman may have an advantage over the eventual Democratic winner, who will have to spend money and time competing in the run-off.
 Democrats said they believed the Republican victory in Kentucky of Rand Paul, a Tea Party favorite, had given them an opening to pick up a Republican-held Senate seat. They said Mr. Paul would face a strong challenge from Jack Conway, a Democrat who is the state's attorney general, as well as a concerted effort by Democrats to define him as outside the mainstream. Democrats also pointed to the fact that Kentuckians voted in greater numbers in the Democratic primary than in the Republican contest.
 ''Paul is on record as taking some very, very extreme positions,'' Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, said.
 Republicans said such attacks would fail.
 ''I have no doubt the Democratic National Committee and others will try to demonize Republican candidates as they try to demonize Tea Party participants,'' Mr. Cornyn said. ''Rand Paul was rewarded for running a very good campaign, very disciplined, and he obviously represents the views of about 60 percent of the primary voters in Kentucky. I think he is going to win.''
 Republicans acknowledged that the election in Pennsylvania of Mr. Critz, who was to be sworn as the newest member of the House on Thursday, was certain to put a damper on the party's exuberant talk of wrenching the House from Democratic control come November.
 ''I do think we will reclaim the majority,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican. ''But last night is evidence of the fact that we have a lot of work to do, and we can't get ahead of ourselves.''
 Party strategists attributed the loss by Tim Burns, the Republican candidate, to high Democratic turnout caused by the intense Senate primary between Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Joe Sestak.
 They say they may have also underestimated the extent to which Mr. Critz's embrace of conservative positions on gun control, abortion and climate change legislation would insulate him with voters who might otherwise be fed up with Mr. Obama and Washington Democrats.
 Still, Republicans acknowledge that the party is going to have to raise its game if it is to have a real chance to take back the House against a Democratic organization that is evidently not going to make it easy for them.

HEADLINE: South Korea Publicly Blames the North for Ship's Sinking

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea formally accused North Korea on Thursday of responsibility for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, killing 46 sailors, in one of the deadliest provocations since the two countries ended the Korean War in a truce in 1953.
 In an uncharacteristicallyswift reaction, North Korea called the South Korean conclusion a ''fabrication'' and threatened to respond to sanctions with ''strong measures, including a full-scale war.'' It also offered to send a team of ''inspectors'' to South Korea to ch allege its investigation.
 South Korea saw ''no other plausible explanation'' than a North Korean attack. ''The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine,'' a team of military and civilian investigators from South Korea, the United States, Britain, Australia and Sweden said in a statement. ''There is no other plausible explanation.''
 The widely expected conclusion was bound to escalate tensions between the Koreas and to intensify an international debate on how to punish the North. 
 North Korea, which was also found responsible in 1987 for the bombing of a South Korean commercial jet that killed 115 people, has denied involvement in the sinking on March 26 of the 1,200-ton ship, the Cheonan, which occurred near the countries' disputed western sea border. North Korea has vowed to retaliate against any attempts to link it to the sinking; it recently threatened to shut down the border, raising the possibility of trapping 1,000 South Korean workers at a joint industrial park in the North Korean city of Kaesong.
 The South insists that the sinking of its warship deserves punishment -- through unilateral and United Nations economic sanctions -- because it violates the United Nations charter and the 1953 Korean War armistice.
 ''We will take resolute counter-actions against North Korea. We should make North Korea admit to its wrongdoing through international cooperation,'' President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea told Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd by phone, Mr. Lee's office said. ''In the past too, North Korea had denied involvement after committing military provocations and terrorism. But this time, its sophism won't work because we have evidence no county, no one in the world can dispute.''
 On Tuesday, the Notational Defense Commission, the North's highest ruling agency headed by its leader, Kim Jong-il, vowed to retaliate against any attempt to link it to the March 26 sinking of the 1,200-ton ship, the Cheonan, which occurred near the two Koreas' disputed western sea border.
 ''We will swiftly respond to any punishment, acts of revenge or sanctions that violate our national interest by taking strong measures, including a full-scale war,'' the commission said in statement carried in the North's state-run media.
 Investigators established a critical forensic link when South Korean fishing boats scouring the sea bottom near where the ship went down recovered fragments of a torpedo, including a propulsion motor, propellers and a steering section, Yoon Duk-yong, the head of the investigative team, during a nationally televised news conference on Thursday morning. The parts were on display during the news conference. 
 The fragments matched in size and shape the specifications found in sales pamphlets that North Korea has distributed internationally to export its torpedoes. 
 In one of the parts, the investigators found a handwritten marking in the Korean alphabet Hangul, which reads ''No. 1'' in English. It was consistent with a similar marking found on a stray North Korean torpedo obtained by the South seven years ago, Mr. Yoon said.
 After an analysis of intelligence data, the team also concluded that a few small submarines and a mother ship supporting them had left a North Korean naval base two to three days before the South Korean ship was destroyed in an explosion and had returned to port two or three days after the sinking.
 ''Furthermore, we confirmed that all submarines from neighboring countries were either in or near their respective home bases at the time of the incident,'' Mr. Yoon said.
 ''The Cheonan was split apart and sunk due to a shock wave and bubble effect produced by an underwater torpedo explosion,'' he said, also citing an analysis of damage on the ship's hull. He said the weapon was a high explosive torpedo ''manufactured by North Korea.''
 One of the North's ten midget submarines of the 130-ton Yeono class is believed to have approached the Cheonan by sneaking through international waters and torpedoed it at night, said Air Force Brigadier General Hwang Won-dong, a senior investigator. Mr. Hwang said the North has built the Yeono craft mainly for exports.
 Faced with what it considers the boldest North Korean provocation in years, the government in Seoul has begun rallying international support for sanctions against the North. It invited foreign experts to lend credibility to its investigation. it briefed its neighbors and foreign diplomats in Seoul about the investigation's findings before formally making them publc.
 In recent weeks, South Korean officials have dropped widespread hints about North Korean culpability in the attack. They said that if they proved the ship had been struck by a torpedo, people would reasonably conclude that the North was to blame, given its history of military and terrorist provocations against the South.
 Still, South Korean officials have carefully marshaled their evidence in hopes of securing international support for sanctions. Vital to such an effort would be support from China, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council and a North Korean ally, which has shored up the regime in Pyongyang.
 On Tuesday, when South Korea is thought to have briefed the Chinese ambassador in Seoul about its investigation, China's top envoy in Pyongyang met with North Korean leaders and said that the warm welcome given to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, when he traveled to Beijing earlier this month was proof of an ''undefeatable friendship'' between the allies, according to North Korea's state-run media.
 China's stance is likely to drive South Korea into an even closer military alliance with the United States. Officials here have discussed increasing the number of joint United States-South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea, a maneuver designed to guard against the North but certain to irk China.
 ''This attack proves that despite the past decade of international efforts to engage North Korea, nothing has fundamentally changed,'' said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. 
 The two Koreas remain technically at warm because the Korean War ended in 1953 with a truce, but not a permanent peace treaty. South Korea's previous ''Sunshine Policy'' of engaging the North with economic aid was altered after Mr. Lee took office two years ago with a vow not to coddle the North until it gives up nuclear weapons.
 Even before the formal announcement of the investigation's findings, South Korea has suspended financing for government-level exchanges with North Korea and has asked companies in the South not to start any new deals with the North. But it has shied away from consideration of a military response, which could risk a broader conflict.

HEADLINE: Major Powers Have Deal on Sanctions for Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER; Reporting was contributed by Ellen Barry from Moscow, Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations, Peter Baker from Washington, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration announced an agreement on Tuesday with other major powers, including Russia and China, to impose a fourth set of sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, setting the stage for an intense tug of war with Tehran as it tries to avoid passage of the penalties by the full United Nations Security Council.
 The announcement came a day after Iranian leaders announced their own tentative deal, with Turkey and Brazil, to turn over about half of Iran's stockpile of nuclear fuel for a year, part of a frantic effort to blunt the American-led campaign for harsher sanctions. 
 ''This announcement is as convincing an answer to the efforts undertaken in Tehran over the last few days as any we could provide,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, describing the agreement as a ''strong draft.'' 
 On Wednesday, however, Russia seemed to strike a more ambivalent note when Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov released a statement expressing cautious support for the draft resolution, but stressing that it is far from completion. 
 He said there is a ''basic understanding'' of the new draft, but that it must be approved by non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. If Washington and its European partners proceeded unilaterally, he said, the proposal ''would go beyond decisions agreed upon by the international community and would run counter to the principle of the supremacy of international law guaranteed by the U.N. charter.'' 
 Mr. Lavrov's statement said he ''expressed concern'' over this during a conversation with Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday night, and encouraged her to re-examine Tehran's latest proposal to ''help establish a favorable atmosphere for the resumption of political and diplomatic efforts to regulate Iranian nuclear problems.''
 An official in the Russian Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity under ministry rules, said Mr. Lavrov placed a call to Mrs. Clinton after learning of her announcement on Tuesday night. The official said Russia views Tehran's proposal to enrich uranium in Turkey as very similar to a deal brokered in October by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but acknowledged that Washington is skeptical. 
 ''Our position is, give them another chance,'' the Russian official said. ''We should take into account this demonstration of readiness by Iran.'' 
 Several Iranian officials decried the move toward sanctions, saying it was an illegitimate attempt to thwart Iran's negotiations with Brazil and Turkey and predicting that new sanctions would not pass the Security Council. Kazem Jalali, a member of Parliament called the push for sanctions ''modern barbarism,'' Iran's semi-official FARS news agency reported. 
 Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, told reporters during a trip to Tajikistan that there was ''no chance'' for another sanctions resolution, telling reporters ''Let's not take this seriously,'' Reuters reported. 
 Even if the Security Council adopts the new sanctions, it is unclear whether the provisions -- including a mandate to inspect Iranian ships suspected of entering international ports with nuclear-related technology or weapons -- would inflict enough pain to force Iran to halt its uranium enrichment and cooperate with international inspectors. None of the previous three sets of sanctions passed by the Council during the Bush administration succeeded in their goal: forcing Iran to end its enrichment of uranium and to answer the many questions posed by international inspectors related to their suspicions about Iranian research into nuclear weapons. 
 Some of the toughest proposals were barely even discussed as the United States sought support from China, which is a major trading partner with Iran and has been the most resistant to new sanctions. Along with the Russians, the Chinese blocked any measure that would stop the flow of oil from Iranian ports or gasoline into the country. President Obama himself had raised the possibility of such sanctions during the 2008 campaign. 
 In the end, a deal was reached by the five permanent, veto-wielding members of the Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- plus Germany. They agreed on sanctions against Iranian financial institutions, including those that supported the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Members of the Guard Corps are responsible for overseeing the military aspects of the nuclear program and have assumed commanding roles in the broader Iranian economy. 
 The newest element of the sanctions would require countries to inspect ships or planes headed into or out of Iran if there were suspicions that banned materials were aboard. But as in the case of sanctions against North Korea, there is no authorization to board ships forcibly at sea, a step officials from many countries warned could touch off a larger confrontation. 
 Another new element bars all countries from permitting Iran to invest in nuclear enrichment plants, uranium mines and other nuclear-related technology. That appeared to be aimed at halting rumored Iranian ventures with Venezuela and Zimbabwe, or with companies in Europe. 
 The agreement came months later than the administration had hoped, and after a hectic week of diplomacy, capped by a last-minute phone call by Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Lavrov, to confirm whether Moscow was on board, a senior American official said. 
 The United States believed that it was close to a deal last week, said the official, who did not want to be identified by name while discussing internal negotiations. But it could not resolve the final points with Russia over conventional, nonnuclear arms sales to Iran, and with China over its energy investments there. 
 The American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, said, ''We will seek a vote as soon as the conditions are right and Council members have had an opportunity to consider it.'' Several officials said that moment would not come until next month, at the earliest. 
 Even if the proposed sanctions survive without being watered down, administration officials concede that they are unlikely to alter Iran's behavior, unless they are combined with considerable additional pressure. 
 The previous three sets of sanctions were simply ignored by many of Iran's trading partners. 
 The draft resolution faces resistance from Brazil and Turkey, which have seats on the Council and brokered the deal to transfer some of Iran's nuclear fuel out of the country. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey sharply criticized the continued push for sanctions by the United States. Mr. Erdogan worked with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil to reach the accord with Iran on Monday. 
 Turkey and Brazil have considerable business dealings with Iran, and are seen as eager to flex their muscles on the international stage. The ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Council, speaking with reporters at the United Nations, said that they respected the compromise that the countries had reached with Iran but that it did not address their core concern: Iran's continuing efforts to enrich uranium. 
 Li Baodong, the Chinese envoy, said the resolution should signal to Iran that it needs to cooperate with the United Nations' atomic energy agency. ''The purpose of sanctions is to bring the Iranian side to the negotiating table,'' he said, while praising the initiative taken by Brazil and Turkey. 
 Iran's announcement that it would ship what is believed to be roughly half of its nuclear fuel to Turkey for further enrichment appeared to be a bid to undercut the American efforts to bring along China and Russia. The offer resembled an accord made with the West last October that fell apart when Iran backtracked. 
 Iran has said its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, but American and European officials have pointed to work that seems unrelated to simply producing power. 
 A senior administration official said that one of the most critical sections of the proposed sanctions was modeled on a resolution passed last year against North Korea, after its second nuclear test. That resolution authorized all nations to search cargo ships heading into or out of the country if there were suspicions that weapons or nuclear technology were aboard. 
 In North Korea's case, there have already been some modest successes. In one case, North Korea sent one of its ships back to port, rather than risk having it boarded and inspected.

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Says U.S. Could Feel Europe's Pain

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A top Federal Reserve official warned Thursday that Europe's debt problems could amount to a ''significant external shock'' to the United States economy, harming American banks and exporters and stalling the global recovery.
 The official, Daniel K. Tarullo, said in testimony at a House hearing that the Fed's decision last week to reinstate dollar liquidity swap lines with the European Central Bank and four other central banks was a crucial measure to minimize the risk of further financial turmoil arising from the Greek fiscal crisis. 
 ''In the worst case, such turmoil could lead to a replay of the freezing up of financial markets that we witnessed in 2008,'' Mr. Tarullo told members of the Financial Services Committee. 
 Despite a nearly $1 trillion financing package assembled by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, the downturn in stock markets and continued tight financing in Europe reflected persistent uncertainties, said Mr. Tarullo, who was President Obama's first appointment to the Fed's board of governors.
 The United States is ''in a very different position'' than the debt-stricken European countries, he said. But their problems could hold lessons.
 ''Their experience is another reminder, if one were needed, that every country with sustained budget deficits and rising debt -- including the United States -- needs to act in a timely manner to put in place a credible program for sustainable fiscal policies,'' he said. 
 Two subcommittees called a joint hearing after the Fed's decision last week. Other experts also provided strong warnings on the state of the international economy.
 Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the new financing package in Europe was ''ambitious and demanding.'' He added: ''It may fail, but it is in the collective interest of the United States and the international community to give the people and authorities of Greece time to implement at least the first phase of their program.'' 
 The European Union has responded to economic imbalances since the late 1970s by providing financing without requiring adequate fiscal adjustments, with the result that European countries turned to Brussels rather than Washington for relief, Mr. Truman said.
 ''During those decades, policy makers in Washington were generally content that E.U. countries were not borrowing from the I.M.F. because the I.M.F. could then concentrate its limited resources elsewhere,'' Mr. Truman said in a written version of his testimony. ''However, in retrospect U.S. policy makers should have promoted European adjustment assertively, including through the I.M.F.'' 
 He added: ''As a former Federal Reserve official, I hold myself partly to blame for this failure.'' 
 Carmen M. Reinhart, an economist at the University of Maryland, College Park, said that a restructuring -- or a partial default -- by Greece seemed probable but was ''no panacea.'' While other European conditions may not require a restructuring of government debts, she said, ''there is a pressing need to facilitate a restructuring of private debts, notably those of financial institutions.'' 
 At most, the newest financing package buys time for other heavily indebted countries in Europe to impose austerity measures and restructure private debts, but ''it does not change Greece's, nor anyone else's, levels of outstanding debts and their even more worrisome profile in the period ahead,'' Ms. Reinhart said.
 Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland's Smith School of Business, predicted that a default by Greece would result in much higher borrowing costs for Portugal, Spain and potentially other countries. ''Crisis could easily spread from Europe to the United States, much as the recent U.S. mortgage and broader financial crisis spread to Europe,'' Professor Morici said.
 Mr. Tarullo laid out how that contagion could spread. If sovereign debt problems were to broadly affect Europe, American banks could face large losses on their overall credit exposures, as asset values declined and loan delinquencies mounted. Money market mutual funds that hold commercial paper and certificates of deposit issued by European banks also would be hurt. The result could be a further contraction in bank lending.
 ''Although we view such a development as unlikely, the swoon in global financial markets earlier this month suggests that it is not out of the question,'' Mr. Tarullo said.

HEADLINE: Padded Pensions Add to New York Fiscal Woes

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and AMY SCHOENFELD

 BODY:
In Yonkers, more than 100 retired police officers and firefighters are collecting pensions greater than their pay when they were working. One of the youngest, Hugo Tassone, retired at 44 with a base pay of about $74,000 a year. His pension is now $101,333 a year.
 It's what the system promised, said Mr. Tassone, now 47, adding that he did nothing wrong by adding lots of overtime to his base pay shortly before retiring. ''I don't understand how the working guy that held up their end of the bargain became the problem,'' he said. 
 Despite a pension investigation by the New York attorney general, an audit concluding that some police officers in the city broke overtime rules to increase their payouts and the mayor's statements that future pensions should be based on regular pay, not overtime, these practices persist in Yonkers.
 The city has even arranged for its police to put in overtime as flagmen on Consolidated Edison construction sites. Though a company is paying the bill, the city is actually reporting the work as city overtime to the New York State pension fund, padding future payouts -- an arrangement at odds with the spirit of public employment, if not the law. 
 The Yonkers experience shows how errors, misunderstandings and wishful thinking are piling hidden new costs onto New York's public pension system every year, worsening the state's current fiscal crisis. And the problem is not just in New York. Public pension costs are ballooning everywhere, throwing budgets out of whack and raising the question of whether venerable state pension systems are viable. 
 In fact, the cost of public pensions has been systemically underestimated nationwide for more than two decades, say some analysts. By these estimates, state and local officials have promised $5 trillion worth of benefits while thinking they were committing taxpayers to roughly half that amount.
 The use of public money for outsize retirement pay really stings when budgets don't balance, teachers are being laid off, furloughs are being planned and everything from poison-control centers to Alzheimer's day care is being cut, as is happening in New York.
 According to pension data collected by The New York Times from the city and state, about 3,700 retired public workers in New York are now getting pen-sions of more than $100,000 a year, exempt from state and local taxes. The data belie official reports that the average state pension is a modest $18,000, or $38,000 for retired police officers and firefighters. (The average is low, in part, because it includes people who worked in government only part time, or just a few years, as well as surviving spouses getting partial benefits.)
 Roughly one of every 250 retired public workers in New York is collecting a six-figure pension, and that group is expected to grow rapidly in coming years, based on the number of highly paid people in the pipeline. 
 Payouts for Decades
 Some will receive the big pensions for decades. Thirteen New York City police officers recently retired at age 40 with pensions above $100,000 a year; nine did so in their 30s. The plan's public information officer said that the very young retirees had qualified for special disability pensions, which are 50 percent larger than ordinary police pensions. He said several dozen of the highest-paid New York City police retirees had disabilities related to 9/11 and the rest of the disabilities resulted from injuries in the line of duty. 
 In virtually every case, the officials who granted the rich pensions thought they were offering something affordable, because the cost estimates were too low. 
 Before Yonkers adopted a richer pension formula for police in 2000, for instance, it was told the maximum cost would be $1.3 million a year. But instead, the yearly cost is now $3.75 million and rising. 
 David Simpson, a spokesman for the mayor of Yonkers, said pension cost projections were ''often lowballs,'' so the city could get stuck. ''Once you give something, you can't take it away,'' he said. 
 Police pensions and overtime have been a sore point in Yonkers for many years and were the subject of an expose in The Journal News in Westchester in 2009. A special audit of police overtime in Yonkers in 2007 found that the police department had failed to enforce its own rules, creating pervasive opportunities for abuse.
 Despite all the attention, police are now being paid as flagmen by Con Edison on their days off, Mr. Simpson confirmed, adding that the city was tacking the extra hours onto their pay, which is then reported to the state pension fund. 
 ''The system encourages police to take as much overtime as they can in the last year before retirement. That's the way the system is structured,'' he said. ''There's nothing illegal or unethical about this.'' 
 In fact, a Con Edison spokesman, Robert McGee, said a number of other towns also require the company to use their police officers as flagmen, raising its labor costs.
 A spokesman for the New York State comptroller's office said that the city was in error and pointed to a 1986 decision by the Supreme Court of New York that found that hours worked by police for outside businesses could not be included in their state-paid pensions.
 ''It has long been established that such overtime from private special duty cannot be included,'' said the spokesman, Mark Johnson.
 The question of how to pay for generous benefits is proving a challenge to New York and many other states whose revenue has fallen and whose debts have become harder to manage, while public officials try to limit the kind of deep service cuts that often mean political death. Some hard-pressed governments are belatedly coming to the grim conclusion that they have promised workers more than their sagging economies can deliver. 
 Outside the United States, Greece and Spain have recently reduced government pensions to deal with burdensome debt that has impeded their ability to finance themselves. The new British coalition government has said it will review public pension costs there as well. 
 Municipalities in this country cannot easily follow suit even as financial problems mount, though, because reducing benefits for their existing employees is considered impossible under the current laws of most states.
 The New York State constitution bars public employers from slowing the rate at which workers build up their pensions over the course of their careers. That degree of protection contrasts sharply with the private sector, where companies can generally change the rate at which workers build their benefits at any time. Furthermore, as companies have reduced pensions substantially over the last two decades, states and cities have embellished theirs with sweeteners like inflation adjustments and lower retirement ages that appealed to unions and their members, who vote. 
 Police and other safety workers are in many cases allowed to retire with full pensions after 20 years. Other workers can often do so after 30 years, even as young as 55, although future hires in New York will have to work to age 62 to get their full benefits, under a law passed in January. 
 Census data from 2008 shows that the typical state or municipal pension is substantially richer than the typical company pension -- $15,941 versus $7,904 -- for retirees aged 65 and older. By tradition, public employees have said they accepted lower salaries in exchange for better benefits, but the Census data show this has not been true for a number of years. In 2008 the median pay for a worker in the private sector was $39,877, compared with $45,124 for a state or local employee. The data show broad national aggregates that do not try to compare similar occupations.
 And, while companies must adhere to uniform federal guidelines about setting aside money to pay pensions, states do not. Some, like New Jersey, have failed to fund their pensions for years and have fallen so far behind they may never catch up again. New York City and New York State have been more diligent about contributing the required amounts each year -- but the required amounts now turn out to have been too low, in part because they counted on solid investment returns that have not materialized. 
 In Yonkers, contributions to the state pension fund keep rising. This year, to save money, the city is proposing to eliminate about 90 police jobs, out of 640. The savings, though, will not even cover the extra cost of the overtime-enriched pensions. Meanwhile, the police say the layoffs will make the situation worse, because shrinking the police force means those who remain must work even more overtime, driving up pension costs even more.
 An online, searchable database compiled by The Times contains the names and pensions of about 3,700 public retirees in New York who receive more than $100,000 a year. Information was provided by New York State's two big pension plans, one for teachers and the other for other state and local workers outside New York City. 
 Four of New York City's five big pension funds also provided data. But the city police pension fund listed the six-figure amounts being collected by 536 retired police officers without giving their names. The pension plan for the city's firefighters has yet to provide the information, as required by public information law. 
 Even without names, the pension list from the New York City police plan shows a trend toward very youthful retirement, at a time when the city's contributions to the police pension fund have risen sharply. 
 New York City has budgeted a contribution of about $2 billion for this year -- about 64 percent of the police payroll, one of the highest pension contribution rates in the United States. That amount does not yet include money to make up for the investment losses of 2008, so the rate is almost sure to rise.
 A Variety of Occupations
 Not all the people getting six-figure pensions are former police and firefighters from cities with liberal overtime and disability policies. Hundreds more worked at hospitals, power utilities, port authorities and other ''public benefit corporations'' -- hybrid entities that compete with the private sector and pay their officials accordingly, but allow them, at the same time, to participate in the state pension fund. 
 Edward A. Stolzenberg makes a good example. He started out more than three decades ago in the Westchester County government; today, in retirement, he collects $222,143 a year, one of the biggest pensions paid by the New York State pension fund. 
 In between, he became county health commissioner, running the Westchester Medical Center when it was a big, struggling county hospital. The county made it a public benefit corporation in 1997, with a mandate to grow and compete with the big hospitals in New York City. 
 In the process Mr. Stolzenberg's salary shot up. By the time he retired, he was the highest-paid official in Westchester County, he said, with a salary of more than $400,000 a year. That was still less than the rate at a for-profit hospital, he said. 
 ''In a time when the state budget is pretty bad and money is pouring out, people look at pensions and say, 'This is terrible! Why are people getting this kind of money?' '' he acknowledged. ''It may not be viable. But that's the way the state structured it.''
 He added that his successor at the medical center was making more than $900,000 and accruing a pension. 
 Companies that find they have overpromised have a way out. They can declare bankruptcy, and if a judge approves, they can send their pension plans to the federal agency that insures corporate pensions. That agency limits its coverage to what is considered a basic pension, currently $54,000 for a 65-year-old retiree, much less for younger people. If Yonkers could send its police plan to the federal guarantor, for instance, Mr. Tassone, at 47, would have his benefit cut from $101,333 to just $15,660. 
 But state plans don't have such an insurance program, much less any definition of a basic, guaranteed benefit. 
 Federal tax law does put a cap on pension payouts, currently $195,000 a year. Congress set this cap, which has risen with inflation, more than 30 years ago to keep employers from turning their pension funds into abusive tax shelters. 
 But New York State found a way around it. In 1997, lawmakers created a safe-harbor mechanism allowing retirees to collect bigger pensions legally -- a second pool of money called the Excess Benefit Fund. Towns all over the state pay the associated costs, even though only a few of them have retirees who qualify. At least 28 recipients in New York get pensions above $195,000 a year. One of the highest is George M. Philip, who gets $261,037 after retiring as chief executive and chief investment officer of the New York State teachers' pension fund. Since retiring, he has gone back to work as president of the State University of New York at Albany, drawing an additional $280,000 last year. 
 New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, has said public pensions are getting out of hand, and has begun an investigation of places, like Yonkers, where there are unusual concentrations of six-figure retirees. 
 But he may well find that most recipients have done nothing illegal. The benefits have been enacted by legislators, signed into law by governors, hailed by comptrollers and adopted by local officials -- all of whom were told by actuaries and other financial advisers that the pensions would cost just a fraction of what they are now turning out to cost. 
 ''In very few cases do they know what they're agreeing to,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, which tracks pension costs. ''They almost always obscure the costs, from themselves and from the public.'' 
 Offended by Comments
 Mr. Cuomo did not name Mr. Tassone but spoke of a Yonkers officer who had retired at 44 on $101,033 a year. Mr. Tassone said all his neighbors knew it was him, and he bristles at the implication that he got more than he was supposed to. He said he could correctly document all the overtime he worked, and that the practice was approved by the mayor and city council. 
 The special audit in Yonkers named Mr. Tassone in its sample of retirees with unusual overtime records, but did not accuse him of doing anything wrong. Disciplinary proceedings were brought against only one officer, who is now retired. 
 Mr. Tassone said the only reason he joined the police force was the promise of a full pension after just 20 years, and it would have been wrong for the state or city to go back on the promise after using it to recruit him. 
 He said he put up with hardships for 20 years as a police officer, ''and now I'm at the end of it and I've become a target,'' he said. ''I broke my hand three times. I broke my left ankle. I blew out my knee. In my last two years alone, I made between 350 and 400 arrests, and a lot of those people weren't volunteering.'' 
 Because he could retire young, he added, it was important to start out with the largest pension possible. In the coming years, inflation will eat away at his benefit. Public pensions in New York City and State have had a cost-of-living adjustment feature since 2000, but it applies only to the first $18,000. 
 ''I concede, I have a very good pension, but what's that pension going to be worth when I'm 70 years old?'' Mr. Tassone said. 
 Although limited to the first $18,000, the cost-of-living adjustment was the most expensive pension enhancement enacted in recent memory in New York, according to the Independent Budget Office. The cost has, once again, proved higher than expected. 
 Yonkers still offers full pensions to police after 20 years, but just in theory. For the moment, the city is too broke to send any new cadets to the police academy, and retirees are not being replaced.

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Drops Below U.S. Rate for the First Time in Months

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In the latest sign that New York's economy is on the rebound after a long recession, the city's unemployment rate fell below 10 percent last month for the first time since August.
 The number of private-sector jobs in the city rose by 21,000 in April, nearly triple the average increase for that month in the last 10 years, said Colleen C. Gardner, the state's labor commissioner. 
 The growth was widespread, with increases in all industries, but was especially strong in professional and business services and in leisure and hospitality, Ms. Gardner said. 
 For the city, the unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in April, down from 10 percent in March and a recent high of 10.5 percent at the end of 2009. 
 It is now lower than the national unemployment rate, which was 9.9 percent in April, for the first time since late summer 2009.
 New York State's unemployment rate also fell in April, declining to 8.4 percent, from the March rate of 8.6 percent. 
 ''Across the board, New York has done better than the nation as a whole during this recession,'' Ms. Gardner said.
 Still, she said, unemployed New Yorkers face a ''very difficult job market,'' in which there are three to four times as many job-seekers as available jobs. Statewide, more than 580,000 people are collecting unemployment benefits, and more than half of them have been out of work for at least half a year. 
 Even worse, about 64,000 residents have exhausted 99 weeks of unemployment benefits and cannot collect any more unless Congress approves another extension.
 Ms. Gardner said a growing number of employers were indicating a willingness to hire. To spur them, she and other Labor Department officials have been promoting a program that gives companies a credit for the Social Security taxes they would pay for the rest of this year on any newly hired employees who had been out of work for 60 days or more.
 Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services firm in Manhattan, pointed out that the sector that added the most jobs was the federal government, most likely because it hired so many census-takers. Those jobs, of course, are temporary. 
 The latest figures do not necessarily demonstrate that big layoffs have ended, as was proved by the announcement this week that thousands of jobs were being cut by Pfizer Inc., the big drug company based in Manhattan. But Ms. Denham said, ''It is pretty safe to say at this point that the streak of job losses bottomed in December.''
 By her calculations, which include adjustments for normal seasonal fluctuations, the city has regained 53,500 jobs already this year.
 One company trying to contribute to that trend is Vitech Systems Group Inc., a software company with headquarters on Park Avenue South.
 Vitech is trying to fill 15 jobs, mostly computer programmers and business analysts, that pay at least $70,000 a year. After freezing wages and benefits during the worst of the recession, the company is preparing for a surge in orders from its clients, which include labor unions, banks and hedge funds, said James E. Vitiello, a vice president of Vitech.
 ''We've certainly seen an uptick in business lately,'' said Mr. Vitiello, whose brother, Frank, started the company 20 years ago in his dormitory at New York University.
 ''Part of what happened is companies tried to cut expenditures on services like ours and products like ours,'' James Vitiello said. ''Now they feel the economy is picking up and they have some pent-up demand within their own businesses, which is flowing through to companies like ours.''
 Those employers that are hiring still have the leverage in negotiations over pay. According to data compiled by James A. Parrott, chief economist for the nonprofit Fiscal Policy Institute, the average wage of workers in the city, outside of the financial sector, declined almost 5 percent last year. Wages declined in 7 of the 10 biggest sectors of the city's economy, he said.

HEADLINE: Repression Is Alleged Before Vote In Ethiopia

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Jason McLure and an Ethiopian journalist contributed reporting from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- Diplomats, human rights groups and witnesses say the Ethiopian government is methodically stifling dissent in the prelude to this weekend's national elections, denying food aid to opposition supporters, jailing political opponents and possibly killing a few activists, part of a broader pattern of repression in several of America's closest allies in Africa, especially during election time.
 Ethiopia is one of the poorest and most aid-dependent countries in the world, and the American government and the World Bank, two of its biggest donors, are investigating potential leaks in the aid system and allegations that the government is manipulating food aid to reward political allies and literally starve out political opposition.
 ''We have seen these reports, and we are looking into them, and we would object to any politicization of our humanitarian assistance,'' said Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ''We expect countries to use the aid in the manner in which it was given and to ensure that it reaches those who need it.'' 
 The allegations, which the Ethiopian government strongly denies, seem to be part of an increasingly iron-fisted strategy to ensure that the governing party holds on to power while preventing the widespread protests that erupted after the last major elections in 2005. 
 Back then, opposition groups said they had won far more seats than the government acknowledged, setting off demonstrations that were violently suppressed. Security forces arrested tens of thousands and killed scores of unarmed protesters.
 According to human rights groups, recent State Department reports and witnesses, the Ethiopian government has recently imprisoned opposition leaders on false charges, passed laws to stymie intellectual and human rights groups and silenced independent media. Ethiopia gets roughly a billion dollars a year in aid from American taxpayers; at the same time, the government is jamming radio broadcasts from the American-financed Voice of America, one of the few major independent media outlets left in the country. 
 The complaints pouring out of Ethiopia echo some of those from Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, American allies that receive hundreds of millions of dollars in aid each year. 
 Elections are looming in each of these countries, and though such contests are supposed to be the embodiment of democracy, they often presage harsh crackdowns. Human rights groups say strongman governments across the continent continue to use a variety of tools -- arresting journalists, driving out human rights monitors and jailing opponents -- to eliminate any serious political threat.
 ''More repression, less democracy and no real outcry,'' said Daniela Kroslak, deputy Africa program director for the International Crisis Group. ''That's true for much of Africa today.''
 In a recent report, Human Rights Watch describes how the Ethiopian government employs an extensive network of local officials, militias and spies to control who gets donor-financed fertilizer, seeds, food aid and jobs. It is part of a ''complex and multilayered strategy aimed at preventing political opposition and dissent,'' the report said, and the elections on Sunday will probably be ''a veneer of democratic pretension hiding a repressive state apparatus.'' 
 Many Ethiopians are terrified to discuss these issues openly, and the government has denied visas to several foreign journalists trying to cover the elections and is restricting the movements of foreign diplomats. 
 But some Ethiopians are speaking out. Hassan Ali, a farmer in central Ethiopia with seven children, was one of several villagers who said they were cut off from a donor-supported antipoverty program because they backed the opposition. He said local officials warned him in March, ''Unless you join the E.P.R.D.F.,'' the ruling party, ''you could die and your family will starve to death.''
 Some analysts go as far as saying that American aid to governments like Ethiopia's is actually subsidizing the problem. 
 ''Our findings show that the development assistance is helping to underwrite the repression'' in Ethiopia, said Georgette Gagnon, director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.
 American officials say they have tried to broach these complaints with their Ethiopian counterparts, and the State Department's human rights report on Ethiopia is unsparing: ''There were numerous credible reports of unlawful detention of opposition candidates,'' and, ''Security forces committed arbitrary and politically motivated killings during the year.'' 
 Since early March, two opposition activists and one candidate have been killed. Witnesses and some Western diplomats say the victims were singled out because they were outspoken opponents of the governing party. 
 The Ethiopian government says that the killings were common crimes, not assassinations, and that the opposition was fabricating abuses to discredit the election. The government has also lashed out at critics abroad, denouncing the State Department assessment and dismissing the Human Rights Watch report as ''a smear campaign.''
 Bereket Simon, Ethiopia's minister of communication affairs, said last week that the government did not need coercion to win the election because ''the people of Ethiopia know for sure the future of Ethiopia lies with this government.''
 Supporters of the government say it has reduced poverty and improved infrastructure, unlike some African nations that get staggering sums of foreign aid yet have little to show for it because of corruption. 
 The United States has many delicate interests to balance in Ethiopia, a sprawling Christian-led country of 85 million people in a region struggling with Islamic extremism. Mr. Carson, the State Department official, acknowledged that a top priority was maintaining a ''military-to-military relationship'' with the Ethiopians, who received covert American help in 2006 to invade Somalia and oust a government that was tilting toward radical Islam.
 Human rights groups are urging the United States to put more strings on the humanitarian aid to Ethiopia, but the Obama administration is against that.
 ''We should never tie our humanitarian assistance to political goals and objectives,'' Mr. Carson said. ''We are trying to ensure that poor people's lives are saved.''
 But he added that ''other pieces of the aid package are subject to discussion when governments backslide on democratic reform.''
 That backsliding is a problem across the continent, despite the money, effort and diplomatic capital spent on democratic reform. Sudan just completed its first multiparty election in 24 years, but many analysts say the previous election, in 1986, was freer and fairer. Kenya held a clean election in 2002, and a disastrously flawed one in 2007.
 Few of Africa's authoritarian governments, like Ethiopia's, were previously bastions of liberty. The country has a long history of repression and rebellion. But critics contend that many of Africa's former-guerrilla-fighters-turned-leaders are growing steadily more repressive as their terms stretch from years into decades. Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, has led the country for 19 years.
 ''They still have this leftist ideology that the vanguard party knows what is right for the people,'' said Berhanu Nega, who was elected mayor of Addis Ababa, the capital, in 2005, then jailed for nearly two years, forced into exile in the United States and recently sentenced to death in absentia. ''Anyone who opposes the party is an enemy of the people.''

HEADLINE: Pay-What-You-Want Has Patrons Perplexed

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM and MALCOLM GAY; Malcolm Gay reported from Clayton, Mo., and Stephanie Strom from New York.

 BODY:
CLAYTON, Mo. -- The country's latest experiment in pay-what-you-want eating started last weekend when a cafe run by Panera Bread, one of the fastest-growing chain restaurants in the country, began refusing payments from customers in this affluent St. Louis suburb and politely asked them instead to ''take what you need, leave your fair share'' in wood-and-plexiglass lockboxes.
 There was a line out the door at the peak of the lunch rush -- a crew of government workers, area professionals and the merely curious who seemed enthusiastic, if a little bewildered, about the enterprise. Was this a high-class soup kitchen? A newfangled charity? 
 Neither, it turned out. It is one of about a dozen operations around the country providing free or low-cost food to those who need it and trying to sustain themselves off the money their paying customers decide to toss in the box. 
 Some will call it a hot trend, others a pipe dream, but the notion of letting diners choose what they pay for their meals has been gaining traction over the last decade as an outgrowth of the organic food movement and the advent of social entrepreneurs -- those who believe that making a profit and doing good are not mutually exclusive.
 The intention is that these restaurants will take in enough cash to cover their expenses. If money is left over, restaurants embracing the concept say they plan to use it to help needy people by feeding them or giving them jobs.
 Such restaurants are not charities in the traditional sense, though many rely on support from nonprofit groups. Panera, for example, will offer financial and other support, like donated food, to its new concept store here. 
 Ron Shaich, the chairman of Panera and a co-founder of the chain, says that if ''we see people are gaming the system, we're going to say, 'Why don't you come in and volunteer?' ''
 ''It's a test of human nature,'' Mr. Shaich added. ''The real question is whether the community can sustain it.''
 At the restaurant Wednesday, some customers paid nothing and signed up to volunteer later, though everyone was hazy about what they would be doing. 
 Lynn Richardson, 30, who works for a music promoter, paid roughly 50 cents more than the $5.48 ''suggested funding level'' for her potato soup and diet soda. 
 David Eisenbraun and Melanie Holland, two college students taking a break from yard work to buy lunch with her mother, dropped $15 into the box for their meals -- though the suggested price was $24.95. They also wondered just how ''charitable'' the entire enterprise really was. 
 ''I don't have the foggiest idea of where the money's going,'' said Mr. Eisenbraun, who also wondered about the company's motivation: ''Are they in it for the good press?''
 Such skepticism, coupled with a fair amount of freeloading, has all but killed the concept in other places. The phone at the Java Street Cafe in Kettering, Ohio, which last year embraced the pay-what-you-want strategy, has been disconnected, and it appears to have closed.
 And Tierra Sana in Queens folded -- though it offered customers a pay-what-you-want option only one day a week.
 The Terra Bite Lounge, a cafe in Kirkland, Wash., operated as a pay-what-you-want restaurant for a year or so. But Ervin Peretz, its owner and a lead technical designer at Google, said the cafe now charges for its meals. He said he dropped the model in part because of issues particular to its location -- it is in a neighborhood popular with teenagers. 
 Founded in 2003, One World Everybody Eats in Salt Lake City is one of the oldest pay-what-you-want restaurants, and like Mr. Peretz, its operators have found the concept a bit challenging. It is now owned by a nonprofit group and suggests customers pay a small amount, say, $4 for a meat or fish entree.
 ''I used to let people put their money in a basket and make their own change, but then I went to a lockbox,'' said Denise Cerreta, the cafe's founder. ''You learn how to cut down on the people who will take advantage of the concept.'' 
 About 15 to 20 of the roughly 60 meals it serves each day are given away to needy customers, some of whom wash windows, sweep or break down boxes for an hour or so in return. ''They leave here with a full stomach and feeling like they earned their meal, which is the idea,'' said Giovanni Bouderbala, the head chef and director.
 The One World Everybody Eats charity has helped restaurant owners in Denver, Spokane, Wash., Highland Park, N.J., and Arlington, Tex., incorporate the pay-what-you-want concept, and Ms. Cerreta advised Panera on its cafe here. 
 Daniel Honkomp, 21, and Andrew Eason, 20, both unemployed, came by the cafe to volunteer. ''If I had anything to donate, I would, but what I can donate is my labor,'' Mr. Eason said. 
 He added, ''You don't have to pay, but if you have a good heart and you make the money, you're going to try to pay your fair share.''

HEADLINE: Dollar a Haven, For How Long?

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
 Haven status in a market storm sounds good for the United States, but could be dangerous. The current atmosphere bolsters the dollar's standing and delivers the perk of cheap financing. But for a nation that desperately needs to kick its borrowing habit, the weak euro could be a bad influence.
 Global financial markets have been rattled for weeks as euro zone leaders have clumsily tried to contain the Greek contagion. A nearly $1 trillion rescue package has done little so far. The euro has been hammered despite recovering a little ground in recent days. Stock markets around the world took another beating Thursday as investors feared a global economic slump. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.9 percent. 
 The big winners remain the United States dollar and government debt. Ideally, this should provide a window of opportunity for America to address its own deficit problem. The message from the euro zone should be loud and clear: if lawmakers don't put their house in order, markets eventually will do it for them.
 Sadly, moves to raise new money and curb the deficit have been few and far between. The recent Senate energy proposal passed up an opportunity to raise around $100 billion a year through a tougher carbon cap-and-trade system. Social Security reform, a reduction in mortgage income tax relief and other revenue savers may have to wait until bond investors threaten to revolt.
 There's hardly been a whiff of rebellion, however. The incredible shrinking euro, in fact, has quashed any sign of interest rates moving higher. The United States government would need to pay only 3.25 percent for a 10-year Treasury note, and less than 1 percent for a two-year note. Continued upheaval abroad means the rates will probably go lower.
 Moreover, the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency has few challengers. That means foreign central banks are more likely to think twice about diversifying their vast savings into other currencies. And private investors will continue to park money in United States government debt, even if they're dismayed at Washington's spendthrift ways. Tough decisions shouldn't be put off just because of the dollar's popularity.
 Nuclear Power at Bay
 Nuclear power advocates in the United States could see their hopes choked by low emissions costs. The latest proposals in Congress involve expanding the hodgepodge of available subsidies. But these will be hard-pressed to overcome the cost advantages of fossil fuels, especially with natural gas prices so low.
 As global warming has climbed the political agenda, lawmakers have tried hard to rouse the nuclear industry from a slumber of decades. To maintain its existing 20 percent market share, the nuclear industry would need about 25 new reactors by 2035, according to the Energy Department, assuming electricity demand increases as forecast. No new reactor projects in the United States have made it past the drawing board since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.
 The government has streamlined the licensing process in the 1990s and dangled $18.5 billion in new loan guarantees since 2005. But that has barely brought the industry to the starting line. A Senate proposal this month roughly triples loan guarantees available for up to nine new reactors and provides for more generous depreciation rules.
 Even this is unlikely to do enough. Nuclear power plants are notoriously expensive, costing about $4 billion for one gigawatt of generating capacity, compared with $850 million for a similar amount of gas-fired capacity. And they have a long history of surpassing estimates. A reactor in Finland now being constructed by Areva of France is 65 percent over budget and three years behind schedule.
 The surge in natural gas discoveries in America has further raised the hurdle for nuclear power. The 616 trillion cubic feet of shale gas found in recent years through new drilling techniques have sent prices diving, making gas generation cheaper still.
 The upshot is that the government would have to price carbon emissions at $100 a metric ton to make new nuclear plants economical, the nuclear operator Exelon says. Even if that's an exaggeration, the contrast with what's proposed is stark: the Senate bill has a carbon price ceiling of just $25 a ton.
 The subsidies proposed so far won't bridge the gap. The nuclear industry's future may depend on America adopting an unexpectedly beefy tax on greenhouse gases.

HEADLINE: World Events Rumble at Cannes

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

DATELINE: CANNES, France 

 BODY:
Of all the filmmakers whose work is in the 63rd Cannes Film Festival -- including the French lion Jean-Luc Godard, who growled at us yet refused to show his face, and the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, who has seemingly metamorphosed into a Euro-style art-house auteur -- none have had the impact of the man who could not attend. Jafar Panahi is an Iranian director who was asked to join the competition jury, but is currently in a jail in his country for his political views. On Tuesday, a message from him in which he asked to contact his family and speak with a lawyer, was posted on the Web site of the French journal La Regle du Jeu (laregledujeu.org). 
 ''Finally, I swear upon what I believe in, the cinema: I will not cease my hunger strike until my wishes are satisfied. 
 ''My final wish is that my remains be returned to my family, so that they may bury me in the place they choose.'' 
 The gravity of Mr. Panahi's statement only underscored the real and often calamitous world events that have informed a number of the films here, with selections touching on the American war in Iraq, the global financial crisis, religious fundamentalism, armed revolutionary struggles and the usual man's inhumanity against man, women and children. At a Thursday afternoon press conference, an Iranian journalist asked the director Doug Liman -- who's here with ''Fair Game,'' about the former C.I.A. operative Valerie Plame and her husband, Joe Wilson -- what he thought about the belief that the United States might soon lead an attack on Iran. The slightly surprised-looking Mr. Liman paused and then answered that, in contrast to the real Ms. Plame, he is not ''a nuclear proliferation expert.'' Next question. 
 Greeted with solid applause and a smattering of boos after its first press screening, ''Fair Game'' has an enjoyable opening hour before disintegrating into melodramatic hooey. Naomi Watts, bright and sincere at the press conference, plays Plame as a no-nonsense operative who's always rushing, whether at home tending her family or in the dreary basement halls of the Central Intelligence Agency or on the streets of a foreign country. Sean Penn, who plays Ms. Plame's husband, skipped Cannes to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the need for continued relief for Haiti. 
 Mr. Liman said ''Fair Game'' was the kind of movie he had always wanted to make (his previous titles include ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' and the first Bourne movie), invoking the memory of his father, Arthur L. Liman, who served as the chief counsel to the Senate committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, the arms-for-hostages scandal that blew up in the Reagan years. Given the younger Mr. Liman's stated goals and that the movie takes aim against the Bush administration and the complicit news media, it is too bad that the story insists on turning into a marital soap opera. That's a familiar strategy in mainstream cinema, where real politics are generally avoided. But the bombs and deaths that are part of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson's story demand more.
 Hollywood productions have long found a place at Cannes, even if Hollywood now rarely returns the interest. ''Fair Game,'' it's worth noting, was not made by one of the Hollywood studios, which right now appear averse to smart adult entertainment. For that, American viewers increasingly need to look to nonstudio distributors like IFC Films, which continues to skim the cream of Cannes. As of Thursday, it had bought two of the best-received films in this year's edition: Olivier Assayas's ''Carlos,'' a 5 hour 33 minute portrait of the militant turned mercenary known as Carlos the Jackal, and Mr. Kiarostami's widely admired talky two-hander, ''Certified Copy,'' the first feature he has made outside his native Iran and the first with a European star. 
 That would be Juliette Binoche, who stars as an antiques dealer, merely identified as ''she,'' who lives in Tuscany. The film opens with a shot of a table on which two mikes have been placed, as if in wait for the two principals, who soon take their place in Mr. Kiarostami's self-conscious exercise. The woman, after prematurely leaving a talk by a visiting British author, James Miller (the British opera singer William Shimell), agrees to drive him out of town for some sightseeing. During their adventure, they discuss his book of art criticism (titled ''Certified Copy''), which explores the differences between originals and fakes, and slowly slip into an increasingly serious game by pretending to be a long-married couple. 
 The most appealing part of ''Certified Copy'' is Ms. Binoche's generous, alternately uptight and loose performance, which pulls you close when her character's unpersuasive actions turn you off. The cinematography by Luca Bigazzi is another draw, capturing the beauty of Tuscany without drowning it in the honeyed tones that often goo up the screen whenever anyone shoots in that part of the world. Although the film formally recalls Richard Linklater's peripatetic love stories, ''Before Sunrise'' and ''Before Sunset,'' ''Certified Copy'' is very much a Kiarostami film in its blurring of fiction and nonfiction. I wish I believed that this woman would have tolerated this insufferable man for a single second; it might have helped if Mr. Shimell, who has an interesting, grave face, were a plausible screen performer. 
 Given the situation in Iran, this might not be the last time that Mr. Kiarostami, whose previous films include ''Taste of Cherry,'' ventures into European art-house cinema, of which this new film is certainly a ''certified copy.'' Mr. Kiarostami, seated next to a stricken-looking Ms. Binoche, opened his news conference by saying that he had received a message to call Mr. Panahi's wife in Tehran and was hoping for good news. ''The fact that a filmmaker has been imprisoned,'' Mr. Kiarostami said, ''is in itself intolerable.'' He added that if the Iranian government continued to imprison Mr. Panahi, explanations were necessary, because he did not understand how a film could be considered a crime. When a journalist started crying while asking another question about Iran, Ms. Binoche wept as well. 
 ''Certified Copy'' remains a strong contender for the Palme d'Or, along with two other competition entries: Mike Leigh's ''Another Year,'' about a happily married late-middle-aged couple (the movie has been acquired by Sony Pictures Classics for distribution in the United States), and Xavier Beauvois's quietly powerful ''Of Gods and Men.'' Based on a true story, ''Of Gods and Men'' largely takes place in a Cistercian monastery outside an Algerian village in the 1990s. The story involves eight French monks -- played by Lambert Wilson and Michael Lonsdale, among others -- whose peaceable lives are threatened by Islamic fundamentalists soon after civil war erupts. (Another competition film, ''Outside the Law,'' from Rachid Bouchareb, about the Algerian fight for independence from France, has its premiere on Friday.) 
 Part of what distinguishes ''Of Gods and Men'' is its intelligence and topicality, its inquiry into questions of faith and fear. But much of its pleasure derives from its attention to the monks' liturgical rituals, quotidian habits and manifestly deep love for one another and the world around them. In one scene, the abbot, played by Mr. Wilson, takes a long, meditative walk, stopping to lovingly pat an enormous tree, a gesture that brings to mind the communion between man and nature in Roberto Rossellini's ''Flowers of St. Francis.'' The superb cast includes some of the most expressive faces in contemporary cinema -- Mr. Lonsdale's thick white eyebrows alone suggest a richly lived existence -- which Mr. Beauvois tenderly frames in close-up during the devastating finale.
 Like Mr. Beauvois, the South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong uses reserve to tremendous effect. Mr. Lee's latest, ''Poetry,'' which is also in competition, centers on Mija (Yun Jung-hee), a grandmother raising her only grandchild, a teenage boy, in a small city. At first, this seemingly simple story concentrates on Mija's daily habits, her visits to her doctor, her relations with her grandson, her poignant vanity. One day she decides to take a poetry writing course, a decision that, as the tale takes a violent turn, becomes our entry into a woman who's far richer than her fussy habits and humble words suggest. With an understated visual style and perfectly paced narrative, Mr. Lee has created a portrait of a woman who has, by the end, become an extraordinary vision of human empathy.

HEADLINE: Stocks Plunge on Fears of a Spreading European Crisis

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Reporting was contributed by Sewell Chan, Eric Dash and Matthew Saltmarsh.

 BODY:
Fears that the fragile economic recovery in the United States might be threatened by the financial and political crisis in Europe gripped Wall Street on Thursday, sending the stock market into a sharp decline and leaving anxious traders wondering where the pain might stop. 
 The 376-point drop of the Dow Jones industrial average punctuated what amounts to a slow-motion crash that began in late April. The Dow has now plunged more than 1,000 points in a matter of weeks, signifying what is known as a market correction -- a sort of minibear market characterized by a 10 percent decline in a short period of time. 
 With Thursday's sell-off, this broad decline gained momentum and quickly spread beyond stocks to commodities like copper and oil, which are considered bellwethers of the industrial economy. 
 As traders downgraded their forecasts for economic growth, the price of a barrel of crude oil fell roughly 8 percent in intraday trading, before recovering to settle more than 2 percent lower, at $68.01. 
 Nagging worries that Europe's debt crisis could spread, compounded by uncertainties over financial regulation on both sides of the Atlantic, have set investors on edge the world over.
 ''People are learning to think the unthinkable,'' said Willem Buiter, chief economist of Citigroup. Many worry that Greece and even other economically vulnerable nations like Spain or Portugal will be unable to pay their debts despite a sweeping rescue effort by the European Union.
 By the close, the Dow was down 376.36 points, or 3.6 percent, to 10,068.01. In a seesaw period of months this year, the index hit a recent low of 9,908.39 on Feb. 8, climbed to a peak of 11,205.03 on April 26, and then fell back by more than 10 percent since.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 43.46 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,071.59, the biggest one-day drop since April last year. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 94.36 points, or 4.11 percent, to 2,204.01.
 The unilateral decision by Germany this week to ban certain speculative trading, a move rebuffed by some other European nations, has unsettled investors.
 The German government did not consult its partners before issuing the change, adding to the sense that new financial regulations will start arriving piecemeal and that Europe's leaders are not united in addressing the Continent's broadening crisis.
 ''Investors are struggling to adjust to a new regime where politics is more important than before,'' said Gianluca Salford, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase in London.
 On Thursday, the Treasury Department announced that Secretary Timothy F. Geithner would travel to Europe next week to discuss the crisis there with Britain's new chancellor of the Exchequer and with the president of the European Central Bank. 
 The uncertain progress of financial regulatory overhaul in the United States also weighed on the markets. 
 Across Wall Street, banking analysts were busy tallying up the financial effect of the legislation, which was passed by the Senate on Thursday night. Tough new credit card rules have already chipped away at the bottom line of the biggest banks. Now, their derivatives, debit card and proprietary trading businesses could face similarly heavy restrictions under new rules. 
 A Goldman Sachs research report, released Monday, said the proposed legislation could reduce earnings at 28 of the biggest banks by more than 20 percent.
 For the first time there was talk of capital flight from countries like Germany and Britain to perceived safe havens like Switzerland. And across the globe investors fled from risky currencies, bonds and stocks to safer assets like the dollar, the Japanese yen and United States bonds. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond -- the benchmark global interest rate -- fell to 3.21 percent, its lowest level this year and a clear sign of investors seeking a safe haven. 
 ''There has been a flight to quality -- a flight to the dollar, investment grade bonds and even within the stock market toward higher quality companies,'' said Matthew S. Rothman, global head of quantitative equities strategy at Barclays Capital.
 There were other reasons for the jitters on Thursday -- violence in Thailand, political tensions between North and South Korea, and yet another labor strike in Greece over the proposed austerity measures, added to the nervousness of investors. 
 But traders and analysts said the biggest factor unnerving markets was the prospect that European governments might not have done enough to stem the panic over Greece and other heavily indebted nations, and that their problems might spill into the United States, affecting the pace of the economic recovery.
 Some economists warn, for example, that weakness in Europe's economies combined with the current appreciation of the dollar against the euro could hurt American exports.
 ''You are seeing the combined impact of three distinct yet reinforcing factors: greater understanding and concern about the structural headwinds facing markets, a downward reassessment of global growth prospects, and large technical unwinds,'' said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond giant Pimco.
 Major American industrial companies whose prospects are intertwined with that of the global economy took a hit to their share prices on Thursday. General Electric, for example, closed 5.79 percent lower, Caterpillar shares were down 4.51 percent and Boeing was off 4.85 percent.
 The S.& P. 500 index broke below its 200-day moving average. To technical analysts of the stock market, that was seen as a sure signal of a bearish mood among investors.
 ''There is no sector that is being spared,'' said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at the BNY ConvergEx Group. ''You have heard the phrase 'flight to quality'? We are having a flight to liquidity. Everybody is trying to get liquid. Gold, oil, silver, financials -- every sector is getting hit.''
 Mr. Buiter of Citigroup said many big investors were questioning whether they could continue to rely on the euro as a safe long-term investment, given Europe's troubles. ''Many pension funds and other long-term holders have to, for regulatory reasons, hold a fraction of their investments in safe assets. Euro debt used to fit the bill,'' he said. ''It no longer does. People are wondering about it.'' 
 But some other investors said that despite the market correction there had not yet been a fundamental shift in long-term investment strategies. 
 Justin Urquhart Stewart, a co-founder of Seven Investment Management in London, said: ''The market is nervous and there has been some selling out, but it's not capital flight. The euro zone economy is doing better than it was, German exports are strong and corporate earnings are on the up. We have had a one-year bull market in equities, so it's not surprising to see a pullback.''
 An earlier version of this article misstated the closing price of oil and the day's change.

HEADLINE: New Claims for Jobless Benefits Rise Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week by the largest amount in three months. The surge was a setback to hopes that layoffs were declining.
 The Labor Department said Thursday that applications for unemployment benefits rose to 471,000 last week, up by 25,000 from the previous week. It was the first increase in five weeks and the biggest jump since a gain of 40,000 in February.
 The forecast had been for claims to fall by around 4,000 from the previous week. The unexpectedly large rise underscored that even though the economy was growing, improvements in the labor market were coming in fits and starts. 
 The total for new claims was the highest since claims stood at 480,000 on April 10, the Labor Department said. It also pushed the average for the last four weeks to 453,500.
 ''Although no one expects this volatile series to go in one direction every single week, this is clearly a disappointment,'' said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 Stocks slid at the opening bell as investors' already bleak view of the world economy worsened with another drop in the euro and the disappointing United States employment news.
 In a separate report, a private research group said its index of leading economic indicators dipped slightly in April. It was the first decline in more than a year. 
 Six of the 10 components on the Conference Board's index deteriorated. Among them: United States residents filed fewer applications to build homes; vendors were slower in delivering supplies to companies; the unemployed filed more claims for jobless aid; and consumers' confidence dropped.
 Lawmakers responded Thursday to the persistently high jobless rate by announcing a deal to extend expanded unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed through the end of the year. Laid-off workers would also continue to get subsidies to buy health insurance through the Cobra program. House leaders plan to vote on the bill Friday, with the Senate voting next week.
 Employers are hiring again, but not at levels needed to make a dent in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate increased in April to 9.9 percent. An improving economy has lured those who had given up looking for work back into the labor market. The jump in the unemployment rate came even though payrolls rose last month by 290,000 jobs, the biggest gain in four years.
 Analysts could trim their forecasts for job growth in May based on the sudden rise in new claims. The increase occurred in the week that the government conducts its survey for the monthly unemployment report.
 The number of people receiving jobless benefits fell by 40,000 to 4.63 million for the week ending May 8.
 However, that figure does not include unemployed workers who have exhausted their regular 26 weeks of benefits. An additional 5.3 million workers are receiving extended benefits paid for by the federal government for the week ending May 1.
 For the week ending May 8, 35 states and territories had increases in applications for new jobless benefits and 18 had declines.
 The largest increases came in California, up 8,351 because of layoffs in service industries and manufacturing, and Michigan, up by 3,175 because of layoffs in the auto industry.
 The states with the largest declines in jobless applications were New York, down by 3,144, because of fewer layoffs in transportation, services and manufacturing, and Kentucky, with a drop of 2,193.

HEADLINE: Lost Decade Looming?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Despite a chorus of voices claiming otherwise, we aren't Greece. We are, however, looking more and more like Japan.
 For the past few months, much commentary on the economy -- some of it posing as reporting -- has had one central theme: policy makers are doing too much. Governments need to stop spending, we're told. Greece is held up as a cautionary tale, and every uptick in the interest rate on U.S. government bonds is treated as an indication that markets are turning on America over its deficits. Meanwhile, there are continual warnings that inflation is just around the corner, and that the Fed needs to pull back from its efforts to support the economy and get started on its ''exit strategy,'' tightening credit by selling off assets and raising interest rates.
 And what about near-record unemployment, with long-term unemployment worse than at any time since the 1930s? What about the fact that the employment gains of the past few months, although welcome, have, so far, brought back fewer than 500,000 of the more than 8 million jobs lost in the wake of the financial crisis? Hey, worrying about the unemployed is just so 2009. 
 But the truth is that policy makers aren't doing too much; they're doing too little. Recent data don't suggest that America is heading for a Greece-style collapse of investor confidence. Instead, they suggest that we may be heading for a Japan-style lost decade, trapped in a prolonged era of high unemployment and slow growth. 
 Let's talk first about those interest rates. On several occasions over the past year, we've been told, after some modest rise in rates, that the bond vigilantes had arrived, that America had better slash its deficit right away or else. Each time, rates soon slid back down. Most recently, in March, there was much ado about the interest rate on U.S. 10-year bonds, which had risen from 3.6 percent to almost 4 percent. ''Debt fears send rates up'' was the headline at The Wall Street Journal, although there wasn't actually any evidence that debt fears were responsible. 
 Since then, however, rates have retraced that rise and then some. As of Thursday, the 10-year rate was below 3.3 percent. I wish I could say that falling interest rates reflect a surge of optimism about U.S. federal finances. What they actually reflect, however, is a surge of pessimism about the prospects for economic recovery, pessimism that has sent investors fleeing out of anything that looks risky -- hence, the plunge in the stock market -- into the perceived safety of U.S. government debt.
 What's behind this new pessimism? It partly reflects the troubles in Europe, which have less to do with government debt than you've heard; the real problem is that by creating the euro, Europe's leaders imposed a single currency on economies that weren't ready for such a move. But there are also warning signs at home, most recently Wednesday's report on consumer prices, which showed a key measure of inflation falling below 1 percent, bringing it to a 44-year low.
 This isn't really surprising: you expect inflation to fall in the face of mass unemployment and excess capacity. But it is nonetheless really bad news. Low inflation, or worse yet deflation, tends to perpetuate an economic slump, because it encourages people to hoard cash rather than spend, which keeps the economy depressed, which leads to more deflation. That vicious circle isn't hypothetical: just ask the Japanese, who entered a deflationary trap in the 1990s and, despite occasional episodes of growth, still can't get out. And it could happen here.
 So what we should really be asking right now isn't whether we're about to turn into Greece. We should, instead, be asking what we're doing to avoid turning Japanese. And the answer is, nothing. 
 It's not that nobody understands the risk. I strongly suspect that some officials at the Fed see the Japan parallels all too clearly and wish they could do more to support the economy. But in practice it's all they can do to contain the tightening impulses of their colleagues, who (like central bankers in the 1930s) remain desperately afraid of inflation despite the absence of any evidence of rising prices. I also suspect that Obama administration economists would very much like to see another stimulus plan. But they know that such a plan would have no chance of getting through a Congress that has been spooked by the deficit hawks. 
 In short, fear of imaginary threats has prevented any effective response to the real danger facing our economy.
 Will the worst happen? Not necessarily. Maybe the economic measures already taken will end up doing the trick, jump-starting a self-sustaining recovery. Certainly, that's what we're all hoping. But hope is not a plan.

HEADLINE: Student Protests Tie Up Campuses In Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By OMAYA SOSA-PASCUAL and EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS

 BODY:
SAN JUAN, P.R. -- The seven entry gates on the largest campus of the University of Puerto Rico system remained chained shut on Thursday. Beyond improvised barricades were hundreds of students in makeshift camps, some with portable showers and stoves, hardly engaged in the typical college springtime routine of studying for final exams and preparing for graduation.
 The students here have hunkered down, bringing the academic calendar to a halt. They are a month into a strike that has crippled an 11-campus system with more than 62,000 students, intent on persuading the administration to revoke austerity measures that they believe will unfairly hamper low-income students. Only one campus, for medical sciences, is operational. 
 The Rio Piedras campus here in the capital has been closed since the strike began on April 21. When the students locked the gates, a confrontation with the police ensued, and university officials later decided to shut down the school. The territory is grappling with a huge budget deficit and an unemployment rate of 16 percent. The strike is the latest, most contentious protest against Gov. Luis G. Fortuno, a Republican elected in 2008. Thousands of union members rallied against planned layoffs by the government in a national protest last October.
 As the university system announced budget cuts, students demanded an alternative and a greater transparency for university finances. One point of tension is funding for music, athletics and honors scholarships for students who also have federal grants. 
 ''We understand this is social marginalization and discrimination against the people with less resources,'' said Fernando Espinal, a law school graduate and former president of the student council.
 University officials did not respond to requests for interviews. 
 Many public universities in the United States have faced tuition increases and cuts in funding because of states' financial problems. In March, thousands of students and faculty members protested at the University of California. 
 But the strike in Puerto Rico has continued for weeks and grown increasingly tense, with reports of the police preventing the students from receiving supplies, food and water last weekend.
 The fiscal crisis set up the conditions for the student strike, said Miguel Soto-Class, executive director of the Center for a New Economy, an independent research organization here. 
 ''The University of Puerto Rico is receiving a significant amount less than it has received in the past,'' he said. ''It has forced the administration to undertake some cost-cutting measures that have not been popular with the students and some of the staff.''
 Mr. Fortuno has encouraged both sides to work together to reach a solution, a spokesman said. 
 The governor said in an e-mail interview: ''It is unfortunate that a minuscule group of students, that do not represent the vast majority of university students, have decided to take matters in their own hands and closed the university gates, thus precluding the vast majority of students to continue their studies, the teachers to impart their classes and the researchers to continue their research projects.'' 
 The protesters spend their time reading and using computers with wireless Internet access to spread the word about the strike. They have received support from union leaders, writers and performers, including the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano and the Puerto Rican musician Ricky Martin, who posted a supportive message on Twitter.
 After negotiations between the administration and students fell apart on Thursday, Aura Colon Sola, a member of the university's law school action committee, said she was prepared to continue the strike for several more months. She said she was upset that university officials had sued some student leaders to try to end the strike.
 ''You do not sue students if you really intend to negotiate,'' she said. ''It is ridiculous. They would have to sue the 200 students in here and the thousands that voted in favor of this.''
 Maritza Stanchich, an English professor at the Rio Piedras campus who supports the strike, said many professors viewed the strike as a ''teachable moment'' to show the students how to stand up for themselves.
 ''It has been an enormous disruption,'' she said, ''but it's meant to be that way to force the administration to negotiate.'' 
 Students said the administration tried to end the strike through a court injunction, but public backlash intensified and Mr. Fortuno revoked the court order after three days. This week, the police chief ordered a reduction of the police presence. 
 On Thursday, the mood was calm at the main gate, where about 20 police officers stood guard. A large sign on the fence read ''You may cut all the flowers, but will never eradicate spring.''

HEADLINE: The Man Behind the Euro

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and STEVEN ERLANGER; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Steven Erlanger from Paris. Scott Sayare contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- For the first time in a long life of technocratic excellence, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, finds both his judgment and his credibility in question.
 The crisis of the euro and the panic of the markets have pushed Mr. Trichet, 67, who has run the bank since 2003, into bending the rules, compromising his principles and appearing to give way to political pressure from panicked national leaders. In doing so, he may have saved the euro but lost part of his reputation for probity.
 ''The E.C.B. lost its virginity,'' said Marko Skreb, a former governor of the central bank in Croatia. ''The last couple of days have clearly indicated that we live in a new world.''
 In the last few weeks, as the bank has taken a central role in Europe's debt crisis, Mr. Trichet has reversed himself on buying sovereign bonds from weak euro zone countries; agreed to keep accepting Greek bonds, however downgraded, as loan collateral; and opened himself up to charges that he has weakened the bank's commitment to low inflation. He is being second-guessed from Athens to London and accused of badly misreading the markets. 
 During an interview in his office on the 35th floor of the bank headquarters here, Mr. Trichet, unfailingly courteous and urbane, showed no sign of being rattled by the criticism, though he was aware of it, and aware that his every word was parsed and second-guessed by a small army of analysts, economists and journalists.
 ''When you have the great honor to have enormous responsibility,'' he said, ''you have to accept that all of your decisions can be criticized.''
 The euro's continuing problems -- and the bank's -- were evident again on Thursday, as markets in the United States, Europe and Asia continued to fall because of worries about whether the European debt crisis was really under control. 
 In the early hours of May 10, European leaders cobbled together a nearly $1 trillion deal meant to stun bond investors who, after Greece was driven to the brink of default, were hungrily eyeing attacks on Portugal and even Spain.
 A few days before, on May 6, Mr. Trichet had told reporters that the bank was not even considering buying bonds from the weakest governments of the shaken euro zone. On May 7, markets tumbled.
 But a few hours after the leaders adjourned -- at 3:15 a.m. on May 10, and by all accounts under severe pressure from President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and other European leaders -- Mr. Trichet and the bank board members reversed themselves.
 Mr. Trichet's market-shaking change was controversial enough. But many analysts thought that he had badly misread the markets -- and Europe's politics -- in the first place, and that he and the bank, which controls the euro, were too far behind the curve.
 In Germany, with its historic dread of inflation, the intervention in bond markets was met with something approaching outrage. One member of Parliament called on Mr. Trichet to resign. 
 Axel A. Weber, president of Germany's Bundesbank and a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, distanced himself from the bond purchases in a rare display of internal discord. It was particularly impolite, given Mr. Weber's ambition, supported by Chancellor Angela Merkel, to succeed Mr. Trichet after his term expires in 2011.
 Jurgen von Hagen, an economist at the University of Bonn and seasoned central bank watcher, sounded almost betrayed by Mr. Trichet, who had made controlling inflation his watchword; as governor of the Bank of France in the 1990s, he made his name standing up to free-spending French politicians. 
 ''I think he's been a good president, particularly throughout the financial crisis,'' Mr. von Hagen said before adding, ''What we have seen in the last six weeks is terribly disappointing.''
 Mr. Trichet has plenty of supporters, even among the inflation-wary Germans. Joschka Fischer, a former foreign minister, came to Mr. Trichet's defense, praising him for acting intelligently in a crisis.
 ''We Germans, we love principles,'' he said. ''Principles are fine, but in the moment of crisis even George W. Bush transformed himself into an American Lenin and nearly nationalized banking. 
 ''When the house is on fire, you don't think of principles, but containing the fire. That's the situation we're in now.''
 Whatever the merits of the argument, one thing is clear to outsiders: Mr. Trichet's willingness to bend or break the rules and buy government bonds -- aimed at halting a potentially catastrophic sell-off -- served as final confirmation that the central bank had stepped once and for all beyond its narrow founding mission solely as a bulwark against inflation. 
 The European Central Bank now seems to have been pushed into the much larger role of guardian of financial stability in the 16 countries that belong to the euro area, with implications for all the 27 nations of the European Union. 
 The bank has crossed a Rubicon with the bond purchases, which some economists argue could spur inflation by increasing the money supply. 
 Mr. Trichet and the central bank's board members, who voted by telephone and not unanimously, denied any connection between the bond purchases and the nearly $1 trillion rescue package. But the decisions were less than two hours apart, and they had a reinforcing effect. 
 Mr. Trichet has often had combative relations with political leaders. In 2004, for example, he resisted pressure from Gerhard Schroder, then chancellor of Germany, to cut interest rates and loosen the European Union's limits on government debt.
 Events have vindicated the bank's position then, Mr. Trichet said. The implication is that he expects events to vindicate the most recent decisions as well. 
 Still, the bank's abrupt shift over bonds struck even Mr. Trichet's admirers as disturbingly out of character. To some it seemed that the man who stood up to the former French president, Jacques Chirac, had bowed to pressure from European Union leaders, who had mismanaged their budgets for years and caused the crisis in the first place.
 ''Buying debt on the secondary market was a bad thing to do, and suddenly they do it,'' said Paul De Grauwe, an economist at the University of Leuven in Belgium. ''It's very bad communication.'' 
 Mr. Trichet has said that the Governing Council was always aware that markets might turn their attention from Greece's dire public finances to other euro countries. But he couches the bank's recent actions in the language of the bank's anti-inflation mandate, rather than any attempt to serve as custodian of the European economy. 
 The nonconventional moves, he said, were necessary to ''preserve the bank's ability to have an effective transmission mechanism of its monetary policy and to carry out its prime mandate of holding inflation below 2 percent.''
 ''We have not changed our monetary policy stance,'' he said. He argued that the bank would take deposits to ''sterilize,'' or offset, its purchase of sovereign bonds and thereby eliminate the inflationary effect.
 While conceding that buying government bonds was new for the central bank, Mr. Trichet portrayed the move as consistent with other extraordinary steps the bank had taken since the global financial crisis began building in 2007. 
 In general, he and the bank have been praised for their actions in the first part of the financial crisis to keep banks lending, providing unlimited short-term loans at 1 percent interest to strapped banks and buying covered bonds -- low-risk paper issued by banks and tied to mortgages.
 But with Greece nearing default and the whole euro project at risk, Mr. Trichet's defenders say that it would have been a much bigger mistake for him to stubbornly stick to his previous statements.
 ''Only dumb people never change their minds,'' said Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a former member of the bank's Governing Council. ''It was a change of circumstances which required a different posture. It seems to me it's a dogmatic, if not pedantic, view of things to say that this entails a loss of credibility.''
 Mr. Trichet, an engineer and mathematician by training, graduated near the top of his class at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the elite and demanding school that shapes France's top civil servants.
 Jean-Paul Huchon, a classmate, said of Mr. Trichet: ''He is a man who lives in abstraction, who lives in numbers.''
 ''He thinks that what is rational is automatically understood,'' added Mr. Huchon, who is now president of the regional council of the Ile-de-France, composed mostly of the Paris metropolitan area. That trait has left Mr. Trichet baffled by those who disagree with him on policy matters. 
 Yet Mr. Trichet, who is careful about revealing details of his personal life, is also a lover of poetry. Mr. Huchon said he had seen Mr. Trichet recite long passages of French poetry by heart -- an observation that Mr. Trichet confirmed by reciting several verses from ''Cyrano de Bergerac.'' 
 Mr. Trichet shows another side of his personality, however, when discussing the misbehavior of Greece, which has long lied to its European colleagues about the real state of its economy.
 ''We share a destiny in common,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''Now it's clear in the eyes of all public opinion and governments that this is very serious, and the fact that one particular country behaved very improperly has an impact on the full body, the full college. That is why proper surveillance by peers is so essential.'' 
 He called for stricter financial discipline, backed up by significant sanctions. 
 But as powerful as he is, Mr. Trichet needs the active support and initiative of national leaders to push the countries of the euro zone to impose the self-discipline needed to get through the crisis.
 ''The facts have proved him right,'' said Colette Neuville, a shareholder advocate who is a member of the European Commission's Corporate Governance Forum. But, she added, ''You can't be right all alone. One has the impression that he's arrived at the limit of what he can do with the power he's been given.''

HEADLINE: Economics Is on Agenda For U.S. Meetings in China

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska -- The United States on Thursday dispatched the first of a flotilla of senior officials to China for high-level economic and security meetings that are likely to be overshadowed by the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the deepening debt crisis in Greece, which some fear will infect other European countries.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner are leading a delegation that will include nearly 200 policy makers and advisers, one of the largest groups of American officials ever to travel to a foreign capital for a single set of meetings. 
 On the agenda: trying to balance the economic relationship between China and the United States, breaking down trade and investment barriers, and moving China toward a market-driven exchange rate.
 But despite rising political pressure at home, administration officials said the United States did not plan to make a public show of pressing Beijing to loosen its policy of pegging its currency to the dollar. And it does not expect China to take any action on the currency until at least next month, because Beijing is loath to appear to yield to outside pressure.
 The administration sought to put a good face on Europe's troubles, suggesting that they played into one of the main American themes for the meeting: encouraging the Chinese to increase domestic consumption, so that they do not rely so heavily on exports to either Europe or the United States.
 ''The Greek crisis underlines the U.S. argument about the need for more balanced global growth,'' Mr. Geithner said in an interview. ''It makes the case very strongly because it is about Europe as well as China. It makes our interests in balanced growth even more aligned.''
 The Greek crisis has dragged down the euro, however, which complicates a related American priority: prodding China to loosen its peg, which economists say keeps its currency, the renminbi, at an artificially depressed level. The United States wants China to allow the renminbi to rise closer to market levels, calculating that it would make American goods more competitive.
 The problem is that the renminbi has already risen sharply against the beleaguered euro, making Chinese goods more costly in Europe. And this could make Chinese officials more resistant to taking any steps that would allow their currency to rise against the dollar, analysts say.
 Moreover, if the Greek crisis spreads to Spain, Portugal or other European countries, it could slow Europe's overall economic growth and further dampen demand for Chinese exports.
 The Obama administration delayed filing a report with Congress, scheduled for mid-April, that could have labeled China a country that manipulates its currency. The administration's policy, officials said, is to give Beijing the space it needs to make the decision by itself.
 Chinese officials have signaled privately to American officials that they may begin to loosen their currency policy in advance of a meeting in June of the industrialized and major emerging economies that make up the Group of 20, officials said.
 ''While we don't know when China is going to move, we remain confident that they're going to determine that it's in their interest to move to a more market-determined exchange rate,'' said David Loevinger, the senior coordinator for China affairs at the Treasury Department.
 On her way to Shanghai on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to stop in Tokyo, where she is expected to begin shaping the international response to South Korea's accusation on Thursday that a torpedo fired from a North Korean submarine sank one of its warships, killing 46 sailors.
 Mrs. Clinton did not speak to reporters on the plane, which landed in Alaska for a refueling stop.

HEADLINE: Senate, 59-39, Approves Vast Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday approved a far-reaching financial regulatory bill, putting Congress on the brink of approving a broad expansion of government oversight of the increasingly complex banking system and financial markets. 
 The legislation is intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis, but also reshapes the role of numerous federal agencies and vastly empowers the Federal Reserve in an attempt to predict and contain future debacles. 
 The vote was 59 to 39, with four Republicans joining the Democratic majority in favor of the bill. Two Democrats opposed the measure, saying it was still not tough enough. 
 Democratic Congressional leaders and the Obama administration must now work to combine the Senate measure with a version approved by the House in December, a process that is expected to take several weeks. 
 While there are important differences -- notably a Senate provision that would force big banks to spin off some of their most lucrative derivatives business into separate subsidiaries -- the bills are broadly similar, and it is virtually certain that Congress will adopt the most sweeping regulatory overhaul since the aftermath of the Great Depression. 
 ''It's a choice between learning from the mistakes of the past or letting it happen again,'' the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said after the vote. ''For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it didn't work.'' 
 The bill seeks to curb abusive lending, particularly in the mortgage industry, and to ensure that troubled companies, no matter how big or complex, can be liquidated at no cost to taxpayers. And it would create a ''financial stability oversight council'' to coordinate efforts to identify risks to the financial system. It would also establish new rules on the trading of derivatives and require hedge funds and most other private equity companies to register for regulation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Passage of the bill would be a signature achievement for the White House, nearly on par with the recently enacted health care law. President Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon, declared victory over the financial industry and ''hordes of lobbyists'' that he said had tried to kill the legislation. 
 ''The recession we're emerging from was primarily caused by a lack of responsibility and accountability from Wall Street to Washington,'' Mr. Obama said, adding, ''That's why I made passage of Wall Street reform one of my top priorities as president, so that a crisis like this does not happen again.'' 
 The president also signaled that he would take a strong hand in developing the final bill, which could mean changes to the restrictive derivatives provisions the Senate measure includes and Wall Street opposes. It is also likely that the administration will try to remove an exemption in the House bill that would shield auto dealers from oversight by a new consumer protection agency. Earlier, Mr. Obama had criticized the provision as a ''special loophole'' that would hurt car buyers. 
 As the Senate neared a final vote, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, withdrew an amendment to put a similar exemption for auto dealers into the Senate bill. 
 Mr. Brownback's move had the effect of killing an amendment by Senators Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, and Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, to tighten language barring banks from proprietary trading, or playing the markets with their own money -- a restriction generally known as the Volcker rule for the former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker, who proposed the idea. Congressional Republican leaders, adopting an election-year strategy of opposing initiatives supported by the Obama administration, voiced loud criticism of the legislation while trying to insist that they still wanted tougher policing of Wall Street. 
 But while Republicans criticized the bill in mostly political terms, arguing that it was an example of Democrats' trying to expand the scope of government, some experts have warned that the bill, by focusing too much on the causes of a past crisis, still leaves the financial system vulnerable to a major collapse. 
 The Senate bill, sponsored primarily by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, would seek to curb abusive lending by creating a powerful Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Federal Reserve to oversee nearly all consumer financial products. 
 In response to the huge bailouts in 2008, the bill seeks to ensure that troubled companies, no matter how big or complex, can be liquidated at no cost to taxpayers. It would empower regulators to seize failing companies, break them apart and sell off the assets, potentially wiping out shareholders and creditors. 
 To coordinate efforts to identify risks to the financial system, the bill would create a ''financial stability oversight council'' composed of the Treasury secretary, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the comptroller of the currency, the director of the new consumer financial protection bureau, the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and an independent appointee of the president. 
 The bill would touch virtually every aspect of the financial industry, imposing, for instance, a thicket of rules for the trading of derivatives, the complex instruments at the center of the 2008 crisis. 
 With limited exceptions, derivatives would have to be traded on a public exchange and cleared through a third party. 
 And, under a provision written by Senator Blanche L. Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, some of the biggest banks would be forced to spin off their trading in swaps, the most lucrative part of the derivatives business, into separate subsidiaries, or be denied access to the Fed's emergency lending window. 
 The banks oppose that provision, and the administration has also said that it sees no benefit. 
 Concern about the derivatives provisions also led Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, to vote against the bill, saying it still included a dangerous loophole that would undermine efforts to regulate derivative trades. Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin was the other Democrat to oppose the measure. 
 The four Republicans to support the bill were Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine; Scott Brown, the freshman from Massachusetts; and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who is up for re-election this year. 
 Among the differences between the House and Senate bills is the inclusion in the House measure of a $150 billion fund, to be financed by a fee on big banks, to help pay for liquidation of failing financial companies. 
 The administration opposes the fund, which it says it believes could hamper its ability to deal with a more costly collapse of a financial company. Republicans demanded that a similar $50 billion fund be removed from the Senate bill because they said it would encourage future bailouts of failed financial companies. 
 There are numerous other differences. For instance, the House bill addresses the consumer protection goals by establishing a stand-alone agency that would be subject to annual budget appropriations by Congress. The Senate bill establishes its consumer protection bureau within the Federal Reserve, limiting future Congressional oversight. 
 Lawmakers said that the bills would be reconciled in a formal conference proceeding, possibly televised.

HEADLINE: Calderon Again Assails Arizona Law On Detention

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Felipe Calderon of Mexico escalated his assault Thursday on the Arizona law that allows law enforcement officials to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally, calling it a ''terrible idea.'' He offered the criticism in a particularly privileged forum: before a joint meeting of Congress. 
 Mr. Calderon dedicated much of his 35-minute speech to underscoring the centrality of the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and he drew warm and frequent applause. 
 But he did not shy from the thorniest common issues, including illegal immigration and the tough law that is part of Arizona's response, and the deadly surge in drug-related violence that has spilled at times across the border. To address the latter, Mr. Calderon argued that Congress should reinstate its ban on the sort of assault weapons often used by drug traffickers.
 Briefly taking up the Arizona law, he said that it ''introduces a terrible idea: using racial profiling as a basis for law enforcement.'' He had made a similar point on Wednesday, when he spent much of the day with President Obama, who himself called the law ''misdirected.''
 Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said afterward that it was ''inappropriate for President Calderon to lecture Americans on our own state and federal laws.''
 Mr. Calderon also said that despite immense challenges -- the recent recession, a severe drought and a deadly flu outbreak -- Mexico was doing all it could to keep its people at home. It has managed to create hundreds of thousands of jobs this year, he said, growing more rapidly than its northern neighbor. 
 He also told Congress that Mexico was making extraordinary efforts to confront a wave of drug-fueled crime. ''We have not hesitated to use all the power of the state, including the federal police and the armed forces,'' he said. ''We are hitting them, and we are hitting them hard.'' 
 ''Restoring public security will not be easy and will not be quick,'' Mr. Calderon said, adding that it would take time, money ''and, unfortunately to our deep sorrow, it will take human life.'' 
 But he said that of 75,000 guns and assault weapons seized in Mexico in the past three years, ''more than 80 percent of those we have been able to trace came from the United States.'' 
 Violence in Mexico began to increase in 2006, he said, just two years after the American assault-weapons ban expired. Drug-related killings are estimated to have approached 23,000 since that year. Mr. Calderon's call for a new weapons ban drew some applause, but many lawmakers remained seated. Indeed, in the largely pro-gun Congress, there seemed to be little chance of passing a fresh ban, and the notion raised some Republican ire.

HEADLINE: Obama to Mandate Rules To Raise Fuel Standards

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; John M. Broder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama has decided to use his executive power to order tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, accelerating the fight against climate change without waiting for Congress, administration officials said Thursday.
 Mr. Obama plans to announce on Friday that he is ordering the creation of a new national policy that will result in less pollution from medium- and heavy-duty trucks for the first time and will further reduce exhaust from cars and light-duty trucks beyond the requirements he has already put in place.
 Under rules that were eventually formalized last month, new cars have to meet a combined city and highway fuel economy average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. The administration said the new rules would cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by about 30 percent from 2012 to 2016. 
 The plan Mr. Obama will announce on Friday will order further improvements in fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks made in 2017 and beyond, and in medium and heavy trucks made in 2014 through 2018.
 The initiative comes as the spill in the Gulf of Mexico has underscored the problem with dependence on oil, and officials said the president would cite the problem when he discusses his plan. The order allows Mr. Obama to advance his goals even as Senate Democrats have difficulty trying to pass a comprehensive energy bill that he supports.
 Administration officials confirmed the plan after disclosing it to environmental advocates but insisted on anonymity to avoid upstaging the announcement. In addition to the fuel efficiency and pollution standards, Mr. Obama's directive will order more federal support for the development of new-generation cars like advanced electric vehicles and will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce pollutants from motor vehicles other than greenhouse gases.
 Environmentalists hailed the move. ''President Obama's oil savings proposal will reduce our dependence on oil,'' said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. ''More efficient cars and trucks will help to protect families' budgets as well as America's shores.''
 Medium and heavy trucks represent only 4 percent of all vehicles on American highways but they consume more than 20 percent of on-road transportation fuels, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy organization. Improving the average fuel economy of these trucks by 3.7 miles per gallon would reduce American annual oil consumption by 11 billion gallons in 2030, the group said.
 Building cleaner cars costs money but may ultimately save consumers more through lower gasoline bills. The policy already enacted will add about $1,000 to the cost of an average new car by 2016, but save about $3,000 in fuel over the life of the vehicle, according to government officials.
 The president will be joined Friday by environmental leaders as well as representatives of major automakers and truck manufacturers supporting the new policy, administration officials said. The Transportation Department and the Environmental Protection Agency will jointly develop the policy.
 Manufacturers want a single, national standard set over the long term because it is easier to meet than the patchwork quilt of regulations imposed in the past. 
 Before the president's initial policy a year ago, car and light-truck makers were facing fuel-efficiency standards being developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in response to Congressional legislation, separate greenhouse gas standards being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act and the possibility of separate standards enacted in California and 13 other states.

Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100520
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE PRIVATE COLLECTION OF HENRY DARGER,' through Sept. 19. This revelatory exhibition proposes, unconvincingly, that the self-taught, reclusive eccentric Henry Darger was an art collector. It presents about 40 of the 100 or so collages, drawings and images from magazines and books that he hung on the walls of his one-bedroom apartment. The revelation is in his collages, which look nothing like the big, lurid watercolors he is known for. Roughly cut and pasted and focused mainly on images of young girls, they are weirdly numinous. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100520 
 ASIA SOCIETY MUSEUM: 'PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART,' through June 20. This deftly shaped show, not especially large, spans vast swaths of land and time, from India to Japan and from the first century A.D. almost to the present. Materially it's cornucopian, with all manner of painting and sculpture and a camping store's worth of pilgrim travel gear: rucksacks for sutra scrolls, monastic hiking staffs and fanny-pack shrines, not to mention charts and maps -- some cosmic, some not. The show traces the Buddha's life and the circular path his wandering took between his birth and death in northern India. It also looks at the paths of those who followed him through the centuries and to this day. Some have traveled alone and quietly, others in lively packs. The action in a mural-size pilgrimage painting from 18th-century Nepal looks like a raucous scene from ''The Canterbury Tales'' set in the Kathmandu Valley. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)20100520
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100520
 . BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'AMERICAN HIGH STYLE: FASHIONING A NATIONAL COLLECTION,' through Aug. 1. This thrilling cornucopia celebrates the transfer of the Brooklyn Museum's fabled fashion collection to the very lucky Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is rich in the work of genuine geniuses like Charles James (daringly sculptural evening dresses), Steven Arpad (prescient shoes) and Sally Victor (inventive headgear). Ditto the House of Worth, which essentially invented haute couture in Paris in the 1870s and dressed generations of wealthy American women. Thumbnail sketches introduce several of these women and others in their roles as fashion plates/art patrons. A no-frills installation argues for the objects of the patrons' passion as art. And historic marvels abound, like a black satin twill gown once worn by the aging Queen Victoria, whose build provides a good reality check here. Anorexic she was not. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100520
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL: WHY DESIGN NOW?,' through Jan. 9. The fourth edition of this triennial is the largest yet and the most international in its reach. It's also, hands down, the most ecology-conscious. Design as defined here isn't about how to make the House Beautiful more beautiful, but about how to keep the globe afloat and give all its occupants access to a healthy patch of it. Reduce, reuse, recycle are the imperatives embodied in the work, which includes a hand-cranked grain thresher made from repurposed materials, a light bulb fueled by dirt, and digital images of a new all-green, no-car city to be built in the desert outside Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The architectural projects included are particularly impressive, and if not every idea in the show is strong, many are already generating winds of change. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Cotter)20100520
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY,' through May 30. That any of the nine works in this sweet dream of an exhibition sent over from London could easily be mistaken for works from the Frick's own incomparable collection tells you all you need to know about the quality on display. Rembrandt's ''Girl at a Window'' (1645) is the star of the show. Jean-Antoine Watteau's ''Plaisirs du Bal'' (about 1717) is a poetic, happy-sad vision of privileged indolence. Gerrit Dou's Vermeerish ''Woman Playing a Clavichord'' (1665) is preternaturally lucid. Nicolas Poussin's ''Nurture of Jupiter'' (1636-37), in which the toddler-age future king of the gods suckles a goat while a nymph holds him in her lap in a rocky landscape, is otherworldly. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)20100520
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'HAUNTED: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO/PERFORMANCE,' through Sept. 6. Drawn primarily from the museum's permanent collection, this show haphazardly traces photography, photo appropriation and their offshoots, backtracking six decades to Warhol and Rauschenberg when three would have sufficed. With few exceptions, the displays are liveliest when closest to the present, in film pieces by Douglas Gordon, Tacita Dean and beyond, as well as the work of younger artists who have devised ways to use appropriation, setup and regular photography (together or separately). Among those are Sarah Anne Johnson and Sara VanDerBeek. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20100520
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'GRAPHIC HEROES, MAGIC MONSTERS: JAPANESE PRINTS BY UTAGAWA KUNIYOSHI FROM THE ARTHUR R. MILLER COLLECTION,' through June 13. Today's graphic novelists owe a huge debt of gratitude to Hokusai, Hiroshige and the artist featured in this engrossing show, Utagawa Kuniyoshi. With wonderful formal and technical ingenuity, Kuniyoshi created woodblock prints illustrating tales of martial conflict, high-seas adventure and mythic triumph and sold them in vast quantities to the 19th-century equivalents of manga and anime fans. He also made portraits of courtesans in fashionable clothes; comical montages of anthropomorphized cats and octopuses; and antic, pornographic cartoons. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20100520
 JEWISH MUSEUM: 'MODERN ART, SACRED SPACE: MOTHERWELL, FERBER AND GOTTLIEB,' through Aug. 1. The Millburn, N.J., Conservative synagogue Congregation B'nai Israel is renovating and expanding and has lent some of its art to the Jewish Museum for a small but inspiring exhibition. The synagogue commissioned three large artworks -- Adolph Gottlieb's Torah curtain, Herbert Ferber's exterior sculpture and Robert Motherwell's lobby mural -- for its midcentury Modernist building designed by the architect Percival Goodman. Temporarily installed and amply documented at the museum, they show off the mystical-spiritual side of Abstract Expressionism. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through Aug. 1. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by Xie Zhiliu, a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' continuing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation of one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'SIDE BY SIDE: OBERLIN'S MASTERWORKS AT THE MET,' through Aug. 29. Oberlin College's Allen Memorial Art Museum, now undergoing renovations, has sent 19 of its best paintings and one sculpture to the Met, and they are now hanging in various historically appropriate permanent collection galleries. Follow the map provided by the museum, and you will discover unfamiliar works by Turner, Cezanne, Kirchner, Rothko and others from the Oberlin collection, and you will also revisit many old favorites from the Met's. It makes for a great scavenger hunt. Bring the kids! (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through this fall. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Met's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver, might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICAN WOMAN: FASHIONING A NATIONAL IDENTITY,' through Aug. 15. The latest extravaganza from the Costume Institute is one of the best and most visually exciting in its history. Laden with sumptuous evening wear, the show celebrates the Met's recent absorption of the Brooklyn Museum's costume collection while tracking the growing independence of women from the 1890s to the 1940s through a progression of stereotypes and fashion silhouettes. This limited but effective approach presents Gilded Age heiresses cosseted in House of Worth ball gowns; sportif Gibson Girls; bohemians in exotic capes by Poiret; flappers in short, sparkling chemises; and screen sirens in flowing, unstructured evening dresses. Wonderful hand-painted murals provide a seductive sense of the time. The wealthy and their ideals of feminine beauty predominate, but even so, a half-century of astounding change is encapsulated. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100520
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PICASSO IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' through Aug. 1. This display of nearly every scrap in the Met's stodgy, lopsided Picasso holdings is strongest in the very early work and has some great pictures, including the famed portrait of Gertrude Stein. But the energy drops off as the collection thins out, beginning at exactly the point when the artist turned revolutionary, with Cubism. A concluding salon-style hanging of prints is almost as exhausting to take in as it must have been to install, but it gives a fair idea of why this artist is the awesome and exasperating presence he is. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20100520
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'UNEASY COMMUNION: JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND THE ALTARPIECES OF MEDIEVAL SPAIN,' through May 30. Only about 20 years ago did scholars begin to recognize the extent of Jewish participation in the Spanish visual arts in the two centuries before the nation's expulsion of all Jews in 1492. Ranging from a near mural-scale assemblage of panels depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin by Pere Espalargues to an illuminated manuscript version of ''Guide for the Perplexed'' by the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, this historically illuminating show reveals Jewish contributions to Spanish art and a picture of Jewish life in late medieval Spain. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20100520
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON: THE MODERN CENTURY,' through June 28. Rarely has the phrase ''man of the world'' been more aptly applied than to the protean photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson, the subject of a large and handsome MoMA retrospective. For much of his long career, which began in the 1930s and officially ended three decades before his death in 2004, he was continually on the move, covering the better part of five continents, usually sending his film to various publishers and agencies for developing and editing. Many of his individual pictures are rightfully classics: those taken in the aftermath of World War II in Europe; at Gandhi's funeral; in China on the eve of the revolution. MoMA carefully mixes pictures chronologically, as if to avoid a comparison of Cartier-Bresson's daring in his early work and his later weakness for sentimentality and stereotypes, but the lack of cumulative moral and emotional intensity in the career, and in the show, is evident. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100520
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARINA ABRAMOVIC: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT,' through May 31. The long-building energy wave of performance art hits MoMA with this four-decade survey of work by one of the form's more visible and magnetic figures. And the show's combination of stressed-out bare flesh on film and live bodies, some nude, in the galleries makes pretty radical fare for the museum. The exhibition is part true endurance-test grit, part pure diva hokum. And it comes with a mission: to demonstrate that it is possible to preserve an ephemeral medium through live re-creations of work in a museum setting. The demonstration falls flat, but Ms. Abramovic herself is performing a new piece. It consists of her sitting absolutely still and staring straight ahead in MoMA's atrium for almost the entire time the museum is open during the show's run, an estimated 716 hours and 30 minutes, all told. Visitors are invited to participate by taking a seat across from her and meeting her gaze. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100520
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at MoMA. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it is constantly being reborn. In its current form, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20100520
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PICASSO: 'THEMES AND VARIATIONS,' through Aug. 30. This subtly excellent show brings together about 120 prints from the museum's collection, nimbly accounting for many of the pinnacles of Picasso's crafty exploration of the various print mediums. It also parses numerous themes -- Saltimbanques, wives and mistresses, Cubist nudes, hommages to the old masters, the burly Minotaur -- and includes stunning recent acquisitions. Revealing as much about the printmaking processes as about Picasso's freewheeling involvement with them, it casts a wide net and arranges its catch with penetrating clarity. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100520
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)20100520
 NEW MUSEUM: 'SKIN FRUIT: SELECTIONS FROM THE DAKIS JOANNOU COLLECTION,' through June 6. This exhibition of works from the collection of a New Museum trustee selected and installed by the art star Jeff Koons might conceivably have pulled a rabbit out of its ethically sticky headgear. Instead it teems with usual suspects, and its overcrowding benefits no one, especially the several larger, more admittedly festivalist works that form its high points. This museum has some rethinking to do, and high on the list should be coming to grips with the size and limitations of its often poorly proportioned galleries. Ultimately the air of complicity is less disturbing than the look of complacency. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20100520
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary this year, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20100520
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL DIE: DEATH ACROSS CULTURES,' through Aug. 9. Sooner or later the Grim Reaper will come for each and every one of us. Evenly divided between traditional Tibetan works and Medieval and Early Renaissance pieces from Europe, this fascinating exhibition highlights profound differences in what that means to those two cultures. There are terrific works on both sides, but the West's morbid preoccupation with the perishable body yields the more arresting objects, like the beautifully carved golf-ball-size head of a famous general, half skull and half flesh, carved from ivory by an unknown 18th- or 19th-century Bohemian craftsman. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Johnson)20100520
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100520
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,' through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the sense that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20100520
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: '2010 WHITNEY BIENNIAL,' through May 30. In the spirit of the economically bleak two years it represents, the Whitney has made efforts to underpitch its 2010 Biennial, and the show lives up -- and down -- to its billing. There are fewer artists than in the past. Its installation is spartan. Spectacle is out. Much of what's in is quiet and hermetic to the point of looking blank. The prevailing aesthetic is the art of the tweak, minute variations on conventional forms and historical styles: abstract paintings stitched like quilts, performance pieces channeling the 1960s, and so on. The show feels empty where it reflects the retrenched, art-about-art spirit of the moment. But it also has strong work, particularly in video and photography, that speaks of life beyond the art factory. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20100520
 Galleries: Uptown
 OTTO DIX, through Aug. 30. The first Dix retrospective in this country provides heady glimpses of the achievement of this so-called wild man of German art. Few things escaped his remorseless eye -- from the horrors of World War I to the hypocrisies of the Weimar Republic. He made every stop on the itinerary of German modernism (including Realism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, folk, visionary), had a few Cubist moments and, of course, qualified as degenerate under the Nazis. This exhibition of more than 100 paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings (organized with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) doesn't have the scope -- or the space -- to do Dix justice, but it begins to make up for lost time. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20100520
 'JASPER JOHNS: 'INK ON PLASTIC,' through May 28. The first show surveying Jasper Johns's 48-year use of ink (and sometimes watercolor) on a non-absorptive vellumlike plastic is, not unexpectedly, lovely but disquieting. The combination can defy control, resulting in pooling, mottling and an illusion of wetness that is inherently unstable and hard to read. Familiar Johns motifs -- flag, flagstone, crosshatch, ale can, catenary -- are dark, as if burning or melting. The works emphasize his inherent fatalism but also his factualism: changing materials changes everything. In this case, the materials' family likeness overrides all else -- a little like death. Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street, (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Smith)20100520
 'TANGUY CALDER BETWEEN SURREALISM AND ABSTRACTION,' through June 12. The artworks of two old friends, drinking buddies, Connecticut neighbors and innovators in the gap between Surrealism and abstraction are seen alone, together and in quantity for the first time. The 26 pieces span from 1934 to 1956. Some of Calder's sculptures might almost have walked out of Tanguy's paintings, yet the differences are profound. Calder moves peripatetically and amusingly from one idea to another. Tanguy perfects his lifelong style with increasingly solemnity. A delightful, immersive exercise in mutual illumination.

 'CLAUDE MONET: LATE WORK,' through June 26. The Gagosian, in its kunsthalle mode, has assembled a gorgeous, where-on-earth-did-this-come-from loan show of 27 Giverny paintings dating from 1904 to 1922. The earliest pictures of water lilies are small and diaphanous; later, as Monet's world changed and his eyesight deteriorated, the images grow panoramic and dark. The rose arbor paintings in the show's final gallery, dating from 1924, two years before his death, are compact, dense and incendiary.

 MARK RYDEN: 'THE GAY 90S: OLD TYME ART SHOW,' through June 5. Painting and drawing with the skill of a Beaux-Arts academician, Mr. Ryden creates funny and creepy pictures of big-eyed female waifs in bizarre situations. One of his baby dolls appears in a misty park wearing a pink party dress made of slabs of meat. In a Victorian-era outdoor cafe, Abraham Lincoln, wearing a loud green plaid suit, serves a young femme raw hamburger that he has processed through a meat grinder.

 JOSEF ALBERS/KEN PRICE, through June 5. Pairing a German abstract painter and color theorist, Josef Albers (1888-1976), and a ceramic sculptor, Ken Price (born 1935), is a bit of curatorial genius that can make your eyes feel attached to a bigger, better brain. An intricate dovetailing of works spanning several mediums and decades clarifies their individual greatness. The shared passion for strong color juxtapositions is to be expected. Less so are those for Modern architecture, pre-Columbian pyramids, stones, interior spaces (variously erotic, domestic or symbolic) and an oscillation between biomorphic and straight-edged form. Anyone interested in the curatorial arts should see this thrilling show, among the best and most timely to grace a New York commercial gallery.

 'EMILY DICKINSON'S GARDEN: THE POETRY OF FLOWERS,' through June 13. A collaboration with the Poetry Society of America, this ambitious, multipart exhibition celebrates the great American writer equally as a horticulturalist and as a poet and forges links between the two. Dickinson's 19th-century garden has been re-created in the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory in front of a replicated facade of the home where she spent much of her life. An archival show in the Botanical Garden's library places her gardening in the context of the time. And a continuing program of readings and seminar-style discussions with contemporary writers throws the spotlight on the floral content of Dickinson's poems -- and on her startling contemporary relevance. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, the Bronx (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Cotter)20100520
 CONRAD SHAWCROSS: 'THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (INVERTED),' through July 10. Part sculptor and part inventor, this young British artist has conjured a remarkable rope trick under the 50-foot-high glass ceiling of 590 Madison Avenue's airy atrium. Complicated machinery slowly weaves a rope as thick as your arm from 162 spools of variously colored strands above. At ground level, a big wooden winch pulls it along and dumps it on the floor. Though not exciting as sculpture, Mr. Shawcross's Rube Goldbergian contraption is a compelling metaphor about time and process.

 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE MOURNERS: MEDIEVAL TOMB SCULPTURES FROM THE COURT OF BURGUNDY'; closes on Sunday. They are so cute, these 16-inch-tall fellows in their floppy robes. Shuffling two by two, 36 strong, behind a choirboy on a black runway, they weep, sigh and pray, mourning the demise of their liege. Carved with extraordinary sensitivity from alabaster by Jean de la Huerta and Antoine Le Moiturier, they usually occupy niches beneath the slab on which lies an effigy of the duke and his wife in Musee des Beaux-Arts in Dijon, France. Each is a masterpiece of early Renaissance sculpture. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100520
 'ROBERT & ETHEL SCULL: PORTRAIT OF A COLLECTION'; closes on Thursday. Racing from Abstract Expressionist paintings to Earthworks, this unforgivably crowded exhibition conveys the amazing instinct for the new, the next new and the next new after that that set Robert Scull and his wife, Ethel, on one of the most influential shopping sprees in postwar American art -- until they cashed out with the 1973 Scull auction at Sotheby Parke-Bernet. In tandem with its detailed, must-read catalog, the show counts as ''It's a Wonderful Life'' for the art world. Attempting to rehabilitate the collectors most synonymous with the Swinging '60s, it demonstrates what a difference one or two people can make. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com. (Smith)20100520
 'THE SAME SIGHT SLIGHTER'; closes on Saturday. Titled with a line from ''Tender Buttons,'' Gertrude Stein's inventory of everyday epiphanies, this show assembles small, delicate, unassuming works that pursue what might be called (to paraphrase Clement Greenberg) homeless painterliness beyond the confines of traditional painting. The materials and methods include little magazines, gouged wood, bound cardboard, plastic bags and even a trembling tree branch in flower. The participants are Bianca Beck, Alexandra Bircken, Heather Guertin, Charlotte Posenenske, Clement Rodzielski, Josh Tonsfeldt and B. Wurtz. Despite the ostensible modesty, the resulting cross talk is robust and revealing. Renwick Gallery, 45 Renwick Street, South Village, (212) 609-3535, renwickgallery.com. (Smith)20100520

HEADLINE: A Wish for More Community in Mixed-Income Units

BYLINE: By EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS

 BODY:
Johnnie Braswell moved into Westhaven Park four years ago, after living in the midst of violence and drugs for 43 years in the Harold Ickes public housing complex on the South Side. Ms. Braswell said she felt safer now and liked her modern apartment, but she said she wished the building's condominium owners would socialize more with the public housing residents. 
 ''I believe the homeowners have misconceptions about us,'' said Ms. Braswell, 63. ''We are just people like they are.''
Many residents in the new developments expressed similar views, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Chicago. 
 Ten years into the Chicago Housing Authority's ''Plan for Transformation'' -- the landmark plan to replace thousands of apartments lost in the demolition of blighted high-rise projects with 10 mixed-income developments -- the agency has struggled to meet one of its main goals: creating harmonious communities of lower-income residents and their more affluent neighbors. 
 The study, one of the first to examine how these communities are developing, found that while the physical environment of the low-income residents has improved substantially, those residents have not necessarily benefited from interactions with new neighbors. 
 The plan is an experiment being watched closely by social researchers and officials in other major cities.
 So far, the new developments that have been built around the city provide about 2,935 mixed-income units out of a planned 7,700. Over all, the authority plans to create or rehabilitate 25,000 units. The recession and housing crisis have slowed progress on the program, officials said. They now hope to finish the remaining mixed-income units by 2015.
 Robert Chaskin, a professor at the University of Chicago, and Mark L. Joseph, a professor at Case Western Reserve University, based their study on interviews at three mixed-income developments -- Westhaven Park on the city's West Side, and Oakwood Shores and Park Boulevard on the South Side. (The research was supported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The foundation also provides a grant to the Chicago News Cooperative, but it is not involved in editorial decisions.)
 ''Some of the rhetoric around community-building evokes a kind of Golden Age notion of neighborhood solidarity, which is perhaps misguided,'' Mr. Chaskin said in an interview at the end of April. ''Most people have much more moderate expectations. They are looking for a good place to live with cordial and unproblematic relationships with their neighbors.''
 The developments typically are one-third public housing apartments, one-third affordable units that are subsidized, and one-third condominiums, whose owners pay market prices. Officials said there was still strong demand for the market-rate units, but less financing was available for prospective buyers. The wait list for the housing authority has been closed since 1999, but officials announced this month that they would reopen it for new registration, adding up to 40,000 names.
 Lewis A. Jordan, the chief executive officer of the housing agency, said he was most proud of the way residents were becoming more economically self-sufficient under the program. He said he understood that more needed to be done to bring people together with group activities and youth programs. 
 ''Let me be clear: in creating these new communities, it's not without issues,'' he said. ''We need to continue to help people to better interact with one another.''
 On Thursday, a federal judge ended 23 years of a court-ordered receivership of the C.H.A., which had been imposed because of discriminatory practices. The housing authority and Mayor Richard M. Daley heralded the decision, saying it was proof of the success of the ''Plan for Transformation.'' 
 The study found that the socioeconomic differences among residents are often extreme. Almost all the condo owners interviewed for the study had college degrees and half had household incomes over $70,000. Among the public housing residents, all of whom are African-American, none had completed college and three-fourths earned less than $20,000.
 Upper-income owners were satisfied with the prime locations near downtown, the design of the buildings, and the relatively low prices, the study found. But about half expressed frustration with the behavior of the public housing residents, including noisy parties and the use of the lobby as a gathering place. 
 The condo board at Westhaven voted to remove the furniture from the lobby, but the developer, Brinshore Development, intervened and encouraged residents to negotiate new guidelines.
 Last year, two public housing residents were added to the board as representatives. Antwan Dobson, the president of the condo association, said learning to live together was ''a huge adjustment,'' but added that it was getting easier. ''The biggest thing I would tell someone is to come in with your eyes wide open,'' he said. ''This is different.''
 Mr. Dobson, 35, a Chicago firefighter, grew up near the Henry Horner Homes, which once dominated the West Side neighborhood. He bought his condo in Westhaven for more than $300,000 in 2006. He and his wife have a view of the skyline. 
 He said he moved in partly because he wanted to contribute to the area's revitalization. ''I thought it would be a good opportunity to be somewhere where I was raised and to see a change for the better,'' he said. 
 Angelene Johnson, 56, who lived in the Henry Horner Homes for almost 20 years, is one of the low-income representatives on the board. Residents are cordial to each other at Westhaven Park, she said, but they do not socialize very often. She helped organize a mosaic project on a small wall in the neighborhood with designs by the residents and is planning a communal garden, she said. ''We are trying to get more of the condo owners to come out and participate,'' Ms. Johnson said. 
 At Oakwood Shores, a mixed-income development on the South Side near Lake Michigan, the developers are trying to create ways for residents to meet.
 ''These opportunities to bring the community together must be more subtle than overt,'' said Joseph Williams, a co-chairman of the Granite Companies, the developer of Oakwood's for-sale units. ''You don't get it from calling meetings.'' 
 The two researchers also reported that many lower-income residents felt stigmatized and socially isolated in the new developments and that they felt more stressed over higher bills and tougher rules from property managers and condo associations. But some of them ''appear to be thriving in the new environment and determined to use it as a stepping stone,'' the study said. Mr. Williams pointed to eight former public housing residents who have bought homes at Oakwood Shores as a sign that the plan was working.
 Velma Parker said she felt at home at Oakwood Shores. She moved into a rental about a year ago with her 6-year-old granddaughter after living in the Ida B. Wells housing project for 27 years. Her granddaughter has access to a computer lab, and has improved academically, she said.
 Ms. Parker, 51, said she thought the residents could learn from each other. 
 ''It's a beautiful community,'' she said. ''I never thought I would move back down here. But since I've been back, I wouldn't trade it.''

HEADLINE: In Blue Island Office, Seeing Recession's Toll

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
If south suburban Blue Island long ago was a geological mix of boulders and other debris dropped by a glacier, the Illinois Department of Human Services office there now is a moraine of human travail deposited by the recession.
 A parking lot the size of a football field was jammed Tuesday, and caseworkers laughed about my three-minute search for a space. This was a slow day, they informed me; show up on the first of the month, when various benefits are due, and you would think the Rolling Stones were in town. Lines form outside shortly after sunrise.
By 10 a.m., about 150 people of diverse economic strata were applying for, or seeking urgent counsel about, welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid and disability payments, among other matters. They were in financial, social, mental and physical distress, and this office -- whose budget-stressed staff deals with 81,000 cases in a suburban area up to the Will County border -- is a lifeline. 
 ''I'm way behind on my bills and need assistance,'' said Michael Clark, 55, who lost his trucking job, had a heart attack and has exhausted unemployment compensation. He's married, has a daughter and sought advice on alternatives.
 Diane White, 41, was taking care of a jobless husband on disability. ''He needs a medical card,'' she told me, referring to a Medicaid card, so that he can see a doctor.
 I was shown around the work space by Janet Hampton, the office administrator who, like many of her colleagues, exudes remarkable equanimity. They deal daily with those in extremis, often forced to say ''no'' due to strict eligibility rules, especially when it comes to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, a conduit for the welfare-to-work law passed in 1996.
 Statewide, unemployment is up, and food-stamp usage is stratospheric. More than 712,000 families, or 1.6 million individuals, are on food stamps, prompting Illinois to stagger its monthly allocation to ease the inventory burden on grocery stores. For those who chide a profligate federal government, be informed that welfare brings just $318 a month to a single mother with two kids, with food stamps providing another $257.
 The 1996 law dramatically toughened welfare eligibility standards and spawned an administrative culture prone to reject applicants. Nationally, the caseload fell to 1.7 million in 2009 from 4.8 million right before the Clinton-era measure passed. In Illinois, the welfare rolls fell to 26,377 in March 2009 from about 240,000. They have now risen to about 31,000.
 That's still a smaller increase than one would figure, since there are so few jobs, but some states' caseloads are stagnant, even improbably declining. Regardless, the burden placed on human services infrastructures amid state cuts is torturous. 
 This Blue Island office has a staff of 123, down from 230 a few years ago, though the caseload for welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid is up 30,000 in the same period. That means caseworkers like Danny Smith, Dawn Stewart and Carolyn Nance are inundated, with some workers overseeing between 1,500 and 2,000 individual cases.
 Handling the demand appears a Sisyphean task and, stereotypes aside, some workers show up well before doors open at 8:30 a.m. and stay past 8 p.m. Sometimes it's to help those still waiting when doors close for the day. Perhaps it's finally getting to clogged voice mail and ample paperwork. 
 The office's phone system is so antiquated that during peak periods, like the start of a month, it routinely breaks down. 
 ''I can't even call 911,'' Mrs. Hampton said. And since so much is not computerized, there are more boxes than in an Allied Van Lines warehouse -- filled with pending applications for benefits, and turning conference rooms into storage bins.
 Then there's the daily interaction with people who are just like any of us could be -- with grown men who, scared of losing their homes and not being able to feed their kids, break down in tears.
 ''I tell people not to be ashamed,'' Mr. Smith said.
 Ms. Nance added: ''You're a social worker, counselor, mother, father -- one-stop shopping. But it is overwhelming.''
 I exited after a primer on welfare-to-work rules from welfare caseworkers pained by an obligation to reject so many. As I drove past the restaurant next door -- called Beggars Pizza, would you believe -- I wondered how so many can suffer so much so quietly. Rage seems so private and isolated. 
 And, like anybody, I wondered where the folks in that waiting room will all wind up.

HEADLINE: The Challenge of Capturing Carbon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Bad Bet on Carbon'' by Robert Bryce (Op-Ed, May 13):
 The assertions made about carbon capture and storage do not acknowledge the reality of the situation.
 Many scientists -- including the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- have determined that carbon capture and storage, or C.C.S., can significantly contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. 
 Additionally, the Department of Energy documents more than 3.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide storage potential in the United States and Canada alone.
 Moreover, decades of operational experience from C.C.S. projects and underground carbon dioxide injection (about 53 million tons a year) for enhanced oil recovery indicate that carbon dioxide can be stored safely and effectively.
 C.C.S. is not without challenges, but President Obama, Congress and industry have committed billions of dollars to address advances in C.C.S. The Energy Department's Office of Fossil Energy is pursuing a vigorous program to have C.C.S. in place for commercial deployment in the next decade, and substantial progress is being made in state-of-the-art technology options that can dramatically reduce the cost of carbon dioxide capture and improve power plant efficiency.
 All these efforts are based on a fact we can't ignore: Since the world will continue to rely on fossil fuels for most of its energy in coming decades, C.C.S. must be part of our energy strategy.
 James Markowsky Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Department of Energy Washington, May 17, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Robert Bryce raises some valid points about the challenges of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants, but his pessimism about the odds of success is unwarranted.
 Every major new technology goes through a rigorous research, development and demonstration period to refine it and work out the kinks. Utilities are conducting demonstrations to do just that, with a goal, among others, to improve the efficiency of carbon capture and storage technologies. Mr. Bryce suggests that success is a long shot. Research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the National Energy Technology Laboratory and others suggests otherwise.
 And yes, we'll need to build additional pipeline capacity to carry compressed carbon dioxide to storage locations when it can't be stored at the site of capture. Siting any major infrastructure, whether a wind turbine, pipeline or transmission line, takes time, but it is by no means an insurmountable obstacle.
 Mr. Bryce's final concern involves the amount of underground storage space that will be necessary to hold the captured carbon dioxide. Fortunately, most scientists believe that we have more than adequate capacity in North America to store the emissions from our roughly 200 to 300 years of coal reserves.
 Karen R. Obenshain Director, Fuels, Technology and Commercial Policy Edison Electric Institute Washington, May 13, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Robert Bryce's opposition to financing carbon sequestration development is right on point. Tax dollars should be devoted exclusively to financing research and development on clean energy. If ''clean coal,'' including sequestration, is a sound approach, the mining and fossil fuel industries should be able to finance their own research and development after more than a century of support from us taxpayers.
 Renewables as far as possible and closed-cycle nuclear need our help until they are on a pay-as-you-go basis.
 We need a new leader of the Department of Energy whose head is not turned from scientific and economic fact by political expediency. We have Congress for that.
 Avrom Handleman Indianapolis, May 14, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Robert Bryce outlines three compelling reasons (there are more) carbon capture and storage is a poor strategy for carbon reduction. His argument is solid and spot on. I would, however, respectfully disagree with one of his conclusions.
 He states that unlike natural gas, ''carbon dioxide is a worthless waste product.'' Because all fuel begins with carbon dioxide, Mr. Bryce and your readers should be aware that a number of companies, including Carbon Sciences, are developing breakthrough technologies to transform this greenhouse gas into valuable, marketable and useful liquid portable fuels. This addresses both the climate and energy challenges facing the world.
 The problem with C.C.S. is not the C.C. (carbon capture), but the S. (storage). C.C.R., on the other hand (carbon capture and recycling), is a terrific bet on carbon.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''While the Senate Fiddles'' (editorial, May 14):
 Like many well-intentioned environmental groups, The Times is of the opinion that the Kerry-Lieberman bill, though far from perfect, will ''point the country in the right direction.'' Unfortunately, the authors of this legislation were working with a broken compass. By allowing polluters to buy carbon offsets, we will delay by decades America's conversion to clean energy.
 Such offsets in most instances produce no reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. If you pay a landowner not to harvest the trees on his property, demand for lumber does not go down. Those trees are chopped down somewhere else.
 A simple, steadily increasing fee on carbon is the best way to make clean energy competitive with fossil fuels within the next decade. Returning all the revenue to households -- which the American Power Act does not do -- would shield families from the impact of rising energy costs.
 It's been said that solving the climate crisis will be a marathon, and we need to start running now. But let's not tie our shoelaces together at the starting line.

HEADLINE: First Trip Abroad Takes British Leader to Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
PARIS -- With a dinner in Paris and a journey to Berlin, Britain's new prime minister, David Cameron, head of a party known for its aversion to closer European integration, planned Thursday to devote his first overseas trip since coming to power last week to smoothing ties with continental Europe.
 The meetings with Continent's most influential leaders -- President Nicolas Sarkozy of France on Thursday and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday -- reflected Britain's sometimes awkward balancing act between its vaunted ''special relationship'' with the United States and its close economic, geographic and cultural ties to other members of the European Union. 
 Britain's new foreign secretary, William Hague, made his first journey abroad since taking office last week by visiting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. President Obama has invited Mr. Cameron to the White House in June.
 British officials described Mr. Cameron's foray into continental Europe as exploratory, important to set the tone of personal relationships that dictate a good part of the dynamics of intra-European politics.
 ''I think there is a big agenda that the prime minister is keen to discuss with the president of France and the German chancellor about taking Europe forward,'' said David Lidington, Britain's new minister for Europe.
 ''Our view is that we need to see Europe focusing much more on getting people back into work, improving the single market through greater liberalization, making other initiatives on international trade because that helps prosperity both in Europe and in the wider world, and in addressing major problems like climate change and nuclear proliferation.''
 Mr. Cameron's Conservative party has traditionally been regarded as euroskeptic, particularly when it comes to a vocal right wing that successive party leaders have sought to appease by maintaining their distance from Europe. But, unlike any government in Britain since 1945, the current administration in London is a coalition grouping the Conservatives with the much smaller Liberal Democrats, who have been much more friendly toward Europe.
 In negotiations to set up the coalition, the Conservatives softened plans to claw back political powers that previous administrations have ceded to Europe, while the Liberal Democrats agreed a five-year moratorium on any attempt to join the troubled European currency, the euro.
 The presence of the Liberal Democrats has been welcomed by European leaders, casting it as a restraint on more hard-line Conservative policies on Europe, such as Mr. Cameron's decision in opposition to withdraw the party's members of the European Parliament from the mainstream center-right alliance and aligning them with a more euroskeptic grouping.
 Soon after taking power last week, Mr. Cameron made a placatory phone call to Mrs. Merkel, who had snubbed him earlier in the year during a visit to London in April, and then called Mr. Sarkozy, who visited with Mr. Cameron in March, well before the May 6 election.
 All three leaders are from the European center-right mainstream, but their lands have sharp differences on issues such as the regulation of hedge funds which British authorities believe could harm business in London, Europe's biggest financial center. Earlier this week, France and Germany backed tighter European controls on hedge funds over British objections, and German regulators announced measures including a ban on a form of speculation known as naked short selling of euro zone government bonds.
 The French and German leaders are also likely to seek Mr. Cameron's support on issues such as the regulation and taxation of financial markets before the summit meeting of the Group of 20 in Toronto next month. 
 Additionally, news reports said, they might press Britain to back the nearly $1 trillion safety net for the euro zone's weaker members being set up by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The euro zone is Britain's biggest trading partner.
 But, before he left for France and Germany, Mr. Cameron insisted on Thursday that Britain would not support closer pan-European economic governance. ''We don't believe there should be further transfer of power in that way,'' he said. In a joint agreement with Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, Mr. Cameron said Britain would call a referendum on any new effort by the European Union to expand its influence in member states.
 French officials have insisted that they over not overly concerned about the Conservatives' historical euroskepticism. 
 ''If Cameron wins, he will do like the others,'' President Sarkozy was quoted in news reports as saying before the British election, ''he will start off anti-European and finish up pro-European. That's the rule.''

HEADLINE: Bridging the Gap: Considering Factors That Shape Generations

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Reflecting on defining experiences and how they both reflect and mold generational attitudes and identities. 

 BODY:
Overview | What events and trends both reflect and shape each generation? In this lesson, students compare their generation with one or more older generations and the reasons for differences between them. They generate defining events they have experienced and consider how those events have shaped who they are - and will become. They then interview a member of another generation about his or her own defining experiences. 
Materials | Copies of handouts, music player and music from the 1980s and '90s (optional), student journals and computer(s) with Internet access (optional).
Warm-Up | Give each student a copy of the "Back in the Day & Today" handout (PDF) to complete as best they can in 10 minutes. (You might substitute, or augment, this activity by having students write, using the prompts of our related Student Opinion question, "What Do Older Generations Misunderstand About Yours?")
Remind them that they can substitute for parent(s) any person they know well in an older generation. If you don't mind sharing a bit of personal information, complete the handout about your own parents to help extend the conversation to follow. 
It may be fun to play music from the '80s or '90s as everyone completes the handout. If you opted to play music, begin the discussion by asking if what you played is what students, their parents or both like. Ask students to talk about music styles or groups they and their parents agree on, and at some point, mention that a study showed that the Beatles is one group that ranks as a top favorite musical act in all listener groups from ages 16 to 64. 
Move on to a discussion of the completed handouts. As the students share their ideas, jot on the board a list of the issues that arise, like parenting strictness and safety concerns, taste in entertainment, expectations about manners, communication and media habits (including how often parents expect their children to call home), politics, values, religious practices, spending on items like clothes or technological devices and so on. Consider weighing in on topics as a member of an older generation and/or with your answers about your parents' or grandparents' generation.
As students look at the completed list and reflect on everything they've heard and shared, have them speculate on some of the defining moments, events, movements or trends at the heart of their parents' values or attitudes. 
Tell them that they will now read an Op-Ed column about how crime in the '60s and '70s continues to affect how the children who grew up then tend to parent their own children today.
Related | In "Children of the '70s," the Op-Ed columnist David Brooks notes:
We're familiar with talk about how Vietnam permanently shaped the baby boomers. But if you grew up in or near an American city in the 1970s, you grew up with crime (and divorce), and this disorder was bound to leave a permanent mark. It was bound to shape the people, now in their 40s and early 50s, reaching the pinnacles of power. 
It has clearly influenced parenting. The people who grew up afraid to go in parks at night now supervise their own children with fanatical attention, even though crime rates have plummeted. It's as if they're responding to the sense of menace they felt while young, not the actual conditions of today.
Read the entire column with your students, using the following questions:
. 

        
What incidents took place on West 84th Street, and how did the city leaders try to deal with the situation?
        
How has the crime rate in New York City changed since the '70s? The '90s? Do you know how the crime rate has changed in your town since the 1970s?
        
What did the crime wave have to do with the hippies in the '70s?
        
What other attitudes does Brooks say were destroyed by the crime wave?
        
Do your own parents have enduring attitudes toward parts of town, stretches of highway, business establishments or activities that were forged in their youth and that affect what you are and are not allowed to do?
Activity Explain to students that they will now consider the events, cultural trends and other elements that both shape and reflect their own generation's identity, attitudes and values. 
Start by having small groups work together to list all the memorable moments that have occurred in their lifetimes. You might start them off with our handout about the first decade of the 2000s (PDF) or our related fill-in and/or student crossword to jump-start their thinking about the past 10 years of their lives. They might also look at the reader-submitted Times photo feature "Documenting the Decade." (For more in this vein, see our lesson "From '00 to '10: Defining the Decade.") 
Encourage them to include events having to do with American politics, world events, economics, culture and entertainment (including music, film, television, advertising), technology, journalism and media or anything else. 
Also have them include any local events or situations that, though not necessarily watershed moments for their whole generation, affected (or affect) their outlooks, attitudes and what their parents will or will not allow them to do.
When their lists are assembled, ask students to talk about generational attitudes toward issues like immigration, the environment, health care, women's issues, same-sex marriage,religion and freedom of expression. 
Do they believe their own attitudes tend to reflect those of their generation over all? Why or why not? What might account for differences? 
Have students compare and contrast their generation's attitudes with those of their parents, perhaps looking again at their completed "Back in the Day and Today" handouts. As a whole group, have students discuss the generational differences they believe exist and speculate about reasons for those differences. 
End by inviting predictions about how the attitudes and values they have today will shape who they are in 2030 and how they will parent their own children. 
Going further | Students interview at least one person of a generation different from their own. They should begin by sharing the defining moments and situations they have already identified in class, bringing with them to the interview all the notes and the handout(s) from this lesson. 
Encourage students to let their interview subjects talk about these moments - what would they add or remove from the list? - before discussing whether the event affected younger and older people the same way. Do people in different age groups interpret the same information in different ways? What does the interview subject see as the biggest differences and similarities among the two generations?
Encourage students to prepare for their interviews by researching the period in which their subjects were teenagers. If their subject is a member of Generation X, for example, they might look at moments like the Persian Gulf war, Bill Clinton's "Rock the Vote" appearances on MTV and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the O.J. Simpson trial, grunge music and the sartorial style it spawned , the Challenger explosion, the AIDS epidemic and the fall of the Berlin Wall. What values and worldview emerged in those who grew up in the '80s? 
Students who interview baby boomers might research people like John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and events like the Vietnam War, as well as the social and cultural impact of Beatlemania, Woodstock, the Kent State shootings, the Pill, the Watergate scandal and disco. 
Have students ask their subjects about defining moments for themselves and their generation - and how each event defined their group's larger identity. Have students share their ideas about their own generation and its identity. To end the interview, they should ask what advice or insights the subject has for young people today.
Students write their interviews in the form of newspaper articles they can submit to their school's newspaper or Web site, or on audio or videotape; podcasts or videos can be posted to your school's Web site or to SchoolTube. 
In a future class, have students share key moments and insights from their interviews, and then discuss ways to bridge the generation gap and find common ground.

HEADLINE: Be Wary of the Rush to Gold

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
Most of us have seen advertisements to buy gold or offering cash for gold. With the economy still unsettled and gold prices steadily rising, you may be tempted.
 But not all gold investments are safe.
 On Tuesday, Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, attacked one company that is a gold and precious metals dealer, Goldline International Inc. He accused the company of ''shady practices,'' alleging that it overcharges for collector coins and provides misleading financial advice to consumers. ''They're exploiting the economy that we're in,'' he said.
 Mr. Weiner also spoke of the company's ''unholy alliance'' with television and radio personalities like Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and Republican presidential candidate; and Fred Thompson, a former Senator from Tennessee and TV actor. But he particularly singled out Glenn Beck, the conservative talk show host. 
 ''It's debatable whether gold is a good investment,'' Mr. Weiner said at a news conference in front of the Mercantile Exchange building in lower Manhattan. ''There's a confluence between a declining economy and the ignorance many consumers have about how the marketplace works.''
 But is Goldline the bad guy here? 
 The Better Business Bureau, which has given Goldline an A+ rating, said Tuesday that it was standing by that. A representative of the bureau said it had recently re-reviewed Goldline in response to Mr. Weiner's accusations and saw no reason for a change. ''It's a company with not that many complaints,'' said Gary Almond, from the bureau. When compared with other companies that sell gold, ''there was a remarkable difference in how each one addressed complaints,'' noting that some of those other companies had F ratings.
 Goldline itself disputed Mr. Weiner's allegations. In an interview, Mark Albarian, the president and chief executive of Goldline, said that the figures that Mr. Weiner gave out -- that the average markup for a Goldline coin was 90 percent above the melt value of the coin -- were inaccurate. He said the company's markup on coins ranged from 5 percent for bullion coins to a maximum of 54 percent for rare or historic coins.
 ''We don't guarantee that people can make a profit,'' Mr. Albarian said, adding that buyers are encouraged to hold on to the coins for at least three to five years before trying to resell.
 A report distributed by Mr. Weiner on Tuesday also claimed that Goldline's salespeople misrepresented their ability to give ''investment advice'' since they are not certified financial advisers. ''We don't have a fiduciary duty,'' Mr. Albarian said in response. ''Our reps are not trained to give investment advice.''
 But Mr. Weiner spent some time at his news conference criticizing ''public programs to advocate for gold followed by advertisements for gold.'' That was a reference to Mr. Beck, who is a proponent of buying gold. Goldline is also an advertiser on Mr. Beck's television show.
 The issue has been raised in the past, and the company has said that Mr. Beck reads advertisements for Goldline on his radio show but is not a paid spokesman. Christopher Balfe, the president and chief operating officer of Mercury Radio Arts, Mr. Beck's production company, said: ''Glenn used Goldline before they became a radio sponsor and as his listeners know he only does live radio reads for companies he uses and trusts.''
 Mr. Thompson issued this statement in response to a request for comment.''The runaway spending policies of Congressman Weiner and his international soul mates drive up gold prices and he blames talk radio? Apparently, those correspondence courses in economics are letting him down again. Frankly, I am outraged that he thinks me so crass as to use every opportunity to pitch a product ... and by the way, my new book,''Teaching the Pig to Dance'' is in bookstores today, or from my Web site: teachingthepigtodance.com.''So what's a gold consumer do to?
 John Breyault, vice president of public policy at the National Consumers League, offered three consumer tips at Tuesday's news conference:
 Guaranteed profits are an illusion.Go to the Internet and read up on gold buying.Get unbiased financial advice.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What the Overhaul Means To Your Pocketbook

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
For consumers trying to figure out what the financial overhaul bill means for them, the legislation the Senate passed Thursday offers some tantalizing possibilities.
 Merchants might offer more discounts to people who pay cash. You could get a free credit score every time a lender or landlord penalizes you with a high interest rate or rejects your application because your score is not up to snuff. Many mortgage prepayment penalties would go away. And there will be a consumer financial protection agency, despite many efforts to kill it off. 
 But some of the measures that could have the most impact on consumers are not in the House version of the bill that passed in December. So we will not know which new rules will exist in what form until the two sides haggle in conference and produce a final bill.
 One last-minute Senate addition would lower the fees that merchants pay to process many debit card transactions. If banks lose revenue as a result, they could make up for it by adding fees to checking accounts or cutting back on rewards programs. Retailers say that once card costs fall, they will hire more workers and hold the line on prices. There is a fair bit of disagreement about who has the better argument. 
 It will not be clear until there is a final bill -- and perhaps not for years afterward -- how much money the measures will put in your pocket or whether they will keep it from being picked. But the basic outlines are clear, so here are the areas to watch as a final bill emerges.
 DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS The Senate bill contains an amendment with provisions that could affect how you use your credit card. You have probably encountered those irritating handwritten signs that forbid card use unless you're spending more than $10 or so, even though stores are generally not supposed to do this. The bill would allow such minimums, as long as stores were not setting minimums for, say, Bank of America's credit card but not Chase's. Merchants would also not be allowed to set different credit card spending minimums for, say, a Visa and MasterCard. 
 However, stores would be able to offer discounts based on what card a customer was using. So someone with an American Express card, which often costs the merchant more than other cards, might pay the full sticker price of an item that costs $100, while Visa and MasterCard holders could get a $1 discount.
 The bill specifies that cash discounts are acceptable, as are lower prices for people who use debit cards. The stores could not, however, charge one price for Visa debit cards from one bank and another for Visa debit cards from a different bank. 
 Why does the bill include this provision? Because it also orders the Federal Reserve to set rules that would lead to lower fees for merchants who accept debit cards. A crucial part of this provision is the fact that merchants would pay those lower fees only to banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Smaller community banks and credit unions would still get the same amount of merchant fee income that they are getting now. That might have led a merchant to accept the less-costly Visa cards while turning away the more expensive ones (or setting minimum purchase amounts for the pricier ones).
 You would think that small banks would like having a revenue advantage. They don't think a two-tier fee system can last, though, and figure that big banks, which produce a large portion of the revenue for Visa and MasterCard, would pressure the two companies into lowering the fees that the small banks would collect as well. So they are lining up with the big banks to oppose the bill and keep the fees intact. 
 Dan O'Malley, the chief executive of PerkStreet Financial, is trying to build an online banking service around giving customers rewards for using their debit cards. Those merchant fees finance his perks, and if those fees fall, he's got problems. Most banks would have their own challenges if they were to lose out on a big chunk of fee revenue.
 ''It becomes a gamble,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''Monthly checking account fees will come back. And maybe retail prices will come down, but nobody knows.''
 Indeed, the merchants who have been pushing for lower fees for years argue that the reduction would benefit consumers, since they would then pay lower prices. 
 Somehow I doubt that merchants would throw a parade and immediately cut all prices by half a percentage point on every item on the day this bill goes into effect, if it comes to pass. Maybe prices won't go up as much as they might have otherwise. But it will be hard for merchants to point to the vague idea of less-steep increases and satisfy angry customers who may suddenly be paying $10 a month for a checking account or earning half as many debit card rewards because their bank can't afford to be as generous anymore.
 ''This is an incredible con job,'' MasterCard's general counsel, Noah J. Hanft, said. ''Under the guise of helping small business, this is just a shrewd and cynical effort that ultimately harms consumers.''
 That is the case he will make to the Congressional panel that will reconcile the two bills. The provisions are not in the House bill, and it's not clear if House members will be willing to accept any of them.
 MORTGAGES The Senate bill outlines three new changes, many of which echo the House bill.
 First, mortgage lenders would face restrictions on when they can charge borrowers a penalty for paying off their loan before the term of the mortgage is up. They wouldn't be able to charge prepayment penalties at all for mortgages that have balloon payments or for those that allow people to make payments so low that the mortgage balance rises instead of falls (so-called negative amortization loans), among others. For more standard plain-vanilla mortgages, prepayment penalties would be allowed only in the first three years.
 Second, the bill forbids anyone who sets up mortgages for customers from accepting compensation that would vary depending on the loan type. This is intended to protect consumers from some of the shenanigans that went on several years ago, when banks paid mortgage brokers extra for putting customers in loans with high fees and terrible terms.
 Finally, the bill requires banks to consider applicants' income, assets and credit history before making a loan. How quaint, right? It would be funny if it weren't so pathetic.
 CREDIT SCORES In an issue that is not addressed in the House bill, the Senate bill, through an amendment, requires anyone who uses a credit score as a reason for taking an adverse action against a consumer to give the score to that person free. So if you don't get the best mortgage, credit card or auto loan interest rate, the lowest insurance premium or the apartment you wanted, you would be able to see the grade that hurt you. Normally, this can cost you about $15. 
 Lenders or landlords will have to give you the score they used, which will usually be a FICO credit score. I had hoped that Congress would give consumers free credit scores every year to go along with the three free credit reports they can get, but it didn't happen. 
 BROKERS AND FIDUCIARY DUTY Senators had no luck inserting an amendment into their bill that would require brokers to act in clients' best interests. Currently, many of these professionals need only to recommend investments that are suitable. The House bill includes the ''best interests'' requirement, and if it prevails, many more stockbrokers -- and insurance sales representatives pushing certain kinds of expensive annuities -- would have to meet a higher standard.
 The House's so-called fiduciary standard has been the subject of debate for a long time, and theinsurance industry will fight fiercely in the negotiations to keep it from becoming law. 
 NEW CONSUMER AGENCY Both bills call for the creation of a consumer protection agency. The agency would oversee many consumer loans and work to make the products more transparent.
 It's hard to predict exactly how much power the agency will ultimately have and how aggressive it will be as it tries to set new rules. At the very least, it will give consumers someplace else to go when things go awry.
 Lest we forget, the whole point of this bill is to prevent something like what went on in the latter half of the last decade from ever happening again. Perhaps the new cops on the beat will sound the alarms sooner when we inevitably go off the rails again in the years to come.

HEADLINE: Markets Close Higher After an Early Decline

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Contributing reporting were Graham Bowley, Mark McDonald, Sewell Chan and Eric Dash.

 BODY:
What began as another losing day for the stock market on Friday ended instead with a gain, a welcome close to a tumultuous week during which the Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 400 points. 
 The mood on Wall Street was hardly euphoric, however. Even as the stock market recovered from an early slide that briefly pushed the Dow below 10,000, crucial parts of the credit markets remained under stress. Worries about the health of the global economy -- particularly the possible effect of Europe's financial crisis on the American economy -- continued to weigh on investor confidence, suggesting that Friday's gains might prove fleeting. 
 But for a day, at least, greed again trumped fear in the stock market. Investors swooped in to buy after a decline that, only a day before, had pushed the market into what is known as a correction, which is typically characterized as a 10 percent decline in a short period of time. 
 ''It was an encouraging close,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's. ''The damage, however, was done,'' he wrote in a research note.
 At the close on Friday, the Dow index was 125.38 points, or 1.25 percent, higher at 10,193.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,087.69, and the Nasdaq was 25.03 points or 1.14 percent higher at 2,229.04.
 But for the week, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 index were down more than 4 percent, while Nasdaq was 5 percent lower.
 The volatility that has characterized the markets in recent weeks continued, adding to investors' anxiety. 
 ''Definitely people think we are not out of the woods yet,'' said Justin Golden, a senior strategist for Macro Risk Advisors. Many institutional investors were awaiting more news from Europe about how governments there would handle the debt crisis in Greece. 
 Financial shares led the market higher after the Senate approved a far-reaching financial regulatory bill on Thursday. While the bill, if signed into law, would hurt banks' profitability, the step nonetheless removed some of the uncertainty hanging over the industry. Some analysts also said the measure was less rigorous than many had feared. 
 Citigroup rose 12 cents to close at $3.75. Bank of America gained 69 cents to $15.99. 
 William T. Fitzpatrick, equities analyst for Optique Capital Management, said the financial industry was rebounding after a severe sell-off and there was more certainty in the market after the Senate vote on Thursday.
 ''We are getting closer to some closure,'' he said. 
 Jim Eckenrode, a banking analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services consulting firm, said the banking industry as a whole was also stabilizing, adding to investors' confidence. 
 ''We are seeing generally better financial performance,'' Mr. Eckenrode said, adding that the ''tide has turned'' in terms of credit delinquencies and that reserves for loan losses had gone back down.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 7/32, to 102 7/32. The yield rose to 3.24 percent from 3.21 percent late on Thursday.

HEADLINE: City of Tears

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Sometime Saturday, the lifeless body of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, 7, will be lowered into a grave in Detroit, and that beleaguered city will shed yet more sorrow into its ever-expanding pool of tears. 
 The circumstances surrounding Aiyana's death represent a tragedy within a tragedy, much like the story of the city itself.
 Aiyana was asleep on a sofa when police raided her home. They were looking for a man suspected of shooting and killing a 17-year-old boy. A shot was fired. The bullet tore through the little girl's head and neck. Sadly, she could not be saved.
 Little Aiyana is the latest victim of a city in free fall -- unable to find the bottom and, therefore, unable to rebound.
 Mayor David Bing said Thursday of recent killings: ''It's very demoralizing, very painful. Don't know how to stop it, quite frankly.'' So the hapless become the hopeless.
 That's not what that city needs to hear from its mayor. Detroit is fighting real crime and the even more corrosive and debilitating perception of crime. 
 Last year, Forbes dubbed Detroit the most dangerous city in America. Last month, CNN upped the ante and crowned it one of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world. 
 But, according to data released last week by the Detroit Police Department and published by the Detroit Free Press: ''Homicides are down, so far, from 138 this time last year to 108 this year.'' Progress, yes. But that's hardly solace when innocents continue to be killed, and the mayor sounds as if he's throwing up his hands.
 In a Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University poll released in January, Detroit-area residents were asked what word came to mind when they thought about the area. The word most mentioned was ''depressed/depressing'' followed by ''unemployment/joblessness'' and ''crime.'' And only 13 percent of respondents said that they felt ''very safe'' in the city. 
 The combination of personal insecurity and financial insecurity has led many to give up on Detroit. Not me.
 No, Detroit will never be the city it once was. It will forever be haunted by the ghosts of lost grandeur. But it needn't slip into the chasm of lawlessness and despair.
 I lived in Detroit for nearly two years, and I learned this: It's filled with indomitable spirits of gritty, determined Americans. They're fierce, proud and unbreakable. They believe in that city. 
 In fact, the January poll found that despite all of its problems, 63 percent of people felt optimistic about the future of the Detroit area. Call me silly, but I agree, as soon as they stanch the violence and raise a new civic identity from the ashes of the old one.
 You can do it, Detroit. Let the sad end of Aiyana's life spark a new beginning of the city's life.

HEADLINE: In Violent Karachi, Pakistani Insurgency Finds a Haven and a Forge

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH

 BODY:
KARACHI, Pakistan -- In this violent city of 18 million people, where the country's wealthiest live just miles from thousands of extremist religious schools and their Taliban supporters, lies the urban front line of Pakistan's struggle with Islamic militancy.
 A thousand miles to the north, the Pakistani Army is fighting the Taliban in barren tribal lands, and the Central Intelligence Agency has unleashed an air war with drones.
 But the infrastructure that propels the insurgency -- recruits, money, hiding places, and ideological underpinning -- is embedded across this grubby city on the Arabian Sea, according to politicians and militants alike.
 It remains unclear whether Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistani-American who is accused of planting a car bomb in Times Square, set out from Karachi for his journey to the tribal area of North Waziristan, where, according to American officials, he got training from the Pakistani Taliban. 
 But he lived in a middle-class area of Karachi in the 1990s, and it would have been easy enough for him to find conduits to the Pakistani Taliban among this city's more than 3,500 religious schools, or even to go to the Pakistani Taliban here directly, according to people familiar with his circumstances.
 The Pakistani authorities have arrested two men in Karachi who they say were linked to Mr. Shahzad and are now questioning them in Islamabad, Pakistani officials say. One was close to Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical religious party that is staunchly anti-American and whose supporters have harbored operatives of Al Qaeda, a Karachi police official said.
 The second man was arrested at a mosque funded by Jaish-i-Muhammad, an Islamic extremist group that has been backed by Pakistan's intelligence agencies, and has recently joined forces with the Pakistani Taliban in the tribal areas.
 Jaish and a multitude of other hard-line Islamic groups have helped make Karachi, with its overlay of radical Islamic edicts -- cinemas barely exist, alcohol is essentially banned -- a welcoming rear base for the Pakistani Taliban.
 It is also a sanctuary for the Afghan Taliban, who the Americans are fighting in Afghanistan and who are clients of the Pakistanis. Despite the arrest of a senior commander for the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, on the outskirts of Karachi in January, some senior members still stay in the wealthy area of the Defense Housing Authority and have free passage in and out of the city, according to local politicians.
 The chaos and crime that bedevil Karachi, mainly the result of gang warfare among armed wings of the political parties, create a near perfect place for fighters of the Pakistani Taliban to plan and to hide.
 Amid this violence, the Taliban organize, recruit and raise funds, even as the Pakistani military has opened a series of offensives in the north that have chased Taliban fighters to other areas, like North Waziristan and Orakzai.
 Recently the army has launched an offensive in Orakzai, too, and many fighters were retreating to Karachi, a common tactic for the Taliban, according to Jan Mohammed, 21, a fighter from the Pakistani Taliban, who came to Karachi two months ago from Orakzai. ''We have about 500 to 600 fighters here from Orakzai, waiting for orders,'' he said. Some of the wounded Taliban -- those who could make the journey sitting up in a car -- were brought to Karachi for treatment, he said.
 Another, more senior Taliban fighter in his early 30s, who has lived in Karachi for more than six months, boasted, ''We are well organized here.''
 Almost all Taliban are from the Pashtun ethnic group whose ancestral homes are in the tribal areas. About five million Pashtun have migrated to Karachi over the years, and while many of the Pashtun in the city do not agree with the Taliban, their presence in the city gives the Taliban cover, the senior fighter said.
 The fighters are organized in cells according to the geographical area they came from in the tribal areas, he said.
 A veteran Taliban official, known as the emir, serves as the central commander in Karachi, and he receives orders on financial matters and strategy from the Pakistan Taliban high command, now in North Waziristan, the senior fighter said.
 This fighter, who said he changed his address every few days in the city, declined to give his name for fear of being discovered by the Karachi authorities.
 After an interview, the police stopped the fighter, dressed in Pakistani garb of shirt and baggy trousers, as he hailed a pedicab, he said later. When he showed the police a business card with the name of his trading company, he was allowed to move on, he said.
 Many Taliban fighters are seasonal, and use Karachi as a winter bolt-hole to earn money, often in lowly jobs. They migrate to the tribal areas or move onto Afghanistan in the summer. Last week, a Taliban organizer in South Waziristan said by telephone that he had just received a batch of fighters from Karachi who were heading to Afghanistan.
 Karachi is important to the Taliban because it is Pakistan's Wall Street. The city's trucking industry, dominated by Pashtun businessmen, carries almost all the supplies the United States Army uses in Afghanistan -- weapons, vehicles, fuel, food and water. Some of the huge amounts of money involved in that transportation splash back to the Taliban, politicians and trucking businessmen said.
 ''The militants put business first and by default they are benefiting,'' said Ali Mohammed, who runs a company that takes supplies to Afghanistan. ''They are paid very well by the trucking companies'' not to strike the convoys, he said.
 Moreover, the militants ran a parallel trade by truck to supply themselves along many of the same routes, he said.
 Some of the trucking companies carried drugs from Kandahar, the Taliban heartland in southern Afghanistan and a center of opium poppy cultivation, to Karachi and returned with weapons for the militants fighting American and NATO forces, Mr. Mohammed said.
 Many of the rich Pashtun businessmen of Karachi donate to the Taliban, said the senior fighter. ''Money is not a problem for us,'' he said.
 ''They like to give to get a place in heaven.''
 But Karachi is also an ideological motor for the insurgency, powered by a vast circuit of unregistered religious schools, known as madrasas. 
 Most of the militant groups, like Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have sponsored madrasas here for many years, where they imbue a hatred of all things Western and provide the justification for militancy, community leaders said.
 In Sohrab Goth, a bleak sprawl of one-story concrete houses, a madrasa called Jaamia Farooqia is the alma mater for the Pakistani Taliban's chief suicide bomb instructor, Qari Hussain. Many graduates from Jaamia Farooqia have headed to the tribal areas as recruits for the Pakistani Taliban, the senior fighter said.
 But pressure on the Taliban from the police, often considered corrupt and violent, is mounting, the senior fighter said.
 In a highly publicized case last October, the police, recently supplemented with more counterterrorism squads, arrested the senior Taliban commander in Karachi. 
 The house of the commander, Akhtar Zaman, was filled with weapons, the police said, and Mr. Zaman remains in custody.
 The new commander is a younger, less seasoned man from South Waziristan. He has just installed himself at a madrasa in Baldia town, a ramshackle area of narrow alleys and dust-flecked palm trees, dominated by Pashtuns.
 In keeping with a lower profile, he rebuffed a request for an interview. So far, said the senior fighter, he is keeping the madrasa free of weapons.

HEADLINE: Former Senator Kerrey May Lead Movie Group

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska governor and United States senator who has recently served as president of the New School, is in negotiations to become Hollywood's top lobbyist. 
 Mr. Kerrey, 66, will become chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America if talks continue as expected, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Kerrey, who was dealing with graduation duties on Friday, did not respond to requests for comment.
 The Motion Picture Association, which oversees the movie ratings system and is the entertainment industry's primary lobbying organization, has been seeking a new leader since Dan Glickman resigned in early April. A spokeswoman for the organization declined to comment about Mr. Kerrey. A Hollywood blog, TheWrap.com, was the first to report the talks.
 Various studio executives -- including Barry M. Meyer, the chairman of Warner Brothers Entertainment, and Jim Gianopulos, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment -- have met with Mr. Kerrey in recent weeks and given approval for his hire, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. The headhunting firm Korn/Ferry International has also been involved.
 The Motion Picture Association has stumbled in recent years, in part because Mr. Glickman, a former congressman from Kansas and agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, never clicked with show business. While genial, he lacked the razzmatazz of his predecessor, Jack Valenti, who had been an aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson and used the post as a megaphone for entertainment industry concerns.
 The six movie studios that finance the organization also cut its budget by 20 percent last year in the economic downturn, resulting in layoffs. The chairman's job comes with a salary of $1.2 million a year.
 Mr. Kerrey, who announced last May that he would step down from the New School when his contract expired in July 2011, will have his work cut out for him should a deal be reached. One challenge involves forcing rival studios to agree on policy initiatives; unlike in Mr. Valenti's day, all the studios are embedded inside conglomerates whose interests do not always coincide.
 Even when studios agree that an issue is a priority -- combating digital piracy, for instance -- efforts have often been dragged down by disjointed or ineffective strategy and public messages.
 Mr. Kerrey was governor before serving as senator from 1989 to 2001. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. Mr. Kerrey received the Medal of Honor for his service as a Navy Seal during the Vietnam War, where he lost part of a leg.After leaving the Senate to lead the New School, he served on the 9/11 Commission and flirted with a run for mayor of New York City in 2005. 
 Mr. Kerrey rose to the top of the list of candidates to lead the Motion Picture Association after other names like Harold Ford Jr., the former Democratic congressman from Tennessee, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico declined to be considered.

HEADLINE: In a Land of Cynics and Saps, the Skeptic Is King

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MANY of us have faced this situation at some point: a stranger approaches and tells us that he is visiting the city and lost all his money and identification, or it was stolen. He just needs $20 more to buy a bus ticket/fix his car/get a motel room. 
 The stranger looks anxious. It seems as if the story may be true. But if we hand over the $20, are we being played for a sucker? On the other hand, if I were in a similar situation, wouldn't I want someone to give a helping hand? Am I being too cynical?
 In my experience these situations are usually scams. I once saw the same person telling the same story on the same street corner two weeks after I first heard it. So either he was pulling a fast one or he was a terribly unlucky soul. 
 But the pull between cynicism and gullibility is constant. Do we trust people too little? Too much? There's evidence on both sides. According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, public trust in the federal government is at one of its lowest levels in half a century.
 On the other hand, we're just coming to terms with the price of our gullibility after Bernard Madoff and one of the biggest Ponzi schemes of all times.
 The truth is that gullibility and cynicism are not opposites, but two sides of the same coin. 
 ''I think cynical people are extraordinarily gullible,'' said Stephen Greenspan, emeritus professor of educational psychology at the University of Connecticut and the author of ''Annals of Gullibility'' (Praeger, 2008). ''They are gullible to ideas that reinforce their point of view.'' 
 Now, gullibility is nothing new. Look at Adam, Eve and the serpent. 
 But you don't have to go back to the Garden of Eden. We know many people who bought houses that they couldn't possibly afford because they wanted to believe the myth that housing prices would never fall. 
 Professor Greenspan said he lost some money when he invested, through a third party, with Mr. Madoff. He feared, he said, that he would appear foolish if he didn't invest in what seemed to be such a good opportunity, and he dismissed a friend's warning as knee-jerk cynicism.
 So is the answer to trust no one? To assume everyone is out for himself or herself?
 Not at all. ''No one wants to live in a world without trust,'' said David Dunning, a professor of psychology at Cornell University. In fact, he said, there is a notable positive correlation between countries where people have greater trust -- that contracts will be honored, that laws will work -- and economic growth. 
 Professor Dunning has conducted experiments that show we often overestimate the cynicism of others -- that ''when people are contemplating whether they should rely on the kindness of strangers, they suspect those strangers will prove more selfish than actually is the case.''
 In the experiments, a ''truster'' is given money that can be kept or handed to a completely random and anonymous stranger, the ''trustee.'' If the truster hands the money to the trustee, the amount of money is quadrupled ($5 becomes $20). The trustee can then either give half back to the truster or keep all of it.
 When asked before the game, trusters said they believed that trustees would give half the money back only 45 to 60 percent of the time. But, in fact, that turned out to be true in 80 to 90 percent of the cases.
 The numbers were pretty consistent in experiments in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands.
 One of the problems, Professor Dunning said, is that people remember when their trust has been exploited, and then become more cynical. It is more difficult to draw a lesson from the opposite -- there are few times when we learn in retrospect that someone we failed to trust was, in fact, trustworthy.
 But, interestingly, Professor Dunning's research found that participants in his experiment were much more likely to put their faith in other people than in the odds. When the experiment involved a game of chance, only 30 percent were eager to take the risk -- half the number of those willing to believe that a stranger would split the money.
 When asked why they trusted other people over chance, ''our subjects didn't have much insight into why they act the way they do,'' Professor Dunning said.
 It also seems that people actually trust more than they say they do. In the experiments, less than 40 percent predicted they would give the money to a stranger. But in fact, about 60 percent turned over the money.
 This is the opposite of most psychological experiments in which people tend to make themselves look better on paper than they behave in real life, Professor Dunning said. ''This contradicts every other type of study I've done in my lab in the past 15 years.''
 Teasing out why and how people trust is a clearly a complicated undertaking. But it is important to stress that being trusting is not the same as being gullible.
 ''Gullibility is not a function of high trust, it's a function of high trust where there are obvious signs that someone shouldn't be trusted,'' Professor Greenspan said. ''So it's foolish trust.''
 A Japanese study found that contrary to common wisdom, those considered to be more trusting were shrewder in potentially risky social interactions than distrusters. This may be because those who fear betrayal avoid many situations, thus limiting their ability to learn and interpret social cues. They don't know how to figure out whom to trust and whom not to, so they distrust everyone.
 Which is pretty much the definition of a cynic.
 Cynicism makes an unpredictable world more predictable, Marcia Angell wrote in her book ''Science on Trial'' (W. W. Norton, 1996), and ''offers the illusion of understanding.'' Dr. Angell, a senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said that both cynicism and gullibility produced ''a penchant for magical thinking and the suspension of logic.''
 The choice, though, is not simply between cynicism and gullibility. The middle ground is skepticism -- someone who doesn't accept things on faith but seeks out more information, said Paul Mihailidis, an assistant professor of media studies and public relations at Hofstra University. 
 ''A cynic doesn't trust and walks away,'' he said. ''A skeptic doesn't trust and keeps asking questions.''
 The danger is trying to teach skepticism and ending up with cynics, which can happen, Professor Mihailidis said, when educating students in how the media operates. A study of University of Maryland undergraduates who took media literacy found they were more able to understand, evaluate and analyze media messages, but they were also more cynical and negative about the media's role in civil society -- which was not the goal.
 ''It's not enough to teach students how the message is slanted,'' Professor Mihailidis said. ''We need to teach how to become engaged and active citizens.''
 The aim is, as much as possible, to question and learn. Nonetheless, all of us, at some point, will be duped or mistakenly distrust an honest man. But that doesn't make us cynics or fools. It just makes us human.

HEADLINE: Congo Minerals Provision Becomes Part of Financial Bill

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- During their long effort to pass a financial regulation bill, senators cited many causes for the housing crisis and the financial market collapse that led to the recession. 
 The mining of minerals in Congo was not one of them.
 Nevertheless, tucked into the bill passed by the Senate on Thursday is a provision that requires any publicly traded company that uses certain minerals to file reports annually with the Securities and Exchange Commission certifying whether the minerals originated in Congo or neighboring countries. 
 It also requires them to report what steps the company took to ensure that the purchase of these minerals did not benefit armed groups in Africa. Minerals trading in Africa is often used to finance military activities.
 These are not just any minerals, however. Columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, gold and metals derived from them are widely used in the manufacture of cellphones, laptop computers, MP3 players, digital cameras and all sorts of other consumer electronics. Thus, the regulations could affect hundreds of companies. 
 Wolframite, for example, is a source of tungsten, which is used in integrated circuits, light bulbs, and computer and television screens.
 The measure calls for any company using the minerals as a primary ingredient in its products to file the reports and to describe the steps taken to ensure that its mineral procurements did not benefit armed groups in Africa.
 Senate leaders had vowed that the financial regulation bill would not be weighed down by amendments favoring the pet projects of lawmakers. But the Congo mineral amendment has been a project of Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, for years. The amendment was approved by a voice vote. 
 Mr. Brownback, who argued strongly for the need to exclude auto dealers from the regulations the legislation imposes on them by a new consumer financial protection bureau, said he was ''hopeful that this amendment will bring accountability and transparency to the supply chain of minerals used in the manufacturing of many electronic devices, without placing a disproportionate burden on publicly traded companies.''

HEADLINE: Swiss Panel's Vote Signals UBS Deal on Client Data May Be Approved

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
A Swiss parliamentary commission signaled on Friday that it was likely to accept an agreement with United States to hand over data on clients of the bank UBS suspected of tax evasion. 
 The issue has become tied up in Switzerland's highly factional political process, with some parties linking their support to government commitments on rules on bonus caps and bank supervision.
 Some observers said they thought the committee on economic affairs would vote against the UBS deal, prompting an outpouring of lobbying from Swiss business groups and others backing it. But the committee voted 19 to five, with three abstentions, to continue deliberations on the issue until the start of June, just before the full Parliament votes.
 Mark Stucki, a spokesman for the Parliament, said the decision to continue the discussions suggested that there had been a shift in opinion and sent a clear signal that the committee would ultimately back the deal.
 Hansruedi Wandfluh, the chairman of the committee, was quoted by Swiss media as saying that the committee was likely to agree on the text in a final vote on June 2.
 Although the vote on Friday was anonymous, it appears that the nationalist Swiss People's Party backed the motion, with the center-left Social Democrats opposing it. Such a reversal of previous positions would suggest that the center-left group might fail in its attempt to link the bill to a broader banking overhaul.
 In the original August 2009 deal, UBS agreed to disclose names and accounts of 4,450 wealthy Americans suspected of dodging taxes, in return for the suspension of legal action in the United States and a $780 million fine.
 But Bern placed the settlement before Parliament in February after a Swiss court said that the deal violated national laws, which permit breaches of banking secrecy in cases of tax fraud, a criminal offense, but not tax evasion, a civil matter.
 There has been mounting pressure on lawmakers to approve the deal. The finance chiefs of the cantons, or states, sent a letter to lawmakers this month highlighting the damage that could be inflicted, in the event of rejection, on Switzerland's image as a reliable business partner globally and specifically in the United States. The letter said it was ''not sensible'' to link the UBS case with financial rules on banks and bonuses.
 The Swiss business association, economiesuisse, sent a similar letter this past week

HEADLINE: Arizona Law Reveals Split Within G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Republican lawmakers and candidates are increasingly divided over illegal immigration -- torn between the need to attract Latino support, especially at the ballot box, and rallying party members who support tougher action.
 Arizona's new measure, which requires that the police check the documents of anyone they stop or detain whom they suspect of being in the country illegally, has forced politicians far and wide to take a stance. But unlike in Washington, where a consensus exists among establishment Republicans, the fault lines in the states -- where the issue is even more visceral and immediate -- are not predictable.
 Conservative Republican governors like Jim Gibbons of Nevada, Robert F. McDonnell of Virginia and Rick Perry of Texas have criticized the Arizona law. But some more moderate Republicans, like Tom Campbell, who is running in the party's Senate primary in California, have supported it.
 The decision on whether to support or oppose the law can have almost immediate political consequences. The latest evidence may be Meg Whitman's declining fortunes. 
 For months, Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, enjoyed a substantial lead over her principal rival for the Republican nomination for governor of California, Steve Poizner. But in recent weeks, she has seen her advantage slip significantly, in no small part because Mr. Poizner has hammered her on her opposition to the Arizona law. 
 Finding herself increasingly on the defensive on the issue, Ms. Whitman even proclaims in a new advertisement: ''I'm 100 percent against amnesty for illegal immigrants. Period.'' 
 Nonetheless, a poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California showed her advantage falling 23 percentage points since March, down to 38 percent versus 29 for Mr. Poizner.
 In states with hotly contested elections, several Republican candidates are finding their positions mobile, reflecting the delicacy of the issue and a growing body of polls that suggest many voters support the Arizona law. 
 In Florida, for instance, Attorney General Bill McCollum, who is running for governor, now says he approves of the law, though he called it ''far out'' two weeks ago; Marco Rubio, the state's Republican Senate nominee, has also shifted his stance. 
 State Republicans now find themselves in a balancing act, trying to seize a moment of Congressional stalemate to demonstrate leadership while not repelling voters on either side of the debate, a challenge that is particularly daunting for those in a primary fight.
 ''I think we need to be very careful about immigration,'' said Karl Rove, the former adviser to President George W. Bush. ''I applaud Arizona for taking action, but I think the rhetoric on all sides ought to be lowered.'' 
 Mr. Rove and other strategists who worked for Mr. Bush were proponents of an immigration overhaul that included a path to legal status.
 At the same time, state legislatures are racing to create their own laws, making it more likely than ever that the nation will end up with a patchwork of state legislation instead of a comprehensive national approach in the next year or two. 
 In the first three months of this year, legislators in 45 states introduced 1,180 bills and resolutions relating to immigration; 107 laws have passed, compared with 222 in all of 2009, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. 
 ''The kindling has been lit in the states,'' said Matthew Dowd, a political consultant from Texas who was the chief strategist for the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign. 
 ''With immigration, the choices you have to make are hard, and most people in Washington don't really like to make hard choices,'' he added. ''Hard choices are much more often made in the states.'' 
 Democrats have their own problems with the issue. Some more left-leaning factions prefer a path to legal status for illegal immigrants without the tough enforcement measures that Democrats in Congress have proposed.
 But the divisions appear more acute among Republicans, some of whom fear that the party will become identified with punitive immigration laws at a time when Hispanics are a growing part of the electorate -- particularly in emergent battleground states like Colorado and Nevada.
 ''I am a grandson of an Irish immigrant,'' Mr. McDonnell of Virginia said in an e-mail message. ''The Hispanic population in this country contributes to our culture, economic prosperity and quality of life.''
 Republicans who are not facing primary challenges are far more likely to take a more moderate view of immigration, and many, particularly in border states, are aware that business groups that depend on illegal immigrants for labor support a comprehensive immigration overhaul. 
 ''If I am running in a primary without opposition, I have the luxury of not having to worry about what I say on this issue,'' said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politicsat the University of Southern California.
 The dynamics of immigration politics vary vastly by state, even among those with heavy immigrant populations, and can reflect local concerns. In Texas, for instance, Latinos have a lot of political influence and have elected candidates for many years. The population there is often closely aligned with the political leadership of some cities and even with state government. 
 In Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer, who faces a Republican primary challenge, was under extreme pressure from her own party for advocating a tax increase, something now seen as largely mitigated by her signing of the immigration bill. 
 But it is also true that a spate of new polls show support, although tempered, for the state's tough new immigration law, which is clearly weighing on the minds of candidates.
 In a recent New York Times/CBS poll, 57 percent of the 1,079 adults queried said the federal government should determine the laws on illegal immigration, and 51 percent said the Arizona law was ''about right'' in its approach to the problem. 
 In a poll released by the Pew Research Center this month, 59 percent of 994 respondents said they approved of the Arizona law, while 32 percent disapproved. An Associated Press/Univision poll found that 42 percent of those asked favored the Arizona law and 24 percent opposed it. 
 ''It is really how you ask the question,'' said Sarah Taylor, who was Mr. Bush's political affairs director. ''And it is tied up in people's feelings about their own family's immigration experience, and then you have elements of race.''
 While the federal government ponders, numerous states have already moved to emulate Arizona's law, while others have moved forward with other measures, from laws that prohibit driver's licenses for illegal immigrants to those that improve classes for immigrant children in public schools.
 The issue is likely to be a problem for both parties throughout this election year.
 ''People like Perry and McDonnell and others realize this is a very divisive issue for our party,'' said Linda Chavez, the Republican chairwoman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative research organization, referring to the governors of Texas and Virginia. ''The fact is, you can't secure the borders if you don't fix immigration, because the two go hand in hand.''

HEADLINE: Deal to Buy Miramax Said to Be in Jeopardy

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- It may not be a Hollywood ending after all for the Weinstein brothers and their beloved Miramax Films.
 For weeks, Bob and Harvey Weinstein have been near a deal to reacquire the mini-studio from the Walt Disney Company. The brothers founded Miramax 31 years ago, naming it after their parents, Miriam and Max, but were forced to leave it behind in 2005. 
 The relationship between seller and buyer, however, suddenly grew stormy late Friday. Two people with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, insisted that the proposed deal had collapsed entirely. But Harvey Weinstein and their primary backer in the deal, the investor Ronald W. Burkle, claimed the exact opposite.
 ''The Weinstein brothers, the Weinstein Company and Ron Burkle are all working towards a deal to purchase and operate Mirmax,'' a joint statement from Harvey Weinstein and Mr. Burkle read. ''The parties continue to work diligently towards an agreement.''
 A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment.
 Negotiations, which have been going on for over a month and until recent days were considered close to resolution, did not bog down over price, according to the people with direct knowledge of the matter. The Weinsteins had been offering about $625 million, backed by the Yucaipa Companies, which is controlled by Mr. Burkle. Colbeck Capital Management and the Fortress Investment Group were to provide additional backing.
 Instead, the snag involved complications regarding how Miramax would fit with the brothers' new venture, the Weinstein Company, which has struggled to find its way in a shrinking market for independent film. The brothers appeared to want to align the two companies -- but not merge them -- while managing the Miramax library and using its cachet to bolster their own position as film producers and distributors.
 Disney is now expected to try to restart talks with other bidders. Before Disney awarded the Weinsteins an exclusive negotiating window last month, an all-cash offer for about $550 million was pending from the brothers Tom, Alec and Sam Gores, who are independent investors and control the Paradigm Talent Agency. A spokesman for the Gores declined to comment.
 One reason the Gores brothers initially lost out to the Weinstein group involved sequel rights.
 Industry insiders have privately estimated that any buyer of Miramax will ultimately need as much as $300 million above the sale price to revive the studio. Miramax delivers several hundred million in annual revenue from its 700-title library, but no longer has any employees after the integration with Walt Disney Studios last fall.
 The difficulty Disney has encountered in selling Miramax comes as investors all over Hollywood chew over a difficult question: just how much are movie libraries worth?
 Hotly pursued during the DVD boom, libraries are now significantly less valuable as the economic downturn and shifting consumer tastes have sent disc sales plummeting.

HEADLINE: Obama Sketches Energy Plan In Oil

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There is very little upside for the Obama administration in the ecological and economic disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico. The government has come under sharp criticism for underestimating the size of the discharge and for coddling the oil industry for too long.
 Until now, perhaps distracted by the critics or because it did not appear that his overall energy agenda was moving forward, President Obama has not made use of the disaster in an overtly political way. 
 But on Friday -- a full month after the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon -- he made clear that he also was not going to let the moment go to waste, announcing plans to impose stricter fuel-efficiency and emissions standards on cars and, for the first time, on medium- and heavy-duty trucks. 
 He said the oil gushing from the crippled BP well in the gulf highlighted the need to move away from dirty and dangerous fossil fuels toward a cleaner energy future. And he signaled that he intended to use the accident to continue to push his broader policy priorities, including legislation that would put a price on climate-altering emissions and increased federal aid for American industries in the global race to dominate the clean energy technology sector.
 ''We know that our dependence on foreign oil endangers our security and our economy,'' Mr. Obama said in a Rose Garden announcement. ''And the disaster in the gulf only underscores that even as we pursue domestic production to reduce our reliance on imported oil, our long-term security depends on the development of alternative sources of fuel and new transportation technologies.''
 Put more starkly: the road Mr. Obama is sending us on to his dreamed-of carbon-free future will be slick with oil for many years to come.
 Friday's announcement extended rules on exhaust reduction for cars and light-duty trucks and proposed new greenhouse gas pollution limits for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The new rules build on an agreement the administration reached with automakers a year ago. Mr. Obama was able to broker that deal by taking advantage of existing executive authority and the near-desperate desire of the struggling auto companies for a single national fuel-efficiency standard, rather than a patchwork of conflicting state and federal rules. 
 Mr. Obama faces a much steeper path to an agreement limiting carbon dioxide emissions from other sectors of the economy, including electric power companies and heavy manufacturers. That will require a negotiated deal with a variety of regulation-averse industries like coal and oil and the lawmakers who represent their interests.
 There is no Rose Garden ceremony in sight for that fundamental remaking of the American economy. 
 There are limits to what the president can do unilaterally, and, as the president himself has acknowledged, getting 60 votes to pass a sweeping energy bill through the Senate will require significant concessions on nuclear power, coal and, yes, offshore drilling.
 ''This is a small but commendable step,'' said Michael Levi, an energy and climate change expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The president should indeed be using the moment to focus people on the need to reduce U.S. dependence on oil, foreign and domestic,'' he wrote in an e-mail message.
 ''Big political moves, though, will require more,'' Mr. Levi continued. ''They will require sustained and focused advocacy from the president. People will not make any intuitive link between the tragedy in the gulf and legislation that raises electricity prices. For most Americans, the oil spill is tragic, but jobs and the economy are still the clear number one. The oil spill can help focus people's attention, but it will take something else to close the deal.'' 
 The president's Friday announcement came against a backdrop of an administration scrambling to both respond to the crisis in the gulf and to appear to be responding to the crisis. There has been a daily drumbeat of press releases, conference calls, denunciations of BP and announcements of investigations and reorganizations intended to showcase the vigor of the government's action.
 Yet even as the oil has continued to gush beneath the gulf, the administration has not been shy about acknowledging the reality that a third of domestically produced crude oil comes from offshore and that undersea reserves will continue to be an important source of American energy for decades. On March 31, Mr. Obama announced a significant expansion of offshore oil development, just three weeks before the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, a policy shift long in the making and unfortunate in the timing.
 Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, charged with both leasing the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling and protecting it from the ravages of oil development, reminded Congress this week that the administration was pursuing what he called a ''balanced'' energy strategy for the future that included substantial and expanded offshore exploration.
 ''Offshore development is a necessary part of that future,'' Mr. Salazar told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee this week. But he emphasized that new safety and environmental safeguards would have to be put in place before extensive new drilling was permitted.
 Thus the president's options are both defined and limited. There will be more offshore drilling, but the rules of the game have now changed. 
 As Mr. Obama put in on March 31, ''Given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs, and keep our businesses competitive, we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable homegrown energy.''

HEADLINE: Fate of Car Dealers Under Reform Still Uncertain

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
After months of intense lobbying to shape the future of financial regulation, it turns out that orthodontists and florists most likely won't be under the thumb of a new regulator after all.
 Car dealers are still in limbo.
 The Senate late Thursday passed a sweeping financial reform bill that promises to impose new oversight over the nation's increasingly complex financial industry, from Wall Street behemoths like JPMorgan Chase to small community banks and storefront payday lenders. 
 While the potential effect on banks was obvious, many nonbank businesses worried that they too might be swept into the legislation, hurting their ability to extend credit to their customers or hedge their investments against losses.
 Even after the Senate vote, many of those questions remain unanswered, as its bill must be reconciled with the House version. And even if the legislation eventually passes, as most expect it will, some issues won't be resolved until specific regulations are written.
 ''The goal in this is to get statutory certainty in laws in certain areas,'' said Gary E. Hughes, executive vice president and general counsel for the American Council of Life Insurers, whose members use derivatives to hedge interest rates. ''That's proven to be an elusive objective.''
 Still, the Obama administration and consumer groups had pushed for the creation of a consumer protection agency that would oversee all types of consumer loans, including those originated by mortgage companies and payday lenders rather than banks. 
 For the most part, they got their wish. Both House and Senate bills include a new consumer agency that would oversee all types of consumer loans, including credit cards, payday loans and mortgages. The agency also will oversee debt settlement firms, debt collectors and check-cashing stores.
 ''The idea that you have consumer protection no matter where you buy the product is largely in this bill,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, director of consumer programs for the United States Public Interest Research Group. 
 Most of the nonbank lenders are currently overseen by state regulators and the Federal Trade Commission, which lacks the resources and rule-writing authority of bank regulators.
 The most obvious remaining uncertainty involves the nation's 18,000 or so car dealers, who had mounted a vigorous campaign to be excluded from the new agency's oversight. The dealers, who swarmed Capitol Hill to make their case, maintained that they simply facilitate car loans on behalf of financial institutions and therefore should be exempt.
 But the Obama administration and consumer groups argued against the loophole, saying car dealers played a key role in arranging financing and too often steered consumers toward high-interest loans.
 The military weighed in too, complaining that dealers foisted unscrupulous deals on soldiers.
 On Thursday evening an amendment to exempt car dealers was withdrawn before the final vote. As a result, under the Senate bill, the new consumer protection agency would regulate car dealers.
 Despite the loss, car dealers and their supporters in Congress vowed to continue the fight. They had previously won an exemption in the House version of the financial reform bill, and on Monday, the Senate will hold a vote on whether to instruct negotiators to include the auto dealer exemption in the final bill.
 ''We're not disappointed at this point,'' said Dave Westcott, a North Carolina-based car dealer who is also chairman of government affairs for the National Automobile Dealers Association, which was urging its members to call senators on Friday. ''We'll have an up or down vote on Monday. We're optimistic.''
 Mr. Mierzwinski held a different view, maintaining that a nonbinding message from the Senate was far weaker than an actual bill. Nonetheless, he said the car dealer exemption would most likely result in a pitched battle as negotiators try to reconcile the two bills.
 Among the most obvious winners in the Senate bill were small businesses, many of which were excluded from the legislation. Some worried that small businesses would fall under the regulatory umbrella of the new consumer financial protection bureau, because orthodontists, butchers, florists and plumbers, among others, extend credit to their customers.
 But an amendment sponsored by Senators Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, excluded businesses that met a three-pronged test: they did not sell financial products, did not securitize consumer debt and met accepted definitions for a small business.
 While the amendment successfully removed all but the very largest plumbers and orthodontists from the new agency's purview, some business groups said it still left midsize business owners vulnerable to additional regulation, which they deemed unnecessary.
 A second amendment, drafted by Ms. Snowe, would require the consumer agency to assess the impact on small businesses before writing new regulations. Consumer groups complained that the amendment would slow the agency's ability to write new regulations and give small businesses, including perhaps predatory lenders, first crack at killing consumer protections.
 On another matter, many businesses, including confectioners, brewers and airlines, had worried that new rules for trading derivatives would hurt their ability to hedge. But an exemption was included in the Senate bill that essentially exempts manufacturers of goods that use hedges on such things as commodities, currencies and interest rates.
 And merchants were a surprise victor in the Senate version of the bill. It included a provision that would limit the fees, known as swipe fees or interchange, that banks charge merchants when consumers use debit cards. Merchants have long complained that Visa and MasterCard set the interchange rates for credit and debit cards at excessive levels as a way to entice banks to issue their cards. Last year, Visa and MasterCard paid the banks roughly $15.8 billion in interchange fees on debit cards alone.
 The bill calls on the Federal Reserve to cap the fees at a ''reasonable and proportional'' level.

HEADLINE: Finding the Way To the Final Bill

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Fresh off Senate approval of the overhaul of the nation's financial regulations, the Obama administration quickly moved on Friday to shape the final version of the bill.
 In three areas, consumer protection, restricting banks from using their own money to make bets in the market, and dealing with failing institutions that threaten the financial system, administration officials suggested that they were inclined to favor provisions in the Senate version over those of the House bill, which was passed in December.
 But the fate of a Senate provision that could require banks to spin off their lucrative derivatives trading desks is in fierce contention. The author of the provision, Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, has so far fended off attempts to water it down, but financial institutions are preparing to lobby against it over the next several weeks. Treasury officials have privately expressed strong reservations about the provision.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee, and Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who will shepherd the reconciliation process, said after meeting with President Obama at the White House that they were confident that a final bill could be delivered for his signature by Independence Day. 
 ''This is one of those rare occasions when the two bills really are very close to each other,'' said Mr. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat. ''There's not a great deal of difference. We need to take the best parts of both bills and marry them together and present our colleagues in both chambers with our final product.''
 Mr. Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, promised a transparent process for reconciling the two bills. ''It will be conducted, the formal parts, in public,'' he said. ''That means that no agreements reached, no compromises which obviously are being discussed, will be made part of anything without being publicly presented and voted on and discussed.''
 Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview, ''The president wants us to get this right and make sure that this is the strongest possible bill, but he wants us to get it done in a responsible way that preserves the right balance.''
 Mr. Geithner was part of the meeting at the White House, along with Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council.
 In another sign of the unusual political dynamics that have accompanied the monthslong debate over the regulatory overhaul, there were calls from both the left and the right for the conference process to be as open as possible.
 ''The battle now moves to conference, where the big banks will look to weaken or kill the bill behind closed doors,'' said Heather Booth, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of liberal advocacy groups. ''We cannot and will not allow this to happen.''
 The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, made a similar point. ''This subject is too important and affects too much of our economy to be written in its final stages by a select few Democrats and lobbyists behind closed doors,'' he wrote in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 The process of reconciling the legislation will most likely be undertaken with the aim of preserving the fragile coalition that made its passage in the Senate possible.
 The House bill would create a freestanding Consumer Financial Protection Agency, financed through a mix of sources, while the Senate version would create a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection within the Federal Reserve, with a director appointed by the president and its budget coming from within the Fed. Momentum appears to be growing for the Senate approach.
 The two bills differ on the extent to which the new agency's rules would override consumer standards promulgated by states, known as pre-emption. Most banks prefer the Senate version, which would allow greater pre-emption in certain instances.
 The House bill would exempt auto dealers from the reach of the new consumer agency; the Senate bill would not. President Obama has been outspoken in arguing against the exemption.
 The two bills differ on what has become known as the Volcker Rule -- a ban on banks making market bets with their own money, as opposed to trading on behalf of their clients.
 The House version gives regulators the discretion to crack down on such activity, known as proprietary trading. The Senate version directs regulators to ban such proprietary trading after a period of study.
 The Treasury Department largely drafted the Senate version of the Volcker Rule, and is expected to advocate for it.
 The bills also differ in their approach to creating a so-called resolution authority, a process for the government to seize and dismantle a systemically important institution in a way that is aimed at preventing financial chaos.
 While both bills call for a process modeled on the approach the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation uses to take over failing banks, the House bill calls for huge financial companies to pay into a $150 billion fund. The Senate removed the fund, which had become an object of much contention. Either way, the industry would have to pay the costs of resolution.
 In addition, the Senate version makes it clear that a company could not survive the process -- that resolution is ''hospice, not convalescence,'' said John Dearie, executive vice president for policy at the Financial Services Forum, which prefers the Senate approach.
 The administration is seeking to remove two requirements in the Senate version: that a failing company must pass through a review by a special panel of bankruptcy judges, and that F.D.I.C. loan guarantees obtain Congressional approval.
 The Lincoln provision is expected to draw the most fire in coming weeks. Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, have criticized the provision, asserting that it could destabilize the financial system. Administration officials say that the provision would block derivatives-clearing organizations from receiving liquidity assistance in the event of a crisis, undermining a major aim of the measure.
 Mrs. Lincoln has so far stood firm behind her provision, but several observers said its fate would almost certainly not be decided until after June 8, when she faces an aggressive challenger, Bill Halter, in a Democratic primary runoff.
 Other substantial differences exist between the two bills.
 While both provide for increased oversight of the Fed by the Government Accountability Office, the Senate version would continue to exempt interest rate decisions from scrutiny.
 And it would limit interchange fees, which retailers pay to banks when customers swipe credit or debit cards.
 The House version does not contain either provision.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 2010, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about merging House and Senate versions of a bill to overhaul financial regulations misstated the status of a provision that would make it easier for shareholders to nominate directors for corporate boards using company ballots. Both the Senate and the House bills contain that provision; it is not absent from the House version.

HEADLINE: A Progressive Agenda To Remake Washington

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 With the Senate's passage of financial regulation, Congress and the White House have completed 16 months of activity that rival any other since the New Deal in scope or ambition. Like the Reagan Revolution or Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the new progressive period has the makings of a generational shift in how Washington operates.
 First came a stimulus bill that, while aimed mainly at ending a deep recession, also set out to remake the nation's educational system and vastly expand scientific research. Then President Obama signed a health care bill that was the biggest expansion of the safety net in 40 years. And now Congress is in the final stages of a bill that would tighten Wall Street's rules and probably shrink its profit margins.
 If there is a theme to all this, it has been to try to lift economic growth while also reducing income inequality. Growth in the decade that just ended was the slowest in the post-World War II era, while inequality has been rising for most of the last 35 years. 
 It is far too early to know if these efforts will work. Their success depends enormously on execution and, in the case of financial regulation, specifically on the Federal Reserve, which did not distinguish itself during the housing bubble. 
 Already, though, one downside to the legislative spurt does seem clear. By focusing on long-term problems, Mr. Obama and the Democrats have given less than their full attention to the economy's current weakness and turned off a good number of voters.
 After months of discussion, and with the unemployment rate hovering near a 27-year high, Democratic leaders said Thursday they had finally reached agreement on a bill that would send aid to states and take other steps to increase job growth. Congress plans to vote on the bill next week. But some of the money will not be spent for months and may not be enough to affect voters' attitudes before November's midterm elections.
 Still, the turnabout since Jan. 20 -- the first anniversary of Mr. Obama's inauguration and the day after Scott Brown, a Republican, won a Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts -- has been remarkable. Then, commentators pronounced the Obama presidency nearly dead. Today, he looks more like a liberal answer to Ronald Reagan.
 ''If you'd asked me about this administration after Scott Brown was elected, I'd have told you it was going to fizzle into virtually nothing,'' said Theda Skocpol, the Harvard political scientist. ''Now it could easily be one of the pivotal periods in domestic policy.'' But, Ms. Skocpol added, ''It will depend on what happens in the next two elections.''
 The recent period surely will not match the impact of the New Deal. Nothing is likely to, notes David Kennedy,a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, because the New Deal created much of the modern American government. ''These are not as dramatic as the foundational moments,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''but they're significant changes.'' 
 Alan Brinkley, a historian of the Depression, added: ''This is not the New Deal, but it's a significant series of achievements. And given the difficulty of getting anything done under the gridlock of Congress, it's pretty surprising.''
 The last 16 months seem most similar in scope to three other periods in the last 80 years. After World War II, the federal government helped build the modern middle class with the G.I. Bill, housing subsidies, the highway system and incentives for employers to offer health insurance. The 1960s -- mostly under Mr. Johnson, but also Richard Nixon -- brought civil rights legislation, Medicare, Medicaid and environmental laws. Then Mr. Reagan ushered in a period that continued, more or less, until 2008: tax cuts, less regulation and other attempts to unleash the competitive forces of the market.
 Mr. Obama has been trying to reverse the Reagan thrust in some important ways. Although the Reagan administration did not shrink the size of the federal government, it changed the ways that Washington collected and spent its money, by reducing taxes on the affluent, cutting some social programs and increasing military spending.
 These policies ended up magnifying income inequality, which was already rising for other reasons. Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled. Every major piece of the Obama agenda is meant, in part, to push back against inequality. Government may grow, but the bigger change will be how the government is spending its money. 
 The health bill expanded insurance coverage largely for middle-class and poor families and paid some of the bill by taxing households making more than $250,000 a year. Attached to the final health bill were also education provisions that cut subsidies to banks making student loans, and used much of the money for college financial aid instead. 
 The financial regulation bill, meanwhile, would take several steps likely to reduce Wall Street's profits -- and Wall Street has created more multimillionaires in recent decades than any other industry. To take one example, certain trades would be forced onto open exchanges. This would hurt financial firms' ability to act as a middleman, much as Expedia and other travel Web sites have hurt travel agents. 
 For all these differences, though, there are also ways that Mr. Obama and today's Democrats have accepted, and are even furthering, the Reagan project. They are not trying to raise tax rates on the affluent to anywhere near their pre-1981 levels. Their health bill tried created new private insurance markets, not expand Medicare. 
 Most striking, the administration is trying to improve public education by introducing more market competition. To win stimulus funds, about 20 states have changed their rules to allow more charter schools or to evaluate teachers in new ways. On Thursday, Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado signed a bill that would reward teachers who received strong evaluations and deny tenure to some who did poorly.
 These education changes -- combined with increased spending on science research -- are meant to lift economic growth. Economists have long considered education and technology to be the main ingredients in growth. In Mr. Obama's phrasing, the goal is to create a ''new foundation,'' more solid than the bubbles of recent years. 
 Even with those bubbles, the nation's economic output expanded only 20 percent from 2000 through 2009. In the 1980s, it grew 35 percent, and in the 1990s, it grew 37 percent.
 Will this new progressive project succeed? There are any number of uncertainties: whether enough charter schools will succeed, whether the new health insurance markets will function well, whether the Fed will learn to become an effective regulator of Wall Street.
 Some of those questions won't be resolved for years. But one issue should become clear much sooner. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Johnson and Franklin D. Roosevelt cemented their changes by retaining enough allies in Congress and serving more than four years in the White House. Mr. Obama has yet to do so.

HEADLINE: After Days of Rage in Thailand, a Weary Calm

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE and SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared on Friday that order had been restored across Thailand and that it was time for reconciliation, even as the country remained under a state of emergency and a military cordon continued to encircle the central commercial district of the capital.
 ''We recognize that as we move ahead there are huge challenges ahead of us, particularly the challenge of overcoming the divisions that have occurred in this country,'' Mr. Abhisit said in a televised speech, adding that he would initiate ''an independent investigation of all the events that have taken place during the protest.'' 
 After an outbreak of deadly rioting and arson by antigovernment protesters on Wednesday and Thursday, Bangkok was mostly calm on Friday. Thai financial markets remained closed for a special holiday declared by the central bank, public transportation was limited, many businesses were shuttered, and an overnight curfew remained in effect for at least two more days. 
 Two months of tension and violence ended with a whimper on Thursday as the last exhausted group of protesters filed out of a Buddhist temple where they had taken refuge, bewildered and frightened, some in tears.
 As they shuffled past a smear of blood on the ground that told of the recent fighting, a line of female police officers in black berets comforted them, touching their shoulders and murmuring: ''Don't be afraid. You're safe now. Have a safe journey home.''
 But it felt, after a political convulsion unlike anything anyone here has seen, that Thailand's future was anything but safe.
 ''It was tragic,'' said Anusart Suwanmongkol, a senator who supports the government. ''Yesterday was the most tragic day in my memory, in Thai history. Nobody gained anything. Nobody won. The country lost.''
 ''This is the worst crisis Thailand has had, ever, probably -- maybe World War II -- and where we go from here I don't think anybody knows,'' said Charles Keyes, an anthropologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, who has devoted much of his life to the study of Thailand.
 ''My understanding of what I have learned over the years here has really come into question,'' he said. ''I question all the things I've learned about this country.''
 After weeks of stalemate, the military on Wednesday forcibly dispersed the protesters, known as red shirts, who had occupied Bangkok's prime commercial quarter since early March, setting off an eruption of violence and arson that took at least 15 lives. 
 The clashes on Wednesday and Thursday, along with four years of acrimonious political combat, have exposed rifts and resentments in Thailand that have smoldered under a surface of smiles and a virtue the Thais call ''cool heart.''
 The country's divisions and enmities have only deepened. Nothing has been resolved. The battle for power between social classes and between the politicians who manipulate them continues.
 An early election promised by Mr. Abhisit is off the table after protest leaders rejected it last week and vowed to fight on. Most of the leaders were arrested Wednesday as the final battle for the protest site began, and there seemed to be no one left with whom the government could negotiate.
 As the last of the protesters boarded buses to their homes in the countryside, leaving behind the ruins of their rally site and the smoking shell of a burned-out mall beside it, an antigovernment Web site urged them to fight on, saying, ''You are your own leaders now.''
 Hopes for a peaceful election, whenever it comes, seem faint, and in an increasingly polarized and violent political arena, it seems unlikely that the loser will accept the results.
 Antigovernment sentiment has hardened in the northeast and north of the country, to where many of the protesters were returning Thursday.
 Political opportunists have harnessed their yearnings into a powerful political movement, indoctrinating government opponents on community radio and in the amplified speeches of the protest stage, with a new vocabulary of exploitation about ''serfs'' and ''aristocracy.''
 The frightened protesters, who had cowered in the temple amid gunfire and explosions, were heading home with new grievances and hatreds.
 ''We have been poor for hundreds of years, even thousands of years, and they are living in fancy resorts and mansions,'' said Srirasa Reungrat, a middle-aged woman from Chiang Rai in the north, as she stood at the back of the temple Thursday morning. ''They have been doing this to us for a long time.''
 The bodies of six people killed the day before were laid out on mats beside her, with small offerings of noodles, cups of water and incense sticks at their feet, as a coroner with rubber gloves poked and prodded at their wounds.
 In fact, the social conflict in Thailand is more complex than a simple uprising of the poor. This is a society built on harmony, and until politicians hardened the divisions, the pressure for change was less confrontational.
 Thailand's rural people are not serfs. They have been called some of the most comfortable poor people in the world. The economic boom of the 1980s brought them paved roads, electricity, brick houses, television sets, motorbikes, cellphones and factory jobs. Political analysts now call them ''post-peasants'' and ''middle-income peasants.''
 But as their standard of living rose, the wealth of the well-to-do in Bangkok rose faster, and the aspirations and resentments of the lower classes grew. 
 They underwent a process known here as ta sawang, or a ''brightening of the eyes'' -- an awakening, a realization of a truth they had not recognized.
 When their eyes brightened, they focused in many cases on Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister, whose genius was to recognize this untapped electoral bloc, to answer some of its needs with low-cost health care and financial assistance, and to secure its support.
 Mr. Thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives abroad, evading a conviction for corruption. But he stays in touch with supporters through audio and video messages and a flow of fatherly messages on Twitter. He remains the single most influential political personality in Thailand; many see him as the master manipulator of the protests.
 ''Don't forget that the two most important weapons in modern-day politics are money and the media,'' said Mr. Anusart, the pro-government senator, ''and unfortunately the other side are the masters of both.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Decline in 34 States in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment rates fell in a majority of states last month as improved economic conditions spurred hiring.
 The Labor Department said Friday that 34 states and the District of Columbia reported lower jobless rates in April. Six states reported higher rates, while unemployment held steady in 10. 
 That was an improvement from March when 16 states and the District of Columbia reported declines in unemployment, 22 states had increases and 12 had no change, according to revised figures.
 South Carolina's rate fell to 11.6 percent in April, from 12.2 percent in March. That was the largest monthly drop of any state.
 After cutting their work forces during the recession, companies are starting to increase hiring as their sales and profits improve.
 Nationwide, employers added a net 290,000 job in April, the most in four years, the department reported earlier this month. The unemployment rate in the United States, though, rose to 9.9 percent as hundreds of thousands of job hunters -- feeling more confident about their prospects -- resumed or started searches.
 Even as the employment picture is less bleak in many states, and the nation as a whole, many economists predict it will take years for the job market to return to normal. A normal nationwide unemployment rate typically hovers around 5.5 to 6 percent. It is going to be a long slog because economic growth is not robust enough for companies to ramp up hiring and quickly drive down the jobless rate.
 Michigan, whose manufacturing base was clobbered by the recession, once again recorded the highest unemployment rate of any state -- 14 percent. The rate dipped from 14.1 percent in March.
 Nevada was close behind. Its rate rose to 13.7 percent last month, the highest on records dating back to 1976. California rounded out the top three with a rate of 12.6 percent, unchanged from March. Nevada and California -- states at the heart of the housing boom -- have been slammed by the market's bust and have been swamped by a wave of foreclosures.
 North Dakota again had the lowest jobless rate -- 3.8 percent. That is down from 4 percent in March. It was followed by South Dakota, whose rate dipped to 4.7 percent in April, from 4.8 percent in March, and Nebraska at 5 percent, unchanged from the previous month.
 Friday's report also said that a majority of states saw employers bolster jobs in April. The top three gainers: Ohio, where payrolls grew by 37,300 in April, from March; Pennsylvania, with 34,000 net new jobs; and New York with 32,700.

HEADLINE: Limits of Libertarianism

 BODY:
By denigrating several of the signal achievements of modern American society, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act, Rand Paul has performed a useful service for voters who are angry at their elected officials. He has helped to illuminate the limits and the hazards of antigovernment sentiment. 
 Many Americans are sputtering mad, believing that government has let them down in abetting a ruinous recession, bailing out bankers and spending wildly. But is Rand Paul really the remedy they had in mind? His views and those of other Tea Party candidates are unintentional reminders of the importance of enlightened government.
 In a handful of remarkably candid interviews since winning Kentucky's Republican Senate primary this week, Mr. Paul made it clear that he does not understand the nature of racial progress in this country. 
 As a longtime libertarian, he espouses the view that personal freedom should supersede all government intervention. Neighborhood associations should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of race, he has written, and private businesses ought to be able to refuse service to anyone they wish. Under this philosophy, the punishment for a lunch counter that refuses to seat black customers would be public shunning, not a court order.
 It is a theory of liberty with roots in America's creation, but the succeeding centuries have shown how ineffective it was in promoting a civil society. The freedom of a few people to discriminate meant generations of less freedom for large groups of others. 
 It was only government power that ended slavery and abolished Jim Crow, neither of which would have been eliminated by a purely free market. It was government that rescued the economy from the Depression and promoted safety and equality in the workplace.
 Republicans in Washington have breathlessly distanced themselves from Mr. Paul's remarks, afraid that voters might tar them with the same extremist brush. But as they continue to fight the new health care law and oppose greater financial regulation, claiming the federal government is overstepping its bounds, they should notice that the distance is closing.

HEADLINE: It Takes A Crisis To Make a Continent

BYLINE: By GABOR STEINGART. 
Gabor Steingart is the editor in chief of the German financial newspaper Handelsblatt.

 BODY:
Berlin
 BIRTHDAYS are fun; a birth itself is not. There's a lot of screaming and groaning, and even in the easiest deliveries, there's always the fear that something will go wrong.
 The birth of a state is no less difficult. Indeed, what pessimists -- including many here in Germany -- see as an existential crisis for the continent is really just the latest stage in the birth pangs of a new country. While we should of course worry about Greek debt, we should also have hope that we are witnessing the end of the euro zone as an abstraction and the birth of the United States of Europe.
 Europe's movement toward unification has always been the product of crises. The catastrophes of World War I and World War II convinced the continent's leaders to cast aside the solidity of fixed borders and with them the old nationalism and isolationism that led to repeated conflict. 
 And yet idealism was only a small part of the urge toward cooperation. By the early 1950s, the threat of Soviet communism loomed much larger. Common fears as much as a collective vision united us; as Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of Germany once said: ''European unity was a dream of a few. It became the hope for many. Today it is a necessity for us all.''
 During the cold war the European Community expanded its membership and began creating monetary relationships. Though European leaders tried to give sound economic justifications for the merger, the nascent monetary union was first and foremost a political creation, a currency knot meant to bind vastly different states to a common interest.
 Crisis and opportunity were also attendant during the early 1990s, when German unification led to fears of a renewed Teutonic nationalism and a reactionary Russia. The result, after years of debate, was the creation and rapid expansion of the European Union. We also got the euro, as much a political as an economic tool. By design, the currency's strict fiscal and monetary rules would force the stronger economies to balance out the weak, pushing them toward ever closer cooperation.
 By and large, however, the European Union has stayed out of the lives of its citizens, and so these past crises have not entered so rudely into the public consciousness. That has changed with the talk of bailing out spendthrift Greece, which is perhaps why this crisis is being seen as so much more serious than those of the past.
 Yet historians will likely look back to May 9 as a turning point. That is when, in a conference room in Brussels, European leaders announced a blanket guarantee of 750 billion euros (about $1 trillion) for the countries on the euro zone's southern flank. Even the European Central Bank, which until then had been regarded as an independent body, silently stepped in to bail out the troubled states. Though they would never admit it, the men and women who sat in Brussels formed the first European economic cabinet, making policy on the fly, just as in a regular state.
 Yes, the rules governing the euro are being breached every day, causing panic in the market. But this is part of a movement forward, not dissolution. According to the monetary union treaty signed in 1999, member states were never meant to take on the debts of a fellow member state, and the European Central Bank, modeled on the German Bundesbank, was meant to ensure monetary stability at all cost. But, at this critical moment, Europe decided that monetary unity was not enough, that it was worth breaking the rules to bring its members closer together as a political unit.
 From now on, the domestic budgets of northern and southern Europe will be connected, a fact resulting not from a long-term plan but, once again, from crisis. Germany did approve an unexpected, unilateral ban on naked short selling this week, but it was more a sop to an angry domestic populism than a signal of things to come; indeed, such national-level decisions will become increasingly rare.
 Having forced itself into an era of continental policymaking, Europe must now play catch-up with its democratic system. Millions of Europeans already feel alienated by Brussels; if the achievements of this crisis are to survive, European leaders must figure out how to make sure the people are heard in the political process. Europe as a decision-making body is a fact; now it has to become more democratic.
 The significance of the events that are unfolding now will become clear to us only with time. The press calls it a fatal crisis, but the headlines should really be a birth announcement. All we can do now is hold our breath and hope that the baby will survive.

HEADLINE: A Tale of One City, Then and Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Children of the '70s'' (column, May 18):
 David Brooks correctly contrasts the sense of security from riots and crime in which New Yorkers now take comfort with the fear that haunted the city in the 1960s and 1970s. But his praise of the ''restored'' Upper West Side ignores the destruction of the area's highly valued authentic character.
 Since the 1990s the Upper West Side has been gentrified. Formerly rent-stabilized apartments that had preserved the remnants of social diversity now sell for a million dollars. Chain stores run rampant on Broadway. Urban renewal that began in the 1950s gradually removed the poorest Puerto Rican residents and replaced them with brownstone revivalists and glitzy towers. 
 We can appreciate a safer city while opposing its luxification. An ''authentic'' neighborhood is where residents and local store owners can put down roots.
 Sharon Zukin New York, May 19, 2010
 The writer, the author of ''Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places,'' is a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the City University Graduate Center.
 To the Editor:
 I grew up on the Upper West Side in the 1950s and 1960s. I lived on 106th Street and Broadway all through this time, never going to Central Park or even east of Amsterdam Avenue, where many streets were too dangerous. When I graduated from P.S. 165 on West 109th, most of my friends left Manhattan; we could not. I attended the local junior high school, dodging gang fights, chases and all sorts of crimes. Now when I walk those old streets, I am amazed by the transformation.
 Now I am raising a college-age daughter in Lower Manhattan (across from the World Trade Center, from where we fled on 9/11) who tells me how safe New York is. I don't disagree, but I do tell her to be careful, for I know what lurks out there, and this is from my memory, not from any reality of today.
 Steven Abramson New York, May 19, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks reduces the so-called hippie movement -- the disparate and diffuse outpouring of cultural and political dissent that rocked the 1960s and '70s -- to its least common denominator.
 Hippies, Mr. Brooks tells us, ''celebrated disorder, mayhem and the whole Dionysian personal agenda.''
 Is that what hippies were about? Such an exercise in hedonism seems hardly worth noting, except, oddly, that it produced ''menacing results ... all around,'' as if it were hippies who brought us urban blight, racial unrest, Vietnam and Watergate.
 Odder still, Mr. Brooks appears to recognize that mayhem and hedonism were not quite the extent of hippiedom. For there seemed to be something in hippies' worldview about solving social and cultural problems by ''changing material circumstances.''
 Were ''hippies'' wrong about this? Isn't this the premise of capitalism, for goodness' sake?
 Jonathan M. Hansen Boston, May 18, 2010
 The writer is a historian at Harvard University.
 To the Editor:
 In trying to explain today's adults, David Brooks confuses the children of the urban 1970s with their suburban counterparts.
 I grew up in Manhattan in the 1970s and 1980s, and it had problems. Just last year, at a school reunion, my Upper West Side friends reminisced about all the muggings they endured back when President Gerald R. Ford was telling us to drop dead.
 But those experiences haven't made us more fearful today; they've made us more tolerant. We see how things can improve, and we know that most people are decent and good, because we remember them from our childhoods.
 Mr. Brooks is thinking of the people who fled, who bailed on New York (and other cities) and never looked back. The people who today boast that they never set foot in the city. They internalized that fear and now, grown up, project it onto America's urban policies. With luck, we can change that.
 Andrew J. Schaefer Chicago, May 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As an African-American youth attending private school on the Upper West Side in the 1970s, I was taken aback by David Brooks's column. Rampant crime existed in many communities of color for decades, but the 1970s were actually a great time for me and my family and other people of color in New York City; there were economic and other opportunities we had not enjoyed before then.
 Post-civil-rights opportunities opened doors that allowed my family to move into East New York, Brooklyn, which was then a white middle-class ethnic enclave until white flight and fear changed that neighborhood a decade later.
 The same era of opportunity allowed me to get a scholarship to Walden, a progressive Upper West Side private school that Mr. Brooks might say was ''hippie.'' I loved the vibrant diversity of the Upper West Side in those days. The mom and pop stores. The bodegas, the Latin conga players in Central Park. The different faces that passed me by every day.
 Yes, there was crime. But many brown and black people had been struggling with crime in their communities for decades. To some middle-class whites, I guess it all came as a big surprise.
 The crime now is the gentrification, the depression of wages, the chain stores. Working and middle-class people of all races are being pushed out by the runaway real estate into the outer boroughs, the suburbs or other states entirely. That market is exemplified by the current Upper West Side, which Mr. Brooks inexplicably calls ''still integrated.'' Compared with what?

HEADLINE: The Value of Carbon Capture

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Robert Bryce's May 13 Op-Ed article, ''A Bad Bet on Carbon,'' disregards the importance of carbon capture and sequestration technology in building a clean energy future. 
 Just last week, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said: ''The potential of carbon capture and sequestration is enormous. Aside from a few other things ... nothing ranks as high as C.C.S. [among the] tools that could be used to decrease carbon emissions.''
 President Obama has recognized the vital role of C.C.S. by creating a task force to develop plans for additional C.C.S. within the next 10 years.
 C.C.S. technology will also allow our nation to reduce the carbon footprint of coal, America's most abundant energy resource, meaning that millions of Americans can continue to receive the benefits of affordable, reliable electricity as our nation recovers from this recession.
 Prudent investments in C.C.S. by industry and government are essential to achieving the clean energy future we all seek.

HEADLINE: Clinton Issues Warning to North Korea Over the Sinking of a South Korean Vessel

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned North Korea on Friday that it would face ''consequences'' for sinking a South Korean warship in March, as she set off on an intense round of shuttle diplomacy in Asia to muster an international response.
 ''It is important to send a clear message to North Korea that provocative actions have consequences,'' Mrs. Clinton said after meeting in Tokyo with the Japanese foreign minister, Katsuya Okada. ''We cannot allow this attack on South Korea to go unanswered by the international community.'' 
 The comments were the first from Mrs. Clinton on what South Korea has called a deliberate North Korean torpedo attack, which killed 46 sailors. Mrs. Clinton declined to lay out the options for a response, saying that would be ''premature.'' 
 But other administration officials said they included action by the United Nations Security Council and joint American-South Korean naval exercises that could include antisubmarine warfare patrols. South Korea is also likely to squeeze the North economically by reducing trade ties.
 Mrs. Clinton, who flew to Shanghai later on Friday, will consult with Chinese officials in Shanghai and Beijing on the matter. China's support is considered crucial, both because it holds a veto in the Security Council and because it is North Korea's neighbor and the principal supporter of the North's leader, Kim Jong-il.
 So far, China has been reluctant to condemn North Korea for the torpedo attack on the 1,200-ton corvette, the Cheonan -- a reticence that has outraged many in South Korea.
 The escalating tensions between North and South Korea have scrambled what had been planned as three days of economic and security talks between China and the United States in Beijing next week. Now, those discussions will be partly eclipsed by what a senior American official characterized as the greatest military provocation on the Korean Peninsula in decades.
 Already, there is evidence that the tensions have influenced security calculations in the region. After declining for months to work out a deal to move a Marine Corps air base on the island of Okinawa, Japan now appears to be working toward a resolution, driven in part by a reaffirmation of the role the United States military plays in Japan's security, officials said.
 Mr. Okada said his government was trying to convince residents of Okinawa that ''in the current security environment, the presence of U.S. forces is indispensable for the security of Japan.'' He said he hoped a deal would be reached by the end of May, the government's self-imposed deadline.
 China is likely to be a tougher sell. President Hu Jintao hosted Mr. Kim during his train trip to China this month, just days after meeting with South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak. That showed China's instinct not to take sides in disputes between the North and South.
 Still, Mrs. Clinton began laying out the case for China's support in Tokyo, noting that the South Korean government's investigation of the sinking had been a ''thorough and comprehensive scientific examination,'' echoing the words Chinese leaders had used in calling for a scientific investigation.
 The evidence collected, including part of a torpedo propeller, was ''overwhelming and condemning,'' she said.
 ''Let me be clear: this will not, and cannot, be business as usual,'' Mrs. Clinton said, speaking in a grave tone. ''There must be an international, not just a regional, but an international response.''
 While Mrs. Clinton tours the American pavilion on the vast fairgrounds of the Shanghai Expo this weekend -- the main event during her stop here -- her aides will be huddling elsewhere, making the case that China must back punitive measures against the North.
 ''We'd like to see them acknowledge the reality of what happened and then join with South Korea, Japan and us in fashioning a response,'' said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
 The administration finds itself in a delicate spot: orchestrating international support for South Korea while also deferring to President Lee on the timing and nature of the response. The United States is wary of aggravating an already tense situation; North Korea, which denies the torpedo attack, threatened to respond to military retaliation with ''all-out war.''
 Mrs. Clinton did not speak to reporters traveling on her plane, breaking a common practice on trips by the secretary of state. An aide said she spoke to President Obama about the crisis while en route.
 Despite the bellicose language from the North, American officials said they did not believe the country was trying to precipitate a military attack. 
 ''The hope is that this was a one-off action,'' one official said. ''We have not seen evidence that this is the first step on the road to war.''
 When Mrs. Clinton wraps up her meetings in China next week, she will stop in Seoul, South Korea's capital, to give public backing to President Lee. By then, aides said, there will be clarity on what steps he plans to take.

HEADLINE: Obama Mandates Rules to Raise Fuel Standards

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; John M. Broder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama ordered the government on Friday to develop tougher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, advancing the fight against climate change without waiting for Congress.
 Mr. Obama announced the creation of a national policy that will result in less greenhouse gas pollution from medium- and heavy-duty trucks for the first time, and will further reduce exhaust from cars and light-duty trucks beyond the requirements he had already put in place. 
 ''Today's announcement is an essential part of our energy strategy, but it's not a substitute for other necessary steps,'' Mr. Obama said in a Rose Garden ceremony on Friday, flanked by auto and truck manufacturers. He repeated his hope that Congress would pass an energy bill by the end of the year. ''In the meantime,'' he added, ''I'm going to take every sensible, responsible action that I can take using my authority as president.'' 
 Mr. Obama said that reducing fuel use would save money for businesses and consumers, and he linked his new policy to the enormous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. ''The disaster in the gulf only underscores that, even as we pursue domestic reduction to reduce our reliance on imported oil, our long-term security depends on the development of alternative sources of fuel and new transportation technologies,'' he said.
 The executive memorandum the president signed on Friday orders the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department to develop new fuel and emissions standards more strict than those formalized last month, but the memorandum did not propose specific fuel-economy figures. 
 Under last month's rules, new cars must get at least 35.5 miles to a gallon of fuel, on average, by 2016, in combined city and highway driving. The president's new plan would order further improvements in fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks made in 2017 and beyond, and in medium and heavy trucks made in 2014 through 2018.
 In addition, Mr. Obama's directive orders more federal support for the development of new vehicles like advanced electric cars, and it instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce emissions of other kinds of pollutants by motor vehicles, besides greenhouse gases. 
 Environmentalists hailed the move. ''President Obama's oil savings proposal will reduce our dependence on oil,'' said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. ''More efficient cars and trucks will help to protect families' budgets as well as America's shores.'' 
 Medium and heavy trucks represent only 4 percent of all vehicles on American highways, but they consume more than 20 percent of the fuel used in road transportation, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy organization. Improving the average fuel economy of these trucks by 3.7 miles to the gallon would, by 2030, reduce American oil consumption by 11 billion gallons a year, the group said.
 Mr. Obama said existing technology could improve the fuel economy of tractor-trailers, as an example, by 25 percent. Over all, he said that within 20 years he wants the nation's vehicles to be using half the fuel and produce half the pollution they do today.
 Building cleaner vehicles costs money, but may ultimately save consumers more through lower gasoline bills. The policy already enacted will add about $1,000 to the cost of an average new car by 2016, but save about $3,000 in fuel over the life of the vehicle, according to government officials. 
 Mr. Obama was joined on Friday by environmental leaders and representatives of major truck manufacturers who supported the new policy. Among them were the chief executives of Volvo, Daimler Trucks North America, Cummins and Navistar, the head of the American Trucking Association and a garbage-truck driver in his uniform.
 Manufacturers want a single national standard set over the long term because that is easier to comply with than the patchwork of state and national regulations that had been imposed in the past. 
 Before the president's initial policy a year ago, car and light-truck makers were facing fuel-efficiency standards being developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in response to Congressional legislation; separate greenhouse-gas standards being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act; and the possibility of separate standards enacted in California and 13 other states. 
 ''The federal government is looking 15 years down the road and uniting all the diverse stakeholders to work towards the same national goal,'' Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a statement. Noting the collaboration over the set of rules enacted last month, he added, ''This approach achieved success once before, so we are optimistic that we can do it again.''
 Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, a nonprofit group, said the new policy would promote the use of clean diesel technology. ''Diesel engines offer an unmatched combination of energy efficiency, work capability, reliability and now near-zero-emissions environmental performance,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Five Ways to Outsmart The Market

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
TRYING to pinpoint what's going on with the New York City real estate market right now can be like standing at the shoreline and determining the exact moment the tide turns -- without a tide chart.
 But as sales pick up and open houses draw dozens of prospects instead of single-digit groups, one thing is clear: the rules of the game have changed -- in some ways, for good. The recession has brought about many of the biggest changes, like lower prices, tighter lending standards and historically low interest rates. But technology, too, has had a large impact on the way deals get done, giving everyone access to information that brokers once held close to the vest, and revealing details even they may not have known. (A buyer involved in multiple lawsuits? Thanks, Google!) As buyers and sellers make their way down the path to move-in day, what once seemed like a well-marked highway has become more like a labyrinth. Here are guideposts that can help make sense of the maze:
 MORTGAGE HURDLES 
 If there's one word that sums up the current mortgage application process, it's paperwork. And tighter lending standards mean that many buyers will need more of it. The traditional starting point for buyers has been securing a simple preapproval letter for a mortgage. Now lenders recommend having detailed discussions about a loan before heading to open houses. This way, you can get a jump on collecting all the documents the bank will want to see. ''Three years ago, I got a mortgage literally after conducting a phone call while I was driving,'' said Peter Hamarich, who closed on a studio apartment in Chelsea in April after he and his partner sold their one-bedroom near Lincoln Center. This time, though, things were different. ''I'd bet 90 percent of the documents we submitted we had to submit twice, or submit updated copies,'' Mr. Hamarich said. That paperwork includes tax returns, bank statements and pay stubs, all of which will probably have to be resubmitted as newer versions arrive during a process that can take up to six months. ''Putting the right paperwork together up front really can save you some trouble at the end of the transaction,'' said Bob Donovan, a senior vice president of Bank of America, which recently revamped its Web site to offer buyers more preapplication advice. Another change is that the mortgage commitment letter that banks give to buyers once they have a signed contract is now likely to have conditions attached -- meaning that before the bank will actually issue a check, you may have to undergo a more detailed review of your finances. An unusual deposit in your checking account, for instance, could raise questions about whether someone was helping you with the purchase. Richard Martin, a senior vice president of DE Capital Mortgage, said the goal of gathering up records early on was to head off questions later in the process.
 ''As loan officers, we have to be incredibly detailed and prepared to be able to answer these questions,'' Mr. Martin said. ''We've stepped into a whole new era in the mortgage business, which in a sense we'll never turn back from. All of this stuff is here to stay.''
 THE SEARCH
 The rule of thumb used to be that spring was the busiest time to buy or sell in New York City, but shifting financial winds have changed that pattern. ''Seasonality has been less important in the past couple years,'' said Kenneth Scheff, an executive vice president of Stribling & Associates. ''It's more about the economic news. When the news is good and people feel more secure, there's a rush to buy.''
 Mr. Scheff said pent-up demand led to a strong fourth quarter of 2009, and other brokers reported an earlier-than-usual flurry of spring shoppers hoping to take advantage of the home buyers' tax credit that expired at the end of April.
 That was the motivation for Anne Hunnell Chen and her husband, Cory Chen, first-time buyers who started looking in January and closed on a two-bedroom apartment in lower Harlem on May 10. Although the apartment they bought was one of the first that they saw, they took their time before submitting a bid.
 ''I think we came back to this place three times before we put in an offer,'' Ms. Hunnell Chen said. ''We spent a lot of time walking around the neighborhood, checking out the grocery stores and the commute and things like that.''
 That care reflects today's more cautious buyers. In the boom years, people bought homes without thinking about how long they planned to live there or how long a property might take to sell. Some brokers say they are now advising clients to plan on staying put for at least five years -- or rent instead.
 And when the time does come to sell (you have considered transaction costs, haven't you?), properties that will appeal to a broad base of buyers are looking better than ever.
 Andrew Bartfield, who accepted an offer in April on the Hell's Kitchen loft he put on the market in December, said that the apartment's open floor plan and setting in a converted armory were a draw when he bought it in 2003, but that ''glass and metal'' seemed like the hot thing now. Still, he is happy he has a deal and comfortable with the price.
 ''I don't think it's the same thing I would've gotten two years ago,'' Mr. Bartfield said. ''But I wasn't selling two years ago.''
 PRICING AND NEGOTIATING
 Probably no other factor has affected the negotiation process more than the wealth of real estate data now available online. Web sites like NYTimes.com, StreetEasy and Zillow let buyers in on previously guarded details like how many times a property's price has been cut, how long it has been on the market and how much the owner paid.
 A few more mouse clicks might bring up the recent sales history of every apartment in a given building, and spirited discussions at sites like Brownstoner and Curbed can reveal things like whether a nearby school is noisy.
 Douglas Heddings, the founder of the Heddings Property Group and a blogger about industry ethics at TrueGotham.com, said the new availability of information had foiled some old tricks of the trade. ''Some brokers would take a listing off the market and put it back on as if it were new,'' he said.
 Now, buyers can see the history, and this type of data has given them new ammunition at the negotiating table.
 ''What you're doing is playing poker,'' said Spencer Rascoff, the chief operating officer of Zillow. ''You want to have as much information as possible about what the other person is holding.''
 Tools on Zillow help pinpoint market value by showing the listing discount -- the sales price compared to the last list price -- for similar properties that have recently changed hands. But for those tempted to lob a low-ball offer, brokers report that as prices have come down, deals are happening within 10 percent of the list price and that good, well-priced apartments can generate multiple offers since there are so few of these gems for sale.
 ''We kept hearing, 'It's a buyer's market' -- well, I'm not feeling that,'' said Wendy Weissman, who with her husband has been looking for a one-bedroom prewar apartment in a doorman building since September. They thought for a time in the winter that they had found what they were looking for. But that deal, an estate sale, fell through because the seller lacked a document showing that he was the sole owner, and they began house-hunting again in March.
 ''When I first started to look,'' Ms. Weissman said, ''there seemed to be a lot more inventory. I don't know if we're asking for too much, but I just don't want to settle.''
 THE CONTRACT
 When half a dozen buyers were rushing to outbid one another, the eagerness to get a contract signed could make the review process seem almost a formality. But banks are subjecting buildings as well as buyers to greater scrutiny, and lawyers are advising clients to do the same.
 Along with the well-publicized reluctance of banks to finance purchases in new developments when they are less than 50 percent sold, standards on the financial health of older co-ops have tightened as well. Lenders prefer to see 10 percent of the property's outstanding mortgage in its reserve fund; they also favor owner-occupied buildings over ones with lots of renters.
 Paul Wolsk, a real estate lawyer with Hartman & Craven in Manhattan, said buyers should make sure their lawyers were undertaking similarly detailed due diligence. They should for instance ask about sublease rules and examine the building's financial statements, with an eye toward anomalies like an accounts-receivable change.
 ''Maybe a couple of owners have stopped paying their maintenance because they're protesting some leaks in the building,'' Mr. Wolsk said, adding that the minutes of board meetings could reveal issues like bedbugs, noise problems or an assessment under consideration.
 The biggest sticking point in contract negotiations, he said, is the closing date. Typically 60 to 90 days after the contract is signed, it is subject to delays: a seller who is not ready to move, or a bank that is not ready to issue a check. Most contracts now have a clause making the deal contingent upon the buyer's getting a mortgage.
 ''Three or four years ago, contracts had no contingencies,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Now, sellers are more amenable to having a mortgage contingency because most attorneys for buyers say we're not going to let you sign a contract without one.''
 GETTING TO CLOSING
 If there were a sign flashing above the road to the closing it would read, ''Be prepared for delays.''
 ''The single thing that's extending the period from contract to closing is the lenders,'' said Jesse Gordon, a real estate lawyer at Costello & Gordon in Manhattan, explaining that any conditions in the commitment letter must be addressed before the lender issues a check -- and that these conditions could multiply.
 ''You meet one condition, whether that be providing copies of tax returns or a gift letter, and that leads to five more conditions that need to be satisfied,'' he said, citing as an example questions about deductions on a tax return.
 Appraisals that come in too low and rejections by newly cautious co-op boards are also scuttling deals. In Manhattan, about 65 contracts a month are falling through, according to reports collected by StreetEasy. So buyers should not necessarily feel excluded by an ''in contract'' stamp on a listing, or be surprised if a broker does not add that label to a property that has an accepted offer.
 ''When we contact the broker, usually the broker says, 'I'm showing it for backup,' '' said Michael Smith, the chief executive of StreetEasy, who joked that there should be a new label saying, ''in a committed relationship, but interviewing others.''
 But for all the ways the real estate game has changed, with higher hurdles to jump and a longer course to run, many brokers say that the new data transparency and due diligence in financing have contributed to a healthier housing market for buyers and sellers.
 ''It's a new day out there,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Properties. ''I think we have had some good eye-opening days, and it's probably going to serve all of us long term.''

HEADLINE: Front-Row Seat, to Go? Rock Fans Pay for Perks

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
HERSHEY, Pa. -- Helena Aguiar had come all the way from Sao Paulo, Brazil, for a front-row seat to see her favorite band, and she got it: a black metal folding chair with a gold and cherry-red Bon Jovi logo on the cushion, hers to take home. The price: $1,750.
 ''It was an amazing experience, even more than I dreamed,'' Ms. Aguiar, 25, gushed after the show at Hersheypark Stadium here on Wednesday night, as she packed up her chair and lugged it to the parking lot.
 Nearly a decade after ''The Producers'' introduced the $480 ticket to Broadway, V.I.P. pricing has established itself in the ledgers of rock 'n' roll. This summer Justin Bieber fans can pay $350 to attend a pre-show soundcheck. For $800, Christina Aguilera will pose for a picture. (For $900, Eagles fans get dinner but no photo-op; most packages also include plenty of swag.) 
 At Bon Jovi's three sold-out shows this week at the New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the top package -- which includes the takeaway chair, a leather bag and a catered meal -- is $1,875.
 Once available only for top-dollar tours by the likes of U2 or the Rolling Stones, V.I.P. packages have trickled down to the rank-and-file of live music, as artists try to maximize grosses and reap some of the markup value that the best seats get on resale sites like StubHub.com. And despite the soft economy, promoters have found that hard-core fans are willing to pay premium prices to get red-carpet treatment for their favorite shows.
 ''It's probably the biggest negotiation in any tour deal,'' said Randy Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live, promoter of the Bon Jovi tour. ''On a hot act you can make as much money from 10 percent of the house as the other 90.''
 Four-digit prices are relatively new for the concert business. In 1996 the average ticket to the top 100 tours cost $26, according to Pollstar, an industry trade magazine, but since then it has increased more than 140 percent, to $63. One reason is the collapse of record sales, which has forced artists to rely on touring for most of their income. 
 Artists and their managers say the V.I.P. programs allow them to dote on their biggest fans, rewarding loyalty with special treatment. And many concertgoers leap at the deals. Laurie Huey, a 44-year-old accountant in New Jersey, has bought six various V.I.P. packages for the current Bon Jovi tour, at a cost of about $8,500. She has five Bon Jovi chairs at home and expects to buy even more before the tour is through.
 ''Years ago I used to have to pay a scalper that to get front row,'' Ms. Huey said. ''I would rather pay the Bon Jovi fan club or Ticketmaster and know what I'm getting, because I've gotten burned by scalpers.''
 At Hersheypark, the well-oiled Bon Jovi machine coordinated several levels of backstage access. Members of the fan club got a backstage tour that included a chance to pose for a photo with Jon Bon Jovi's maracas and mic stand, while the non-fan-club V.I.P.'s enjoyed prime rib, prosciutto-wrapped asparagus and white wine in a separate tent. Participants said their experience was well worth the price tag. 
 ''I have money,'' said Jim Leaman, 55, who owns a propane gas company. ''So if I want to come to a show, I want to be up front and I don't care if it costs $100 or $1,000.''
 What fans did not see backstage, however, was Bon Jovi. The more famous the stars, the less available they tend to be to fans, no matter the price. For the ''Glee'' concert tour, which comes to Radio City Music Hall for three nights beginning Friday, a $300 V.I.P. ticket includes a gift bag and a pre-show party, but no cast appearances. (''Glee'' packages, like Bon Jovi's, are long since sold out.)
 But Rick Springfield, the actor and ''Jessie's Girl'' singer, sells ample schmoozing time before and after his shows (for $1,000, which includes a seat on stage) as well as autographed guitars ($600). His manager, Rob Kos, said that access helps develop strong relationships with fans.
 ''Rick's fans are incredibly loyal, which is the reason he's still able to have a career,'' Mr. Kos said. ''He's very cognizant of that.''
 Some consumers, however, see super-premium pricing as little more than exploitation.
 ''The artists are just gouging their fan base,'' said Terrell Lowe, 49, a brewery sales executive and an avid concertgoer in San Francisco. ''The majority of people just can't afford that.''
 The profitability of V.I.P. tickets has spawned an industry within an industry, with numerous companies competing to run artists' fan clubs and develop special merchandise and ticketing packages. Live Nation, the giant concert company that merged with Ticketmaster this year, owns several such firms, including I Love All Access, SLO and Musictoday. 
 Promoters say that premium ticketing offers them two particular benefits. One is that high prices up front can effectively subsidize cheaper seats elsewhere, which leaves more money in fans' pockets to buy extras like food and T-shirts. Another bonus is that since V.I.P. tickets are not often included in general advertisements, artists can reap huge profits while avoiding the stigma of listing very high prices; press releases for Bon Jovi's concerts, for example, give a top price of $150.
 Many in the concert industry still worry that high prices and the conspicuous segregation of crowds into the have-lots and have-somes could backfire.
 ''These aren't just customers,'' said Dan Berkowitz, the founder of CID Entertainment, which organizes V.I.P. programs for Bonnaroo, Coachella and other festivals. ''They are fans who have an emotional attachment to that artist. So if all of a sudden the artist says, 'You can't get close to me unless you've got $1,400,' they're going to lose people.''
 V.I.P. packages are not available on every tour, but the number of acts that avoid them altogether is dwindling. The most prominent is Bruce Springsteen, whose tour last year had a maximum ticket price of $98. In concert he has been known to praise theaters that do not have special V.I.P. boxes.
 Jon Landau, Mr. Springsteen's longtime manager, said he had no plans to add V.I.P. packages for future tours. But he said they are likely to be part of the overall concert landscape for a long time.
 ''If you call something deluxe, if you call something unique,'' Mr. Landau said, ''this is America -- someone will buy it.''

HEADLINE: Graduates' First Job: Marketing Themselves

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THIS spring, college seniors are entering a better job market than the class of 2009 faced. Unfortunately, that is not saying much because 2009 was one of the worst years in the history of hiring.
 Still, hiring of this year's crop of graduates is up 5 percent over the previous year, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. 
 To employers the most desirable majors include accounting, engineering, computing and mathematics, according to Edwin Koc, research director of the association. Companies are also seeking evidence of communication and writing skills, analytical ability and teamwork, Mr. Koc said. 
 Whatever your strengths and weaknesses, you will need to ''bring your A game'' to this job market, said Katharine Brooks, director of liberal arts career services at the University of Texas at Austin and author of a career guide called ''You Majored in What?''
 Dr. Brooks has seen some evidence of an upturn. For example, Facebook just opened an office in Austin with many positions that would be appropriate for new college graduates. But over all, ''we're just talking a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak picture,'' she said. 
 That means you can't be casual about your job search, she said, and your resume, cover letter and interviewing skills must be top notch. 
 Above all, ''you need to be able to articulate the value of your degree,'' she said, especially if you are in the liberal arts, and there isn't a linear connection between what you majored in and the job you are seeking. 
 Take philosophy majors. There aren't a lot of jobs for philosophers. But people use logic to formulate and weigh ideas and to reach conclusions, which can make training in philosophy very effective in the business world, Dr. Brooks said. Being able to spell that out concretely, with specific examples, could be crucial to being hired.
 English majors face similar hurdles. But in most fields, it is important to write and speak clearly and to see things from different perspectives. A graduate with an English degree who tailors those strengths to a particular job description can make a strong case for being hired. 
 An understanding of the human condition gained through great literature can be helpful in professions like social work, Dr. Brooks said. 
 Beyond your major, have stories to tell about how your experiences would make you a good employee, suggested Nathan Bennett, co-author of ''Your Career Game'' and a professor at the Georgia Tech College of Management. And it doesn't have to be work experience. For example, someone who has been a camp counselor will have leadership stories to tell, he said. 
 In this market, graduates need to be flexible about geographic location, job title and salary, Dr. Bennett said. And they should be willing to consider a smaller company rather than a marquee name. 
 Take full advantage of your school's placement office and alumni network, Dr. Bennett said. But ''the trick is not to aim too high.'' If you are applying for a job at a bank, talk to a 25- or 26-year-old alumnus there rather than a 45-year-old, he said, because that person will have a better idea of how to get hired at the entry level. 
 Many new graduates are not sure what they want to do and are worried about taking the wrong job, Dr. Brooks said. Remember that no job needs to be permanent.
 She uses the metaphor of chaos theory to explain the job search process. ''It's a complex world, and you can't predict everything, so don't try to,'' she said. When you are starting in the work force, ''Look for opportunities to learn, take a risk, try things out, see what you like, and always be open to the next opportunity,'' she said. 
 If you don't like your first job, at least you have learned what you don't like, and you can carry that knowledge to your next job, she said.
 Graduates can fall victim to a sense of paralysis if they aren't sure what direction to take, Dr. Bennett said. People in their early 20s have plenty of time to take chances. After all, their working life is probably going to last at least twice as long as their current age, he said.
 Some graduates with little or no work experience may wonder what they have to offer over an applicant with more experience. But recent college graduates are less expensive than more seasoned workers, and that can be an advantage (to the employer, if not the graduate's wallet) in a tougher economy.
 But mainly, businesses hire new graduates as an investment, said Dan Black, Americas director for campus recruiting at Ernst & Young.
 For one thing, younger people tend to have a stronger grasp of the latest technology, Mr. Black said. In addition, this generation of students has been exposed to greater cultural diversity, he said, and they are using the Web and other technology to connect globally. 
 Add the energy and enthusiasm that new graduates tend to possess and their value is clear. As Dr. Brooks put it, ''They may not have the experience, but what they have is potential.''

HEADLINE: Despite Leak, Louisiana Is Still Devoted to Oil

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting from Venice, La.

 BODY:
MORGAN CITY, La. -- In some parts of the country, the sight of oil drifting toward the Louisiana coast, oozing into the fragile marshlands and bringing large parts of the state's economy to a halt, has prompted calls to stop offshore drilling indefinitely, if not altogether. 
 Here, in the middle of things, those calls are few. Here, in fact, the unfolding disaster is not even prompting a reconsideration of the 75th annual Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival.
 ''All systems are go,'' said Lee Delaune, the festival's director, sitting in his cluttered office in a historic house known as Cypress Manor. ''We will honor the two industries as we always do,'' Mr. Delaune said. ''More so probably in grand style, because it's our diamond jubilee.'' 
 Louisiana is an oil state, though and through. A gushing leak off of its coast has not, apparently, changed that. 
 Though local and state politicians are railing against BP and what they consider lax industry regulation and enforcement, it is nearly impossible to find any of them calling for offshore drilling to cease, or even slow down. Louisiana's senators -- Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat, and David Vitter, a Republican -- have both scrambled to be the most prominent voice to argue that the country should not retreat from offshore drilling just because of the spill. Many of their constituents seem to agree.
 ''They're angry, they're frustrated, they're feeling helpless, but they still understand that it is part of the culture and the fabric of the economy,'' said Representative Charlie Melancon, whose district encompasses all of the areas where oil has come ashore. ''It is what it is.''
 In a state that is particularly sensitive to the health of its coastal wetlands, which serve as a barrier against hurricanes, such an attitude might seem odd -- even self-defeating. But as the legendary Gov. Huey P. Long believed with great conviction, a state willing to let others exploit its resources is also a state with considerable leverage. 
 But while Long's taxes on oil paid for schoolbooks, the terms of the trade-off in the coming years may become more directly equivalent: the costly restoration of Louisiana's coastal wetlands, which for decades have been slashed by oil pipelines and canals and are now threatened by crude itself, may be financed in large part by offshore drilling. 
 In the months after Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Landrieu helped push through a federal bill that allowed for greatly expanded deepwater drilling in the gulf but required that 37.5 percent of federal revenues generated be divided among the coastal states.
 According to a formula based on factors including proximity to wells and miles of coastline, Louisiana is the biggest beneficiary of that revenue. And under a state constitutional amendment, it is required to spend the money exclusively on hurricane protection measures and coastal restoration.
 Until 2017, the revenue sharing applies only to new wells, so for now Louisiana is drawing only a small fraction of the royalties it eventually will. (Ms. Landrieu has said that she wants it to apply immediately to existing wells.)
 But Garret Graves, the chairman of the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, said that these potential royalties were not a factor in the state's approach to its natural resources. While officials have pushed for revenue sharing, he said, the oil industry will continue to play a big role here with or without such payments. ''Our state has carried the torch for the country in terms of the oil and gas for years,'' Mr. Graves said. ''It's part of the culture.'' 
 In this he echoed a common refrain: as long as the country maintains its insatiable appetite for oil, Louisiana will be willing to bear many of the risks. The awareness of those risks does not seem to change the state's vigorously pro-industry outlook, though it does reinforce a belief that Louisianans should be compensated for the downsides.
 Cathy Norman, manager of the roughly 40,000 acres of coastal wetlands in the Edward Wisner Donation land trust, knows the risks as well as anyone.
 The land trust she manages includes much of Port Fourchon, the largest onshore support harbor for the deepwater industry in the gulf, but also pristine beaches and mangrove marshlands where, to her horror, she has seen tar balls, sheen and even emulsified crude. Ms. Norman's late husband, Shea Penland, a geologist who died in 2008, was one of the country's most forceful advocates for preservation of the Louisiana's coastal wetlands.
 ''We are a working coastline,'' Ms. Norman said. ''Part of the reason that we are so prolific is because of the delta and because of the geology and geography of the area. It all fits in. It is what we are.''
 Since 1901, when a man named Jules Clement noticed some curious bubbles on his rice farm, this has been an oil state. Nearly 90 percent of the country's offshore rigs and platforms are located on the outer continental shelf off Louisiana, according to the state's office of economic development. The revenue stream from them and from onshore facilities filters throughout the economy, from supply boat companies to rig workers themselves.
 It also seeps into politics, of course, with oil and gas interests routinely showing up as top campaign donors to both parties. 
 Skeptics are now emboldened by the ugly display of the industry's risks.
 ''Somehow some folks have sold our community and citizens the myth that if you don't cooperate, we're just going to go away and you're not going to have a good economy here,'' Marylee Orr, director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, a nonprofit group. 
 Despite its pro-industry policies, Ms. Orr said, Louisiana has continued to be one of the poorest states in the country, raising serious questions as to whether the downsides are worth it.
 ''Welcoming all this industry has not made us a wealthy state,'' she said.
 And yet, while the state's recreational and commercial fishing is now severely at risk, even fishing guides, though angry about the spill, have not soured on offshore drilling. The waters around the rigs and platforms provide them with some of the richest fishing grounds, they say, and the high salaries in the oil industry provide the extra disposable income that fuels their business.
 ''We just want them to clean it up, that's all,'' said Michael Ballay, manager of the Cypress Cove Marina, as he sat in the Harbour Bar and Grill in Venice and surveyed the slips full of luxury fishing boats. ''A lot of our customers that own yachts made their money from the oil field business.''
 And so at the end of summer, the 75th annual Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival will take place as scheduled, with the golf tournament sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, the blessing of the boats by the parish priest and the coronation of the Shrimp and Petroleum king and queen.
 In fact, Mr. Delaune said, curious outsiders have been calling to ask about this odd mix of oilmen and shrimpers. He thinks attendance this year could set a record.

HEADLINE: No Loan? Blame the Building

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IMAGINE finding the perfect co-op or condominium in your dream neighborhood at a fabulous price. Your financials are in order and your credit is good, but the deal falls through. 
 The problem may not be you. It's most likely the building.
 Home buyers in New York, and even those looking to refinance mortgages, face far more hurdles than borrowers in most other real estate markets, particularly with multifamily dwellings. 
 Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored company that sets the lending standards for most mortgages, restricts loans in buildings with too large a share of commercial space, usually beyond 20 percent, or where the building's ownership is concentrated in one person's hands. 
 Freddie Mac, a competing government-sponsored company, has similar restrictions, although Brad German, a spokesman, said Freddie reviews each building on a case-by-case basis
 Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a brokerage firm, advises mortgage shoppers ''to vet your building.''
 ''Most of the time you can get the loan done,'' she said, ''but instead of shopping for the best rate, you have to focus on where you can -- and can't -- go.''
 These issues have confronted borrowers since the mortgage market's contraction began a few years ago, but buyers and mortgage professionals say they have grown more problematic as more people try to capitalize on low home prices and mortgage rates.
 Two of Ms. Cohn's clients exemplify the problems. One borrower recently sought to buy a condo at the Ansonia, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The loan was at first denied, she said, because the building's sponsor still owned about 25 percent of the development. Ms. Cohn said the lender secured a waiver from Fannie Mae, after the agency reviewed the building's financial information in greater depth. ''But it took about three weeks to get the building approved,'' she said.
 Another borrower, Ms. Cohn said, had bought an apartment in downtown Manhattan in 2006 with a $649,000 loan, at a fixed rate of 6.5 percent, and sought to refinance with a mortgage of just under 5 percent. Because 40 percent of the building is made up of commercial tenants, she said, lenders declined the loan. Ms. Cohn said she recently began the appeal process with Fannie Mae.
 Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, said that although there is a strict formula in place, the agency generally remains flexible. 
 Fannie Mae will often look closely at a project's long-term prospects, she said, and a majority of the buildings that undergo this process are granted an ''exception,'' and are therefore eligible for mortgages with the company. 
 Once one borrower is approved for a loan in a certain building, she added, future borrowers in that building need not clear the same hurdles. Those unsure of the building's status can typically obtain that information from the selling agent.
 If a condo or co-op has not yet been approved, borrowers can help their cause by gathering information about the building early in the process, mortgage experts say. A building's managing agent typically fills out a questionnaire, which includes financial information. 
 Borrowers should also seek the financial statements from the previous two years, as well as the current budget and a copy of its master insurance policy. 
 And even if Fannie Mae does not approve a loan, you may still find a mortgage elsewhere. Some lenders will make the loan and will hold it on their own books, rather than selling it to Fannie or Freddie Mac, and they may have less restrictive policies than Fannie and Freddie.
 Borrowers who have an older Fannie Mae loan or a mortgage from Freddie Mac may also sometimes qualify for a refinance loan even if the building does not meet lending guidelines. If borrowers have a clean payment history, according to Ms. Smith of Fannie Mae, their chances improve.

THE PREGNANT WIDOW
 Inside History
 By Martin Amis
 370 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95
 For someone who grew up in a not particularly exciting city in Canada -- yes, yes, that was a joke -- the sexual revolution was something that happened to someone else, somewhere else, most probably in that enchanted, faraway Gomorrah called the United States. I had certainly read about the sexual revolution in magazines like Time, and I was nothing if not eager to take it beyond the theoretical. But the knock on the door never came, and when I left for the rough-and-tumble of New York in the 1970s, I was still waiting for the sexual rebellionto conscript me into its welcoming bosom. 
 We could chat on and on about the dating habits of my beloved homeland -- where even post-marital sex was gently frowned on -- but there is a book to review here. And it is written by Martin Amis, a British foot soldier on the pulsing, sweaty front lines of that era's social sexual upheaval. To Amis, London was a petri dish of sexual experimentation. In his new novel, ''The Pregnant Widow'' he says that sex was everywhere, and that the turning point in the whole affair arrived when girls became sexual aggressors who could pursue their desires and enjoy ''the tingle of license'' just like their male counterparts. Yes, just like guys, minus the pleading.
 To discuss a Martin Amis book, you must first discuss the orchestrated release of a Martin Amis book. In London, which rightly prides itself on the vibrancy of its literary cottage industry, Amis is the Steve Jobs of book promoters, and his product rollouts are as carefully managed as anything Apple dreams up. The Amis campaigns tend to follow a rough pattern. In the first wave are interviews in the broadsheets: The Sunday Times, The Guardian, The Independent, The Telegraph, The Observer and so forth. Amis is photographed or described doing laddish things like playing darts, shooting billiards and drinking in the middle of the day. Names are dropped: Christopher Hitchens, James Fenton, Ian McEwan, Clive James, Philip Larkin and Julian Barnes, with whom Amis had a very public falling-out some years ago.
 There will be the inevitable artistic contrast with his father, Kingsley Amis, an interviewer's dream inasmuch as he was known to proclaim his son's books unreadable. Feature writers will declare the Amises the most significant literary dynasty in living memory. Father and son both burst onto the scene early, shaking up the publishing firmament with bracingly comic, original novels that each heralded a new voice: Kingsley with ''Lucky Jim,'' Martin with ''The Rachel Papers.'' These journalists will then put Amis junior on the spot by reminding him that unlike his father, he has not won the Booker Prize or landed a knighthood. Kingsley was protean in his output well into his 70s. He was also an accomplished womanizer, drinker and conversationalist, and as he aged, he became increasingly and vigorously conservative. (I sat beside him years and years ago at a Private Eye lunch at the magazine's regular spot, the Coach and Horses in Soho, not far from its Greek Street offices. He was funny and raffishly rude, and had the thinnest, whitest skin I've ever seen on a man -- like a condom filled with skim milk.) Finally, there will be descriptions of Martin's lovely home in Primrose Hill, on the same street where his father once lived; his lovely wife, Isabel Fonseca; his lovely kiddies running around the house; and his past conquests as well as his looks, his fame and his fortune.
 As a rule, Amis will make some outlandish statement, generally in jest, that will provide second-day headlines in all the papers. The noted biographer D. J. Taylor is not alone in noticing that Amis does this pretty much anytime he has a book coming out. In the Sunday Times interview for ''The Pregnant Widow,'' for example, Amis envisioned a looming ''silver tsunami'' rolling into Britain. ''There'll be a population of demented very old people, like an invasion of terrible immigrants, stinking out the restaurants and cafes and shops,'' he said, before proposing public euthanasia stands: ''There should be a booth on every corner where you could get a martini and a medal.'' You can imagine how that went over.
 Next come the reviews, which also follow a general pattern. First they rehash the ghastly notices of the previous book, then they express the great hope that this will be a return to the old Martin -- the funny Martin, who gave us ''The Rachel Papers,'' ''Dead Babies,'' ''Success'' and ''Money.'' Then comes the aggrieved disappointment that this book, regardless of its merits, is not the one we were waiting for. Even the compliments are backhanded. When the British publishing journal The Bookseller declared ''The Pregnant Widow'' a ''return to form,'' Amis blanched. ''What's this return?'' he asked. ''He never went away.'' Writing, remember, is the only art in which the creator is publicly judged by people who do precisely the same thing, but as a rule less well. And bubbling beneath the surface of a lot of these interviews and book reviews is resentment.
 ''The Pregnant Widow'' is set largely in 1970, at a castle above an Italian countryside village in Campania, where it just so happens D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Frieda, once stayed. (In this novel, even real estate has a literary provenance.) Like Charles Ryder recalling his time at Brideshead years later, Amis's narrator looks back on the events in that castle from the perspective of the 21st century and reflects on all that happened in their wake. Three students from the University of London have come to stay: the protagonist, Keith; his girlfriend, Lily; and a stunning 20-year-old blonde with all sorts of luxury options and the unlikely name Scheherazade. Keith is both a leg man and a breast man -- a fellow who wants to have his Kate and Edith too, as the saying goes.
 Although Amis announced early on that ''The Pregnant Widow'' (subtitled ''Inside History'') would be ''blindingly autobiographical,'' he tut-tuts when critics try to align the characters with their real-life inspirations. He says that he had been working on a fiercely autobiographical novel, but that two years ago in Uruguay (where he has a second home) he scrapped most of it. Still, as the book opens, his narrator states: ''Everything that follows is true. Italy is true. The castle is true. The girls are all true, and the boys are all true. . . . Not even the names have been changed. Why bother? To protect the innocent? There were no innocent.'' The coy hints really got the fizz up in London's literary cocktail. It has been speculated that Lily was based on Gully Wells, an editor now living in New York, and Scheherazade on Mary Furness, a comely contemporary of Amis's who later took up philosophy.
 Like other evocative descriptions of comfortable worlds on the brink of epic change -- ''The Shooting Party'' before the Great War, ''Vile Bodies'' before the Crash of 1929 -- ''The Pregnant Widow'' depicts the first skirmishes of a revolution from which few will emerge unscathed. Even the title, borrowed from the Russian writer Alexander Herzen, refers to an old order about to be upstaged by a new one: ''The departing world leaves behind it not an heir but a pregnant widow,'' Herzen wrote, ''a long night of chaos and desolation'' in which the old is gone and the new has not yet been born.
 It is good to have a Keith in Amis's hands. This isn't Keith Whitehead, the malignant dwarf of ''Dead Babies'' who briefly resurfaces in ''Success.'' And it's not the Keith Talent of ''London Fields.'' But the simple fact that our boy's name is Keith is a subtle heads-up that we're in for a bit of fun here. This Keith is Keith Nearing, and he happens to share the same birth year as the author (1949) and the same height (''that much-disputed territory between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-7''). Keith, like Amis, also has a sister who will become one of the fallen in the sexual revolution.
 Under the lush summer light of those vast Italian skies, Keith shares a turret with Lily but longs for the sexual affections of Scheherazade. Keith is an aspiring poet who is working his way through the English 101 canon, and there are references to Austen, Eliot, Keats, Shakespeare and the New English Bible. There are nods to Greek mythology, the Iraq war and both world wars. And Amis peppers his prose with etymological references -- ''Nostalgia, from Gk nostos 'return home' + algos 'pain.' The return-home pain of 20 years old'' -- that may strike some readers as appealing and learned but will strike others as a posturing, postmodern affectation.
 All sorts of extras make walk-ons, including a sporty 4-foot-10 accident-prone Italian count (Amis does like dwarfs!), a big-bottomed gold digger named Gloria Beautyman, and Scheherazade's boyfriend, whom Amis describes as ''limply stylish, like a doodle from a talented hand.''
 In the book's present day, Keith is on ''the bullet train of his 50s'' and feeling it. But real time has outpaced the novel, and Martin Amis -- the ''Mick Jagger'' of British fiction -- is now 60 years old and a grandfather. Age is beginning to become an issue. When a writer from The Sunday Times asked what he saw when he looked in the mirror, he told her, ''Don't ask.'' In his memoir, ''Experience,'' Amis describes a scene near the end of Kingsley's life when, in shades of ''The Shining,'' he found his father hunched over the typewriter pecking the word ''seagulls'' over and over. ''Writers die twice,'' Amis wrote in a review of Nabokov's posthumous novel, ''The Original of Laura'': ''Once when the body dies, and once when the talent dies.'' Yet Kingsley was 64 when he won the Booker Prize for ''The Old Devils.'' For that matter, Norman Mailer wrote ''Ancient Evenings'' and ''Harlot's Ghost'' in his 60s, and Amis's friend and mentor Saul Bellow won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Humboldt's Gift'' when he was 60. Topping them completely, Cormac McCarthy won the Pulitzer for ''The Road'' at the ripe old age of 73. And the miraculous Philip Roth, at 77, continues to write high-end books at an alarming rate. So Amis has some time left before he hangs up his laptop.
 However much he fingers the hem of age, it should be said that Amis has still got it -- in the sense that he still has what got him here in the first place. Along with Tom Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson, Amis is one of the true original voices to come along in the last 40 years. The fizzy, smart linguistic fireworks, with their signature italicisms, riffs on the language and stunningly clever, off-center metaphors are certainly evident in ''The Pregnant Widow.'' But this may not be the Roman candle of a novel some of his followers are looking for. Perhaps his next one will do the trick. In the way Steve Jobs announces the new, improved version of the iPad even as he releases the original, Amis has already revealed two of the characters for his next book. One will bear some resemblance to the para-celebrity and Hello magazine regular known as Jordan, whom he once described as ''two bags of silicone,'' and one will be based on Michael Carroll, a ''chav'' who blew almost $15 million in lottery winnings on houses, cars, jewelry, drugs and parties. It is to be called ''The State of England.''
 But if Amis's next book will tell us what we're like now, ''The Pregnant Widow'' tells us what we were like 40 years ago, back when sex was supposed to change everything. To Amis, what matters at the end of the day is ''how it has gone with women.'' And not the conquests so much as the ones who got away. Toward the end of the book we discover that Keith's life is something of a professional and personal disappointment, and that he pinpoints that summer in Italy as the time when the wheels started falling off. It is a touching passage, filled with sadness and regret as he reflects on family and friends, some of them victims of the great sexual revolution. Keith asks a once-frisky character named Rita if she ever had the 10 children she hoped to have. ''I sort of forgot to,'' she says, bursting into tears. ''I just seemed to miss it.''
 Yet there is more comedy than pathos in ''The Pregnant Widow,'' and that's to Amis's credit. In a way, the book is his welcome attempt to return to the old Martin. Like his supremely talented contemporary William Boyd, and like so many other clever, funny novelists, Amis appears to believe that his early success was a card trick, and to have devoted the next several decades laboring to be taken seriously.
 The London Observer called this book a ''romantic farce,'' but don't go expecting Michael Frayn or Peter De Vries. As in many real summer idylls, not a whole lot actually goes on. The book describes a European country house vacation, after all: there is a lot of reading, there are visitors and there are trips into town. And although there are also endless sexually charged afternoons by the pool, you'll get more real action in a Republican romance novel. As much as ''The Pregnant Widow'' is Amis's account of the sexual battlefield and its aftermath -- as much as it contains explicit talk and yearnings and legs and breasts to ache over; as much as it describes dainty washables and other tantalizing elements of the opposite sex's kit to fantasize about -- there's not a heck of a lot of actual sex in the book. It almost took me back to the Canada of my youth.

HEADLINE: Born for Business

 BODY:
MY great-grandfather moved from Jerusalem to Colombia at age 20 because he heard there were business opportunities there. He went from town to town selling textiles on horseback although he didn't speak a word of Spanish.
 When I was about 6, I had a watch that had a game on it. I loaned it to a classmate on weekends, and he gave me money in exchange. One weekend my mom me asked where my watch was. When I told her, she called the boy's mother to apologize and made me return all the money. My father was proud. He said I invented renting. 
 It was a dangerous time in Colombia in the 1980s. Every time the government would pursue the drug dealers, they'd retaliate and bomb government buildings and public places. We'd hear the popping sounds at school. My dad owned a factory that made leather goods, and when I was 9 we were glad to live in the United States for six months while he opened a distribution center in Florida.
 I moved back to the United States in 1994, and in 1998, I graduated from Babson College in Massachusetts with a B.A. in finance and information systems. Working as a management consultant for a while, I analyzed call centers for a bank to determine the effectiveness of its TV advertising. It was boring, but I learned about direct response marketing, which would come in handy later. 
 When I went home to Colombia to visit, my mother would rave about a fitness class she was taking with Alberto Perez, whom everyone calls Beto, that involved a dance routine set to Latin and international music. 
 In 1999, I created a business conference called Latin Venture with a partner, where Latin American entrepreneurs presented their business plans. I got companies like I.B.M. and Telefonica to sponsor it, and I lined up venture capitalists as speakers and panelists. We held the conference in Miami.
 Then three partners and I created Spydre Labs, a business incubator for Latin American entrepreneurs with ideas for Internet businesses. We raised several million dollars and invested in the start-ups we created. 
 Then the tech bubble burst, funding dried up, and I had to let everyone go. I decided to return what remained of the investors' money because my father always taught me that if you're honest and respectful, it will come back to you tenfold.
 My parents had moved to Miami by then, and I had dinner at their house that night. My mother suggested that I talk to Beto about starting a business related to his fitness routine. He had also moved to Florida and was giving fitness classes here.
 He and I met and discovered that neither of us had any money. We decided to start a company anyway, and I asked Alberto Aghion, one of my best friends from childhood, to join us. We wanted to sell home fitness videos directly to consumers, so one night we set up on the beach and had a videographer film a fitness class. We started looking for joint venture partners for producing videos we could market on television. 
 Along with a TV infomercial, the home videos introduced our concept to the public, and when people called wanting to be trained as instructors, the company took off. Zumba Fitness is now in about 50,000 locations in 75 countries. This year we're introducing a game for Nintendo Wii, Xbox and PlayStation. 
 I've learned that if you don't take a risk, that's a risk in itself. I've also learned that your customers are your boss. Our main customers are our instructors, who pay for training. They have their own community on our site, and I listen carefully when they tell me what we need to do in the future.

HEADLINE: Peter G. Rigaurdi

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Riguardi, 49, is the president of the New York operations of Jones Lang LaSalle, a publicly traded company based in Chicago and one of the world's largest commercial real estate brokers.
 Last year, one of his deals included the 550,000-square-foot lease renewal at 1285 Avenue of the Americas.
 Q How's business? 
 A Business is very good. Last year at this time there was a lot of trepidation. In 2010 we see the economy and the real estate market strengthening, and our businesses representing that.
 Q You believe we're well past the bottom then? 
 A In some places we're moving away, and some places we'll probably linger around the bottom a little bit. A testimony that the markets have hit the bottom is that the concession packages stop increasing.
 Q What would a typical package include these days? 
 A A good rule of thumb might be about a month free rent per year of a lease, topping out at a year's free rent, and the work allowances (for tenants redoing the space themselves) are anywhere from $40 to $50 per square foot. A year ago, we probably saw more like a month and quarter of free rent per year and maybe work allowance in the $60- to $70-per-square-foot range.
 Q Are rental rates rising? 
 A The Midtown Class A space is probably trading about 20 percent less than the peak two years ago, but it's trending up from where it was last year. We're starting to see some $115 or $120 rents in elite Park Avenue or Plaza District buildings.
 In Lower Manhattan, it depends. There hasn't been a sustainable amount of leasing activity to draw opinion on it. But I think we're going to see a wave of activity in the financial center.
 Q Speaking of downtown, Jones Lang has been hired by the Port Authority, along with Cushman & Wakefield, to handle negotiations with prospective partners for One World Trade Center. Where does that effort stand?
 A We're talking to developers to be a fee-based adviser on the completion in the marketing of One World Trade Center. We're looking to get their expertise. The teams have short-listed the developers to four.
 Q Who are they? 
 A The top four would be Durst, Related, Boston Properties and Hines. A decision might come perhaps by the summer.
 Q You represented the first tenant of One World Trade Center, Beijing Vantone Industrial, in its deal to lease 191,000 square feet.
 A One of the most challenging deals I ever did was representing the Chinese at the World Trade Center, because it took a few tries to get the deal completed. But the most challenging things at the end of the day when they're completed could be some of the most rewarding.
 Q Any concern that the added office space around ground zero might create a market glut? 
 A I think this market has flourished around 420 million square feet. It could easily add 10 million or more to it.
 Q Tell me about other recent big deals. 
 A We represented the landlord at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, with the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. We represented the landlord at Black Rock; we did the Orrik Herrington & Sutcliffe deal. We represented General Motors in renewing their lease at the General Motors Building. We represent Jet Blue on their headquarters, and hopefully, that'll finish up shortly.
 Q There have been some changes in the brokerage world lately, with the recent merger of Colliers and FirstService Real Estate, for example. Does Jones Lang have its eye on any competing firm? 
 A We're never targeting firms -- they're all good firms -- but if we could find people that would like to be with us, then we'll take advantage of that. We recently improved our position in the investment-sales area, where we brought over a big team from Cushman & Wakefield. Last year we improved our brokerage depth by bringing over a team from Newmark.
 Q Do you see further consolidation in the industry? 
 A I have nothing to say about that.
 Q Why all the sports memorabilia in your office? 
 A My wife likes to say I'm knowledgeable about two things: baseball and real estate.
 I love sports -- I played baseball up until college -- and I have four sons and they love sports. It's a good way for me to relax and to entertain for business by taking people to a hockey game or a baseball game.
 Q Whom do you root for? 
 A I'm a Mets-Rangers-Jets fan.

HEADLINE: In Afghan Fields, a Challenge to Opium's Luster

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
COMBAT OUTPOST HANSON, Afghanistan -- The annual Afghan opium harvest finished this month with production sharply down from last year, Afghan farmers and American military officers say. Now, growers and smugglers who had long been unchallenged here face tough choices created by the poor crop and new government and military pressure. 
 They describe an industry approaching a crossroads.
 As farmers around Marja, the heart of Afghanistan's opium industry, confront harsh environmental conditions and new interdiction efforts, they are also receiving offers of aid in exchange for growing different crops. Both they and the military said that the start of a shift to other sources of income could be possible by the end of this year, when poppy planting would resume. 
 That result is a major aim of the American effort. It is also far from sure. The possibilities for crop transition are uncertain and are undermined by persistent fighting and the limited Afghan government presence. This year's decline in production has also nudged up opium prices, providing an incentive for farmers to consider gambling on future cultivation. 
 Many Afghan farmers say they grow poppy because it earns them significantly more income than any other crop, and because opium, which is nonperishable in the short term, can be brought to market anytime after harvest, making it an ideal product in the uncertainties of a conflict zone.
 Still, several farmers said in interviews that they were willing to plant other crops in the fall, perhaps wheat, and avoid the new risks and perennial turbulence of the opium trade.
 To do so, they said, they would need seeds, fertilizer, agricultural equipment or money. ''If the government of Afghanistan will help us next year, we will not grow poppy,'' said Obidullah, 50, who said he cultivated about six acres of opium-producing poppy this year. Like many Afghans, he uses only one name. 
 His yield, he said, was just a quarter of last year's, because of poor weather and blight. 
 With fighting around Marja heating up again with a seasonal uptick in Taliban activity and what Marines say is an influx of fighters, the state of the area's opium trade is a central element of the conflict between the American and Afghan governments and a complex insurgent and criminal base. It is also a sector of the Afghan economy that the Obama administration hopes to uproot, and thereby demonstrate progress resulting from the so-called Afghan surge, which thus far has shown mixed results. 
 Afghanistan's huge opium crop enriches both the Taliban and corrupt officials, serving as an economic engine for two persistent phenomena bedeviling the country: a resilient insurgency and a government too weak and discredited to defeat it. 
 The industry has also been a sore point with allies and potential allies in the American-led war, who have been alarmed that opium production soared after the Taliban were chased from power in 2001. Heroin derived from Afghan opium has flooded Europe and former Soviet states, causing public health problems, including addiction and the spread of H.I.V.
 Marja and its environs, a network of irrigated farming villages that form a large green belt on an otherwise parched steppe, are now the center of the densest opium-producing zone in the world.
 Before the Marines started their much-publicized offensive into the opium belt in February, their commanders recognized that efforts to reduce drug production in 2010 would meet limitations and risks.
 Opium is derived from the sap of poppy seed pods, and the year's poppy crop had already been planted months before the first helicopters touched down. Moreover, while Afghan law bans the opium trade, American military units here do not have the authority to enforce the country's laws. 
 Even if they did have a mandate to confront the trade head-on, commanders decided that forced eradication would prove counterproductive, because, as one officer said, ''in a population-centric campaign, we don't want to turn the farmers against us.'' 
 But doing nothing was deemed unacceptable, too. As their patrols fanned out and outposts grew and hardened, the Marines did not want to be seen as a foreign constable service guarding an illicit drug zone, especially if the crop underwrote the insurgents who were firing on them and planting hidden bombs. 
 What followed was a complicated end of the poppy season and an attempt by Western forces to position themselves and the farmers for a sharply reduced crop in 2011. 
 Marja is ringed by canals, and Marine units have established checkpoints near all of the bridges leading into and out of the region. American troops now supervise Afghan police officers and soldiers as they search every vehicle passing by. 
 This has made it more difficult to move opium away from the poppy fields, several poppy farmers said. The Marines have also located and destroyed processing labs as part of their operations. 
 For these reasons, poppy farmers said, few farmers have sold this year's harvest. Farmers said they had stockpiled opium instead, hoping that they might more readily sell it later, perhaps after the Marines leave. (Opium, which takes the form of a dark paste, can be stored for years.) 
 In separate interviews, five poppy farmers from Marja or the fields at its edge said their harvest this year was down, depending on the location of the field, 20 to 75 percent. Cold winter weather, hailstorms and blight were all factors, they said. 
 The short supply caused by thinner harvests and interdiction efforts has driven up prices from recent lows caused by the production glut of previous years. This March, farmers sold dry opium for $94 per kilogram, compared with $79 one year ago, said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, representative in Afghanistan for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 
 That 19 percent increase was not offset by the sharp declines many farmers suffered in yields. The American military says these market conditions may have been a factor that led many farmers to participate in a Marine-sponsored program to destroy their poppy plants in exchange for cash payments. 
 The efforts, known as the Marja Accelerated Agricultural Transition Program, offered $300 to farmers for every hectare (2.47 acres) of poppy plowed back into the dirt. In all, nearly 1,900 farmers tilled roughly 17,000 acres of poppy into the soil by early May, in exchange for $2.1 million in payments, according to the military's data. 
 The program required farmers receiving payments to pledge not to grow poppy again. That way, farmers will not be eligible for payments if they replant in the fall and try to collect payments again. 
 Assessing the program's effect remains difficult. In many cases, according to Marines on patrols who had to verify that poppy fields were destroyed, farmers were paid based on estimates of a field's size, which Afghans often inflated. 
 Marines and poppy farmers also agreed that many farmers waited until the end of the season to register for payments. Then they quickly harvested their opium, plowed under the stalks and collected payments nonetheless. 
 ''That was the only bad thing,'' said Cpl. David S. Palmer, who led the squad that provided security for the verification team. ''A lot of people were double-taking on us, and there was nothing we could do about it.'' 
 The more sure value of the program, many Marines said, was its role as a steppingstone. Until the program began, farmers were hesitant to meet with the Marines, officers said. The Taliban threatened to punish local men who cooperated with Americans. At least six men had been beheaded and others were beaten or shot for suspected collaboration. 
 Butwhat began as a trickle of cooperative farmers, a few men registering each day, became a busy queue. By late April, as many as 120 farmers registered in a single day with the Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, one of two infantry battalions in Marja. 
 ''The program has helped us reseize the momentum,'' said Maj. James F. Coffman, the senior civil affairs officer in the battalion. ''The Taliban's murder and intimidation program is still ongoing,'' he added, but through the subsidies, groups of farmers have begun to meet and cooperate with the Americans and Afghan troops. 
 Major Coffman also said the harvest-season engagement provided ''much-needed assistance to some of the poorest people in the world'' and helped prepare for the next phase: distributing seed, fertilizer and equipment to encourage farmers to diversify next year. 
 The ultimate hope, several officers said, is that if security can be improved as American and Afghan units continue to spread through southern Afghanistan, poppy production will fall further, as it has in other provinces where the government's presence has grown and alternative programs have been able to operate. 
 No one can yet say how long it will take for such security conditions to take hold here. Skirmishes continued in the past week, and the sight of civilians moving away from the fighting -- in tractors and trucks piled high with their belongings -- showed that the Taliban were still a powerful presence in Marja. To succeed, any campaign to counter poppy cultivation may require substantial time, civilians and military officials said. 
 ''If the surge succeeds, that may be the end of opium cultivation in the south,'' said Mr. Lemahieu, the United Nations official. ''If it doesn't, there might be three, four years of fighting.''

HEADLINE: Into Kandahar

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- In the postcards of the mind, it is the starkest of all the images of Kandahar, dating back more than 20 years to the period immediately after Soviet troops withdrew from the city, and standing ever since as a grim warning of the folly of foreign military adventures in Afghanistan: hundreds of acres of rubble, whole quarters of the city reduced to fields of blasted concrete and steel, and further out, in the poorer districts, a shattered chocolate-box of a landscape formed by ragged mud walls that had once been home to tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from the war raging in the Afghan hinterland.
 Outfought by the mujahedeen fighters of the 1980s, and desperate to hang on in the city that more than any other symbolizes Afghanistan's history of national resistance, Soviet forces had resorted, like the Americans in Vietnam, to obliteration by bombing. That was as good as an admission that they had lost, and when they finally pulled back across the Hindu Kush, they left behind little by way of a memorial to the 14,000 Soviet troops who lost their lives, or to the Kremlin's tens of billions of wasted rubles, beyond the scrap of blasted helicopters, tanks and armored vehicles that litter Afghanistan to this day. 
 The images of that dismal time came rushing back last week when the Taliban, legatees of the mujahedeen, sent a suicide bomber in a vehicle loaded with nearly a ton of high explosives to attack a NATO convoy in western Kabul, killing at least 18 people, among them five NATO soldiers, four of them officers. In the grisly calculus of the current conflict, the attack was a Taliban triumph, and photographs from the scene pressed the message home. Behind the carnage, like a forbidding sentinel, stood the artillery-blasted ruins of the old royal palace at Darulaman, another monument to the Soviet disaster.
 When I walked through the Kandahar rubble in the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union's collapse, hastened by the imperial overreach in Afghanistan, was barely three years away. Now, like others with experience of that time, I find recollections of the Soviet debacle sounding like a tocsin in the mind, warning of the miseries that await America if the war's trajectory remains as it is, toward expanding influence for the Taliban and their Al Qaeda cohorts, and mounting signs, for the corrupt Kabul government and its frustrated allies, that the war against the Islamic militants may ultimately be unwinnable.
 In the summer of 2010, Kandahar, again, is at the heart of the matter. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the American commander, has been signaling for months that the crucial engagement of the war, aimed at loosing the tentacles the Taliban have wound around the city and its outlying districts, would begin sometime this spring or summer. True to the form he set since taking command in Kabul last year, when he warned that the war was on its way to being lost unless radical new strategies were adopted, the general has left no room for illusion. In effect, he has said, the struggle for Kandahar may determine the outcome of the war.
 That judgment reflects the lessons learned in Iraq, where, with other reporters, I spent years listening to the illusionism of generals ''putting lipstick on a pig,'' as Gen. David H. Petraeus expressed it was his time to retrieve what he could from the disaster unfolding there. No less, the sense that the battle for Kandahar has brought America to a watershed in the war acknowledges the historic, political and strategic importance of the city, and of the province.
 Though Kabul has been the capital for 250 years, Kandahar has been the main crucible of power in Afghanistan since the mid-18th century, when a Kandahari tribal chief, Ahmad Shah Durrani, unified the country and established himself as the first of the Durrani kings, a dynasty that endured until the last monarch, Zahir Shah, was overthrown in 1973. The Communists who ruled until 1992 regarded their competition with the mujahedeen for support from the Kandahari tribes as crucial to their survival, and the two governments since the 1990s -- the Taliban, ousted by the American-led invasion after 9/11, and the current administration of President Hamid Karzai -- have had their roots in Kandahar.
 In a country of perhaps 30 million people, Kandahar's importance goes beyond numbers. The province is thought to have fewer than two million people, perhaps half in Kandahar city and its outlying districts. Most belong to a cluster of powerful tribes -- the Popolzai, Barakzai, Achakzai, Alokozai, Alizai, Ishaqzai, Noorzai and Ghilzai, among others -- who are part of a confederacy known as the Pashtun. They are the politically dominant ethnic group who live, mostly, in the lands between the Hindu Kush mountains and the 1,200-mile border with Pakistan.
 Strategically, Kandahar is critical. It lies at a junction of historic trade routes that served as infiltration routes for the mujahedeen, and now for the Taliban. It is the main entrepot for the opium-and-heroin trafficking that is Afghanistan's economic mainstay and a source of financing for the Taliban, as well as for corrupt tribal leaders who nominally, at least, support the Kabul government -- among them many Afghans and, American officials say, President Karzai's younger half-brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, president of Kandahar's provincial council.
 Most of the 30,000 additional American troops agreed to by President Obama last year have been assigned to the south, and Pentagon officials have acknowledged that what happens in Kandahar is likely to be decisive when Mr. Obama reaches the July 2011 deadline he has set for reassessing America's role in the war.
 General Petraeus, responsible for both wars as head of Central Command, has warned against drawing too many analogies. But to reporters who have covered the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are some compelling similarities. Kandahar and its tribes present some of the same challenges and opportunities as Iraq's Anbar province, where an American outreach to Sunni tribal leaders marked the beginning of a new arc in that war that made an honorable American exit seem thinkable.
 Another similarity has been the American command's readiness, after years of false starts, to honor the military's doctrine of ''lessons learned'' -- in Afghanistan, not only from the mistakes made by earlier American commanders but from the Soviet blunders. Thus, in Kandahar, there will be none of the Stone Age tactics the Soviets used, and probably little bombing at all. General Petraeus and General McChrystal have been reluctant even to call what they plan an offensive, describing it as classic counter-insurgency that relies as heavily on political innovation as on military force. In effect, Kandahar will be the laboratory for warfighting doctrines forged from nearly a decade of fighting in both wars, and from the experience of two generals who have served side by side in both.
 Not that firepower will be irrelevant. General McChrystal, a former Special Forces commander in Iraq, has already had American and British commandos striking fast and hard at selected targets in and around Kandahar, in a bid to ''reduce'' the Taliban's leadership cadres. More American strikes can be expected in outlying districts and on infiltration routes; in the city, fighting will be entrusted mainly to Afghan forces. But the crucial element of the plan will be the pursuit of a political settlement between tribal factions in the city, once they see the losses inflicted on the Taliban.
 If it works, it will be a historic victory. But it is a long shot, as the American generals acknowledge. Not the least of the challenges facing them is the fact that the Taliban have shown signs of becoming, for many Afghans, the lesser of two evils. Loathed as they have been for their medieval brutalities and obscurantism, from their public beheadings to their banning of women from jobs to their ban on almost all forms of public recreation, their directness -- some would say their primitive kind of honesty -- has made for a stark contrast with the Karzai brothers, who are widely despised for their perceived determination to turn government into a machinery for personal power and profit.
 In many of the areas that the Taliban control or decisively influence -- a Pentagon report to Congress in April estimated that 48 of 92 districts it assessed were supportive of the Taliban in March this year, up from 33 in December -- the insurgents have succeeded in establishing at least a facsimile of government. They have named shadow governors, raised taxes and set up courts. Relying on their own lessons learned, they have relented on some of their harsher measures; now they allow children to fly kites and villagers to play soccer, and they have banned, in a decree issued by Mullah Muhammad Omar, who was one of the founders of the Taliban in a village outside Kandahar in 1994, public beheadings for alleged miscreants. (His preference: firing squads.)
 All of that represents a traverse from the Kandahar I returned to in 1996, the year the Taliban completed their sweep of all of Afghanistan south of the Hindu Kush. Having experienced the back-to-the-future of Taliban rule in Kabul, where a group of fighters imprisoned me briefly in a suffocating shipping container for having stubble that failed the test of a six-inch steel strip they used to measure compliance with the Islamic standard for untrimmed beards, I set out for Kandahar to -- well, beard the lion in his den. The city I found was one where a frenzied crowd had gathered to watch as a young widow forced into marriage with an elderly man was taken to the main mosque and stoned to death -- by one of her own children, among others -- for alleged adultery with her husband's 38-year-old son.
 Mullah Omar would not see me, considering American reporters to be infidels. But one of his deputies, a gracious man with a missing eye and leg from his days with the mujahedeen, invited me for a talk at the old royal palace. Over delectable glasses of fresh pomegranate juice, we talked into the night, until he eventually asked me, intently, to offer some advice on an issue vexing the Taliban's ruling council.
 The issue, he said, was what to do with the incidence of homosexuality among Taliban fighters, much of it involving older men and young boys. Should the offenders be buried alive, or taken atop the old city wall and cast down? The question carried me back across the centuries to a time when similar barbarisms were an everyday occurrence in the Christian West. But when I asked my host why the Taliban would resort to such violence, he replied, as if surprised that anybody wound wonder, ''Why not?''
 At that moment, I understood what remains so hard for many in the West to grasp, as our troops fight to secure freedoms for Afghans that we have long enjoyed at home: that for many in Afghanistan, if not the more cosmopolitan, secular class we have chosen as our principal allies, our world and theirs are, indeed, centuries apart, separated by the ancient verities of the Koran, the rhythms of Afghan traditional life, and the absence, in Afghan experience, of anything like the Enlightenment that broadened the liberties of our forebears in the 18th Century. For American commanders seeking an ending in Afghanistan that spares the United States the humiliation visited on the Soviet Union, that could yet prove an impossible divide to cross.

HEADLINE: As American as Cherry Pie

BYLINE: By ANN PATCHETT

 BODY:
I imagine there are plenty of people who travel around the country going to baseball games, and that those people can tell you everything there is to know about the motels near the various stadiums and the quality of the chili dogs. What they know of America's cities they know insofar as it relates to the game: the convenience of the parking, the freshness of the popcorn. Over time, the things that make us travel can also give us a certain kind of expertise. It could be amusement parks, Civil War battlefields, marinas, museums. 
 For me it's independent bookstores. Sure, I occasionally go to a city to speak at a library or college, but most of my travel is bookstore-based. I am a novelist, and when I'm not at home writing a book, I tend to be sitting at a small table in the back of a bookstore trying to sell it. I can tell you who has the best selection of birthday cards, who is still serious about poetry, who's got unusual coffee table books. It isn't just that I dip in and out of bookstores. I stay there for hours looking at the inventory. At the end of the night, I'll go to some hotel I won't remember, eat a grilled cheese sandwich at the bar, and then the next morning I'll fly to another city to see another bookstore. I can remember the fiction sections, the new releases table -- I just can't remember which store was in which town. Like the baseball fan, I blur the details of anything outside the parking lot. Except in this particular story.
 The first time I was sent to Petoskey, Mich., was in 2001. I wasn't happy about it. It was sandwiched into my itinerary among cities like New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. I would have to fly to Detroit, take another flight to Traverse City, rent a car, drive an hour and a half, give a reading, sign some books, get back in the rental car and do the whole thing in reverse. It was such a tight trip that I wasn't even going to get the cheese sandwich. ''It's supposed to be a really great bookstore,'' my publicist said. I said I didn't care. I had already seen really great bookstores, loads of them. She told me I was going anyway.
 Here's a universal truth: The really great places are often the ones that are a drag to get to, and they have been able to remain great places for exactly that reason. Try going to Spear-O-Wigwam Ranch in the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming (rutted dirt road, straight up) or Isle au Haut, off the coast of Maine (you arrive on the mail boat). Petoskey isn't that challenging, but it's certainly off the beaten path. I drove my rental car down two-lane highways that were riddled with fruit stands, vegetable stands, pie stands, all of them nestled in orchards. Maybe I could have driven past one offer of homemade cherry pie, maybe even three or four, but the fifth time I saw the sign I pulled over. I gobbled down my slice by the side of the road: tart cherries, flaky crust, none of that viscous red slime that gave the pie a bad name in the first place. I can't tell you where that particular stand was, and it wouldn't matter anyway. In the intervening years I've eaten a great deal of pie while standing by the side of the road in Michigan. It's all been good. This was only the beginning.
 That first afternoon when I pulled into town I was short on time and sticky from pie. I was tired and distracted. I had work to do and still another plane to catch. But that didn't mean I was blind. There I was in Petoskey. The houses were wide of porch and steep of gable, many of them painted in the colors favored by seventh-grade girls. Petunias dangled from window boxes. Below the town the sun spread its diamond light over Lake Michigan, over the boats and the swimmers and the shore. The small downtown was a throwback to some simpler idea of American vacations, a couple of ice cream stores that sold taffy and fudge, a gift shop with T-shirts in the window that said lake. Imagine the cast of ''Mad Men'' driving out to Michigan in wood-paneled station wagons for the summer. Frank Sinatra playing in the hotel bar. Sophisticated restaurants commingling with pie shops. The world was leafy and dappled, quiet and cool. Within 10 minutes I started to wonder how I could spend the rest of my life in Petoskey.
 Of course the desire to stay in Petoskey has been around as long as the town itself. The Gamble family came without the Procter family. The Wrigleys came, no doubt loaded down with chewing gum. In their day one could expect to see the Quakers of the oats and the Armours of the potted meats in these parts. The C.E.O.'s of the auto industry had homes around here in the era of auto grandeur, and they could still be coming today -- there really is nothing ostentatious about the place that might cause a taxpayer to wonder why the C.E.O. is taking such a fancy vacation. After all, Mario Batali vacations in this region, but so do the regular folk of Michigan, along with the occasional novelist. I was already thinking it would be a fine place to write.
 When I walked into the bookstore of this dreamy little town, at that moment, all the other bookstores I've known in my life fell away. Julie Norcross founded McLean & Eakin Booksellers in 1992, naming it for her two grandmothers. Like the town she comes from, she must have a long history of people falling in love with her at first sight. She's one of those supremely competent individuals who would have made an excellent pioneer. One imagines she could build a sod house in a pinch, but she can also tell a joke, drink a martini, run a business. The books at McLean & Eakin are arranged to beckon, and there are plenty of big chairs to fall into once you heed their call. It is the kind of store where I could happily spend a summer.
 But on that particular day, I only had minutes before I had to get back in the car. Back at the Traverse City airport I bought a paper cup full of cherries (in the airport!) and ate them while I waited for the plane. I cursed the world that would come between me and the place I loved, and I swore an oath on my cup of cherries that I would return. I'm a big one for keeping my oaths.
 The upper tier of the lower peninsula of the state of Michigan is not the most sensible place to vacation when you live in Tennessee, but when did love make sense? I went back that same summer with my husband, who thought that I had, if anything, undersold the charms of the place in my descriptions. We went back many summers after that. Last summer I had to make two stops for work in southern Michigan, a region of the country that has been the hardest hit by the bad economy. There's an eerie sort of quiet down there. There aren't too many cars on the highways, and downtown stores are boarded over. People are home having yard sales. It wasn't exactly the climate to put one in mind
 of rest and relaxation, but it would have been impossible for me to be within a 200-mile radius of Petoskey and not stop in.
 Finished with work, I turned the rental car north. For all of Michigan's woes, Petoskey
 was holding steady. It was the very start of the summer season, and there was a cold wind blowing off the lake, which meant that nothing much was crowded, which meant that I was able to score a premium room at Stafford's Perry Hotel, top floor, end of the hall, balcony overlooking the water. And while the region was still months away from cherries, the orchards were covered over in white blossoms so delicate that the slightest breeze stirred up a blizzard of petals. It makes a person wonder why anyone ever bothers with Japan.
 I called Julie, who immediately invited us for dinner. It was a cold evening and still plenty light out when my husband and I drove out to the Norcross house on Walloon Lake, deep in a piney forest. There we piled into their 1960 Chris-Craft along with various members of the Norcross family and, wrapped in blankets, sped across the lake, past the slender docks, past a summer camp for boys, past Hemingway's boyhood summer home (which, when you see the place, makes so much sense for Hemingway), to the Walloon Lake Inn.
 It turned out to be a night of much anticipation and celebration, because even if the cherry trees had yet to bear fruit, this was the start of morel mushroom season. Walloon Lake Inn, which has some rooms but is mostly about the restaurant, had thrown its whole heart into the moment of the mushrooms. We ate them in soup and grilled on salads and sauteed on whitefish. We would have happily soaked them in our gin and tonics and eaten them on ice cream. Tender, chewy little marvels, they were the harbingers of every good thing that lay ahead in summer.
 I've got no business speaking of tradition in this place. I've never stayed for more than a few days at a time. I've never gone in winter (which, from what I understand, can test the limits of love). Still, I know what I like: strolling through Bay View, a Chautauqua-type summer assembly that was put together by Michigan Methodists in 1875 ''for intellectual and scientific culture and the promotion of the cause of religion and morality.'' If you're just walking through, there's an amazing collection of three-story houses gingerbreaded up to the fare-thee-well. Jesperson's Restaurant is where people go for the famous homemade pies (raves for the banana cream), and American Spoon is a jam and jelly store where I have been known to while away entire afternoons picking out gifts. If you never get to Michigan at all, do yourself a favor and order a jar of its sour cherry preserves.
 If you feel like leaving, and I can't imagine you would, you can get mildly ambitious and drive 15 minutes to Harbor Springs to see the houses on the lake that will remind you that the rich are indeed different from the rest of us, or, if it's late July, you can drive back to Traverse City and catch the film festival that Michael Moore, Michigan's most outspoken son, has brought to his beloved home state. Or you can head up to see Mackinac Island and sit in a rocker on the porch of the Grand Hotel. They will charge you for the pleasure.
 Or, like me, you can go back to the bookstore. I know this is a modern world where books are overnighted to your doorstep and beamed to your hand-held device in under a minute. But even if I went to Petoskey in February and there were no morels and no cherries and no pie, I would still have a good vacation at McLean & Eakin. It is just so thrilling to be around people who read, people who will pull a book off the shelf and say, ''This is the one you want.'' People who want to know what I'm reading and will tell me what they're reading so that while we talk, stacks of books begin to form around us. It's my own personal idea of heaven. It is also, in this age of the overnighted electronic hand-held, a bit of Americana you aren't going to see everywhere. Like the town of Petoskey itself, a very good bookstore feels a little nostalgic, a place out of time. Look at all those people looking at books! It is at once as rare and ordinary as really good pie.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Opens Race With Vow To Fix Albany

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced his candidacy for governor on Saturday, saying he was seeking not only to lead New York but to remake a state mired in political scandal and paralyzed by financial crisis. 
 In a direct confrontation with a Legislature controlled by his own party, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said he would pressure lawmakers this fall to state publicly whether they would embrace essential ethics changes, including disclosing their outside income, ceding control of redistricting to an independent panel and submitting to an outside ethics monitor.
 Appearing in front of the former Manhattan courthouse named for Boss Tweed, the corrupt political boss of Tammany Hall, Mr. Cuomo told a crowd of supporters: ''Unfortunately, Albany's antics today could make Boss Tweed blush. Our message today is simple. Enough is enough.''
 The approach underscores Mr. Cuomo's determination to avoid the fate of the current governor, David A. Paterson, and the previous one, Eliot Spitzer, who both promised change but were quickly stymied by an obstinate Legislature, and later fell victim to their own scandals. 
 In a year in which incumbents everywhere are under attack, Mr. Cuomo is trying to run against Albany, which could be difficult to sell, given his history. He is the son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom he served as political director, and he has deep connections in state and national politics. 
 But Andrew Cuomo is hoping to exploit his broad popularity and his status as the overwhelming favorite in the governor's race to begin overhauling the state before next year.
 His words could be a jolt to rank-and-file Democrats, who consider him a savior capable of restoring their party after several years of embarrassment and disappointment. 
 And the comments could antagonize the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a legendarily shrewd strategist who has outmaneuvered many a governor and has fiercely defended the Legislature's authority to police itself and set its own rules. 
 Mr. Cuomo said that ''politicians of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, share the blame'' for Albany's rash of scandals and corruption. 
 Further, he said, the state government, which is controlled by fellow Democrats, ''has failed and the people have the right, indeed the people have the obligation, to act.''
 In addition to making the appearance in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo released two videos on Saturday, one introducing himself and a longer one detailing his policy positions.
 Wading for the first time into the budget impasse, he said he opposed a plan being pushed by Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch to borrow $6 billion over the next three years in exchange for a series of fiscal controls, including the creation of a financial review board. 
 He also spoke directly to New York's powerful public employee unions, saying he would freeze salaries of state workers. And he said he opposed raising taxes.
 He proposed capping state spending and limiting local property tax increases to no more than 2 percent annually. 
 But his announcement did not grapple with what will be the next governor's greatest challenge: plugging a yawning budget deficit next year.
 Mr. Cuomo made his bid official as Democrats prepared to open their state convention in Rye Brook on Tuesday. He had spent months privately plotting the campaign. 
 His release of the videos, including a 21-minute segment in which he describes his policy positions, is in part a response to criticism that he has ducked questions about what he would do as governor. That criticism has grown louder as the state's economic condition has worsened.
 In the longer video, Mr. Cuomo described his philosophy as ''fiscally prudent and socially progressive,'' and focused mostly on his plans to reshape the government and rein in legislative excesses. 
 Those plans include a proposal to eliminate 20 percent of the state's more than 1,000 agencies, authorities, commissions and the like, part of a broad reorganization effort. 
 He has approached former Vice President Al Gore, who presided over an effort to reinvent government during the Clinton administration, to serve on a reorganization commission in New York.
 Mr. Cuomo also laid out components of an economic agenda, including a plan to create a $3,000-a-head tax credit for businesses that hire unemployed New Yorkers. 
 He described his positions on social issues: He said he supported same-sex marriage, opposed the death penalty and supported increasing the number of charter schools. He pledged to fight discrimination and to further women's rights in the workplace. 
 The Republican primary for governor is expected to come down to a battle between two men: former Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island and the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, who switched his party affiliation in March. Republicans will hold their state convention early next month.
 Mr. Cuomo begins his campaign bolstered by his popularity, at a time when few political figures in the state have much to cheer about in their poll numbers. In a Marist poll this month, 64 percent of voters said they believed Mr. Cuomo was doing either an excellent or a good job.
 Still, it is not clear how much voters know about Mr. Cuomo beyond his family name. In the longer video, he struck a personal note. Appearing in an office, flanked by shelves of law books and photographs of his father, he linked the state's need for revival to his own political and personal rebound. 
 Mr. Cuomo suffered a bruising setback in his abortive run for governor in 2002, when he dropped out of the race after it became clear he would not prevail against H. Carl McCall in a Democratic primary. That loss was followed by a bitter divorce from Kerry Kennedy, the mother of his three daughters.
 ''Sure it's hard to come back,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I saw it in my own life. A few years ago, I ran for governor and I lost. And I then went through a very difficult time in my personal life. It was a public humiliation.
 ''People said it was over for me; they said my public service career was finished -- there was no way I could come back,'' he said. ''Some days even I thought they were right.'' 
 He added, ''With the compassion and empathy of New Yorkers, you gave me a second chance.''
 While Mr. Cuomo's supporters were enthusiastic about his entry into the race, others were more circumspect. Labor leaders had no immediate reaction to his call for austerity, though New York State United Teachers, which has bristled at proposals to increase the number of charter schools or limit property taxes, has indicated it may decline to endorse him.
 Many Democrats see Mr. Cuomo's election as inevitable and are planning for his ascension. 
 Mr. Paterson, who said he had spoken with Mr. Cuomo on Saturday morning, said he would be making some modifications to the sports facilities at the governor's mansion. ''I'm adjusting the basketball rim at the mansion a little lower so he can dunk on it,'' Mr. Paterson joked.

HEADLINE: Sure, It's Big. But Is That Bad?

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
IN the 1990s, Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer, almost single-handedly brought the antitrust weight of the federal government down on that era's high-tech heavyweight, Microsoft. Now Mr. Reback contends there is a dangerous new monopolist in the catbird seat: the search giant Google.
 This month, Mr. Reback shepherded Adam and Shivaun Raff, the husband-and-wife entrepreneurs behind the London comparison shopping site Foundem, around Washington. The three held meetings with Congressional staff members and antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
 Their goal was to air the Foundem couple's complaint that in 2006, Google's supposedly objective algorithms suddenly dropped Foundem into the netherworld of Google search results. They say Google also raised the rates Foundem had to pay to advertise alongside search results. These moves, the couple say, pushed their comparison shopping site out of view, and Google later put the spotlight on its own shopping listings. 
 Google is the ''arbiter of every single thing on the Web, and it favors its properties over everyone else's,'' said Mr. Reback, sitting in a Washington cafe with the couple. ''What it wants to do is control Internet traffic. Anything that undermines its ability to do that is threatening.''
 Google says its mission is to give users the information they're looking for even if that means giving its own content priority and de-emphasizing sites it believes offer poor experiences. ''Telling a search engine that it cannot innovate and show results in a way that benefits users would undermine the very goals of our competition laws,'' says Matthew Bye, a Google lawyer.
 But the search giant's decisions on such matters may soon be judged by higher authorities. Over the last several years, it has become the canonical way to search the Web, an information doorway that dictates what kind of knowledge is visible to the browsing public. That growing market power has generated both sky-high profits and unwanted regulatory attention.
 Almost a decade after Google promised that the creed ''Don't be evil'' would guide its activities, the federal government is examining Google's acquisitions and actions as never before, looking for indications that the company's market power may be anticompetitive in the worlds of Web search and online advertising. 
 ''They are not just on the radar screen. They are the at the center of it,'' said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University and the author of a forthcoming book on technology monopolies, ''The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires.'' ''If you are in the federal government and are interested in antitrust, you are looking at Google.''
 Google has managed to squeak by most regulatory reviews. On Friday, the Federal Trade Commission approved Google's $750 million acquisition of AdMob, a mobile advertising start-up. Staff members had initially planned to oppose the purchase, even saying in a statement that the deal ''raised serious antitrust issues.'' But the agency ultimately endorsed the deal, assuming that Apple's entry in the market would facilitate competition.
 Nevertheless, the search giant may get an indication this summer of just how uncomfortable Washington can get for such dominant firms. Federal Judge Denny Chin is expected to rule in the next few months on Google's amended settlement with authors and book publishers and whether the agreement gives the search giant too much control over the millions of library books that it scanned. The Department of Justice has opposed the settlement on two occasions.
 At the same time, Google's own missteps have prompted a new round of scrutiny. This month, it admitted that its camera-equipped cars, which drive around photographing the world's neighborhoods for Street View images within Google Maps, had inadvertently collected fragments of communications from people using unsecured WiFi networks. Privacy advocates howled, while the F.T.C. and regulators in Europe said they were looking into the matter.
 Taken together, these inquiries are a litmus test for the federal government's willingness to challenge a widely liked and admired company and to take on some profoundly difficult questions. 
 Can monopolies exist online, when competition is only a click away? What constitutes anti-competitive behavior in the complex networked economy, where the very size of big companies allows them to operate more efficiently, and thus grow even bigger? Are consumers harmed if various services are bundled together, but everything is free?
 Google executives acknowledge the scrutiny. ''We're getting larger, and we have been very disruptive within some industries,'' says Alan Davidson, head of United States public policy at Google. ''We know we have a giant bull's-eye on our backs.''
 IN Washington, there is significant disagreement over the proper scope of competition regulation and what the future should hold for Google -- and both sides have big financial stakes.
 On one side are companies like AT&T and Microsoft, which vociferously lobby against Google in the policy arena. 
 AT&T is Google's staunchest foe in the battle over ''net neutrality,'' a term used by Google and others who fear that telecommunications providers might throttle bandwidth for certain Internet services, discouraging innovation. Microsoft provides e-mail and other services in competition with Google and has a rival search engine, Bing, which controls 11.8 percent of the market in the United States. (Google has 64.4 percent, and Yahoo 17.7 percent, according to comScore.) Microsoft is also a paying member, along with Amazon.com and Yahoo, of the Open Book Alliance, a group founded by Mr. Reback to oppose the Google Books settlement.
 Google oozes a confident, seemingly cavalier attitude. Its Washington office, a few blocks from the White House, has all the casual accouterments of other Google spaces, like massage chairs and foosball tables. Furthering the idea of an open, freewheeling atmosphere, the company uses a public meeting space at the office to present regular events that are available to the public, like conversations with authors and a recent panel about home energy use with Carol Browner, a senior energy official at the White House. 
 When it comes to government scrutiny, the company's executives challenge the premise that Google is a monopoly, even as the company's share of the search market inexorably rises, arguing that Google is still a minor player in the overall advertising market, which totals $800 billion a year.
 Google also says that linking prominently to its own services over those of rivals is good for consumers and not malicious. Its famous search algorithm, conceived by one of the founders, Larry Page, at Stanford in the 1990s, uses a series of complex and opaque formulas to rank the sites within a set of search results. The algorithm is responsible for what Google calls the ''organic'' listings that appear on a search results page.
 But increasingly, above and mixed throughout those search listings, Google presents links to its own services, like maps, YouTube videos, local business results and product search listings. Executives argue that providing these easily accessible results clearly benefits users. Rivals claim that this is self-serving, and that Google promotes its content even though there may be better material elsewhere.
 Behind the scenes, Google is taking its challenges in Washington seriously, adding to its staff, increasing expenditures and meeting criticism head-on.
 ''As we have a bigger impact, we have to expect to have more kinds of scrutiny, and we have to adjust,'' said Vic Gundotra, Google's vice president of engineering, when asked whether Google could ever again make large acquisitions, like YouTube, without stiff government resistance. ''It also means we have a lot of resources today that we didn't have when we were tiny. So we have a lot of choices.''
 To fight these and other battles, Google employs a dozen or so policy experts, including nine registered lobbyists, and a public relations staff of four. It also retains at least four Washington public affairs and communications firms.
 According to public records, Google spent more than $4 million lobbying in 2009, a 160 percent increase since 2007. Much of that money was spent through entrenched Washington lobbying firms like the Podesta Group and the Franklin Square Group.
 The search giant is still outgunned by its primary adversaries: AT&T spent $14.7 million on lobbying in 2009. Microsoft spent $6.7 million.
 IN many ways, Google's Washington push appears to be largely successful. In the last few years, the company has won battles over net neutrality, advocated making new parts of the wireless spectrum open to a multitude of devices, gotten all of its acquisitions approved by regulators and kept new privacy laws at bay. 
 Even last month, privacy activists, who have long focused on Google, were frustrated when Congress released a draft of a privacy bill meant to regulate data collection practices on the Web -- which would be a first for the United States.
 Provisions in the bill called for Web sites to discard customer data after 18 months or make it anonymous, and to offer users access to a ''profile manager,'' which would allow them to see why they were being shown certain ads. Both are already policies at Google. The company lobbied while the bill was being written and it was seen as largely favorable to the company.
 The bill ''demonstrated Google's ability to frame the issue to their own benefit,'' said Jeffrey Chester, director of the Center for Digital Democracy. ''Google likely dodged a bullet.'' 
 Google representatives declined to characterize the bill as any kind of legislative victory, saying they still had concerns about it. The response, Google allies say, is consistent with the company's overall attitude in Washington.
 ''They don't want to be a Washington player. They want to be seen as a technology company that explains to Washington what they're doing,'' said Markham C. Erickson, executive director of the Open Internet Coalition, an industry trade group of which Google is a member. 
 Mr. Erickson said that Google executives thought they were doing the right thing for consumers and the Internet, and that simply by educating lawmakers on Google's good intensions, they would ultimately win the day. 
 But even Mr. Erickson acknowledges, ''Once you're big, you're not cute any more.''
 THERE is ample evidence that Washington regulators think Google has already outgrown its cute stage. 
 Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission since last March, has shown his willingness to stand up to Google, most recently with the F.T.C.'s inquiry last year into the board-level relationships among Google and two of its rivals, Amazon and Apple. That investigation caused several prominent Silicon Valley business leaders, including Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, to give up board seats at other companies.
 In January, Howard Shelanski, an F.T.C. economist, underscored the agency's attention to Google. In a speech at the University of Colorado, Mr. Shelanski said that the concern over network neutrality should also apply to a dominant online search engine that might unfairly discriminate against individual companies.
 Though he did not name the search engine, the implication was clear: the F.T.C. was worried that Google could show prejudice against competitors -- exactly the complaint that has been levied by some comparison shopping sites, including Foundem.
 Leading the Department of Justice's antitrust division is Christine A. Varney, an assistant attorney general, who represented Netscape during the antitrust case against Microsoft over its practices promoting Internet Explorer. Ms. Varney has publicly said she thinks Google may merit antitrust scrutiny. ''Microsoft is so last century,'' she said in a 2008 speech. She said Google could be a problem because it had ''acquired a monopoly in Internet online advertising.'' 
 One person at the Department of Justice, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the situation publicly, said that the antitrust division was constantly examining Google's behavior, trying to gauge whether the company was living up to its claims of neutrality. 
 ''Google won a lot of good will by presenting itself as neutral to a lot of different content,'' this person said. ''The question is, are there real examples of chinks in their armor in their claims of neutrality?'' 
 But Google itself may be giving regulators and legislators more reasons to take a closer look. Its collection of private data over WiFi networks followed a similar misstep in February over the Buzz social network, which publicly exposed the contacts of Gmail users with little warning. 
 Google's high-profile mistakes hurt because they convey the impression that Google's behavior is increasingly inconsistent with its ''Don't be evil'' mantra.
 One of Google's founders, Sergey Brin, acknowledged the mistake last week at the company's annual conference for developers in San Francisco. ''We screwed up, and I'm not making excuses about it,'' Mr. Brin said. ''Trust is very important to us, and we're going to do everything we can to preserve it.'' 
 Mr. Reback, the lawyer, is one person who does not trust Google to do the right thing. He is eager to talk about legal remedies to antitrust concerns, including appointing an independent expert to monitor Google's algorithm to ensure that it does not unfairly penalize rivals like Foundem.
 It sounds far-fetched. But Mr. Reback says that a serious conversation has started about Google's power. ''The government is finally onto the notion that they have to start asking questions about Google,'' he said. ''Google started off saying they were going to treat everything on the Web neutrally. That is the basis on which they secured dominance. And now they've changed the rules.''

HEADLINE: Hawaii's Race to the Bottom

 BODY:
Summer vacation for Hawaii's schoolchildren starts on Wednesday. About 170,000 young people will be hitting the beach, the mall, grandma's house, the sofa -- all the places they have already been spending most Fridays for nearly the entire school year. Seventeen school days were sliced out of their educations by a series of school-closing teacher furloughs to help close a nearly $1 billion state budget gap. 
 The furloughs were rightly deplored by parents and denounced by Education Secretary Arne Duncan, and showed Hawaii's political and education establishment at its worst. When the first ''furlough Friday'' happened last October, we didn't imagine that Hawaii -- which has one statewide school district with a lackluster record of achievement -- would slouch through the rest of the school year without getting its kids back in their seats. 
 But it did. Some parents staged a sit-in in the governor's office to no effect. There was no special legislative session. No urgent arm-twisting to raise taxes, cut spending or make other adjustments to teachers' schedules, salaries or benefits so that instruction time could be salvaged. No shared sacrifice, unless you count what the children lost.
 To save the next school year, the Legislature approved a plan in late April to tap $67 million from the state's Hurricane Relief Fund. That would get the teachers back working full time. Gov. Linda Lingle is prepared to release only $57 million. That gap is negligible; so is movement toward a solution. The first of 17 new furlough Fridays is scheduled for Aug. 27, if money is not found. 
 Hawaii, battered by recession, slumping tourism and the high cost of living and fuel, is as burdened by budget woes as any other state. By robbing its students of an adequate education, it is shortchanging its future.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Turns Mark Athletes' Journey

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
HAVERFORD, Pa. -- Each coach at Haverford College has a similar office along one long corridor in the athletic complex.
 Four years ago, Jen Ward's was at the end of the hall, and she was at the end of her rope as a softball coach. She had spent a year trying to recruit a catcher. At the last minute, she got one, but the catcher transferred after one season.
 Ward's only notable recruit that year was an outfielder/pitcher from Green Brook, N.J., Cassandra Searls.
 ''I didn't think of Cassandra as a pitcher,'' Ward said recently, looking back to 2006. ''And while I knew she was a good player, I didn't really know how good.'' Searls became Ward's pitching ace and the team's career home run leader during four winning seasons. 
 A few doors from Ward's office, Coach Dave Beccaria had a similarly perplexing baseball recruiting season. He also wanted a catcher and never got one. ''Plenty of arms, but I'm not sure who will catch them,'' he said.
 In the next four years, pitching depth proved to be a backbone of teams that twice advanced to the Centennial Conference championship game while compiling a record of 90-60-2.
 In the middle of the coaching row, Amy Bergin seemingly had one of the least productive volleyball recruiting seasons four years ago. She had contacted more than 1,000 players and landed two, twins from La Canada, Calif. Rachel and Rebecca Salvo, the ''volleyball twins'' as they are now known on campus, became all-Americans and led Haverford to four conference championships and four N.C.A.A. tournament appearances, including one run to the Round of 16.
 As recruit after recruit went elsewhere in 2006, Bergin was asked how she absorbed the disappointment.
 ''You go home and cry, maybe pound a few beers,'' she said.
 Bergin laughed recently when she was reminded of that remark.
 ''I guess it turned out pretty good after all, huh?'' she said. ''It's crazy when your job is based on the decisions of 17-year-olds. But I'm getting better at it. And I've got two little kids now, so I can't pound beers anymore.''
 The New York Times examined the increasingly competitive athletic recruiting environment at small colleges in a 2005-6 series. For a year, Haverford, a highly selective college outside Philadelphia, granted access to its athletic recruiting and admissions process. 
 The college admitted about 65 recruited athletes, or about 15 percent of the 2006 incoming class. Most of them graduated from Haverford last weekend. 
 Team success is one way to evaluate the value of the recruiting process, and almost universally, Haverford athletics prospered with nine sports winning 23 conference championships in the past four years. It is perhaps just as revealing, and pertinent, to note that about 25 percent of the recruited athletes had limited playing time, or had careers cut short by injuries or chose to pursue other interests.
 The Haverford recruiting class of 2006 included a talented women's soccer player, Monica Stegman, who spent last fall -- what would have been her senior season -- at a marine biology laboratory on Cape Cod.
 ''Academics and other things eventually took precedence,'' said Stegman, who also stopped playing because she feared recurring concussions.
 Another senior, Nick Farina, was a track and field recruit who stopped running because of an ailment that caused him extreme chest pain. Last year, Farina started a blog and a business geared toward advising students on financial matters. He researched the enterprise during a year abroad at Oxford.
 Stefan Pappius-Lefebvre was a recruited pitcher who lost interest in baseball and quit during his freshman year. He returned to play the next two seasons and developed into one of the conference's best pitchers. An arm injury as a senior ended his collegiate career.
 ''I played baseball for a long time,'' said Pappius-Lefebvre, who will enter law school this fall, ''and I know the whole college recruiting thing can be a long and crazy process. It worked out for me; I have known other people who would say otherwise. And that's the biggest message. You better pick a college where you will be happy even if you never play a single game. Because you might not.''
 A vast majority of recruited athletes competed for four years at Haverford. A not insignificant portion of them would probably not have been accepted without their athletic credentials.
 To that end, their graduation represents the culmination of a process that began when many of them were in middle school and started playing on travel teams. That commitment usually led to specialized year-round tutoring, then a grueling regimen of recruiting events and a dizzying schedule of summer camps meant to showcase their talents to college coaches.
 Most of the Haverford athletes were veterans of this demanding and sometimes dehumanizing recruiting routine.
 Four years later, was it all worth it?
 ''It was for me, and I would do it all again tomorrow,'' said Searls, who went to pitching instruction twice a week as a teenager and often missed Thursdays and Fridays in high school to attend softball showcases. 
 Searls, who earned a degree in chemistry, said: ''All that work helped me get into a great academic college where I learned and grew. The youth sports recruiting process is unpredictable and fickle, but without it, I'm not the same person.''
 Brian Fleishhacker, one of Haverford's top lacrosse recruits in 2006, did not disappoint, helping the program reach the N.C.A.A. Division III quarterfinals for the first time last weekend. In high school, Fleishhacker was busy on the recruiting circuit.
 ''It was a lot of work week after week, and maybe you're at some summer camp while other kids are at the beach,'' he said. ''But where you go to college is a huge decision. And every little thing adds up to giving you more exposure and the chance to make the best decision.''
 Fleishhacker, who graduated with a degree in economics, was among 10 lacrosse recruits admitted in 2006, all of them on a list Mike Murphy, then the coach, presented to the admissions department. Murphy hoped their athletic credentials would buttress their academic qualifications, which in most cases were within Haverford's admission standards, or fairly close.
 ''Was it all worth it to take those 10 kids?'' Murphy, now coaching at the University of Pennsylvania, said recently. ''What does opportunity cost? Did they take 10 spots from 10 other kids who weren't athletes? Maybe, maybe not. But I know Haverford is a better place for having those kids around for four years, and not just for all the games they won.''
 Three of Murphy's top 2006 recruits who submitted early-decision applications provide snapshots of the possible outcomes in the ever-evolving recruiting dance.
 Alex Guy, a midfielder from Easton, Md., had his application deferred to the regular decision process.
 ''It was an awful feeling,'' said Guy, who was finally accepted in the spring. 
 But Kevin Friedenberg, a standout lacrosse goalie from Needham, Mass., was rejected outright.
 ''I was devastated,'' he said.
 John-Paul Cashiola of Houston recalled the joy of opening his acceptance letter, which he knew he received in part because he had been the top goalie on Murphy's list.
 Guy was not the significant contributor he expected to be on the field, but he played all four years and graduated last weekend.
 ''I made friends on the team that will last for life,'' said Guy, who will soon apply to graduate schools and hopes to become a college history professor.
 On Sunday, Friedenberg will graduate with a degree in history and English from Swarthmore College -- 10 miles from Haverford, its chief rival. He was a two-time all-conference lacrosse player.
 ''They say everything happens for a reason, and maybe it does,'' Friedenberg said. ''Does Haverford wish I ended up there? Probably. Do I wish that? Not at all.''
 Cashiola never realized his promise as a goalie. He played some as a freshman, lost the starter's job, then sustained a serious back injury that ended his athletic career. Cashiola has taken a year off from his studies but says he expects to graduate from Haverford next year.
 ''I didn't work hard enough as a goalie, and there's no cutting corners at that level,'' said Cashiola, who is working for an international development company in California. ''I wish I had done more. But you could say I used lacrosse as a tool to get a great education, and that is going to serve me well. I'm excited about my future.''
 In the end, Friedenberg, who had a rough ride on the recruiting carousel four years ago, was the most philosophical.
 ''The recruiting process can have some unfortunate outcomes,'' he said. ''But if you look around, one way or another, most of us are doing pretty well. It's a long, wild ride, but we are happy survivors.''

HEADLINE: Before Night Falls

BYLINE: By KEVIN GRAY

 BODY:
My first morning in Bogota brings disturbing news. There on the front page of El Tiempo -- waiting outside the carved doors of my lofty room at the Hotel de la Opera, in the city's rambling colonial neighborhood of La Candelaria -- is a chilling headline. The night before, some 30,000 people had massed in the Parque Metropolitano Simon Bolivar, the sprawling memorial to the continent's boldest revolutionary, to see Coldplay.
 Coldplay? That's what I came to Colombia for? The safest band on the planet playing the safest three chords on the planet? You can get that sort of flimflam in Orlando, Fla. I had heard Bogota was safe for travelers, that the guerrillas who once held the Supreme Court hostage were gone, that the narco thugs had taken up jobs in the booming economy, that galleries and cafes were ascendant. But seriously, Coldplay? 
 Not so long ago, Bogota was a dangerous and deeply sketchy place. In the months after the inauguration of President Alvaro Uribe in August 2002, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's jungle-based leftist guerrillas, bombed the city several times, killing dozens of people. A few blocks south of the city's main square -- the Plaza de Bolivar, flanked by the national congress and the Palace of Justice -- a vast slum once housed 10,000 people, many addicted to pasta de cocaina, or paco, a paste used to process cocaine that can destroy the nervous system. The city leveled the slum in 2005 and built a transportation hub on top. 
 Among the seediest neighborhoods was La Candelaria. Gunfights and knifings were once nightly tragedies. Residents would rush between home and work, then back again, and largely stay indoors. Today the area's narrow streets, lined with Spanish-tiled roofs and Creole iron balconies, some dating back 400 years, are home to a lively mix of artists, activists and students. Upscale cafes sit beside redolent religious icon shops, and local peasants selling fresh grilled corn or loose cigarettes to gringos stand in the shadows of stately museums.
 The Hotel de la Opera turns out to be a good starting place to explore La Candelaria. Set in a pair of 19th-century town houses that once garrisoned Simon Bolivar's personal guards, the hotel is a block from Plaza de Bolivar and one door down from the Teatro Colon. (I woke to the sound of a fellow guest warming up his vocal cords for that night's opera.) From the top-floor cafe, you can see the Escher-esque maze of terra-cotta rooftops and domes and, if your Spanish is good, eavesdrop on the breakfast patter of a congressman and his pretty assistant.
 Bogota sits on a plateau nearly two miles high in the Andes. Its largest peak, Monserrate, looms directly above La Candaleria, topped by a white church where hundreds of pilgrims celebrate Sunday Mass (some crawling on their knees to get there). Along the narrow streets heading up toward Monserrate sit several cultural institutions: the Botero Museum, with its whimsically corpulent mistresses and Madonnas; the two-year-old Centro Cultural Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a modernist structure of blond brick with a bookstore, art galleries and a cafe; and, a few blocks over to the north, the Gold Museum, commemorating Spanish greed and colonial conquest.
 Around lunchtime I stumble into a 250-year-old courtyard lined with iron balconies and palm trees, thinking it was a museum, only to discover La Sociedad, one of the top Colombian restaurants in the city. The tilapia with plantains is excellent, but I have to endure the flat patter of my white-haired Ohio neighbors, lavishly praising their young waiter's broken English. After a quick glimpse of the statues of the divine infant Jesus at the Almacen Relicario, a few doors down, I grab a tamarindo pastry from La Puerta Falsa, the city's oldest confectionery, and begin my own pilgrimage.
 The real Bogota, for my taste, is farther out and up the hill. Past the tourist cafes and candlelit bars -- where the 200-year-old walls are three feet thick -- past the graffitied doors that read no mas paras (''no more paramilitaries''), lies the Chorro de Quevedo, a tiny brick square where Bogota was founded in 1538. Its low walls and dirty steps are littered with tattooed skaters, uniformed schoolchildren and partyers waiting for the clubs to open. The narrow alleys are filled with boutiques and bars. At El Balon de Verde, there's live jazz most days and bossa nova on Sundays. The Merlin, a cavelike cafe in a 200-year-old building with candle wax on the floor and staff in tie-dyed T-shirts, is the gathering place for an underground creative scene -- painters, potters, performance artists.
 Andres Olaya, a 32-year-old with a shaved head and a tuft of green hair sprouting in the back, greets me on the square like a friend. ''There are so many tourists who come here now,'' he tells me. Olaya began studying art at age 12 at Teatro La Candelaria, one of the many schools that give the neighborhood its bohemian edge. He runs a small circus troupe called Artefacto that plies the tourist squares, but he says the Chorro ''is our backyard.''
 Nearby, a chubby young woman in a purple derby practices on a unicycle. A dreadlocked man balances a crystal ball on his forehead. Near a tiny church that flanks the square, a private security guard in a dirty shirt holds a muzzled Rottweiler on a leash. The guards and their muzzled dogs -- like canine Hannibal Lecters -- are a disturbingly common sight all over the city. ''It's not as safe here as you think,'' says Olaya, who has gang-script tattoos on his forearms that read (alternately) cirkus clowns. ''The day is O.K., but not the night.'' The unicyclist, a street performer from Spain, pulls me over to a dusty tree and shows me blood splattered on the paving stones near the tree's roots. ''Last night, one man stabbed another man right here,'' she says. ''I never feel safe here.''
 Bogota indeed has deep shadows. As in any city of 7.3 million grappling with drugs and poverty, you can find trouble or it can find you. For me, part of the city's appeal is this dark, struggling soul. But it is also true that Bogota is a safer place today than in the days of Pablo Escobar, particularly in the gentrifying northern neighborhoods of Usaquen and Zona T, on the other side of town from the Chorro. In 1993, homicides hit a peak at 4,378. By last year, it had dropped 80 percent, to 1,307. Robberies, on the other hand, have risen from 7,675 in 2000 to 11,057 in 2008. The drop in violence is thanks to tough-on-crime security measures -- the Rottweilers, along with riot cops in body armor, who regularly swarm public squares and have earned themselves the nickname RoboCops.
 For the most part, Bogota has a right to proclaim its status as a safer place, even if the attempt can be awkward. The Colombian tourism office goes out of its way to compare Bogota's crime rate favorably with Miami's. Its unusual slogan is: ''Colombia, the only risk is wanting to stay.'' 
 ''The entire world now looks to Colombia as a place for vacation, conventions, adventure, culture, history,'' says Luis Guillermo Plata, Colombia's minister of tourism. The pitch seems to be working. Foreign visitors who once bypassed Bogota for the north-coast beaches of Barranquilla or the colonial charm of Cartegena are now putting the city on their itineraries. The number of foreigners visiting the city has nearly doubled over the past six years, and 11 new hotels have opened, with 18 more under construction.
 The city's striving spirit is on full display Friday afternoons, when the city shuts down Carrera Septima (Seventh Avenue), in the central business district, for its weekly pedestrian-only Septimazo. The streets are filled with handicrafts, jugglers, men who make their living polishing leather jackets and businessmen holding briefcases and eating ice cream. The flashy Club de Billares Londres, with its chrome stairway and brass lanterns hanging over its pool tables, is empty as it prepares for another fashion shoot and film party. Nearby, the family-run San Isidro bakery is desolate -- but wait until 5 a.m., when the postbar crowd comes looking for breakfast.
 ''The workers who come from the south will stay in the center all night dancing,'' says Margarita Maria Bedoya, a 35-year-old former commercial TV producer who moved here from Cali a decade ago. We are having a heavy lunch at El Envigadeno, an out-of-the-way place hidden behind a pair of blue corrugated doors. The restaurant serves a meat-rich, northern Antioquian cuisine and is never mentioned in guidebooks. 
 Bedoya likes to salsa dance, but she never goes to the fashionable clubs in the north of the city. ''In the north, you have to be beautiful, and maybe they don't let you alone, the men,'' says Bedoya, who is plenty pretty herself. She left Cali because of the drug wars there but has seen many of her countrymen return to Colombia in the past few years. ''Everybody is coming back.'' A wooden plate the size of a wagon wheel arrives at our table, packed with beef, pork, chorizo, rice and beans. ''Do you know this music?'' she asks, gesturing to the speaker at our table. ''It is called musica del despecho, music of bad woman and broken hearts.'' I ask if there are dance clubs here in the center where we can go. ''No, it is dangerous for foreigners. You are better off in the north.'' Then she begins to sing to the music, wagging her finger at me, mouthing no, no, no, no.
 ''Foreign people come here to escape safety,'' says Richard, a 32-year-old Scandinavian seafood importer. ''Western countries are too arranged and safe. There's nothing to be done, no more adventure.'' (Richard asked that I not use his last name because he's careful to keep his professional and social lives separate.)
 It is a chilly spring Saturday night, and we are in a bustling club in the Zona T, the upscale neighborhood in the north named for the T-shaped pedestrian strip at its center. The area has about 50 clubs and bars, each pulsating with reggaeton, dance, salsa or house music. Richard, a tall, friendly and good-looking blond, is yelling over the chatter of Bogota's yuppied classes, fresh from work in blue suits or demure skirts, or else pimped out in Adidas sneakers (men) or sparkly heels (women) and cleavage-baring tops (both).
 The street is congested with thousands of revelers, each one better looking than the last. By my count -- and I am counting closely -- women outnumber men three to one. ''Women are the main tourist attraction here, don't let anyone fool you on that,'' Richard says. ''That and cocaine.'' He gives me a knowing wink. ''You know cocaine, ya?''
 Well, ya, I say. But I tell him I had the impression that while Colombia is the largest exporter of the drug to the United States, it is frowned upon by polite society here. We are with a crowd of a half dozen people, and a young woman looks at me appalled. ''Why do you people always speak of cocaine?'' she says. ''Where do you see cocaine?''
 I mutter an apology, but a young Colombian pipes up: ''Give me 60,000 pesos right now and I will get you cocaine.'' I try to explain that I am only doing research. Everyone laughs. ''60,000 pesos!'' the man says. ''It is no problem. Enough to fill a child's sock!'' 
 Partying in the Zona T means three things: drinking, dancing and chasing the opposite sex (or the same sex, depending). To this end, the people I have fallen in with are well disposed to offer their advice and their example, but mostly by way of failure this night. Anders Westman, a 53-year-old Michiganite with tanned model looks and a rooster tail of blond bangs, just arrived in Bogota after attending Carnaval up north. He is a South American playboy by nature and by admission. ''I had more game in Barranquilla than any place,'' he says good-naturedly. ''The women in the north are wonderful. They never see gringos.''
 The streets are mobbed with glamour packs checking each other out, looking for the next disco, for more aguardiente -- a local sambuca-like liquor -- and dancing. We pull into a cavernous club called Spin and sit outdoors beneath a large leafy tree. On a nearby street, Ninja motorcycles roar past, the drivers wearing the distinctive orange vests emblazoned with license-plate numbers that are required by law, to fight drive-by thefts and killings. The night air is aromatic with flowers, cigars, perfume and the drifting exhaust of the bikes.
 ''Can I use your cellphone?'' asks a young American man I'd just met. He had recently discovered that his Colombian girlfriend of eight months is married. (He asked not to be indentified because he fears for his safety.) He texts her an angry missive and regrets it. ''I'm starting to feel this place close in on me,'' he says. ''I need to move to Costa Rica.''
 Inside the bar, the D.J. in his glass booth is blasting Daddy Yankee's ''Gasolina.'' A hundred girls are on the dance floor while a two-story-tall projection screen shows incongruously calm images of beach and surf, like the B-roll video in a karaoke bar. The bartender looks like Kim Cattrall. A member of our party excitedly introduces me and she smiles broadly while shaking a cocktail, asking about New York.
 While the bartender flirts with me, Westman comes in from outside and starts talking in my other ear: ''Your American friend needs to learn about Colombian women. He needs to ask what their daily life was like -- growing up in poverty with a complete breakdown of safety.'' He looks around, his dazzling teeth breaking into a smile as a group of teenage girls staggers past. ''We will never understand Colombians. 
 You fall in love with the first beautiful woman you would never get back home. You must ask: What does she want?''
 The crowd is now jumping up and down to Lady Gaga's ''Poker Face.'' Kim Cattrall comes out from behind the bar and starts fist pumping and swinging her hair around. She pulls me onto the dance floor. But I don't dance and it's awkward. She doesn't seem to mind or even notice. Westman comes by and claps me on the back to tell me he and his friends are leaving and says, ''So now you have a Colombian girlfriend.''
 On Sunday morning, with my head aching from too much aguardiente, I hop into an S.U.V. and cruise the deserted but oddly clean streets of Zona T. The driver is Berny Silberwasser, a 36-year-old Bogotano I met through a friend who lives in Usaquen. He's one of the city's biggest success stories. In 2001, Silberwasser (whose grandfather immigrated to Colombia from Germany) started the Bogota Beer Company. Today the brewery has 10 pubs throughout the city, and his business is still growing.
 We are headed to Usaquen, a charming and remote-feeling little neighborhood farther north, where one of the city's most vibrant and eclectic flea markets sets up every Sunday. A former town that is now part of the city, it's where rich Bogotanos had weekend homes and ranches. Its green is dominated by a colonial church on the north, and it still feels like a rural village.
 On Sundays the neighborhood is thronged with tourists and locals escaping the city center. They come to hear cuenteros, or storytellers, who draw crowds of up to 200 people on the steps near the church. They come to buy indigenous bracelets from dirty-fingered little girls, who braid them into images of Che Guevara or scorpions. The sun-drenched streets today are filled with people selling puppies, pushing schnauzers in baby strollers or draping Labradors over their arms as they pass through the crowds.
 ''There is a generation of Colombians who have never seen parts of Colombia,'' Silberwasser says when we get to Abasto, a cafe in Usaquen where we are having brunch. ''They could not travel outside the cities because, rich or poor, you would get kidnapped. Now people have little farms outside the city and they can travel freely.''
 We are sitting on vintage stuffed couches and large leather chairs, classical music playing overhead, in the back of the restaurant, a house built in the 1940s. Fresh bananas hang from the ceiling, and the walls are done in Caribbean blues and reds. One of Abasto's owners and its chef, Luz Beatriz Velez, appears in a white cook's coat. She is slight and gentle and friendly and looks an awful lot like Joan Baez would if she cooked.
 Velez knows Silberwasser well and makes small talk with our group, asking about families. Manuel Maiguashca, a former deputy minister of energy and mines, has taken me aside to praise the work of President Uribe, under whom he served for six and a half years. ''The security has led to the opening up of oil and energy exploration,'' says Maiguashca, who biked here from his house 20 minutes away and is wearing jeans and a zip-up sweater. 
 ''Did you hear?'' Maiguashca says to the group. ''There were 23 private jets from Argentina that arrived for the Coldplay concert. If that doesn't tell you Bogota is safe, I don't know what does.'' We all dig into our eggs and arepas as Velez brings around fresh espressos. I ask if it's at all unusual, having a large band like Coldplay play outdoors in Bogota. ''Oh, it would not have happened five years ago,'' Maiguashca says. ''And do you know who is coming next week?'' I'm afraid to find out. He leans close. ''Metallica,'' he says happily.

HEADLINE: So, You Think It's African Dance?

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
EVERY year the Brooklyn Academy of Music holds its DanceAfrica festival. Other cities have their own versions, and they serve a purpose in modern America -- honoring traditions that were for centuries ignored and repressed -- that a DanceEurope festival would not. But on such occasions it's too easy to refer to ''African dance'' as if it were a single genre. 
 What is African dance? ''I certainly don't know,'' Judith Jamison, the departing artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, exclaimed in a recent interview: ''Africa is a con-ti-nent!'' 
 Actually, the term is often applied to mean West African dance alone. That geographical area has a particular resonance: many slaves in America were taken from West Africa. 
 Yet who thinks that everyone across West Africa dances alike? And what about the rest of Africa? The Brooklyn festival, which begins on Friday, wisely bypasses those issues. In its 33 years, it has included dances from all over, including the African diaspora. 
 The cliched view of ''African dance'' goes like this: It uses the pelvis all the time and in a much livelier way than the dance of any other continent; the dancers wear wonderfully bright costumes; there's a lot of drumming (the word ''polyrhythms'' may be added here); the costumes are bright; and of course it's all perfectly marvelous. 
 Yet this exaggerated generalization was once useful, especially for African-Americans re-embracing a heritage that had long been maligned. The label ''African dance'' helped introduce traditional forms to many Americans. It brought revelations, and it helped advance the causes of civil rights and black power in the United States.
 The first stages of reclaiming Africa's dance heritage were often arduous. The scholar Doris Green remembers that when the national dance company of Guinea, Les Ballets Africains, first came to America in 1959 after great success in Paris, the appearance of bare-breasted women caused offense here. Insults were hurled. One reporter, she recalls, referred to the performers as ''savages.'' 
 The choreographer Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, artistic director of the troupe Urban Bush Women, recalls how, growing up in a largely segregated community in Kansas City, Mo., in the 1950s, ''we never said we were of African descent.'' She added, ''Our idea of how people moved in Africa came from Tarzan movies: I honestly grew up imagining that everyone there swung from the trees.'' 
 To switch from these still-fresh memories to the situation today is startling. It's now evident that African dance should no longer be lumped together as a single category but parsed as pure artistry. The area is as diverse as it is fecund. 
 It may help to say what African dance is not. No African dance can be ''authentic'' as performed in America. Chuck Davis, the founder of the Brooklyn event, explained in a phone interview: ''We try to show African dances accurately; but they're theatrical presentations. Authenticity happens in the space and on the soil.'' 
 Further, Ms. Green said, many African languages have no word for ''dance.'' The words that define movement to music as dance all come from the languages of the colonizers. Throughout the continent, what we call dance is an automatic part of ceremony and social function. For Mr. Davis, it is even more important to know a dance's intent than its music. Each dance marks some occasion: work, family, season, age. 
 Examples of these burst into life in conversation with Mouminatou Camara. Formerly a dancer with Les Ballet Africains, today a teacher in New York and elsewhere, she specializes in the dances of Guinea. And she describes dances for male and female rites of passage, full-moon dances of courtship, dances of male strength, working line-dances for men, dances for older men, hunting dances, all-female dances and Saturday-night dances before the Sunday wedding. 
 It's the contrast between one African dance and another that the choreographer Reggie Wilson, who has traveled widely, finds staggering. ''When I first went to West Africa, my whole brain exploded,'' he said in an interview. ''I'm still picking the pieces off the wall.'' 
 Mr. Wilson remembers growing up in Milwaukee as black, then Afro-American: ''By the time I got to high school I was African-American.'' His family can trace its lineage to the early 1800s in the Mississippi Delta; his curiosity about his roots led him there, then to Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and then to Africa. 
 For him, the greatest revelation came in the contrast between the gestural Adowa of Anglophone Ghana and the ecstatic Sabar of Francophone Senegal. Whereas the lively but contained Adowa (which began as a dance for royal funerals) may tell stories with the hands, Sabar has been called the ancestor of street dance. ''It's all limbs!'' Mr. Wilson exclaimed. YouTube clips show how Sabar dancers hurl their legs and arms back and forth with phenomenal intensity, sometimes do rapid-fire turns and often explode into the air in jumps. 
 Ms. Green vividly recalled the sensation that Sabar caused when it was first shown at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1971. ''It changed forever ideas here about how African women could move,'' she said. Other African forms had shown women in dainty and time-marking steps; in Sabar they were extraordinarily bold and energetic. ''At that time black people had just emerged from the terrible '60s and were defiantly using the slogan 'I am black and proud.' The Senegalese paralyzed the audience with their remarkable dancing, singing and drumming. The public had never seen anything so spectacular.'' 
 Ms. Green has spent decades recording and notating dances in Africa. Ms. Zollar has made far fewer visits, and while she notes the wealth of contemporary dance and club dancing there, she, too, speaks of the marvel of Sabar. ''Sabar is a verb, a noun, an adjective,'' Ms. Zollar said. ''It's old but it's dynamic; it's tradition that isn't static. It's for the whole community.'' 
 It's obvious that different parts of the body are used in different ways in various dances. Ms. Camara demonstrated how one dance from Guinea can emphasize the head while another tips the pelvis from side to side, but in each no part of the body is still. That's crucial to the forms of that country, she said: ''The whole body moves.'' What about the cliche that the pelvis plays a constant and central part in all African movement? Ms. Green debunked this theory by pointing to YouTube clips of Adowa, in which the upper body leads, and Zaouli (from Ivory Coast), in which the feet pulsate as if on hot coals. If there is a pervasive approach to the use of the body, Ms. Zollar said, it's simply that there is no taboo. 
 Virtually all traditional African dances, however, are tied to music-making. In most traditional ones, that music is the language of drumming, but Ms. Green cites exceptions. The jumping Masai (of Kenya and northern Tanzania), for example, sing their own music while they move. But in all the forms she knows, the connection of music and dance is profound, she said, adding, ''Every move corresponds to a beat; every beat prompts a move.'' She beat a rhythm with her hands on the table. ''And when I hear that'' -- marking one stress -- ''then I know I've got to turn,'' she explained.
 These discoveries have had powerful effects on American dance makers. For Urban Bush Women, which she helped found in 1984, Ms. Zollar has been drawing on African-derived traditions from jazz to dance ideas from Zimbabwe, say, or Guadeloupe. 
 Mr. Wilson recalls that his studies in New York included kinesiology, anatomy, the techniques of Martha Graham and Lester Horton, and the work of Merce Cunningham. In an African village, he said, he would encounter ''a step that the elders are doing, and you think it's going to be a variation of some rhythm you know,'' he said. ''But then,'' he continued, ''someone moves some part of the body and you think 'That's not possible!' To me the possibilities of the experimental avant-garde are not greater than the experiences I've had traveling in the African diaspora.'' 
 In recent decades, students of traditional forms have not all been of African descent, and interest is clearly widespread. As a teacher, with a class schedule that includes Broadway, Brooklyn, Japan and Sweden, Ms. Camara speaks of this with enthusiasm. Mr. Wilson said that while almost all the African dances taught in New York are from West Africa, he had also seen Central African steps executed with real skill at an arts center in Oakland, Calif. 
 For Mr. Wilson and others, the ways in which African dance forms have become more widely available has enriched their sense of what it is to be African-American. Ms. Zollar said, ''I would go further: I would add that it is changing the sense of what it is to be American, and the larger world's sense of what it is to be American, too.'' 
 ''It's still a gradual process,'' she added. ''In New York, I find the dance audience is very segregated except when I go to the Ailey company or to Harlem Stage. But there's a growing sense of diversity, of different kinds of heritage.''
 It's hard, as these experts outline an abundance of dance, not to feel a romantic version of Africa and its extraordinary dance vitality. All of them speak of ''the village'' as a wellspring, and the divergences between the forms of one village and another can be thrilling. But Ms. Zollar cautioned against ''a longing to keep Africa in the same unchanged silo.'' 
 Even if desirable, no such unaltered state is possible. Ms. Green, referring to the traditional forms, stated flatly: ''The dances are dying.'' Colonialism had already damaged some African dance traditions. (There are regions where drumming was banned, for instance.) In some areas, Islam has also created ambivalence about dancing. As a girl growing up in a Muslim family over 30 years ago, Ms. Camara encountered parental opposition when she first took to dance. 
 Economic hardship and social change also pose threats. On her return visits to Guinea, Ms. Camara has tried to consult the elders. Many of the experts she knows, though, have left Guinea. 
 Ms. Green speaks with particular dismay of the ways in which dance and music are now often taught separately in Africa. ''If you don't know both, you don't know the dance at all.'' A fervent advocate of dance notation, she insists that hers will be ''the salvation'' of these traditions. 
 The years to come can only bring further changes, both in the practice of such dances and in how they are perceived. Just now, their profusion -- on the stage, in the classroom, in festivals, on YouTube -- is a welcome and multilayered phenomenon. As Mr. Davis tells African-Americans who learn these dances, ''You've got the best of both worlds -- you're Now, and you're making contact with Then.''

HEADLINE: Suddenly, the Rating Agencies Don't Look Untouchable

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
RON GRASSI will admit that when he decided to sue the three major rating agencies in early 2009, he was too enraged to think about his odds. A retired family law specialist who lives in California, he filed his suit in a low boil a few months after $40,000 in Lehman Brothers corporate bonds he owned all but vanished when the investment bank collapsed.
 At first, he was furious at the bank. But then he decided the true villains were the rating agencies that had stamped those now-worthless bonds with high grades.
 ''My friends were complaining and moaning about what had happened on Wall Street, but nobody was doing anything about it,'' says Mr. Grassi, 69. ''By sheer coincidence, there's a state court a few blocks from where I live in Tahoe City, and one day I walked down there, filled out a two-page form and sued.'' 
 Since then, he has forced the defendants -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- to spend a small fortune on legal fees. At one hearing, the companies sent no less than nine lawyers. Unfortunately for Mr. Grassi, little else about his lawsuit has gone as planned. Currently he's appealing a judge's decision in March to dismiss his case.
 His solo legal assault is unique, but his results, it turns out, are not. There are roughly 30 lawsuits aimed at the rating agencies, and though many of the battles, including Mr. Grassi's, are still unfolding, this much is clear: in the realm of private litigation, so far, the rating agencies are winning. Of the 15 motions to dismiss already acted on by judges, the rating agencies have prevailed 12 times, according to the Standard & Poor's legal team, which keeps a running tally. In addition, five cases have been dropped.
 ''We're making good progress in the courts and believe the remaining claims are without merit,'' says Ted Smyth, an executive vice president at McGraw-Hill, which owns S.& P. Michael Adler, a Moody's spokesman, says that ''in many cases these suits have been found to be without merit, and we will continue to vigorously defend against these suits as appropriate.'' Fitch declined to comment.
 It's an impressive run of victories, of a piece with the industry's nearly perfect litigation record over the years. But it is just about the only good news the rating agencies can point to these days.
 The streak of dismissals notwithstanding, several major lawsuits against the rating agencies have survived the pretrial phase and might -- emphasis on might -- end with huge jury verdicts or expensive settlements. In addition, a newly emboldened Congress is on the verge of overhauling financial regulation and could rewrite the rules of the industry.
 For S.& P., Moody's and Fitch, this is a war on two fronts. And while fought in vastly different realms -- in courts and in Washington -- the fights have this in common: either could wind up costing the rating agencies vast sums of money.
 ''I'm not seeing any signals that hedge funds are pouring in to short these stocks, like we saw with Lehman and Bear Stearns,'' says Adam Savett of RiskMetrics, a corporate advisory firm. ''But if the ratings agencies lose some of these battles, and especially if we see a big jury verdict, there will be blood in the water, and the sharks are going to swim.''
 The threat from Washington is relatively new. For months, it looked as though S.& P., Moody's and Fitch would escape the regulatory overhaul relatively unscathed.
 But on Thursday the Senate passed a bill that included two notable ratings-related amendments. The first, by Senator George LeMieux, Republican of Florida, would strip from federal laws a requirement that a variety of institutional buyers -- including banks, insurers and money market funds -- buy only products stamped with a high grade by a rating agency. The idea is to encourage bond buyers to conduct their own research, or think creatively about outsourcing that job, instead of reflexively relying on S.& P., Moody's and Fitch. The big three rating agencies, the amendment's supporters hope, would no longer be the default raters for Wall Street.
 Then there's the amendment from Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, which is an attempt to upend the conflict of interest that has been at the heart of the rating agencies for some 30 years. Currently, bond issuers pay for grades to their products, giving rating agencies a financial incentive to provide high grades. Senator Franken's amendment calls for the creation of a Credit Rating Agency Board, essentially a committee that would pair issuers with rating agencies.
 The goal is to break the direct link between issuers and raters and theoretically reduce the financial incentives that led to so many wildly inflated grades. It's an idea that is even more revolutionary than it sounds, because the committee could turn the handful of smaller and newer rating agencies -- which have barely registered in terms of market share -- into players.
 If the amendment works as planned, the three-way oligopoly that has long dominated the ratings business could be doomed.
 As Congress appears to have roused itself to action, so too has the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moody's recently disclosed that the commission had warned that it might sue the company. At issue are a number of former Moody's executives who allowed some European derivatives to keep their high ratings even after it became clear that the grades were the result of a computer glitch. The particulars of the suit, however, aren't as important as the signal that it has sent.
 ''This along with the Goldman Sachs lawsuit is a clear indication that the S.E.C. wants us to believe that it's getting tougher,'' says Lawrence White, a professor of economics at New York University. ''The S.E.C. wants the world to know that the cop is back on the beat.''
 IT'S too early to say what Washington's legislative and regulatory actions portend for the rating agencies, but already they have altered the sense, prevalent as recently as three months ago, that these companies are in a business so complicated, and operating in an economy so fragile, that it is best to leave them undisturbed.
 Perhaps legislators have been emboldened to fiddle with our nation's troubled financial machinery because the economy is stronger, making any tinkering less threatening to the entire contraption. Maybe it is part of a populist anger over Wall Street bonuses and the banks' exceptionally strong earnings reports. Whatever the cause, the atmospherics have changed.
 A similar shift might be happening in the courts, though if Ron Grassi's lawsuit is any indication, beating the rating agencies legally is still a very difficult maneuver.
 The origins of his case can be traced to 2004, when he and his wife, Sally, were looking for very safe investments for their retirement years. A broker explained that the high ratings awarded by the three agencies -- A+ from S.& P., A1 from Moody's, AA-1 from Fitch -- were proof the Lehman bonds were all but risk-free. They expected that by 2023, they would have their $40,000 in principal back, plus $90,000.
 Two months after Lehman's collapse in September 2008, Mr. Grassi called Lehman's bankruptcy committee. A representative there said he could expect pennies on the dollar.
 ''Then I started thinking that the real culprit here isn't Lehman,'' says Mr. Grassi. ''The only reason I bought those bonds is because the ratings agencies said the bonds were investment grade. But at the time, Lehman was loaded with all of these incredibly risky mortgage-backed securities. No one who actually studied Lehman's books could possibly have described the company's bonds as investment grade.''
 AFTER he filed his suit, he converted the guest room in his three-bedroom home into what he calls the ''war room.'' A set of bunk beds was soon piled high with documents and books about the financial crisis. When his case was moved to federal court -- because he was suing out-of-state defendants -- he bought an introductory guide to federal civil procedure.
 At a hearing in July, he squared off against a crowded bench of opposing lawyers, including Floyd Abrams, a renowned First Amendment attorney and S.& P.'s lead counsel in these cases. (''We talked about our favorite New York delis,'' says Mr. Grassi.)
 One of Mr. Abrams's arguments, as he put it in a recent phone interview, is that ''it can't be the case that any of the millions of people who purchased a particular bond can bring a lawsuit against a rating agency or an auditor, saying it turned out to be wrong.''
 In March, Judge Dale A. Drozd in Sacramento seemed to agree with that reasoning when he granted the rating agencies' motion to dismiss the case. Essentially, the judge contended that since Mr. Grassi never had contact with a rating agency representative before buying the bonds, the companies didn't owe him a ''duty'' -- a legal obligation that could form the basis of a negligence claim.
 The issue of duty is just one of a batch of defenses that have long given the rating agencies a kind of legal force field that has yet to be breached. Several judges have rejected the idea that the rating agencies worked so closely with the investment banks that they were essentially co-underwriters. And a 77-year-old regulation exempts rating agencies from the definition of ''experts'' who can be sued.
 ''It's important to understand,'' says Joel Laitman of the law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, which has seen two of its five lawsuits against the agencies dismissed, ''they're winning because this is not a level playing field.''
 As for the apparent conflict of interest built into the rating agencies' business model -- judges have ruled that it has been around so long and is so widely known that it isn't a cause of action. And, of course, the rating agencies have long and successfully argued that their grades are just opinions about the future and therefore entitled to robust First Amendment protections, like those afforded journalists.
 The success of these and other defenses has kept a number of potential litigants on the sidelines, say experts, and that includes state attorneys general. After attorneys general in Ohio and Connecticut sued the rating agencies, it looked for a moment as though the companies would face a collective assault similar to the one that forced cigarette makers into a global, multibillion-dollar settlement in 1998. But since March, when Connecticut filed, no other attorney general has jumped in.
 ''I don't have a good explanation,'' says Ohio's attorney general, Richard Cordray. ''I fully expected more states to join by now.''
 But the rating agencies have lost several skirmishes in court that could prefigure disaster for them. Most notably, two judges have narrowed the ways that ratings agencies can use the First Amendment defense. In one case involving a $5.86 billion structured investment vehicle sold by Cheyne Capital, a federal judge in Manhattan, Shira Scheindlin, ruled that free-speech arguments will fail if the plaintiffs are able to prove that S.& P. and Moody's ''disseminated their ratings to a select group of investors rather than to the public at large,'' as part of a private placement.
 The judge did not say that they cannot use the First Amendment as a defense, and the ratings agencies plan to argue that their opinions, in this instance, were in fact publicly disseminated.
 It's already clear that ratings agencies can't use the First Amendment if judges find that the companies didn't actually believe the grades they were selling. As legal scholars put it, there is no free-speech protection when it comes to matters of fraud.
 ULTIMATELY, it's hard to predict where these lawsuits are going because the past might be a less-than-useful indicator about what will happen to these cases in the future. During the years of subprime mortgage mania, the rating agencies conducted themselves in ways they never had before -- awarding investment grades to bonds that even analysts in the company thought were risky, allegedly trampling their own internal safeguards to manage the issuer-pays conflict of interest, and so on. The legal arguments offered by the rating agencies are time-tested, but the facts are new.
 ''If these cases were to gather momentum and create an industry-challenging level of damages, it could well change the behavior of the ratings agencies,'' says Kevin LaCroix, a lawyer with OakBridge Insurance Services who has closely followed the litigation. Once again, the precedent here is the cigarette companies, which agreed to a wide range of restrictions and new regulations after the master settlement.
 ''But we're nowhere near that point yet,'' notes Mr. LaCroix.
 What is happening with the rating agency lawsuits is what happens every time an industry is attacked through the courts en masse -- the plaintiffs lawyers learn from each ruling, including the dismissals, then fine-tune their arguments and refile.
 That is exactly what Mr. Grassi is doing as he attempts to restart his lawsuit with an amended complaint. He admits that if someone came to him now with a case like his, he'd talk the client out of suing. The odds are too long; the costs are too high.
 Then again, he is representing himself, so his expenses are far less than $1,000. And even if this exercise proves futile, he's having a great time ''poking back'' at Wall Street, as he puts it.
 ''When you're retired,'' he says, ''you've got time to do dumb things.''
 And, he happily notes, any time he files a motion he sends copies to 17 different lawyers at the three rating agencies. Given that there have been more than 90 pleadings so far, and given that many of these lawyers bill at well over $500 an hour, he assumes that his case has already cost the company far more than he could ever hope to recover.
 Mr. Abrams, the lawyer for S.& P., declined to get specific about the billings from his law firm:
 ''I'd rather not get into it. You'd fall off your chair.''

HEADLINE: Resumes Made for Fibbing

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
To fib is human. Each of us tells little lies to make it through the day, and an indistinct line divides fair from foul.
 Which side of the line is Richard Blumenthal on? Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, is running for the United States Senate, and an article in The New York Times last week revealed that he has mischaracterized his service in the United States Marine Corps on occasion, by suggesting that he served in Vietnam during the years of combat instead of his stateside duty in the Marine Reserve.
 His supporters say that Mr. Blumenthal's misstatements have been simply slips, and that he stated quite clearly several times that he had not served in Vietnam. 
 But Mr. Blumenthal himself has acknowledged misspeaking, and his friend Christopher Shays, a former congressman, said he had noticed Mr. Blumenthal's description of his service growing in the telling, over time. ''More and more it kept creeping in,'' he said. ''He just kept adding to the story.''
 If Mr. Blumenthal engaged in personal puffery, he's got plenty of company. No one recommends lying on one's resume, but in an age when we are all told to burnish our personal brand, a little padding won't raise an eyebrow. It's just that some go farther than others -- to outright fraud.
 Contrast Mr. Blumenthal's missteps, for example, to the case of Wes Cooley, a one-term congressman from Oregon who in 1997 was convicted of making a false claim in an official document, a voters' guide; he had falsely claimed to have served in the Army Special Forces in Korea in the early 1950s. Or consider the indictment last week of Adam Wheeler, a Delaware man accused by Massachusetts authorities of fabricating much of the transfer application that earned him acceptance to Harvard in 2007, with nearly $50,000 in aid.
 White-out is the new black: Loren Elliotte Friedman was recently suspended from the practice of law after a 2002 incident in which he improved his first-year transcripts from the University of Chicago law school to get a coveted summer job with the law firm Sidley Austin.
 Lying starts young, and experts suggest that it might even be part of what makes us human.
 ''In the normal developmental process -- beginning in early childhood -- the discovery that one can lie is a significant advance in personal growth and development,'' said Jay S. Kwawer, director of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology in New York. From the age of 4, the ability to say, ''It wasn't me,'' or more complex confabulations, he said, ''fuels the development of fantasy life, creativity, and is often at the core of play and drama: 'I can fly!' 'Bang, bang, you're dead!' 'Let's play house.' ''
 In other words, lying is the foundation of fiction itself. ''Within certain normal limits, there's nothing pathological about that at all,'' he said.
 As we grow up, we find that small lies become an essential part of the day, said Paul Begala, a former aide to President Bill Clinton. ''Telling your mother-in-law you love her casserole is a lie, but the harm is zero and the intent is noble, so it's a good lie,'' he said.
 Lawyers can be at particular risk of pushing the boundaries of acceptable spinning, said Stephen Gillers, an law professor and an expert on legal ethics at New York University.
 Their legal training and experience in practice, he said, reinforce the notion that ''a fact becomes true if a jury or opponent can be persuaded to think that it is true -- even if it is false.'' Lawyers and politicians alike, he said, ''work this alchemy through performance.''
 Politicians, too, have incentives to embellish, Dr. Kwawer said. ''Politicians thrive and get elected on the basis of being able to suss out what we want to hear, and telling us what we will vote for whether they believe it or not.''
 The danger for those in politics is the ''happy mental aquarium,'' said Eric Dezenhall, a crisis communications consultant; he means the artificial environment of support and adoration that seems seductively safe. Add to that feeling of specialness an urge to prove that specialness by taking risks -- think Eliot Spitzer or John Edwards, he suggested -- and it's easy to slip into trouble.
 But how could someone lie about the facts of his own life when so much data is easily findable in the age of the Internet?
 While many of us live with some version of the imposter syndrome, fearing that we are frauds who will be found out at any moment, the resume fabulist comes to believe his own lies, said Seth Aronson, a colleague of Dr. Kwawer at the White Institute. ''They buy into this inflated, false sense of self that they build up,'' he said.
 Getting caught is often a matter of chance -- as with embezzlement and fraud, people almost never get caught with the first, cautious misstep. Their lies are discovered after they have successfully avoided detection again and again, having gotten sloppy and finally committing a whopper too big to ignore.
 In some cases, Dr. Aronson said, the act of inflation turns out to have been illusory. Mr. Friedman, for example, had been asked by Sidley to sign on after his successful summer. He joined another firm, where he had worked successfully until the fraud came out.
 ''With a fair number of these people, they are very good,'' Dr. Aronson said. ''That's the irony -- if they just went on their accomplishments and who they were they'd be fine.''

HEADLINE: Bumper To Bumper

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The veteran global investor Mohamed El-Erian, who runs Pimco and has lived through many a financial crisis, recently issued a report describing the new, perilous state of today's global economy. He described it like this: ''The world is on a journey to an unstable destination, through unfamiliar territory, on an uneven road and, critically, having already used its spare tire.''
 I like that image. America used its spare tire to prevent a collapse of the banking system and to stimulate the economy after the subprime market crash. The European Union used its spare tire on its own economic stimulus and then to prevent a run on European banks triggered by the meltdown in Greece. This all better work, because we're not only living in a world without any more spares but also in a world without distance. Nations are more tightly integrated than ever before. We're driving bumper to bumper with every other major economy today, so misbehavior or mistakes anywhere can cause a global pileup. 
 And that leads to the real point of this column: In this kind of world, leadership at every level of government and business matters more than ever. We have no margin of error anymore, no time for politics as usual or suboptimal legislation. But what does that mean, ''leadership''?
 When El-Erian says we have no spare, he means we have a much diminished pool of resources, whether to moderate the impact of markets when they go haywire or to fund better health care, schools and infrastructure for growth. So leadership today is all about taking innovative actions that generate new capabilities and resources -- and being smart and disciplined about every dime we spend and invest. 
 We just emptied our Treasury for a bailout. Did it merely provide a needed short-term jolt to the economy, or will it end up making us much fitter and more competitive so we can drive our economy farther and faster? I am still not sure. We just passed a health care bill. Will that increase our leverage and resources as a society or just add another set of liabilities that will require new credit lines from China? I am still not sure. We're passing a new financial regulation bill. Are we just pretending to solve the problem or will this new law add to our capacity to generate the resources to cushion the next crisis and fund the next start-up? I am still not sure. A lot will depend on the execution.
 Similarly, in Mother Nature we are also losing our margins for error. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday that the planet's average temperature for April was 58.1 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest for any April on record. The more we keep pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the more we expose ourselves to a sudden, unpredictable climate disruption. The more we blithely remain addicted to oil, and not face up to all its negative geopolitical and environmental consequences, the more we invite sudden catastrophes like the gulf spill. 
 I think many Americans understand this at some intuitive level. In this economic climate, people know they need to be smarter, more frugal and make tougher choices in their private lives. They know they can't fake it or fool themselves anymore, so they have much less tolerance for politicians who want to do that in our public life. 
 And I don't think they are alone. I was in Britain for the recent election there, and I was struck at how easily they put together a rare coalition government, bringing together Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, to generate the broad political base needed to make the sacrifices and hard choices they can't avoid. German lawmakers on Friday voted to fund the Greek bailout. Greeks are protesting the austerity being imposed on them, but they are also taking their fiscal medicine -- for now. 
 Writing about the recent U.S. elections, the Politics Daily columnist Walter Shapiro noted: ''The hopeful message buried in all these election returns is that voters are tired of being toyed with. The problems afflicting America are too grave to tolerate the cynical, cling-to-power-at-all-costs cynicism of Arlen Specter and other Capitol Hill Machiavellis. The choices voters make in their desperate quest for authenticity are not always wise or well grounded in reality. But politicians and pundits -- obsessively calculating partisan advantage like Scrooge counted shillings -- will ignore at their own peril the stirrings of idealism among voters in both parties.''
 I really hope he is right. Winston Churchill famously observed that, ''You can always trust the Americans. In the end, they will do the right thing, after they have eliminated all the other possibilities.'' Is that still true for our generation? We're going to find out. The time for bluffing ourselves is over. Are we going to do what it takes to fix our country, or are we going to be remembered as the generation that received more poker chips from their parents than any other and then had to turn around and toss a single chip to their kids and tell them to put it on ''Lucky 21'' -- and hope for the best.

HEADLINE: Resisting the Urge To Sell Low

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IF you've got money in the stock market, take a deep breath: It's one of those moments. The market is lurching, and that is precisely when impulsive behavior can hurt the most.
 Investing can be a delightful pastime when stocks are rising. When they are falling -- which has often been the case lately -- it can be excruciating. But hasty decisions taken at anxious moments can be extremely costly.
 ''When a lot of people reach their threshold of pain, they sell their stocks and try to move to more secure holdings -- cash, bonds, Treasuries,'' said Louis S. Harvey, president of Dalbar, a fund research firm in Boston. ''These decisions don't work out very well for most people.'' 
 Over the long haul, the average investor has badly underperformed the overall stock market: through December, over the last 20 years, the average stock fund investor has had annualized returns of only 3.2 percent, compared with 8.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Dalbar. Shortsighted moves in down periods account for much of the deficit, Mr. Harvey said. 
 Lately, anxiety among investors undoubtedly has been rising. The flash crash of May 6 -- the biggest intraday swing in market history -- didn't help. Shortly after 2:30 p.m. that day, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,000 points -- and then came most of the way back, all in a matter of minutes. 
 The causes of that sharp drop aren't yet entirely clear, although they appear to be related in part to glitches in the connections of lightning-quick computerized stock trading across the United States. In response, the Securities and Exchange Commission last week said it would temporarily impose ''circuit breakers'' on stocks in the S.& P. 500 when they have fallen 10 percent or more in a five-minute period. The S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission say they are still studying the crash, but don't yet understand it. 
 And then there's the Greek crisis. Since the announcement of a nearly $1 trillion bailout package for Greece and other fiscally strained euro zone countries, turmoil in global markets has not abated. Despite an upturn on Friday, stocks have been choppy; the dollar, Treasury bonds and gold prices have risen; and oil and the euro have plummeted. 
 Professional asset managers have been responding as best they can. 
 Robert C. Doll, vice chairman and global chief investment officer for equities at BlackRock, the investment management firm, says he thinks the American market is likely to remain relatively volatile for an extended period -- and then resume its climb.
 In addition to the angst caused by the flash crash, and the problems in Europe, Mr. Doll points to the bear market in China and the threat of economic slowdown there, as well as domestic issues in the United States. These include continuing uncertainty about regulatory reform, investigations into the activities of Goldman Sachs and other banks, and the unsettled state of the American economy.
 He says two other ''scenarios'' are possible, but much less likely. One is a global meltdown, with the Greek crisis morphing into ''Lehman II,'' the probability of which has been reduced by prompt action by European authorities. And the other is a quick resumption of the roaring bull market that took the S.& P. 500 up 80 percent. But there are too many problems for that to be very likely in the next month or two, he said. 
 For long-term diversified investors, he said, it probably makes sense to ride out the storm, and, maybe, add to your holdings. ''Keep your shoulder harness on, and your seatbelt secured, and your life should be O.K.,'' he said.
 There are even reasons to be encouraged by the health of the global economy, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist and chief strategist at UBS Investment Bank. While he acknowledged the negative effects of the ''sovereign debt crisis'' in Europe and myriad problems elsewhere, he also said: ''Signs of growth are very strong and incoming data is beating expectations, and this is true in all major economies, in all major regions around the world.'' 
 Corporate profits are surging, Mr. Hatheway said. Firms that cut costs in the recession are reaping immediate bottom-line benefits as revenue rises in a global recovery. And, finally, he said, central banks in Europe, the United States and Japan have kept short-term rates ''extraordinarily low, near zero.''
 ''We've got low rates, strong profits and strong growth,'' he said. ''That's a pretty powerful combination to boost stock prices.''
 It makes sense for big institutions to engage in tactical maneuvers -- buying stocks that seem cheap because of a market drop, for example, and emphasizing sectors that may benefit from economic shifts, said Derek L. Young, chief investment officer at Fidelity's global asset allocation group. Fidelity is analyzing the implications of a possible ''prolonged period of weakness in the euro zone.'' Consumption of European luxury goods in the United States might surge, he said, benefiting retailers, while some American exporters might suffer.
 Over all, though, he said, individual investors probably should be more concerned with strategic issues -- how much money they need to save, what asset classes they want to emphasize, and how long they expect to hold them. One thing you don't want to do, he said, ''whether you're a professional or an individual investor, is to make an emotional judgment about the marketplace.''
 A VAST majority of people still rely on printed financial statements for information on how they've been doing, Mr. Howard of Dalbar said. If stocks continue to decline for the next few weeks, many people will be getting a shock in the mail. ''The historical record is very clear,'' he said. ''Most people will be best off if they don't take any immediate action.''

HEADLINE: After 200,000 Words, One Still Stands Out

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
IT started in America, which isn't there anymore.
 I mean America the restaurant, in a faux Second Empire mansion in the history-laden, old-money borough of Tenafly: the first restaurant I reviewed for The New York Times -- on Sunday, April 9, 2000, a decade ago last month.
 Ten years is enough for almost anyone in this game, and after 500 meals and 240 reviews totaling about 200,000 words (imagine ''Moby-Dick'' with pasta instead of whale), I've decided to put away the carbon steel critic's pen and concentrate on other forms of writing.
 Before I go, my editors have given me a final chance to reflect on New Jersey dining during that decade. And I've concluded it's like the river you can never step in twice -- it has changed constantly while changing hardly at all. 
 The pattern is exemplified by that first restaurant, America. Capitalizing on what was then a vogue for evocative if cryptic one-word names (Dish, Maize, Rat's), it had rolled quietly into Tenafly and had quickly rewritten diners' food vocabulary.
 Who in those days had heard of beluga lentils, ancho chili butter, seared tuna with Sichuan spices and curried bananas? Ingredients like those -- eclectic, faintly exotic, handled with love and a touch of irreverence by youngish chefs brimming with confidence -- have since come to define a style of upscale eating in New Jersey.
 And while we tend to think of the fashion for local, seasonal produce as a recent phenomenon, I couldn't help noticing a line in another review from that same year: ''Almost any chef these days will trumpet his reverence for fresh seasonal ingredients.''
 Even prices have not risen as much as I might have expected; the range for America's entrees -- $20 to $32 -- would not be out of place in a restaurant of its caliber today. In the face of two market crashes and relentless competition for the dining-out dollar, restaurants have been forced to hold the line.
 Which brings me to what has changed. America, my maiden restaurant, is long gone. One day in the middle of the decade, it simply closed, even more quietly than it had opened. The building stood vacant for a year or so, reopened as Sanzari's Oyster Bar and Grille, then closed again. Then one day in 2008 or 2009, I passed the building and realized it wasn't there at all -- just forlorn mounds of dirt and bricks. Now the site is a bank branch.
 It's not just America, of course. Even in balmy economic times, this is one tough business; in a cold climate it can be brutal. A census by the market research company NPD found that the United States lost 4,000 restaurants -- and fully 7 percent of all independent ''fine dining'' establishments -- in the year ending in March 2009.
 The decade's toll included one of the best restaurants anywhere: the matchless, sadly missed Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station (whose chef and owner, Craig Shelton, is now a consultant). Other favorites -- 9 North in Wayne, Venue in Hoboken, China 46 in Ridgefield -- offered wonderful food yet somehow failed to thrive.
 Many others have held their own through the worst of times. I would be deranged to offer a list of favorites: the danger of leaving one out is far too high. But I will say that Nicholas, in Middletown, has come closest in my experience to claiming the venturesome haute cuisine mantle that was Ryland's -- and that if I had to choose a restaurant to set up shop on my personal desert island, it would be Cucharamama, serving dazzlingly original South American food in Hoboken.
 Places like these stand like Himalayas on the hot, flat and crowded plain that is New Jersey's restaurant scene. Harder to locate are outstanding restaurants at the other end of the price spectrum -- a bit lacking in ambience, perhaps, but delivering maximum value.
 One place that will never be accused of lacking ambience is Di Palma Brothers in North Bergen, where patrons can get fine, straight-ahead Neapolitan food while they contemplate the owners' astonishing collection of antiques, gewgaws and tchotchkes. (Everything is for sale.) In addition, I have had bargain meals at establishments as disparate as Aleppo, a bracingly authentic Syrian restaurant in Paterson; Seabra's Marisqueira, a seafood destination in the throbbing heart of the Ironbound section of Newark; and the subject of my very last review, Petite Soochow (Shanghainese in Cliffside Park).
 Regrets? I've had a few. I never managed to penetrate the Korean restaurant scene, which has washed over North Jersey like a kimchi tide -- not for lack of interest, but because I was unable to develop a network of tipsters who could help me separate merely good from better and best. Likewise, I always suspected that the region had a prime collection of inexpensive, authentic Mexican and Central American restaurants, but I never figured out which ones they were.
 Finally, there's the matter of adjectives. This has been a dream job, but it was work, and perhaps its most tiring aspect was the constant struggle to come up with new ways to describe essentially the same dishes.
 Searching the Nexis news database, I'm chagrined to discover that in about 240 reviews over 10 years, I used the word ''tender'' in 185 of them and ''rich'' in 117. ''Nutty,'' 31. ''Meaty,'' 58. And that old standby ''terrific'' 133 times. Ouch.
 I did, however, come up with at least one coinage, a noun that appears just once -- the time I used it -- in the Nexis archive, which covers virtually every daily newspaper and thousands of magazines, journals, transcripts and online sources throughout the English-speaking world, going back at least 30 years.
 It was in a review of the, ahem, terrific Park Steakhouse in Park Ridge. I was searching for a term to describe the intense competition among restaurants of its kind to serve the choicest meats.
 The word is ''steakstakes.'' May it rest in peace.

HEADLINE: Rule No. 1: Make Money by Avoiding Rules

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
From the earliest days of capitalism, those skilled at making money have proven creative at evading the regulators.
 In the Middle Ages, when usury laws banned lenders from charging interest, savvy merchants lent in one currency and took repayment in another, thereby profiting without incurring the wrath of the Catholic Church. So much has happened over the ensuing centuries -- a blur of financial ingenuity spanning the creation of stocks to the mortgage-backed investments of the present day -- yet history remains unbroken: Time and again, financial innovation finds a lucrative path around regulation.
 As Congress and the Obama administration now enter the endgame in an effort to temper the dangers that delivered the worst financial crisis since the Depression, experts assume that this historical narrative will hold. If anything, swift advances in technology -- computerized trading strategies unleashed on a global landscape -- have made it harder for watchdogs to simply recognize the risks building within markets, let alone deliver effective action. 
 ''The financial industry always finds ways to stay ahead of the regulators,'' says Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a professor at Harvard. ''Whatever law they design today, if it's not updated in 15 or so years, it will be completely ineffective, completely irrelevant.''
 Not that regulatory efforts are futile. The history of finance is full of crises that spawn regulatory steps, snuffing out trouble before a new variant pops up. The wildcat banking era of the 19th century, when banks in multiple states issued their own (sometimes worthless) currency, spurred the creation of a national bank supervisor. When opportunists and charlatans sold stocks to the public without disclosing the extent of their debts, culminating in the stock market crash of 1929, the federal government created the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 The New Deal reforms imbued traditional banking with a sense of safety, but also encouraged financiers to seek out greater profits by taking risks in areas beyond regulatory purview. The resulting shadow banking system that emerged over the last quarter-century -- the murky world of unregulated corporate insurance contracts and other flavors of so-called derivatives -- nurtured the recklessness that ultimately metastasized into today's global crisis. The government had effectively tamed the traditional banking business. Wall Street expanded to more adventurous terrain, erecting frontier-style casinos beyond the edges of regulation.
 This shadow banking system came to specialize in innovations that created the illusion that risk was being responsibly managed; in crucial cases, they actually intensified the dangers. For many years, this felt like prosperity. American International Group sold insurance policies (credit default swaps, in industry parlance) that supposedly backed up now worthless pools of mortgages extended to homeowners with sketchy credit. That emboldened financiers to pump trillions of dollars into now empty empires of housing. There were jobs for home builders, landscapers and furniture dealers, and property values rose for all.
 Financial innovation helped Greece mask the extent of its debt troubles, leading European banks to keep lending. That generated jobs for German autoworkers, whose creations landed on the streets of Athens before reality trumped illusion and crisis washed across Europe.
 The very concept of financial innovation now seems compromised. Some derivatives have sown stability, enabling global companies to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Yet many innovations with forbiddingly inscrutable names -- collateralized debt obligation, structured investment vehicle -- are now implicated in a ruse designed to convey a sense that risk was being diluted when it was really being amplified and spread worldwide. When the insurance policies failed and the losses piled up, ordinary people lost trillions of dollars in wealth, homes and jobs.
 Some argue that regulators were effectively duped into complacency by financial institutions skilled at managing the perception of risk (even as they proved less skilled at managing risk itself). Others accuse the watchdogs of looking the other way as dangers mounted, whether out of ideological reverence for unsupervised markets, fear of angering the people who control money, or a desire to please banks that might soon employ them for considerably more than a government salary.
 Some argue that the investments at play became so complicated and intertwined that even the money masters who built them no longer understood their creations, as if Frankenstein's monster had melted into liquid and seeped into the drinking supply. The marketplace may be so vast and elaborate, its tentacles reaching from Sarasota to Singapore, that it simply beggars human understanding.
 ''Technical advantage has far outstripped our capacity to manage it,'' says Andrew Lo, a finance professor at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management.
 The most fundamental challenge to effective regulation may be the stark inequality of the forces at the table. The latest effort to defang the financial system relies on many of the same institutions that failed to intervene in the run-up to the last crisis. The people inside regulatory agencies serve at the pleasure of the Congressional budget process. The people they are supposed to be watching pull down bonuses reaching seven figures. Their companies employ armies of top-flight lawyers on the prowl for new ways around meddlesome rules. Members of Congress and their staffs may soon be courted by the very institutions whose profits they may constrain through legislation.
 ''There's all this innovation going on, and if somebody gets particularly into it, they get hired away,'' Mr. Rogoff says.
 The revolving door that sends denizens of Capitol Hill to highly paid jobs as lobbyists and bankers while turning Wall Street executives into Treasury officials has long been proffered as a reason to be skeptical of regulation. Yet given the impenetrability of Wall Street, some argue that we have no other option but to rely on financial insiders to staff regulatory agencies: When you need to defuse a bomb, you hire someone intimately familiar with explosives.
 ''If we take the view that only people who come from an academic background, people who don't have any experience, can serve in regulatory agencies, we will have an impoverished government,'' says Eugene A. Ludwig, comptroller of the currency in the Clinton administration and now chief executive of the Promontory Financial Group. ''These human foibles are going to be with us forever.''

HEADLINE: The Major-Step-in-Life Apartment

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN. 
E-mail: thehunt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT was just a year ago that Cherry Pickman left the one-bedroom where she was living in Harlem for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in order to be closer to her girlfriend, Kara Mason. She had no trouble finding a one-bedroom rental for $1,425 in a thriving Graham Avenue location surrounded by little delis, meat markets and grocery stores.
 ''It was the Brooklyn I had fantasies about,'' she said.
 Miss Pickman is 26. She grew up in North Kingstown, R.I., graduated from the University of Florida, Gainesville, and is waiting tables while she studies for a master's degree in poetry writing at Columbia University. 
 There were some drawbacks to the place on Graham Avenue, including a bedroom floor so sloped that the bed required four books to prop it up, and occasional winter days with no heat or hot water. But Miss Pickman loved it anyway.
 It was just eight short blocks from Miss Mason's apartment. A Minneapolis native and Skidmore College graduate who is now an editor at the Guggenheim Museum, Miss Mason, 28, paid $900 a month for her alcove studio in an owner-occupied house on Powers Street. Though it had no closets, it was beautifully renovated, and she got along well with the owners.
 By winter, the two were spending most of their time at Miss Pickman's place. It was homier there because of her two cats. She also cooked often, and had organized her kitchen just so. 
 It seemed ''economically silly'' to keep living apart, Miss Pickman said.
 The couple decided to hunt for a place that was new to both of them, budgeting $1,600 a month. ''It was a big deal to move in together,'' Miss Pickman said. ''We wanted the change to reflect that importance.''
 ''I was confident that $1,600 for a one-bedroom would yield something good,'' Miss Pickman added. Both, however, were giving up good apartments. The new place had two tough acts to follow. 
 They hoped to find a bright, spacious, cat-friendly one-bedroom with good closets in Williamsburg or Greenpoint, neighborhoods they knew and liked. And if they couldn't find something suitable, they had a perfectly serviceable default apartment: Miss Pickman's place.
 Most apartments that fell within their budget were dark, narrow railroad flats, with two windows in front and two windows in back.
 ''We saw pretty much the same thing over and over,'' Miss Mason said. The exception was a railroad unit in a corner building that received more light than the others.
 Their hopes rose when they found a listing for a ''two-story cottage'' in Greenpoint for $1,600. Navigating via Google Street View, Miss Mason zeroed in on the only place that seemed cottagelike.
 ''I was totally obsessive,'' she said. She went by to check it out. They made an appointment to see it -- and dressed up for the occasion.
 But Miss Mason had been training her sights on the wrong property. Instead of a charming cottage, they were shown a small, dark ground-floor flat in a two-story attached four-unit house. 
 ''It was the worst apartment we saw,'' Miss Mason said. ''We had this fantasy, and it was completely the opposite.''
 They were again discouraged by a large $1,600 one-bedroom on Division Avenue in Williamsburg. It had closet space, but the bedroom overlooked an air shaft and had a view of the neighbors' windows. Heat and hot water were not included in the rent.
 Miss Mason ran an ad in The Greenpoint Gazette advertising what great tenants they would make. ''It doesn't even make sense,'' she said, ''but I felt that with Craigslist and the broker route we weren't getting anything. It was sort of delusional.'' They received no responses.
 After three months they were burnt out. ''I was of a mind that, if I work this hard, why can't I find the right place?'' Miss Mason said.
 All of their spare time and emotional energy had been devoted to the apartment hunt, Miss Pickman said. ''It seemed like we had failed, and I didn't want Kara to be sad about it. She was giving up a place that she cherished.''
 Meanwhile, Miss Pickman began to push for the default plan. ''I was feeling, like, what's wrong with my place?'' she said. It was affordable, sizable and well situated, and would be even better if they made some improvements, like painting the entire place and building a second closet. ''I started to dig my heels in,'' she said.
 Miss Mason finally agreed to join her there. ''It wasn't the end of the world,'' she said, ''but it felt like a real bummer.'' 
 Then she came across a listing for a one-bedroom in a small owner-occupied building on Humboldt Street in Williamsburg. At $1,450, it sounded great.
 ''A lot of pressure went into seeing this apartment,'' Miss Mason said. Her fear was that one would like it and the other would not.
 The unit, though a railroad, had two closets, plus an extra little room off the bedroom. The place was bright, even on a gray Saturday morning.
 They constantly checked their e-mail messages until they heard from the owners, husband-and-wife architects, that the apartment was theirs. Now it was Miss Pickman's turn to fret. ''I was freaked out because I hadn't mentally prepared to leave yet,'' she said. ''Kara had her apartment in boxes. She was moving no matter what.''
 They moved in early this month and are happily exploring their new neighborhood.
 ''We have fake complaints, like we have to replace the fluorescent lighting in the kitchen,'' Miss Pickman said. ''But we really like doing stuff like that.''
 Miss Pickman was concerned that the oven was too small for her roasting pan, but discovered the pan will work if she turns it lengthwise. 
 ''And in the end it does fit, so that was a joyous thing,'' Miss Mason said.
 Outside the back windows, they added window boxes for herbs and flowers. ''We are going to become avid stoop sitters,'' Miss Pickman said. ''That, too, can be sort of our outdoor space.''
 Most of all, their apartment outshines their previous homes. ''We are both surprised that we don't miss our other places,'' Miss Pickman said.

To the Sports Editor:
 ''No Tackling, but a Girls' Sport Takes Some Hits'' (May 16) pitted me against flag football and the girls who play it. The point of the article should have been that the Florida High School Athletic Association fails to provide girls with equal educational opportunities, the test for Title IX compliance. Any sports association starting a regional sport that does not have an existing infrastructure the way soccer did in the 1980s is obligated to work to provide girls and boys with similar opportunities. 
 For more than 10 years, flag football players have lost out on $1.5 billion annually in college scholarships and the abundant educational and economic benefits that research confirms flows from the competitive nature of varsity sports. Meanwhile, the Florida association has yet to sponsor other popular girls' sports. Nationally, 50 percent of all high school students are provided with sports opportunities; in Florida, that number is 31 percent, about 40 percent of which goes to girls.

 To the Sports Editor:
 I organized and played powder puff football at the University of California at Berkeley in the '60s. It was linked to the Big Game and the sorority/fraternity system, but in the spirit of Berkeley radicalism, my team of ragtag independents finally won the trophy. It became a political act. What made it memorable and gratifying was the absence of any momentum but our own; we organized it and succeeded with defiance, joy and the skills our passion fostered. Sometimes, activities are best left outside the domain of practical purpose. Sara Hartley
 Oakland, Calif.
 To the Sports Editor:
 I suspect - particularly for students whose entire experience of sport is the Sunday morning travel team - that part of flag football's appeal lies in a word appearing several times in the article: fun. Isn't it just like us baby boomers to invest it all with politics or bemoan the fact that it doesn't lead to a next level of attainment.

 To the Sports Editor:
 This article assumes as an objective closing the gender gap in high school sports, but what if this gap is the result of different levels of interest?
 My two sons were interested in competitive sports, both participating in varsity sports in high school and one participated in a varsity sport in college. My daughter is different. With a lot of encouragement, she participated in sports in middle school, but her real interest in high school and in college is in modern dance and ballet, with both offering teamwork and physical activity. Why is her preference for dance over sports a problem? James G. Russell

HEADLINE: The Teachers' Unions' Last Stand

BYLINE: By STEVEN BRILL. 
Steven Brill is the co-founder of Journalism Online. His last article for the magazine was about executive compensation.

 BODY:
MICHAEL MULGREW is an affable former Brooklyn vocational-high-school teacher who took over last year as head of New York City's United Federation of Teachers when his predecessor, Randi Weingarten, moved to Washington to run the national American Federation of Teachers. Over breakfast in March, we talked about a movement spreading across the country to hold public-school teachers accountable by compensating, promoting or even removing them according to the results they produce in class, as measured in part by student test scores. Mulgrew's 165-page union contract takes the opposite approach. It not only specifies everything that teachers will do and will not do during a six-hour-57 1/2-minute workday but also requires that teachers be paid based on how long they have been on the job. Once they've been teaching for three years and judged satisfactory in a process that invariably judges all but a few of them satisfactory, they are ensured lifetime tenure. 
 Next to Mulgrew was his press aide, Richard Riley. ''Suppose you decide that Riley is lazy or incompetent,'' I asked Mulgrew. ''Should you be able to fire him?'' 
 ''He's not a teacher,'' Mulgrew responded. ''And I need to be able to pick my own person for a job like that.'' Then he grinned, adding: ''I know where you're going, but you don't understand. Teachers are just different.''
 That is the kind of story that makes Jon Schnur smile. Schnur, who runs a Manhattan-based school-reform group called New Leaders for New Schools, sits informally at the center of a network of self-styled reformers dedicated to overhauling public education in the United States. They have been building in strength and numbers over the last two decades and now seem to be planted everywhere that counts. They are working in key positions in school districts and charter-school networks, legislating in state capitals, staffing city halls and statehouses for reform-minded mayors and governors, writing papers for policy groups and dispensing grants from billion-dollar philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates, along with Education Secretary Arne Duncan; Teach for America's founder, Wendy Kopp; and the New York City schools chancellor Joel Klein could be considered the patron saints of the network. 
 Over the last several months, Schnur and the well-positioned fellow travelers on his speed dial have seen the cause of their lives take center stage. Why the sudden shift from long-simmering wonk debate to political front burner? Because there is now a president who, when it comes to school reform, really does seem to be a new kind of Democrat -- and because of a clever idea Schnur had last year to package what might otherwise have been just another federal grant program into a media-alluring, if cheesy-sounding, contest called Race to the Top. It has turned a relatively modest federal program (the $4.3 billion budget represents less than 1 percent of all federal, state and local education spending) into high-yield leverage that could end up overshadowing health care reform in its impact and that is already upending traditional Democratic Party politics. The activity set off by the contest has enabled Schnur's network to press as never before its frontal challenge to the teachers' unions: they argue that a country that spends more per pupil than any other but whose student performance ranks in the bottom third among developed nations isn't failing its children for lack of resources but for lack of trained, motivated, accountable talent at the front of the class. 
 Schnur, who is 44, became interested in education when, as an editor of his high-school newspaper, he read a draft of an article from a student who had transferred from a Milwaukee public school to his school in the suburbs. ''She was savvier than any of us on the editorial board, but the draft was just so terribly written,'' he told me. Schnur added that ''the more I got to know her, the more I became obsessed with why public education hadn't reached people like her.'' After graduating from Princeton, he worked in the Clinton campaign and then landed an education-policy job in the Clinton administration.
 Schnur recalls that when he met Barack Obama before his Senate campaign in 2004, and heard him talk about education, ''I figured this guy could be the great education president -- in 2017.'' When Obama moved up the timetable, Schnur joined his 2008 campaign as a policy adviser. Six months later, he was working as a counselor to Education Secretary Duncan. As the Obama administration prepared to spend $80 billion in education aid as part of the economic stimulus program, Duncan and Schnur diverted $4.3 billion to the contest aimed at encouraging cash-strapped states to overhaul their public schools. Schnur came up with the name and pushed the overall spin of the contest, and it was clear from conversations with people in the school-reform movement that he is the one person who seems to know everything happening on all fronts, from the White House to legislative chambers in Albany or Sacramento to charter schools in New Orleans. Joel Klein, for example, said he talks to Schnur about once a week. 
 The winners of the Race would be those states that submitted the best blueprints for fulfilling the reform agenda, which includes allowing school districts to take over failing schools, improving curriculum standards and encouraging school innovation (which means, in part, allowing charter schools to flourish). But what the reformers have come to believe matters most is good teachers. ''It's all about the talent,'' Secretary Duncan told me. Thus, the highest number of points -- 138 of the 500-point scale that Duncan and his staff created for the Race -- would be awarded based on a commitment to eliminate what teachers' union leaders consider the most important protections enjoyed by their members: seniority-based compensation and permanent job security. To win the contest, the states had to present new laws, contracts and data systems making teachers individually responsible for what their students achieve, and demonstrating, for example, that budget-forced teacher layoffs will be based on the quality of the teacher, not simply on seniority. (Fifteen states, including New York and California, now operate under union-backed state laws mandating that seniority, or ''last in/first out,'' determines layoffs. These quality-blind layoffs could force a new generation of teachers, like those recruited by Teach for America, out of classrooms in the coming months.) To enable teacher evaluations, another 47 points would be allocated based on the quality of a state's ''data systems'' for tracking student performance in all grades -- which is a euphemism for the kind of full-bore testing regime that makes many parents and children cringe but that the reformers argue is necessary for any serious attempt to track not only student progress but also teacher effectiveness. 
 By late March, when the first round of the Race ended, it was clear that Schnur's spin had worked ''better than any of us imagined,'' he says. Thousands of local news stories across the country speculated about how particular states were faring, some of them breathlessly referring to the ''March Madness'' as governors, state legislators and bureaucrats rushed to consider reforms that might improve their chances. Forty states and the District of Columbia entered the first round. Fifteen, including such union strongholds as California, Ohio and Michigan, passed laws or revised regulations aimed at boosting their chances. Before Duncan had dispensed a nickel, the country had seen more school reform than it had in decades. And still more is being debated as the deadline for a second round of proposals looms next week and states, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, hustle to do more to boost their scores. 
 When the starting gun for the Race went off, four forces that had been building came together and gained strength from one another. 
 First there's the rise of the reformers who seem to be in daily communication through e-mail and blogs. The standard profile is someone who went to a prestige college, joined Teach for America for a two-year stint and found the work and the challenges so compelling that he or she decided education should be more than a layover before a real career. So they did more teaching or became involved running a charter school or a reform group, then kept moving up the ladder as sympathetic political leaders, including Democrats (most in this network also seem to be Democrats), took over cities or states and looked for people to overhaul school systems. One exception is Schnur. ''I was in Wendy's class in Princeton in 1989, so I couldn't do T.F.A. because it didn't exist yet,'' Schnur says, referring to Wendy Kopp, who founded Teach for America in 1990 based on a senior thesis she wrote envisioning a Peace Corps-like cadre of young college grads. 
 Although Schnur is a cheerful, modest type, there is a strain of self-righteousness that runs through the reform network. Some come off as snobs who assume any union teacher is lazy or incompetent and could be bested by young, nonunion Ivy Leaguers full of energy. And others see tying teachers' pay to their students' improvement on standardized tests as a cure-all. But most -- especially those who have taught and appreciate how hard it is -- understand that standardized tests are far from perfect, and that some subjects, like the arts, don't lend themselves to standardized testing. They know that most teachers want to be effective and that data-based performance assessments should be combined with classroom observation and other subjective measures not only to hold teachers accountable but also to help them improve their performance. 
 The second force at work is a new crop of Democratic politicians across the country-- including President Obama -- who seem willing to challenge the teachers' unions. 
 Third, there's the boost given to school reform by high-powered foundations, like the Gates Foundation, which have financed important research and pilot reform projects, and by wealthy entrepreneurs, who have poured seed money into charter schools. 
 And fourth, there's the charter-school movement, which has yielded an increasingly large and vocal constituency of parents whose children are among the more than 1.5 million students attending more than 5,000 charter schools. 
 Put those forces together with the Race, and you have education reform moving into prime time. Parents marched and lobbied in Tallahassee, Albany and Los Angeles, demanding that their school systems be reformed the way Obama's instructions for winning the Race said they should. Newspaper editorial boards of all political stripes joined in their cause; ''Union Lackeys'' was a typical title of a Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial about recalcitrant Democratic legislators.
 If unions are the Democratic Party's base, then teachers' unions are the base of the base. The two national teachers' unions -- the American Federation of Teachers and the larger National Education Association -- together have more than 4.6 million members. That is roughly a quarter of all the union members in the country. Teachers are the best field troops in local elections. Ten percent of the delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention were teachers' union members. In the last 30 years, the teachers' unions have contributed nearly $57.4 million to federal campaigns, an amount that is about 30 percent higher than any single corporation or other union. And they have typically contributed many times more to state and local candidates. About 95 percent of it has gone to Democrats. 
 Before they successfully organized in the 1950s and 1960s, teachers endured meager salaries, political favoritism, tyrannical principals and sex discrimination against a mostly female work force. It's that sense of needing to stick together against real or potential mistreatment by management, plus a sincere -- and accurate -- belief that most teachers do teach for reasons beyond simply making a living, that drives Mulgrew and other union leaders. There's also the reality that their own power comes from making sure that the all-for-one-one-for-all contract that they negotiate remains the determining factor in a teacher's professional life. 
 Nonetheless, almost all the states that submitted first-round applications proposed school reforms that a year ago would have been seen as pushing beyond what the teachers' unions would allow. Some moved further than others either because the lure of the Race to the Top money trumped the unions' opposition, or because political leaders and educators were able to persuade union leaders to get on the train instead of standing in front of it. 
 *********
 ON MARCH 4, Duncan announced that 16 applicants were finalists for the first round. And he said that they all were examples ''for the country of what is possible when adults come together and do the right thing for children.'' One of those finalists was New York, which finished 15th but where the union's clout was such that the application failed to address the core requirements of Duncan's agenda. Joe Williams of Democrats for Education Reform sent an e-mail message to the network -- addressed ''Dear Education Warrior'' -- saying he was ''baffled'' by Duncan's apparent leniency in giving states like New York a pass. But by the end of the month, Duncan had redeemed himself with the reformers. He picked only two states, Delaware and Tennessee, for the first round of awards. Those states had scored highest (455 and 444) on the 500-point scale. Georgia and Florida (434 and 431) were close behind, but Duncan told me he wanted ''to set a high bar.'' 
 School officials in Delaware, which will receive $100 million, have been working on reform projects for more than a decade, and the state already has a comprehensive student-performance data system in place. ''We worked on the application all summer, built on a 10-year legacy of reform,'' Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, said. And so, in its application, the state was able to point to regulations that had been beefed up for the Race. In Delaware, no teacher now will be rated ''effective'' who does not meet targets connected to student test-score improvement (as well as other subjective measures, like evaluations of lesson plans and classroom management) over the school year, and teachers could be removed if they are rated ''ineffective'' or ''needs improvement'' two years in a row. ''We know testing has to be part of the evaluation process,'' Diane Donohue, the head of the Delaware state teachers' association, says. ''This is a culture change that has been happening over the years and came to a head with Race to the Top.'' In fact, Donohue was one of the five people picked to present Delaware's proposal in Washington.
 In Tennessee, Gov. Phil Bredesen, also a Democrat, pushed the Legislature to pass laws allowing more charter schools and making student test scores 50 percent of annual teacher evaluations. The statewide teachers' union ended up supporting both bills. 
 Bredesen explained the new politics of education in his state this way: ''For me there's a little bit of a 'Nixon goes to China' feel about it, because I had done a lot of things that teachers were quite happy with over the years. My argument to them was that this is coming from a Democratic administration. This is not a Republican idea anymore. I told them that I know this goes at the core of what you and your colleagues have been protecting over the years,'' Bredesen continued, referring to how he broached the subject of teachers being evaluated and paid based on individual performance ratings. ''But now, we're all going to have to evolve. It's coming, and you can either help to structure it, or you can fight it, and it won't be as good.'' 
 Bredesen points to an earlier development in his state that, he says, had ''broken the ice.'' In 2009 the Gates foundation provided a $90 million grant to the Memphis school system -- the state's largest -- on the condition that teachers there allow 35 percent of their performance ratings to be based on student test scores. Bredesen's icebreaker was emblematic of the forces of reform coming together around the Race. Projects like the one in Memphis financed in the last decade by Gates and other foundations and the work of reform policy groups like the New Teacher Project, which has been involved extensively in Delaware, paved the way for reform, as has the ascent of less ideological, more executive-minded Democrats like Bredesen.

 THE PERSON IN charge of preparing New York's application was John King, the senior deputy commissioner of the state Education Department. Schooled in Brooklyn (where his father was the first black principal in a Brooklyn school), King is an alumnus of Harvard and Yale Law School and was a founder of the Roxbury Preparatory Charter School in Massachusetts. 
 King works for David Steiner, the state education commissioner. But the Education Department is largely under the control of the Legislature, which appoints the State Board of Regents, which oversees the department. The Legislature has also passed -- and could repeal -- statutes that essentially guarantee lifetime teacher tenure and that mandate teacher layoffs strictly on the basis of seniority. The key leader of the Legislature is Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who, like many New York Democrats, held an election-night victory party at the U.F.T. headquarters. The U.F.T.'s Web site calls Silver ''our partner'' and quotes him as declaring at a union rally, ''I and my colleagues in the Assembly majority will be your best friends . . . in Albany.'' 
 King says that ''navigating all of the competing interests in New York is a lot different than any other job I have had.'' Thus, he explains, that with ''all of the limits we had with the laws and collective-bargaining agreements in place and the political reality of the Legislature,'' preparing New York's application ''was difficult and frustrating.'' 
 One frustration centered on charter schools. Charters are publicly financed schools open to any child by lottery but run by entities other than the conventional local school district. Typically they are operated by nonprofit organizations that rely on donations to provide seed money but then use the same per-pupil money doled out to the public schools for ongoing operations. Those who run charters are accountable for the school's performance, but they are free to manage as they wish. That includes the freedom to hire teachers who are not union members. A law allowing charter schools in New York was passed in 1998 over intense opposition from the teachers' union. It survived because there was a Republican governor, George Pataki, and then only because Pataki attached it to a bill giving a pay raise to legislators. Moreover, to placate the union, legislators capped the number of charters to be issued statewide. 
 The Race to the Top reopened the charter debate. Although other reform criteria count for much more, the contest measured a state's amenability to charters, giving up to 40 of the 500 points to charter-friendly states. With New York State 12 charters away from hitting its 200 cap (and likely to hit it with new charters to be issued this year), not lifting the cap threatened the state's application. 
 Charter schools are not always better for children. Across the country many are performing badly. But when run well -- as most in Harlem and New York's other most-challenged communities appear to be -- they can make a huge difference in a child's life. So by the time the Race rules were issued, the charter cap had become something that many New York parents, particularly in neighborhoods with underperforming schools, cared a lot about. In Harlem, for example, about 20 percent of all age-eligible children are now enrolled in charters, and in April, 14,000 other children submitted applications in the lottery for next year's 2,700 open seats. This means that more than 11,000 kids just in Harlem were turned away. Across the city applications were up 25 percent, and 43,000 students were turned away. 
 Bill Perkins, who represents Harlem in the State Senate, is the Legislature's leading opponent of charters. Sitting next to a poster of Barack Obama with the headline ''Brothers for Barack'' in his office on 125th Street, Perkins, who has enjoyed teachers' union support, says it's ''stupid and unfair to blame unions when the reason the schools in this community are failing is that they lack resources. . . . the president is wrong.'' In February, Perkins was faced with a march on Albany organized by the charter schools to protest his and his colleagues' opposition to lifting the charter-school cap.
 A building on 118th Street is one reason that the parents who are Perkins's constituents know that charters can work. On one side there's the Harlem Success Academy, a kindergarten-through-fourth-grade charter with 508 students. On the other side, there's a regular public school, P.S. 149, with 438 pre-K to 8th-grade students. They are separated only by a fire door in the middle; they share a gym and cafeteria. School reformers would argue that the difference between the two demonstrates what happens when you remove three ingredients from public education -- the union, big-system bureaucracy and low expectations for disadvantaged children. 
 On the charter side, the children are quiet, dressed in uniforms, hard at work -- and typically performing at or above grade level. Their progress in a variety of areas is tracked every six weeks, and teachers are held accountable for it. They are paid about 5 to 10 percent more than union teachers with their levels of experience. The teachers work longer than those represented by the union: school starts at 7:45 a.m., ends at 4:30 to 5:30 and begins in August. The teachers have three periods for lesson preparation, and they must be available by cellphone (supplied by the school) for parent consultations, as must the principal. They are reimbursed for taking a car service home if they stay late into the evening to work with students. There are special instruction sessions on Saturday mornings. The assumption that every child will succeed is so ingrained that (in a flourish borrowed from the Knowledge Is Power Program, or KIPP, a national charter network) each classroom is labeled with the college name of its teacher and the year these children are expected to graduate (as in ''Yale 2026'' for one kindergarten class I recently visited). The charter side of the building spends $18,378 per student per year. This includes actual cash outlays for everything from salaries to the car service, plus what the city says (and the charter disputes) are the value of services that the city contributes to the charter for utilities, building maintenance and even ''debt service'' for its share of the building.
 On the other side of the fire door, I encounter about a hundred children at 9:00 a.m. watching a video in an auditorium, having begun their school day at about 8:30. Others wander the halls. Instead of the matching pension contributions paid to the charter teachers that cost the school $193 per student on the public-school side, the union contract provides a pension plan that is now costing the city $2,605 per year per pupil. All fringe benefits, including pensions and health insurance, cost $1,341 per student on the charter side, but $5,316 on this side. For the public-school teachers to attend a group meeting after hours with the principal (as happens at least once a week on the charter side) would cost $41.98 extra per hour for each attendee, and attendance would still be voluntary. Teachers are not obligated to receive phone calls from students or parents at home. Although the city's records on spending per student generally and in any particular school are difficult to pin down because of all of the accounting intricacies, the best estimate is that it costs at least $19,358 per year to educate each student on the public side of the building, or $980 more than on the charter side. 
 But while the public side spends more, it produces less. P.S. 149 is rated by the city as doing comparatively well in terms of student achievement and has improved since Mayor Michael Bloomberg took over the city's schools in 2002 and appointed Joel Klein as chancellor. Nonetheless, its students are performing significantly behind the charter kids on the other side of the wall. To take one representative example, 51 percent of the third-grade students in the public school last year were reading at grade level, 49 percent were reading below grade level and none were reading above. In the charter, 72 percent were at grade level, 5 percent were reading below level and 23 percent were reading above level. In math, the charter third graders tied for top performing school in the state, surpassing such high-end public school districts as Scarsdale. 
 Same building. Same community. Sometimes even the same parents. And the classrooms have almost exactly the same number of students. In fact, the charter school averages a student or two more per class. This calculus challenges the teachers unions' and Perkins's ''resources'' argument -- that hiring more teachers so that classrooms will be smaller makes the most difference. (That's also the bedrock of the union refrain that what's good for teachers -- hiring more of them -- is always what's good for the children.) Indeed, the core of the reformers' argument, and the essence of the Obama approach to the Race to the Top, is that a slew of research over the last decade has discovered that what makes the most difference is the quality of the teachers and the principals who supervise them. Dan Goldhaber, an education researcher at the University of Washington, reported, ''The effect of increases in teacher quality swamps the impact of any other educational investment, such as reductions in class size.''
 This building on 118th Street could be Exhibit A for that conclusion.
 ''I've got one child in a charter and have had two in public schools,'' says Bernice Wynn, who runs an optician's shop on Lenox Avenue with her husband, and whose daughter, Tiana, is in the Harlem Success Academy. ''There is no comparison. Tiana is in first grade and already reading chapter books and writing stories.'' 
 ''Someone like Perkins has to know that we know that,'' DeJuan, her husband, adds. 
 Perkins argues that ''we have to focus on improving the public schools for everyone.'' Klein's response is that while charter schools can never be a substitute for a public school system, they can demonstrate how public schools can be improved, while creating healthy competition for a system that used to be a monopoly. ''Parent choice can only make all schools better,'' he says, paraphrasing a favorite line on the placards of the parents who picketed Perkins in Albany last winter and in Downtown Manhattan last month when he held a hearing about charters. Perkins himself benefited from parent choice; he graduated from Collegiate, the prestigious West Side private boys' school, something he says ''is irrelevant.'' ''There is nothing wrong with a mother wanting her children to get the best education,'' he says.
 Two weeks ago, the reform network was buzzing with the news that the political consultant Basil Smikle had announced that he was running against Perkins in the Democratic primary this September and that Perkins's opposition to charters would be his main issue. Mulgrew of the U.F.T. was quoted in The New York Post praising Perkins as a ''staunch supporter of all the children of Harlem. That will weigh heavily in our endorsement process.'' 
 *********
 AS JOHN KING struggled to prepare New York's application, he knew that the entire school system could benefit from Race to the Top money if the state lifted the charter-school cap. That's why King was pushing for the change so urgently, as was Merryl Tisch, the chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents.
 That is also why, at about midnight on Saturday, Jan. 16, Tisch answered the phone in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and let out an earsplitting shriek. She recalls that her husband, James Tisch, who is the chief executive of Loews Corporation, thought someone must have died. What she was reacting to was a draft of a bill concerning charters that had just been released by the State Assembly. 
 The first paragraphs seemed to lift the cap. But a closer reading revealed so many conditions that it would be no easier to start new charters than under the current law. With three days left before New York's application was due, Silver and the Democrats were choosing to side with the union over winning a possible $700 million that the Race offered her financially strapped state. Thus, Tisch's shriek.
 ''I'm told that the people from Nysut'' -- New York State United Teachers -- ''and the U.F.T. drafted the poison-pill provisions,'' Tisch said. Silver denied that, adding, ''If it's something someone doesn't agree with, they call it a poison pill.'' Silver told me he ''supports charters, but to me the real need remains supporting public education with the resources to lower class size.''
 *********
 ALTHOUGH THE last-minute crisis over the charter cap grabbed headlines all over New York, it turned out to be the least of the problems in the state's proposal. Its application featured comic overstatements -- New York has been recognized for its ''ability to move poor performing teachers from the classroom,'' for example -- and far more significant omissions and misstatements, all of which were the product of King's game effort to finesse the grip the unions have on public education in New York. 
 For example, the states were instructed to check boxes on a grid to signal which of their local school systems had signed a memorandum of understanding, or M.O.U., agreeing with the state to implement each of the many initiatives their plans promised if the state got the Race money. To make this expression of commitment unambiguous, the Race application included the exact M.O.U. that was to be signed. The contest instructions also stated that if the wording of the M.O.U. for any local school system was changed to make it ''conditional,'' the box should not be checked.
 New York checked all the boxes for all of its school districts for all of the initiatives on the grid it submitted. But in a 403-page appendix to its 348-page application, New York included the M.O.U. that actually had been signed by all of its school districts. It was worded almost exactly as the federal government's M.O.U. -- except that after reciting everything that would be done to link student tests to teacher evaluations, and to compensate teachers and move them up on a career ladder according to those evaluations, the New York M.O.U. inserted this qualifier: ''consistent with any applicable collective-bargaining requirements.'' The same phrase was also inserted after the promise to ''ensure the equitable distribution of effective teachers'' -- a reform aimed at allowing school systems to assign their best teachers to the schools most in need. Then for good measure at the end of the entire M.O.U. this sentence was added to cover everything: ''Nothing in this M.O.U. shall be construed to override any applicable state or local collective-bargaining requirements.''
 Of course the U.F.T.'s collective-bargaining agreements in New York City, as well as union contracts in much of the rest of the state, explicitly prohibit exactly the reforms promised in the application. Changing that is the point of Duncan's contest. When I asked Tisch about this, she pointed to another added sentence, in which each school system and the union agree to negotiate any necessary contract changes in ''good faith.'' That's the ''way we solved that,'' she says. 
 ''Right,'' Klein says. ''That's like telling a woman you'll marry her in the morning.'' 
 *********
 MOREOVER, IT TURNS out that Mulgrew of the city's U.F.T. refused to sign even that altered M.O.U. Instead, shortly before the applications were due in Washington, he submitted a completely redone version that outlined a teacher-evaluation program that would be completely voluntary and that contained a provision declaring that ''student performance data shall not be a factor in decisions regarding individual teacher compensation.'' 
 I asked Mulgrew over breakfast, ''If Arne Duncan was sitting here with a check ready to give to New York, and he said he'd give it to you if you promise to allow test scores to be tied to compensation, would you make the promise?''
 ''No -- I'd tell him we have to negotiate with the guy up the street,'' Mulgrew replied, referring to Klein, ''to come up with a fair system first. But I could not promise him that we could.'' 
 ''Would you promise to support a repeal of the state law requiring layoffs to be done only on the basis of seniority?'' I asked him, referring to what has now become another controversial issue. 
 ''No, that's the law,'' he said.
 Nonetheless, the box signifying the U.F.T.'s agreement to the standard M.O.U. was also checked. 
 Klein says he didn't want to sign the M.O.U. because the caveats made it meaningless, but he ultimately went along so as not to ''seem like a spoilsport.'' 
 David Steiner, the commissioner for the New York State Department of Education, signed the application. He offered no explanation for why the boxes were checked other than that his staff has since looked at other applications and found that Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Illinois also checked the boxes ''based,'' he said, ''on a future commitment to collectively bargain.'' He's right. California did the same thing, as did lots of other states, including the first-round winner, Delaware. (In Delaware's case, however, the core of its commitments -- like how teachers will be evaluated -- did not require a union sign-off, explained Donohue, the Delaware state teachers' union president. The collective-bargaining caveat in the M.O.U., she said, ''has to do with other, smaller aspects of the plan, like extending school days at turnaround schools, which I am sure we will agree on.'')
 When it came time for King and four others representing New York to make a presentation to the Race's vetters in Washington, King's performance, as seen on a video I reviewed of the session, looked a bit like a hostage tape. ''We were all struggling,'' King recalls. ''We thought we had a great proposal in terms of what we could control -- like curricula standards and data systems -- but the areas we could not control because of the contracts and laws were difficult.''
 *********
 EVEN IF THE UNION still has support in strongholds like Albany, union leaders like Weingarten and Mulgrew seem to have realized that the political pressure the Race has generated means they have to yield in some places and in some ways. In mid-April, Mulgrew agreed with Klein to streamline the teacher-discipline process in a way that, by the end of the year, will close New York's so-called rubber rooms, the infamous ''reassignment centers'' where the New York City teachers charged with the most extreme incompetence or misconduct (currently 600 out of 80,000) are sent to do nothing while they await tenure-protected arbitration hearings. Until this agreement, the arbitration process lasted an average of three years, during which the teachers remained on the payroll and accumulated pension entitlements. Only a handful of teachers were ever dismissed at the end of the process. It will now still probably take at least a year to remove these most egregiously incompetent or misbehaving teachers, and there continues to be no broader process in place in New York for evaluating, promoting or removing teachers based on performance. Nonetheless, this is a concession that the union had repeatedly refused to make. 
 Weingarten has always embraced teacher accountability in theory, but with the caveat that the system has to be fair, after which she adds that there's no way to guarantee that linking student progress to testing will be fair because tests don't take subjective factors into account, nor would allowing subjective evaluations by principals be fair. To the reformers, Weingarten's refrain has until lately seemed a way to duck reform while appearing to favor it. But last month, she took an important, if muted, step toward the reformers: she ended a high-profile confrontation in Washington, D.C., by agreeing to the elimination of tenure-based job security. 
 ''When I came here, all the adults were fine; they all had satisfactory ratings,'' says Washington's schools superintendent, Michelle Rhee, referring to the teachers. ''But only 8 percent of eighth graders were on grade level for math. How's that for an accountable system that puts the children first?'' 
 In 2008, Rhee -- a Klein protegee, who founded the New Teacher Project after teaching in Baltimore for Teach for America -- proposed huge salary increases for those teachers who would give up lifetime tenure guarantees and lockstep compensation and agree to have their performance linked to student test-score improvements. Those who didn't volunteer could keep their current pay scales and job security. For two years, the union refused to allow Rhee's offer to be put up for a vote. Rhee persisted -- ''I'm not big on the collaborative, warm and fuzzy approach,'' she says -- and became a hero of the reformers. 
 Despite efforts by both sides to save face for the union by preserving the language of tenure, the deal that Weingarten and Rhee negotiated in April actually achieved more than Rhee sought in her original offer. The new contract unambiguously, if subtlely, strips tenure of its core job-security protections. Two clauses now make it possible for Rhee to fire any teacher with tenure, no matter which track he or she chooses (lockstep compensation or performance-based pay), if the teacher is evaluated as ''ineffective'' for one year or ''minimally effective'' for two years. The criteria used to define ''ineffective'' or ''minimally effective'' are, according to another clause, ''a nonnegotiable item'' determined solely by Rhee and her staff. Rhee still has catching up to do when it comes to the data systems that other Race finalists demonstrated, but this new contract -- which New York's Klein calls ''a home run for Michelle'' -- gives the District of Columbia a better shot for the second round. (Washington placed 16th in the first round.) 
 The teachers' unions have become accustomed in recent years to fighting off reform efforts by Republicans and think-tank do-gooders. They ignore the rhetorical noise, while sticking to the work of negotiating protectionist contracts with the politicians who run school systems and depend on their political support. But what happened last month in Washington could signal a new era in which the unions have to worry that Democrats, like Washington's mayor, Adrian Fenty, not only won't yield in contract negotiations but will also support laws and programs aimed at forcing accountability. That is the threat posed by the Race. ''Deliberately or not, President Obama, whom I supported, has shifted the focus from resources and innovation and collaboration to blaming it all on dedicated teachers,'' Weingarten says. 
 Certainly, the political math has changed. ''My basic calculus of school reform is that I know I have every Republican vote and at least some of the Democrats,'' says Mike Johnston, a Colorado state senator who is a Democrat and avid reformer (and another Teach for America alumnus). As with Bredesen's Tennessee First to the Top Act, Johnston got lopsided votes for a Race-friendly bill he sponsored in February that not only ties student test scores back to teachers but also names the educational institutions that trained the teachers, so that education schools, too, would be held accountable. 
 But Colorado is more union-friendly than Tennessee, and Johnston's math only got him so far last winter in a state where Democrats are the majority in both houses of the Legislature. He also pushed for a bill that would make 50 percent of annual teacher evaluations depend on test scores. However, Gov. Bill Ritter, another Democrat, instead submitted an executive order setting up a council to define effectiveness and create an implementation plan that would then be presented to the Legislature. That probably explains why Colorado -- whose largest school system, in Denver, already has strong teacher-accountability rules -- did not win in the first round; the state was a finalist but came in 14th. 
 ''I'm going to try to get the bill passed in May,'' Johnston told me in April. ''Not winning the first round should help.'' Last week, despite a pushback from the union that included demonstrations and radio ads, his bill passed by a wide margin with votes from both parties. And in a development that would have seemed surreal six months ago, Weingarten endorsed the bill after Johnston agreed to minor amendments, including an appeal process for those tenured teachers judged ineffective. (The larger teachers' union, the National Education Association, opposed it.) Colorado now seems likely to win in Round 2 of Race to the Top. 
 Asked if Colorado and the District of Columbia didn't represent some pretty significant concessions, Weingarten told me, ''Anyone who knows me knows that I have always favored what's good for children and fair to teachers, and that's what I stood for here.''
 *********
 DUNCAN'S HARD LINE in the first-round awards obviously helped Johnston. But other reformers worry not only that Duncan praised the many states with weaker proposals than Colorado's that made it into the first round of 16 finalists, like New York, but also that he has promised that there will be ''10 to 12'' more winners in the second round to share the remaining $3.4 billion. With that money to be awarded this September -- at the height of the Congressional election season, when dispensing pork might be tempting -- would Duncan reach far enough down the scoring charts this time to award states that aren't serious about his reform goals? Would a simple fix in the New York law capping the number of charter schools, perhaps passed on the eve of the second application's June 1 deadline, be enough to mask the more fundamental deficiencies in the New York plan? Indeed, three weeks ago the Democratically controlled State Senate did exactly that, in what Klein calls ''a bend in history's arc caused by the Race.'' (The Assembly had not acted as of this writing.) 
 Moreover, on May 11, Tisch and Steiner announced that in anticipation of the June 1 deadline for the second round of Race applications they had gotten the unions to agree to a four-tiered evaluation system for teachers -- ''highly effective,'' ''effective,'' ''developing'' and ''ineffective'' -- that would replace the old satisfactory-unsatisfactory regime. In part the evaluations would be tied to state standardized test scores, though they would count for only 20 to 25 percent of an evaluation. This would seem to make it easier to remove ineffective teachers, because the agreement calls for a teacher's removal if judged ineffective two years in a row, and, as such, it's a reform that would have been unimaginable four months ago when the first-round application was filed -- or even two months ago, when Mulgrew and I had breakfast. But it still does not allow for these evaluations to be linked to teacher compensation, and the small print allows for a drawn-out collective-bargaining process over what the other 75 to 80 percent of the evaluation criteria would be -- before which the evaluations could apparently not begin. Nonetheless, it will make New York's second-round application stronger.
 One reason New York may have gone even as far as it did in the first round could be that good intentions can't guarantee perfect execution in a federal bureaucracy. Joanne Weiss, who runs the Race program for Secretary Duncan, began last summer to recruit experts, called ''peer reviewers,'' to score the applications in a way that would inoculate the decisions from charges of political favoritism. Five vetters were assigned to each application, and the score was the average of their individual scores. Duncan would reserve the right to override the point scores, but if he did, he would have to explain himself because the scores would be released publicly. (He told me that he doesn't plan to override the vetters.) Department of Education regulations required that the scorers not only have no financial interest in the outcome of their decisions, but not even an appearance of a conflict, both in terms of money and potential bias. This pretty much eliminated people involved in operating school systems or those who are active in Schnur's reform network, yielding vetters who were academics, education foundation staff members (but not at places like the Gates Foundation that finance reform projects) and long-retired educators. 
 ''When I found out that the reviewers would be people who are not directly involved in K-through-12 education, I got concerned,'' recalled Paul Pastorek, the Louisiana schools superintendent who is widely admired in reform circles. Pastorek's application included impressive details of what Louisiana had already achieved in creating data systems, described the state's overhauling of New Orleans schools following Hurricane Katrina and presented a comprehensive plan for more progress. Pastorek and I had this conversation about the scorers about three weeks before he found out that his state came in 11th. According to the tallies, he'd have come in much higher but for the rating he received from one scorer, who gave Louisiana a surprising 349, which was lower than New York's average score. 
 However the mechanics of the process might be improved in the second round, some of the reformers were also concerned, as three of them told me, all using the same phrase, that Duncan's language was ''too collaborative.'' What they meant was that by emphasizing how the unions had bought into the plans of the two first-round winners, Delaware and Tennessee, he was suggesting that the unions could block a state from winning by not signing on. 
 When I talked to him in April, Duncan denied wanting to send that signal, noting that Georgia and Florida, with no union sign-offs but far-reaching plans, finished third and fourth in the first round. And he nodded when I speculated that Florida's chances seemed even better for the second round because a new law -- passed by both houses of the Legislature after the first round ended -- would force accountability on all teachers without the union's agreement. ''What we want are the plans that touch the most children,'' Duncan said. ''Ideally we want the adults working together, but at the end of the day, this is about doing reform.'' 
 After we spoke -- in another sign not only of the turmoil caused by the Race but also of the union's continued power -- Florida's governor, Charlie Crist, who is in a hotly contested Senate race, vetoed the teacher-accountability bill. He said he did so because ''the people spoke, and they spoke loudly.'' Those on the other side pointed to a ferocious lobbying campaign by the state teachers' union that generated more than 100,000 e-mail messages and phone calls to Crist's office. 
 As the Florida fight suggests, this is not a battle that is going to end soon. In fact, even as the battle lines have now been drawn in communities and state capitals across the country, the fight is about to come back to Washington, where turning a grant program into a contest started it all. President Obama was so pleased with the reaction to the Race that he recently proposed a new $1.3 billion contest after the first two rounds are completed, this time directed at individual school districts instead of states. More significant, Duncan has said that some of the billions in more traditional annual federal aid that has flowed to states according to population formulas should now be based on Racelike competitions aimed at various pieces of the reform agenda. ''This is the chance of a lifetime,'' Duncan says. ''We have to move the country in a fundamental, dramatic way.'' 
 In a Congress controlled by Democrats, that could be a struggle. When Duncan's testimony broached the broader idea at a March Congressional hearing, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, David Obey, a Democratic representative from Wisconsin -- which finished 26th out of 41 entrants in the first round of the Race -- reminded Duncan of the states' dire need for basic funds and signaled his skepticism about the Race reforms, declaring, ''When the sailboat is sinking, my top priority would not be to put a new coat of varnish on the deck.'' (Obey recently announced he will retire next year, perhaps making Duncan's reform path easier.) 
 ''Every Democrat knows the president really cares about this,'' Schnur says. Which suggests that the Nixon-to-China dynamic that prevailed in states like Tennessee may work in Washington. Obama could most likely get some, probably many, Democratic votes, while winning support from Republicans on an issue they have championed so strongly in the past that taking a flat-out anti-Obama approach would be especially awkward. 
 ''That President Obama did this is a total game changer,'' says Pastorek, the Louisiana schools superintendent, who is a Republican working for a Republican governor, Bobby Jindal. ''If he really sticks to this, education will never be the same.''

HEADLINE: Specter Legacy Is Study Of the Perils of a Switch

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
After decades in public life, Senator Arlen Specter has left his mark on the big issues of his time, from President John F. Kennedy's assassination and President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial to matters of terrorism and biomedical research. He steered billions of federal dollars home to Pennsylvania and played a major role in shaping the makeup of the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary.
 But after the long campaign that ended his career on Tuesday, Mr. Specter, 80, may be remembered more for switching to the Democratic Party after 44 years as a Republican, a brazen act of political jujitsu that rarely ends well. For the moment, his legacy has been boiled down to a teachable moment on the perils of such maneuvers, especially so late in life.
 ''The legacy of political switches is that you can't do it,'' said Chris Mottola, a Republican consultant who ran Mr. Specter's media campaign. 
 But the bigger lesson in Mr. Specter's defeat, in Mr. Mottola's view, is that ''it dissuades people from having a light and playful mind.'' He brought up the bizarre moment during Mr. Clinton's impeachment proceedings, when Mr. Specter, who believed that the president had not received a fair trial, cited Scottish law and singularly cast his vote as ''not proven.''
 ''O.K., that was goofy,'' Mr. Mottola said. ''But I'd rather have that guy representing me than some ideologic automaton.'' 
 When the curtain came down Tuesday night, Mr. Specter -- who began his political career as a Democrat, became a Republican in 1965, then switched back to the Democrats in 2009 -- looked drained and stunned. The longest-serving senator in Pennsylvania history, the master of survival, the one who could always squeak through a tight race, had met his match -- and it was his former Republican self. 
 Mr. Specter came up with just 46 percent of the vote, while a relatively obscure congressman, Joe Sestak, who had run a campaign by the seat of his pants, walked away with 54 percent and the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate.
 Analysts attributed the loss to multiple factors: a queasiness about Mr. Specter among Democratic voters, many of whom had been voting against him as a Republican for decades; Mr. Sestak's plausibility as an alternative; a commercial showing Mr. Specter being endorsed in 2004 by President George W. Bush, who remains extremely unpopular among Pennsylvania Democrats; and Mr. Specter's own words, saying that switching parties would get him re-elected. It also rained Tuesday, meaning that the more liberal, enthusiastic activists who supported Mr. Sestak were more likely to go to the polls.
 Mr. Specter had the backing of the Democratic establishment, including the White House, the governor, the unions and Democratic donors, but this may have backfired in a year of revolt against incumbents. The party switch only added to the sense that Mr. Specter's chief concern was his own political survival.
 President Obama had endorsed Mr. Specter at a fund-raiser several months earlier, footage of which was replayed constantly in Specter commercials. Still, Specter supporters were furious that Mr. Obama never showed up in the final days of the campaign, although it was not clear that even a last-minute Obama rally in Philadelphia would have driven up turnout enough to have offset Mr. Specter's losses across the rest of the state. (He won 3 of 67 counties.)
 ''He should have been here,'' Representative Robert A. Brady, chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic committee and an important Specter ally, said of Mr. Obama. It was all the more humiliating, he said, that the president actually flew over Pennsylvania on the day of the primary on his way to Ohio. Mr. Mottola said Mr. Obama's absence showed he was a fair-weather friend other candidates could not trust.
 Mr. Specter declined to be interviewed for this article.
 In his brief and subdued concession speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Specter appeared to choke up. He said simply that it had been ''a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania'' and to be in the Senate, then abruptly left the stage. It was obviously not an easy moment for a self-made man who had fought his way to such heights.
 ''His father, Harry Specter, who was a peddler, took 5-year-old Arlen to small Kansas towns selling cantaloupes door to door with a small basket in hand,'' Mr. Specter's Web site says of his early life during the Great Depression. When the Specters settled later in Russell, Kan., where Harry owned a junkyard, they were the only Jews in town. Mr. Specter told The Philadelphia Inquirer that while he felt separate from everyone else, ''I didn't get beat up because I fought back.''
 He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1951 from the University of Pennsylvania, served in the Air Force and graduated from Yale Law School in 1956. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, he served on the Warren Commission, where he helped formulate the ''single-bullet theory,'' which bolstered the idea of a single assassin.
 Mr. Specter ran as a Democrat on the Republican ticket for district attorney in Philadelphia in 1965 and after his victory switched his registration. After two terms, he lost and went on to several more defeats before winning a Senate seat in 1980. He has been there ever since.
 During the last two decades, he has undergone open-heart surgery and surgery for a brain tumor, as well as chemotherapy for two bouts of Hodgkin's lymphoma, but he fought this race vigorously. He frequently plays squash and enjoys a martini. 
 Mr. Specter has always prided himself on his intellect and his political skills.
 ''He's an example of an almost heroic kind of survivor in hostile political environments and has an adroitness in terms of negotiating very, very tricky political turns,'' said Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University who specializes in the Senate. But, he added, there was no affection for him.
 He was battered by Republicans after blocking Robert H. Bork, the conservative judge, from the Supreme Court in 1987. Then he was battered by Democrats after interrogating Anita Hill, who had accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, after Mr. Thomas was nominated to the court in 1991. In his fiercest prosecutorial style, he accused Ms. Hill of ''flat-out perjury,'' earning himself a reputation as a bully; while he won re-election (and Mr. Thomas was confirmed), that episode remains a source of anger for some voters to this day.
 ''He has been a serious and consequential senator for three decades,'' said Thomas Mann, a longtime Congress watcher at the Brookings Institution, ''yet mostly ungenerous words come to mind: driven, tenacious, arrogant, self-righteous, opportunistic.''
 And now, Mr. Mann said, Mr. Specter's legacy is ''his insistence at 80 years of age to do everything possible to try to stay in office.''
 Even before he switched parties last year, Mr. Specter, one of the last of the moderate Republicans, got grief from his party for frequently voting with Democrats. But the Democrats did not always appreciate him. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, wrote in a 2008 memoir that Mr. Specter ''is always with us when we don't need him.''
 That became less true when Mr. Obama was pushing through his economic stimulus bill last year. Mr. Specter was one of three Republicans to vote yes, which only increased his party's ire and set in motion his switch on April 28, 2009. Mr. Obama said he was ''thrilled,'' as the move would give Senate Democrats a filibuster-proof majority, and pledged his full support in the comingcampaign.
 At the time, Mr. Specter said candidly that he could not win re-election in a Republican primary because his party had moved to the right. 
 ''I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate, not prepared to have that record decided by that jury,'' he said.
 But the jury he handpicked, the Democratic primary electorate, judged that record without much sympathy, and his failed bid to hang on to his office has become a cautionary tale. 
 ''The lesson is to be true to yourself,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who worked with Mr. Specter to increase financing for the National Institutes of Health.
 ''Maybe there comes a time when people think, 'Should I run anymore -- is there a time to bow out gracefully?' '' Mr. Harkin said. ''But that's not Arlen's style. He's a fighter. And he was going to go down fighting.''

HEADLINE: All Victory Is Local

BYLINE: By CHUCK TODD, MARK MURRAY and DOMENICO MONTANARO. 
Chuck Todd is the chief White House correspondent and political director for NBC, where Mark Murray is the deputy political director and Domenico Montanaro is a political reporter.

 BODY:
MAKE no mistake: The Democratic Party and the Obama White House face a treacherous political environment this November, and Democrats are set to lose quite a few House and Senate seats in the midterm elections.
 When the country is as angry and frustrated as polls suggest it now is -- most Americans continue to believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction, more than 70 percent disapprove of Congress, and a whopping 8 in 10 are dissatisfied with the state of the economy -- voters typically take out their frustrations on the party in power. 
 But what happened in the only race on Tuesday that pitted a Democratic candidate against a Republican -- a House contest largely overshadowed by the night's Senate primaries in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Arkansas -- is a reminder that anger alone won't be enough for Republicans to regain control of Congress. The reason: Good campaigns and good candidates can overcome a tough political environment. 
 And that's why, in the special election to fill the seat of the late Representative John Murtha of Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate, Mark Critz, defeated the Republican, Tim Burns, by eight percentage points, 53 percent to 45 percent. 
 Pennsylvania's largely Democratic 12th Congressional District has the distinction of being the only district in the nation that John Kerry won in 2004, but that flipped to John McCain in '08. It's precisely the kind of district Republicans must capture to take control of the House in the fall.
 So the Democrats' victory in this contest was a big blow to the Republican Party. Indeed, this was the Democrats' third consecutive victory in a highly competitive House special election since President Obama took office, with two other wins in upstate New York; going back to the 2008 cycle, it was their sixth straight win, with victories in Illinois, Louisiana and Mississippi. 
 By comparison, before Republicans took back control of Congress in 1994, they were the ones winning the key special elections heading into the midterms, especially a high-profile one in Kentucky. And heading into the 2006 elections, when Democrats took over the House and Senate, they did far better than expected in special elections in Ohio and California (though they still lost those contests). The trend is pretty clear: In 1994, 2006 and 2008, success in special election contests was a harbinger of success in the fall. 
 Although luck and timing have helped Democrats maintain their current streak -- Mr. Critz benefited from the Democratic turnout in the competitive Senate primary between Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Joe Sestak -- these victories haven't been a fluke. 
 The Pennsylvania special election was an important reminder that riding the wave of voter discontent might not be enough for Republicans this fall. 
 Of course, Republicans didn't necessarily see it that way. In recent days, they have argued that Mr. Critz's conservative stands -- he opposes the health care law, the cap-and-trade energy legislation and abortion rights -- indicated that the electorate was more aligned with them than with the Democrats. But what it really shows is that the Democrats picked the right candidate to retain this conservative but still Democratic-leaning district. 
 Come November, Republicans' ability to win in these types of districts and against these types of candidates could very well be the difference between picking up 25 seats (a good showing, but near the historical average for the opposition party in a president's first midterm cycle) and 40-plus seats (which would make John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, the next House speaker). 
 Message also matters. In this race, the Republican campaign against Mr. Critz was all over the place. Republicans and right-leaning interest groups tied him to President Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; they tried to associate him with the Democrats' health care reform, even though he opposed it; and they attempted to link Mr. Critz, a former Murtha aide, to ethical allegations involving his old boss. 
 By contrast, Mr. Critz and the Democrats had a relatively consistent message -- they portrayed Mr. Burns, a millionaire businessman, as out of touch with Pennsylvanians, and Mr. Critz as someone who would deliver for the district. In short, while Republicans were trying to nationalize the race, Democrats localized it.
 Finally, because special elections are usually mad dashes to fill vacant seats, organization plays a key role. The political parties must quickly find candidates, build campaigns and turn out the vote. 
 In Pennsylvania's 12th, Democrats simply had the better operation. ''The Burns campaign and the G.O.P. failed to identify and get out their voters,'' the nonpartisan Cook Political Report observed in its post-mortem of the race. ''Whereas Senator Scott Brown received more votes in January 2009 than John McCain received in Massachusetts in 2008 ... Tim Burns couldn't even muster the votes McCain received'' in the district. This result suggests an organizational disadvantage that the Republicans need to correct before the midterms.
 Beyond the tactics, a lesson from Pennsylvania and other recent special contests is that when Democrats engage, they can win. The waves in 1994 and 2006 were caused, in part, by the incumbent party's demoralized base. These Democratic victories indicate that the Democrats' base is not demoralized -- it's just not engaged yet. If those base voters get engaged, or if the party engages them as it did in these special elections, Democrats are likely to at least hold their majorities. 
 The good news for Republicans is that they were expected to finally win a special election in Hawaii on Saturday night. But that was due mainly to a split Democratic vote in a three-candidate race.
 The better news for them is that this political environment still remains favorable for Republicans. The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that more than 60 percent of the country prefers divided government -- with one party controlling the presidency and the other controlling Congress. And when Election Day becomes 435 special House elections across the country, that kind of environment will only benefit Republicans.
 Yet the Pennsylvania special election taught us that in the battle for control of Congress, a good candidate running a good local campaign can trump even a very bad national attitude.

HEADLINE: Americans Conclude North Korean Leader Authorized Attack on South

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A new American intelligence analysis of a deadly torpedo attack on a South Korean warship concludes that Kim Jong-il, the ailing leader of North Korea, must have authorized the torpedo assault, according to senior American officials who cautioned that the assessment was based on their sense of the political dynamics there rather than hard evidence.
 The officials said they were increasingly convinced that Mr. Kim ordered the sinking of the ship, the Cheonan, to help secure the succession of his youngest son. 
 ''We can't say it is established fact,'' said one senior American official who was involved in the highly classified assessment, based on information collected by many of the country's 16 intelligence agencies. ''But there is very little doubt, based on what we know about the current state of the North Korean leadership and the military.'' 
 Nonetheless, both the conclusion and the timing of the assessment could be useful to the United States as it seeks to rally support against North Korea. 
 On Monday, South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, who has moved cautiously since the assault, is expected to call for the United Nations Security Council to condemn the attack and is likely to terminate the few remaining trade ties between North and South that provide the North with hard currency. 
 But those steps have little chance of proving meaningful unless China, which hosted Mr. Kim two weeks ago, agrees to join the condemnation and refuses to make up whatever revenue North Korea loses from any trade embargoes. China, North Korea's last true ally, has traditionally been reluctant to pressure the North too much, even when the North Koreans conducted nuclear tests, for fear of toppling the government and sending a flood of refugees across its border.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in Beijing when the South Korean action is announced, leading a delegation of 200 American officials, including roughly half of the Obama administration's cabinet, in an annual ''strategic dialogue'' with Chinese leaders on a variety of economic and political issues.
 So far, at least in public, both American and South Korean leaders have been careful never to link Mr. Kim to the sinking of the Cheonan in March, which killed 46 sailors. Officials said that was in part because of the absence of hard evidence -- difficult to come by in the rigidly controlled North -- but also largely because both countries were trying to avoid playing into Mr. Kim's hands by casting one of the worst attacks since the 1953 armistice as another piece of lore about the Kim family taking on South Korea and the West. 
 The North's state propaganda surrounding that imagery has been used by the Kim family to sustain two generations of leaders since the end of World War II. Under the leading theory of the American intelligence agencies, Mr. Kim ordered the attack to re-establish both his control and his credentials after a debilitating stroke two years ago, and by extension reinforcing his right to name his son Kim Jong-un as his successor. 
 North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, despite the presentation of forensic evidence on Thursday -- including parts of the torpedo found in the wreckage -- that experts from three countries said established that the torpedo was launched from a North Korean submarine. 
 Although the American officials who spoke about the intelligence assessment would not reveal much about what led them to conclude that Mr. Kim was directly involved, one factor appeared to be intelligence that he appeared on April 25, the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, with a military unit that intelligence agencies believe to have been responsible for the attack. 
 Mr. Kim used the event to praise the group, Unit 586, the officials said, and around that time a fourth star appears to have been given to Gen. Kim Myong-guk, who officials believe may have played a crucial role in executing the attack. General Kim is believed to have been demoted to a three-star general last year, perhaps in response to the humiliation that took place after a North Korean ship ventured into South Korean waters. The North Korean ship was all but destroyed, and some analysts believe the attack on the Cheonan, which was in South Korean waters, was planned as retribution. 
 ''Nobody is going to take overt credit for the sinking,'' said Jonathan Pollack, a professor at the Naval War College and an expert on North Korea's military. ''But Kim's visit to this unit has all the hallmarks of congratulating them for a job well done.''
 The senior American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the intelligence assessment is classified, said they ruled out the idea that General Kim or another military officer decided on his own to attack, but they did not explain how they reached that conclusion. 
 Victor Cha, a North Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a former official in the National Security Council during President George W. Bush's second term in office, noted that when Mr. Kim was on the rise three decades ago, ''there were similar incidents designed to build his credibility'' as a leader. 
 The Cheonan episode has posed some difficult choices for the Obama administration at a time when its national security team is preoccupied with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. 
 In an intense series of back-channel discussions with Mr. Lee, senior administration officials, including President Obama, have praised South Korea for its calm response. Like the South Koreans, American officials fear that any military retaliation against the North could quickly escalate, leading to rocket attacks on Seoul, major casualties and a panic among investors in South Korea. At the same time, they worry that if North Korea gets through the episode without paying a price -- one that American officials decline to define -- it could embolden the North Korean military.
 The North Korean defense commission, which rarely issues public statements, turned out a fiery-sounding warning last week, saying it would respond to any military retaliation with ''all-out war.''

HEADLINE: The Slow Lane

BYLINE: By JOHN BOWE

 BODY:
Common knowledge, at least in Portugal, that Lisboetas are cosmopolitan, open-minded, but slightly aloof. Denizens of the Algarve are, shall we say, thrifty. But the people of Alentejo? They're nothing but punch-line fodder. Joke No. 1: Why do Alentejanos hide their money in their garden hoes? Well, since they never work, who would ever think to look there? 
 Joke No. 2: Why do Alentejanos place a chair by the bed? So if they're tired when they wake up, they can plunk down and have a little rest! 
 Alentejo, the big province east and south of the capital, claims about a third of Portugal's territory but only about 5 percent of its population. There's a reason for this. While coastal Alentejo can be lush, dramatic and extraordinarily beautiful, the arid and rocky reaches of Alto Alentejo, an inland expanse of small villages, vineyards and olive groves east of Lisbon all the way to the Spanish border, is famous for being hot, sleepy and a bit old-fashioned. 
 Think of it as Portugal's answer to America's Great Plains. If you're the kind of traveler intent on ticking off the alpha-site checklist (Great Wall, Eiffel Tower, Machu Picchu), it might not be your thing. If your idea of fun is, say, self-touring the Texas Panhandle, then Alentejo offers a rewardingly under-digested corner of Portugal.
 Before the recession, the real estate boom had just begun to spur a bit of Spanish-style development across the area, notably the construction of the Rio Guadiana dam in the village of Alqueva, creating the biggest artificial lake in Western Europe. A half dozen golf courses are under way with the hopes of attracting millions of tourists. But the lighter side of the boom has been a flowering of out-of-the-way country inns, highly personalized labors of love built by former immigrants from the region. 
 Casa da Ermida de Santa Catarina, near Campo Maior, sits at the end of a long, bumpy driveway, perched on a hilltop peninsula, jutting out over the radiant blue waters of a sprawling reservoir. The area is surrounded by hills and sparsely planted olive groves and little else. When I arrived, I felt like I was showing up at a dude ranch, without the dudes. Or even the ranch. The breeze was warm and gentle, the pure product of open country, and the owner Carlos Guedes de Amorim's unobtrusively conceived interiors never let me forget where I was. 
 Some 60 miles south, near Alqueva, Herdade do Sobroso is a plantation-style hotel, vineyard and winery housing the patrician ambitions of its architect-owner, Ginestal Machado. The terrain, newly planted with tens of thousands of cork trees and more than a hundred acres of vines, suggests the Texas foothills, but the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen betrays the fervor of a true culinary evangelist out for converts. Dinner involves lots of game hunted on the enormous property, including javali (wild boar) and coelho (rabbit). 
 At the Refugio da Vila hotel, in the town of Portel, I spent time cooking with the chef Ricardo Moutinho, who'd come to Alentejo from Lisbon for its food, which he held to be ''more real'' than in other regions of the country. We breezed through a lesson on canja de perdiz (wild grouse soup), a staple found on virtually every menu in the region, then proceeded to migas, a dish concocted from two-day-old bread and whatever else a cook feels like adding (in this case, chorizo and bacon). Moving on to the acorda, a common type of soup made with old bread and salted cod, we began the stock with cilantro, garlic and salt. For lovers of peasant food, Alentejo's cuisine is manna: wild game, pork, muttony mutton and the ubiquitous bacalhau (codfish), all of it marinated with medieval quantities of garlic.
 Alentejo's food may parallel its people -- simple, hearty and unfussy. When Moutinho told me about his rigorous culinary training at a school in Lisbon, I assumed his ambitions extended toward three-star Michelin knighthood. But when I asked if this was so, he shrugged: ''I just want to be a good cook.'' When I told Moutinho about some mutton I'd enjoyed at a local restaurant, he got annoyed. ''I don't eat there anymore,'' he said. Beyond the sacramental mix of bay leaf, cilantro, mint and pennyroyal, the rival chef had had the gall to add clove to the mix. Clove! ''That's wrong,'' Moutinho said.
 It's precisely this resistance to change that makes the province unique and hard not to like. As the rest of the global-industrial complex morphs into one gigantic Dunkin' Donuts and Sunglass Hut outlet, Alentejo's signature and most charming characteristic is its lack of interest in any such fate. One afternoon, I found myself in a restaurant called Taberna do Adro, in Vila Fernando. I was finishing up a delicious meal of cerdo (pork) marinated in massa de pimentao, a red pepper paste. Fado played on the stereo, decorative ceramics adorned the walls, and only half of the restaurant's 20 seats were filled. The door opened the cool dark of the restaurant to the bright outdoors, and a family entered, the father first, with a low greeting: ''Boa tarde'' (''good afternoon''). No one answered. The father and 30ish-year-old son both wore jackets, loafers and three-day beards. The mother wore a conservative brown wool dress, the style of which you would only see on a middle-class matron in a formerly poor, Catholic country -- Ireland, Spain and Portugal. 
 The food came, and the family discussed it intently for several moments before drinking. Not in the overenthusiastic way of Food Network loyalists, but like people who have been enjoying meals together for decades. The father called for a toast, glasses were raised, and father, mother and son clinked happily, each with bread crumbs on their face.

HEADLINE: The 'Randslide' and Its Discontents

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IF there is one certain outcome to recent American elections, it's this: The results will invariably prove most of the Beltway's settled political narratives wrong. 
 Tuesday's pre-midterms were no exception. We were told that all incumbents and Washington insiders were doomed, but Exhibit A, the defeat of Arlen Specter, was hardly a test case. The sui generis opportunist Specter lost to another incumbent, a congressman who has been a Democrat far longer than he has. We were also told -- as we were, incessantly, in 2008 -- that blue-collar white men in western Pennsylvania would flee the Democrats. But in the special House election there -- Tuesday's only Republican-vs.-Democrat battle -- a million G.O.P. dollars and countless anti-Obama-Pelosi ads proved worthless. Not only did a Democrat win big, but that winner was a Washington insider's insider, a longtime aide to the seat's previous occupant, the quintessential pork baron John Murtha. 
 That said, it would be a mistake to overinterpret these results to spawn new, and equally bogus, narratives about rekindled Democratic prospects for November. The 2010 election was and is up for grabs. The only race with genuine long-term implications last week was Rand Paul's victory by a margin of some 24 percentage points in Kentucky's Republican senatorial primary. 
 The ''Randslide,'' in the triumphalist lingo favored by Sean Hannity at Fox News, was the Tea Party's first major election victory. As Charles Hurt, another conservative commentator, wrote in another Rupert Murdoch organ, The New York Post, this was no ''qualified'' win by a moderate with Tea Party support, like Scott Brown in Massachusetts. ''What we saw Tuesday night in Kentucky,'' Hurt enthused, ''was a pure, unalloyed victory for the Tea Party'' in which ''the son of the quirky congressman from Texas trounced the establishment candidate who had been groomed and supported by leaders at the highest levels of the Republican Party.''
 Ain't that the truth. The opponent whom Paul humiliated, Trey Grayson, was the protege of Mitch McConnell, Kentucky's senior senator and the G.O.P. Senate leader. Grayson was also endorsed by Dick Cheney, Rudy Giuliani, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and John Cornyn, the Texas senator who presides over the Republicans' Senate campaign committee (and its purse strings). But Paul had the supporters who matter, Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, the tag team that nowadays runs the conservative movement for fun and profit. 
 Unlike Scott Brown, whose Tea Party cred consisted mainly of opposition to the health care bill and a pickup truck, Paul is one of the movement's card-carrying founding fathers. From the start, he openly defined himself as a Tea Party tribune, and its followers embraced him (and contributed to him) as their uncompromising avatar. Now, after months of debate about what this movement is and isn't, Paul's victory provides clear-cut answers. 
 The Tea Party is not merely an inchoate expression of a political mood, or an amorphous ragtag band of diverse elements, or a bipartisan cry of dissatisfaction with the supposed ''government takeover'' of health care. The Tea Party is a right-wing populist movement with a specific ideology. It resides in the aging white base of the Republican Party and wants to purge that party of leaders who veer from its dogma. But divisive as the Tea Party may be within the G.O.P., it's hardly good news for President Obama and the Democrats either.
 Paul is articulate and hard-line. When he says he is antigovernment, he means it. Unlike McConnell, he wants to end all earmarks, including agricultural subsidies for a state that thrives on them. (He does vow to preserve Medicare payments, however; they contribute to his income as an ophthalmologist.) He wants to shut down the Department of Education and the Federal Reserve. Though a social conservative who would outlaw all abortions, he believes the federal government should leave drug enforcement to the states. 
 It's also in keeping with this ideology that Paul wants the federal government to stop shoveling taxpayers' money into wars. He was against the war in Iraq and finds the justification for our commitment in Afghanistan ''murky.'' He believes that America's national security is ''not threatened by Iran having one nuclear weapon.'' 
 No wonder he didn't get Cheney's endorsement; Paul also opposes the enhanced government surveillance mandated by the Patriot Act. The Tea Party is a rolling rebuke to the neocons' quarter-century dominance of the G.O.P. Only three months ago, Ron Paul, who shares his son's un-Cheney national security views, won the straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, ending Mitt Romney's three-year winning streak.
 With Rand Paul, we also get further evidence of race's role in a movement whose growth precisely parallels the ascent of America's first African-American president. The usual Tea Party apologists are saying that it was merely a gaffe -- and a liberal media trap -- when Paul on Wednesday refused to tell Rachel Maddow of MSNBC that he could fully support the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But Paul has expressed similar sentiments repeatedly, at least as far back as 2002. 
 His legal argument that the federal government cannot force private businesses to desegregate is the same used by Barry Goldwater, a frequently cited hero of Paul's, when the conservative standard-bearer voted against the Civil Rights Act at its inception. It's all about the Constitution, not race, you see. Under fire, Paul ultimately retreated from this stand -- much as the new Republican governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, finally withdrew his April proclamation saluting Confederate History Month. But not before both men's messages reached their intended demographic.
 Still, it's Paul's brand of populism, not his views on Jim Crow or Iran, that are most germane to the Tea Party's birth and its future -- both within the G.O.P. and as a force that will buffet Obama and the Democrats. Paul most abundantly embodies the movement's animus when he plays on classic American-style class resentment. His campaign loved to deploy the full name of his opponent, Charles Merwin Grayson III, a Harvard-educated banker's son. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Paul said the voters' message was to ''get rid of the power people, the people who run the show, the people who think they're above everybody else'' -- or, as he put it on an earlier occasion, the establishment who ''from their high-rise penthouse'' look down on and laugh at the ''American rabble.'' 
 That Paul gave his victory speech in a ''members only'' country club is no contradiction to white Tea Partiers. Their anger is directed at a loftier club that excludes them as well: the big-government and big-money elites partying together in that high-rise penthouse. At the Utah state G.O.P. convention this month, the mob shouted ''TARP! TARP! TARP!'' as it terminated the re-election bid of the conservative Senator Robert Bennett. It was Bennett's capital crime to vote for a bailout of Wall Street's high-flying bankers. 
 Mitch McConnell, long a go-to Republican for corporate interests in Washington, didn't just vote for TARP but called it ''one of the finest moments in the history of the Senate.'' That's why he's running around now claiming that the Senate's financial reform bill is another ''bailout'' catering to Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. In fact that bill is an attempt, however flawed, to police those whose reckless and possibly criminal behavior brought down the economy. McConnell has zero interest in curbing Wall Street. He just hopes that if he keeps screaming ''bailout'' in a crowded Capitol, the Tea Party crowd will forget that he (and a Republican president) helped engineer the mother of all bailouts. John McCain, who also voted for TARP, may need a similar subterfuge to save his neck in Arizona.
 It's far-fetched to Democrats that Tea Party populists could possibly believe that the party of McConnell and Romney and Murdoch will in the end be moved to side with the little guy against the penthouse powers that are the G.O.P.'s traditional constituency and financial underwriter. Some Democrats also find it far-fetched that Paul could repeat his victory this fall, given how extreme his views are even for a state as reliably red as Kentucky. 
 But the enthusiasm gap remains real. Tea Partiers will turn up at the polls, and not just in Kentucky. Democrats are less energized in part because even now the president has not fully persuaded many liberal populists in his own party that he is on their side. The suspicion lingers that a Wall Street recovery, not job creation, was his highest economic priority upon arriving at a White House staffed with Goldman alumni. No matter how hard the administration tries to sell health care reform and financial reform as part of the nation's economic recovery, these signal achievements remain thin gruel for those out of work.
 The unemployment numbers, unlikely to change drastically by November, will have more to say than any of Tuesday's results about what happens on Election Day this year. Yes, the Tea Party is radical, its membership is not enormous, and its race problem is real and troubling. But you can't fight an impassioned opposition merely with legislative actions that may bear fruit in the semi-distant future. If the Democrats can't muster their own compelling response to the populist rage out there, ''Randslide'' may reside in our political vocabulary long after ''Arlen Specter'' is leaving ''Jeopardy'' contestants stumped.

HEADLINE: Jobs and the Class of 2010

 BODY:
Commencement is supposed to be filled with hope, but for the class of 2010, these are grim times. Over the past year, the unemployment rate for college graduates under age 25 has averaged 9.1 percent. For the roughly half of high school graduates under 25 and not in college, the average is 22.8 percent.
 Worse, a deep labor recession, like this one, may be more than a temporary hardship. It could signal a long-term decline in living standards -- downward mobility. 
 Where you start out in your career has a big impact on where you end up. When jobs are scarce, more college grads start out in lower-level jobs with lower starting salaries. Academic research suggests that for many of these graduates, that correlates to overall lower levels of career attainment and lower lifetime earnings. 
 Tough times for college grads mean even tougher times for high school graduates, because fewer jobs mean more competition from college-educated workers. In the past year, 59.5 percent of young high school grads on average had a job, compared with 70.2 percent in 2007.
 The pat answer is that college students should consider graduate school as a way to delay a job search until things turn around, and that more high school students should go to college to improve their prospects. 
 For many undergraduates, especially those with large student debts, graduate school would be prohibitively expensive. And while more than half of this year's high school grads are expected to be enrolled in college in the fall, most will have to work to help pay the bills. For them, college is not a retreat from a bad job market; a bad market is an obstacle to a college degree. 
 Washington has not been helping enough. The 2009 stimulus package -- thanks to President Obama, Congressional Democrats and a few Republican senators -- has supported some 2.5 million jobs, helping to avert a much deeper recession. The economy is still missing more than 10 million jobs, and unless more is done to spur employment, the impact on many new graduates and other workers will be harsh. 
 In his budget this year, Mr. Obama called for $266 billion in spending for jobs and stimulus. So far, Congress has passed only a $15 billion tax credit for hiring in 2010 and a few short-term extensions of unemployment benefits. On Thursday, Democratic Congressional leaders called for $80 billion to extend federal benefits and subsidies for the unemployed through 2010 and to provide more aid to states. More emergency spending is crucial to support consumer demand and, by extension, hiring. The Democratic proposal also calls for relatively modest sums for summer youth jobs, small-business lending and state infrastructure bonds. 
 The measures should be passed quickly. But recent debates suggests that the Republicans -- in their role as nouveau deficit hawks -- are likely to oppose more job-related spending unless it is paid for. The deficit needs to be addressed when the economy recovers. Right now, tax increases or spending cuts would only reduce economic activity, weakening the boost the measures are supposed to provide. 
 The White House and Democratic lawmakers need to make that case forcefully. Lawmakers owe it to their constituents -- and explaining the need for more job spending should not be that hard. Far too many Americans know how bad the situation is out there. 
 In the longer term, Congress will also need to do more to foster jobs and industries of the future, like green technology. Several taxes could be enacted to help finance longer-term efforts, including the bank tax proposed by President Obama. Congress and the administration should also consider a financial transactions tax, both to curb speculation and to raise revenue to rebuild the economy that was damaged, in large part, by the banks' recklessness. 
 Without a bigger vision, more money and political courage, the future for those just entering the job market and those already there looks bleak for years to come.

HEADLINE: Lila Paul, Andrew Rymer

BYLINE: By PAULA SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Lila Roskin Paul and Andrew Scott Rymer are to be married Sunday at Oheka Castle, the former Otto Kahn house in Huntington, N.Y. Rabbi Paul M. Kurland is to officiate. 
 The couple met at Dartmouth, from which they both graduated, she summa cum laude and he cum laude.
 The bride, 32, is a senior underwriter and business development manager in New York at Atradius Trade Credit Insurance, part of the Atradius Group of the Netherlands; she analyzes political and economic risks in emerging markets and writes insurance policies. The bride has a master's in comparative politics from the London School of Economics. 
 She is the daughter of Carol Roskin-Paul and Dr. Henry A. Paul of New York. Her father works in New York is a general and child psychiatrist in private practice; he is also the executive director of the Karen Horney Clinic, a psychoanalytic mental health center. Her mother was until last year a psychiatric nurse in a private practice.
 The bridegroom, also 32, is a vice president in investment banking at Goldman Sachs in New York, where he works on health care mergers and acquisitions and oversees raising capital for health care companies. 
 He is a son of Beverly R. Rymer and Dr. Peter Rymer of Suffern, N.Y. The bridegroom's mother is a speech pathologist at Prime Time for Kids, an early learning center in New City, N.Y. His father is a dentist in private practice in Hillsdale, N.J. 
 Ms. Paul and Mr. Rymer met on the bus on their way to a camping trip for Dartmouth freshmen in September 1996. 
 ''She was just my type,'' he said. ''Not particularly tall. Blond, smart and beautiful.''
 They spoke to each other on the bus but were with different groups and did not see each other again until the last night of the trip. Back on campus, they remained friends through the next four years even as they dated others. Mr. Rymer said he wasn't ready ''to strike something up. Maturity-wise she was 10 years ahead of me.''
 They made a point to stay in touch after graduation. 
 ''She was one of the first people I talked to when I was thinking about changing jobs,'' he said, ''and the first person I called when I closed on my apartment.''
 In December 2007, Ms. Paul had a week's vacation from her job in London and decided to spend New Year's in New York. She planned to attend a party around the corner from Mr. Rymer's apartment and she asked him if she could stay at his place. Though she knew he was planning to spend the holidays in Miami she said she hoped he would change his mind, even dropping hints. ''But I didn't push it,'' she said. 
 Mr. Rymer, who was already in Florida when she arrived, did have a change of heart. ''I figured since she was staying in my apartment, if I'm ever going to make a move this is the time,'' he said. He called Ms. Paul to say he was returning to New York and on New Year's Eve, they both ended up at the same club. Close to midnight, as they were dancing, he kissed her.
 ''We were friends for so many years and I was impressed he was assertive and that he made the move because it could have gone any way if he didn't act on it,'' she said, adding she wasn't going to make the first move and his action propelled the relationship to the next level. ''He's a genuinely nice person so I didn't know he had this slightly cockier, confident streak in him, which is very attractive to me.'' PAULA SCHWARTZ

HEADLINE: Europeans Fear Crisis Threatens Liberal Benefits

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Reporting was contributed by Maia de la Baume and Scott Sayre from Paris, Niki Kitsantonis from Athens, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Across Western Europe, the ''lifestyle superpower,'' the assumptions and gains of a lifetime are suddenly in doubt. The deficit crisis that threatens the euro has also undermined the sustainability of the European standard of social welfare, built by left-leaning governments since the end of World War II.
 Europeans have boasted about their social model, with its generous vacations and early retirements, its national health care systems and extensive welfare benefits, contrasting it with the comparative harshness of American capitalism.
 Europeans have benefited from low military spending, protected by NATO and the American nuclear umbrella. They have also translated higher taxes into a cradle-to-grave safety net. ''The Europe that protects'' is a slogan of the European Union. 
 But all over Europe governments with big budgets, falling tax revenues and aging populations are experiencing rising deficits, with more bad news ahead.
 With low growth, low birthrates and longer life expectancies, Europe can no longer afford its comfortable lifestyle, at least not without a period of austerity and significant changes. The countries are trying to reassure investors by cutting salaries, raising legal retirement ages, increasing work hours and reducing health benefits and pensions.
 ''We're now in rescue mode,'' said Carl Bildt, Sweden's foreign minister. ''But we need to transition to the reform mode very soon. The 'reform deficit' is the real problem,'' he said, pointing to the need for structural change.
 The reaction so far to government efforts to cut spending has been pessimism and anger, with an understanding that the current system is unsustainable.
 In Athens, Aris Iordanidis, 25, an economics graduate working in a bookstore, resents paying high taxes to finance Greece's bloated state sector and its employees. ''They sit there for years drinking coffee and chatting on the telephone and then retire at 50 with nice fat pensions,'' he said. ''As for us, the way things are going we'll have to work until we're 70.''
 In Rome, Aldo Cimaglia is 52 and teaches photography, and he is deeply pessimistic about his pension. ''It's going to go belly-up because no one will be around to fill the pension coffers,'' he said. ''It's not just me; this country has no future.''
 Changes have now become urgent. Europe's population is aging quickly as birthrates decline. Unemployment has risen as traditional industries have shifted to Asia. And the region lacks competitiveness in world markets.
 According to the European Commission, by 2050 the percentage of Europeans older than 65 will nearly double. In the 1950s there were seven workers for every retiree in advanced economies. By 2050, the ratio in the European Union will drop to 1.3 to 1.
 ''The easy days are over for countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain, but for us, too,'' said Laurent Cohen-Tanugi, a French lawyer who did a study of Europe in the global economy for the French government. ''A lot of Europeans would not like the issue cast in these terms, but that is the storm we're facing. We can no longer afford the old social model, and there is a real need for structural reform.''
 In Paris, Malka Braniste, 88, lives on the pension of her deceased husband. ''I'm worried for the next generations,'' she said at lunch with her daughter-in-law, Dominique Alcan, 49. ''People who don't put money aside won't get anything.''
 Ms. Alcan expects to have to work longer as a traveling saleswoman. ''But I'm afraid I'll never reach the same level of comfort,'' she said. ''I won't be able to do my job at 63; being a saleswoman requires a lot of energy.''
 Gustave Brun d'Arre, 18, is still in high school. ''The only thing we're told is that we will have to pay for the others,'' he said, sipping a beer at a cafe. The waiter interrupted, discussing plans to alter the French pension system. ''It will be a mess,'' the waiter said. ''We'll have to work harder and longer in our jobs.''
 Figures show the severity of the problem. Gross public social expenditures in the European Union increased from 16 percent of gross domestic product in 1980 to 21 percent in 2005, compared with 15.9 percent in the United States. In France, the figure now is 31 percent, the highest in Europe, with state pensions making up more than 44 percent of the total and health care, 30 percent.
 The challenge is particularly daunting in France, which has done less to reduce the state's obligations than some of its neighbors. In Sweden and Switzerland, 7 of 10 people work past 50. In France, only half do. The legal retirement age in France is 60, while Germany recently raised it to 67 for those born after 1963.
 With the retirement of the baby boomers, the number of pensioners will rise 47 percent in France between now and 2050, while the number under 60 will remain stagnant. The French call it ''du baby boom au papy boom,'' and the costs, if unchanged, are unsustainable. The French state pension system today is running a deficit of 11 billion euros, or about $13.8 billion; by 2050, it will be 103 billion euros, or $129.5 billion, about 2.6 percent of projected economic output.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy has vowed to pass major pension reform this year. There have been two contentious overhauls, in 2003 and 2008; the government, afraid to lower pensions, wants to increase taxes on high salaries and increase the years of work.
 But the unions are unhappy, and the Socialist Party opposes raising the retirement age. Polls show that while most French see a pension overhaul as necessary, up to 60 percent say working past 60 is not the answer.
 Jean-Francois Cope, the parliamentary leader for Mr. Sarkozy's center-right party, says that change is painful, but necessary. ''The point is to preserve our model and keep it,'' he said. ''We need to get rid of bad habits. The Germans did it, and we can do the same.''
 More broadly, many across Europe say the Continent will have to adapt to fiscal and demographic change, because social peace depends on it. ''Europe won't work without that,'' said Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister, referring to the state's protective role. ''In Europe we have nationalism and racism in a politicized manner, and those parties would have exploited grievances if not for our welfare state,'' he said. ''It's a matter of national security, of our democracy.''
 France will ultimately have to follow Sweden and Germany in raising the pension age, he argues. ''This will have to be harmonized, Europeanized, or it won't work -- you can't have a pension at 67 here and 55 in Greece,'' Mr. Fischer said.
 The problems are even more acute in the ''new democracies'' of the euro zone -- Greece, Portugal and Spain -- that embraced European democratic ideals and that Europe embraced for political reasons in the postwar era, perhaps before their economies were ready. They have built lavish state systems on the back of the euro, but now must change.
 Under threat of default, Greece has frozen pensions for three years and drafted a bill to raise the legal retirement age to 65. Greece froze public-sector pay and trimmed benefits for state employees, including a bonus two months of salary. Portugal has cut 5 percent from the salaries of senior public employees and politicians and increased taxes, while canceling big projects; Spain is cutting civil service salaries by 5 percent and freezing pay in 2011 while also chopping public projects.
 But all three need to do more to bolster their competitiveness and growth, mostly by changing deeply inflexible employment rules, which can make it prohibitively expensive to hire or fire staff members, keeping unemployment high.
 Jean-Claude Meunier is 68, a retired French Navy official and headhunter, who plays bridge to ''train my memory and avoid Alzheimer's.'' His main worry is pension. ''For years, our political leaders acted with very little courage,'' he said. ''Pensions represent the failure of the leaders and the failure of the system.''
 In Athens, Mr. Iordanidis, the graduate who makes 800 euros a month in a bookstore, said he saw one possible upside. ''It could be a chance to overhaul the whole rancid system,'' he said, ''and create a state that actually works.''

HEADLINE: What a More Humane Welfare System Could Look Like

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
Helen Olbrecht, 54, of Oak Lawn, lost her office manager's job and is left with two daughters, a grandchild, a dog and a stiff mortgage. She searches fitfully for work and gets by on $318 a month in welfare and $286 in food stamps, while dealing with a foreclosure notice on her home. 
 ''That's all I've got. It's scary,'' she told me last week in the south suburban Blue Island office of the Illinois Department of Human Services. She had earned around $56,000 a year. ''This is a drastic change.'' 
A day spent in the government's ''safety net'' prompts a mix of shock, awe and vague hope. I was taken aback by the scores of needy and the administrative confusions they face, but heartened by the improbable equanimity of staffers with caseloads of 2,000 families. I suspect that fundamental, efficient and humane reconfigurations could be executed.
 One in eight Illinoisans is on food stamps, and the welfare caseload is increasing. The legislature declines to solve the budget fiasco, and, in the Internet age, outposts like Blue Island are so backward, a black-and-white TV airing of ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' would be fitting. There are hundreds of packing boxes with written applications, Rube Goldberg computer systems and phones that go dead.
 Whether it's welfare, food stamps, child-care subsidies, child-support enforcement or other programs, they all operate in silos without any rational link to one another, and their rules trigger unfair consequences. A dollar-an-hour raise could mean the loss of a child-care subsidy or Medicaid eligibility.
 What should we do, especially in the midst of government downsizing and scant political will to raise revenues?
 ''In a free market economy, a capitalist economy, there are winners and losers,'' said John Bouman, president of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, based in Chicago. ''Ultimately, we need to pay attention to the 'losers' and level the playing field so people don't free-fall into abject poverty.'' 
 Mr. Bouman played a key role in pushing for state legislation, effective July 1, to ease stifling welfare eligibility rules, all traced to the historic 1996 federal welfare-to-work law. The changes are embraced by Michelle Saddler, head of the state's human services department, and Jennifer Hrycyna, associate director of human capital development, who runs a system she criticized not long ago as a lawyer at the Shriver Center.
 Smart changes include raising the welfare eligibility income ceiling to $9,000 a year from $6,000 for a family of three; making benefits retroactive to the application date, rather than having them kick in after a 30-day wait; not mandating work-related activities during the first 30 days, while recipients await their first check; and expanding protections for victims of domestic and sexual violence.
 Mr. Bouman would give states incentives to focus on getting people out of dire poverty, rather than on reducing caseloads. He would allow education and training to constitute work credit under the welfare law, which is not the case generally. He'd modernize moth-eaten data-collection methods and do more online and via community groups.
 Ms. Hrycyna, the outsider, now insider, is also rethinking the delivery system and its points of entry. Why not apply for benefits at a public library, for example? Remove the stigmatized culture of the government waiting room?
 Her view, which includes not forcing people into ''low-wage and unstable work,'' isn't shared by Larry Temple, who oversees the Texas welfare system. He contended that we're wedded to a paternalistic, government-knows-best job search and training that's more about ''what I want to do when I grow up'' than ''what I can do right now.''
 Ron Haskins, an author of the 1996 welfare-to-work law as a Republican staffer on the House Ways and Means Committee, conceded that welfare programs have not been fully responsive during the recession. But he argued that a mother who works close to full time at minimum wage is far better off than on welfare, especially if she is also getting food stamps and $5,000 or so via the earned-income tax credit.
 Like Mr. Temple, he argued that almost any job is better than welfare and that state job training is dubious. Yet Ms. Hrycyna doesn't totally demur, stipulating that any streamlining of bureaucracy and job-search process demands rigorous analysis.
 Clearing out the Blue Island office would be all well and good. But a smart alternative is not a new universe of no welfare and no work.

HEADLINE: State Lags in Dental Health Care for Children

BYLINE: By LAURIE UDESKY

 BODY:
Early in the morning on April 2, Dominique Allen's family rushed her to the emergency room at Petaluma Valley Hospital because of jaw pain and inflammation. 
 An infection from four rotting or decayed molars had spread into the jaw and neck of Dominique, 16, causing so much swelling that she could hardly open her mouth or breathe. Her condition was ''life-threatening,'' according to a case history from Community Action Partnership of Sonoma. After spending Easter weekend in the hospital, Dominique was operated on, free of charge, by Dr. Robert Allen (no relation) of Petaluma.
Although Dominique's case was extreme, it is not unusual in California for children to suffer crippling pain and disability from untreated tooth decay. By the age of 5, 28 percent of the state's children have untreated dental decay, according to the most recent statewide figures. 
 In 2007, the last year that data for many reports was available, more than 500,000 California children between the ages of 5 and 17 missed at least one day of school in a year because of dental problems, costing school districts $29.7 million dollars in lost revenue. 
 California children's dental health was ranked third from the bottom in the National Survey of Children's Health, above only Arizona and Texas. In the Bay Area, children and teenagers up to the age of 17 made nearly 1,980 visits to emergency rooms for preventable dental conditions in 2007. The cost of these visits averaged $172, but if a problem required hospitalization it cost an average of $5,000.
 Today, experts interviewed said the dental care crisis had reached an even more alarming level. ''We can only go up from here,'' said Dr. Jared I. Fine, the dental health administrator at Alameda County Public Health Department. ''We have an epidemic of dental disease in children that's absurdly pervasive.'' 
 Dr. Fine said that the medical and dental community has known for decades that dental disease needs to be tackled in early childhood, but programs to do so are ''in their infancy,'' and poorly financed. Six to eight young children a day -- typically from disadvantaged families -- are put under general anesthesia or sedation at the Pediatric Dentistry Residency Program at University of California at San Francisco for surgeries, including multiple extractions, and root canals on baby teeth. 
 In mid-May, Dr. Huong Lu, a pediatric dentist in Oakland, looked into the mouths of the same 80 kindergartners and first-graders she had screened in October only to find, ''none had been treated.'' All still had excessive cavities and abscesses.
 Some working parents, like Dominique's father, Alan W. Allen, who live paycheck to paycheck, cannot afford dental care. Mr. Allen is a single parent who earns $2,480 a month as part of a harbor crew at a yacht club. Though his income barely covers living expenses, it was too high to qualify for Denti-Cal, California's dental program for children from low-income families. 
 When Dominique's emergency occurred, the Allen family was still waiting for word about whether it was eligible for Healthy Families, the children's health program that covers thousands of children ineligible for Denti-Cal.
 Mr. Allen said he was moved by Dr. Allen's willingness to donate his services. ''He said, 'I have a daughter too, I'm going to do this,' '' Mr. Allen said. As more Californians have lost their jobs, they have also lost health insurance that could cover their children's dental care. An estimated 300,000 Californians lost employer-based health coverage between November 2007 and February 2009, according to a report by Children Now, a children's advocacy group. 
 Even those children who are beneficiaries of the state's subsidized dental programs often cannot find a dentist who will take them. 
 A survey, the findings of which were published in Pediatric Dentistry, found that of 255 California-based pediatric dentists less than half participated in Medi-Cal's Denti-Cal program, and of those, two-thirds limited the number of patients they accept because of low reimbursement fees and broken appointments. Some parents lucky enough to find a dentist who will see their child often wait months for an appointment. A school-based prevention program that served about 50,000 Bay Area children was cut in July 2009, forcing public health and county officials to scramble for stopgap support. 
 What this means, health advocates say, is that many children from low-income households are in chronic pain because of rotting teeth, which can interfere with their concentration and even their sleep. If Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent proposed cuts remain -- amounting to a $16.5 million reduction to Healthy Families and a $523 million reduction to Medi-Cal --more cases of untreated dental-related illnesses are likely.
 X-rays of Dominique's mouth, in fact, showed she had been living with pain for some time: Dr. Allen saw what he described as ''long-standing abscesses.'' Dominique said that if 10 was the worst pain imaginable, hers had hovered at about 7 or 8 for a couple of years. ''It's just something I've lived with,'' she said. 
 After her surgery, her father returned to Dr. Allen's office. ''He came back and said 'I'll do anything for you to pay this off,' '' Dr. Allen said. ''I'm seeing more and more emergencies like this,'' he added. ''It's not willful neglect. It's neglect based on economics.''
 Patching together funds -- the result of pleas to county officials, grant proposals to private foundations and other sources -- public health providers have largely managed to preserve dental programs whose financing was cut by the state. 
 In Bay Area counties, despite state budget cuts, a program that goes to schools serves more than 50,000 children. It demonstrates tooth brushing and flossing, and applies plastic coatings, called sealants, to molars, helping prevent the growth of decay-inducing bacteria. The state mandates that new kindergartners and first graders have their mouths checked for disease, and if there are signs of decay, that they be referred to a dentist. But there are not enough dentists willing to accept them, Dr. Fine said. 
 One dentist who will accept them is Dr. Le, dental director of the Asian Health Services clinic in Oakland and an adjunct associate clinical professor at University of California, San Francisco.
 Last year Dr. Le's clinic treated 4,836 children, from pre-school age to 17. About 279 needed emergency procedures, including extractions and root canals of baby teeth. Of those cases, only 25 percent returned for follow-up care, though she said the records may be skewed because the procedures are not billable. 
 In San Francisco, Dr. Carolyn Brown is the dental director of the Native American Health Center, which provides dental care to about 1,800 children a year, with three pediatric dentists on staff. ''We have very few providers who take Medi-Cal,'' Dr. Brown said. ''The two city departments of public health clinics have five-month waiting lists for pediatric dentistry.'' 
 On a recent Friday, Dr. Eric Smith, one of the clinic's pediatric dentists, spent the morning in a mobile clinic at the Alemany Head Start program, where he looked into the mouths of eight pre-schoolers. Two of them, siblings who were 3 and 4 years old, had 8 to 10 cavities each. 
 In Sonoma County, at a screening for kindergarteners, Dr. Susan Cooper, a dentist with the Sonoma County Oral Health Access Coalition, examined 4-year-olds who would be starting kindergarten in a few months. She noticed one child, Vicente Rosas Silva, whose face was swollen. 
 ''He had these big, liquid brown eyes, and he opened his mouth and almost every tooth in his head was bombed out, cratered, decayed, black stubs,'' Dr. Cooper said. She said the swelling was a sign that the infection may have spread to his blood. Sixteen of Vicente's 20 teeth had to be removed. He will remain almost toothless until he is 6 or 7, Dr. Cooper said. 
 His mother, Carmen Silva said that she had not taken Vicente to a dentist when she first noticed his tooth discoloration. ''My son has bad asthma and was in and out of the hospital,'' she said. ''I wasn't thinking about teeth. The asthma was my priority.'' 
 She said that she did not have anyone to give her guidance or educate her about what she needed to do to prevent what happened to Vicente. If she had, she said, ''maybe I would have been able to get help for my son.''

HEADLINE: Roads to Success That Bypass College

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Plan B: Skip College'' (Week in Review, May 16) made a plausible economic argument for steering some kids away from college. I worry, though, that it's of a piece with the movement toward sanctioning class distinctions that has accelerated in the wake of the recession. 
 Some people will never find well-paying jobs. Some people should keep renting and not aspire to own a home. Some people shouldn't think about college. These may be realities we ought to acknowledge, but it diminishes us not to think of them as problems we should work to overcome.
 There's nothing wrong with vocational training or corporate apprenticeships or work readiness programs, as long as they offer a way up and not a dead end. The aspirational part of our culture is a key American strength, and we should aim toward creating opportunities for people and businesses, not legitimizing lowered expectations.
 Matthew Chanoff San Francisco, May 16, 2010
 To the Editor:
 My daughter is graduating from high school this month and going to college in the fall. The prospects are slim that she will find meaningful work with a B.A. in any field. But what we're expecting of her time in college is that she will become a sufficiently skilled world citizen to be able to make successful future decisions about her life.
 For most American high school graduates, college is really an introduction to life beyond their parents' sphere of influence. Yes, it is also important to become employable. But if the choice is between a lifelong general education or getting vocational training that may lose its value as the economy and technology change, which is the better option?
 The solution to this problem -- which regrettably is unlikely because of how education funding works -- is to create national standards for graduating high school and provide equitable resources for all schools across the country.
 This way, as is the case in many other countries, 18-year-olds would be reasonably prepared to participate in public life whether or not they continue with any form of higher education. Shamefully, American high school graduates are still far behind their peers elsewhere.
 Eran Fraenkel Jakarta, Indonesia, May 16, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The plight of young people during the recession has sharpened the focus on the real value of higher education, as your article illustrates. Clearly, many students are pushed to pursue a college degree based on out-of-date perceptions of the route to success.
 Many of them are not suited to this choice and will not profit from it, personally or economically. Realistic alternatives, more suited to the persisting economic crisis, should be encouraged.
 As you note, the majority of jobs likely to grow in numbers over the coming decade do not require a bachelor's degree. It is abundantly clear to me as a faculty member who has taught undergraduates in private and public settings for nearly two decades that many young people who are in college are not there by thoughtful choice, not likely to excel and not happy.
 As with another American shibboleth gone painfully wrong in recent years -- the virtues of owning your own home -- now is the time for action to change unsustainable, outdated concepts of postsecondary education in this country.

HEADLINE: Pilot Season

BYLINE: By ANDREA BENNETT

 BODY:
Much prognosticating about the world's ''emerging'' destinations is pure speculation, but consider where the airlines are placing their bets. New routes point to where the money is -- and provide a glimpse into travel's crystal ball. Case in point: Lufthansa is now flying from Frankfurt to Iraq's newly expanded Erbil airport for the first time in 20 years, catering to workers in the oil and gas industry. So what do the airlines' latest touch-downs tell us about where to go next? ANDREA BENNETT 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: BARBADOS: Flights from: New York Kennedy (JetBlue)
Philadelphia (US Airways). Who's flying: Leisure passengers taking advantage of the 38 percent drop in flight prices. What's there: A new outreach program for American travelers
resorts offering gentler prices
tons of renovated hotels, including the Crane, Tamarind Cove and the classic Sandy Lane.
MUNICH: Flights from: Newark, N.J. (Continental)
Miami (Lufthansa)
Singapore (Singapore). Who's flying: Fat cats of the German economy -- it's a regional center for many multinationals like BMW. What you'll find there: A discreet moneyed class, plus a lively district of design shops and boutiques -- not to mention the more-fun-than-it-sounds Oktoberfest.
ACCRA, CHANA: Flights from: Atlanta (Delta, beginning June 1)
Washington Dulles (United, beginning June 20)
London Heathrow (Virgin Atlantic). Who's flying: Petrogarchs (Ghana expects to export oil this year), gold speculators and cocoa executives. What's there: One of the most stable political landscapes in Africa, after a smooth transition of power last year
distinctive colonial architecture like the Osu Castle, the center of government since British rule.
BAHRAIN: Flights from: Washington Dulles (United) Who's flying: The engineers and builders of a mammoth infrastructure plan, along with the requisite soldiers and oil barons. What's there: Bahrain Bay, a $2.5 billion development, with apartments, a marina and a Four Seasons hotel to come
and, soon, the estimated $3 billion Bahrain-Qatar causeway, beginning construction this year.
TORONTO: Flights from: Los Angeles and San Francisco (both Virgin America, beginning in June). Who's flying: Players in the new Hollywood North -- studio heads and their stars -- along with tech professionals and venture capitalists from the Bay Area.

HEADLINE: Unsold Condos Get the Hammer

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Postscript: May 22, 2010
 Late Friday, after the following article went to press, The New York Times learned that the developers of Stone Ridge had canceled plans to auction the condominiums.
 In an e-mail message to prospective buyers announcing the cancellation, the developers wrote:
 ''We listened carefully and with great interest over the last couple of weeks. What we have learned from your response is that the vast majority of interested buyers are extremely well informed and sophisticated and prefer a more personalized and less pressure-filled private sales process. As a result, we have canceled the Stone Ridge at Fairfield auction, and instead, will transition into a conventional sales program, with new prices that reflect your input and present market realities. You will now have the opportunity to meet with our sales team one-on-one to purchase the home of your choice.''
 Original Article
 THE 15 condominiums that have sat unsold for years at the Stone Ridge complex in Fairfield don't look like leftovers. Scattered throughout three buildings in a gated development equipped with a gym, a club room and a concierge, they have the same 10-foot ceilings, walnut floors and magazine-perfect kitchens as the 55 occupied units. 
 Even so, the project's developers are auctioning the units at deep discounts, hoping that by stimulating a skittish market they will be able to close out a project begun back in 2004. The one-day auction, scheduled for Sunday, will open with minimum bids 44 to 55 percent below previous asking prices. A two-bedroom two-bath condo, for instance, will start at $339,000, as opposed to the original price tag of at least $645,000.
 The low minimums are designed to lure enough potential buyers to bid up the prices.
 ''I don't know if we're going to sell them for the minimum bids,'' said Robert S. Skolnick, a partner in the Stone Ridge development, adding, ''I hope not.''
 It's a gamble -- whether the market will favor the developer or a few fortunate buyers won't be known until after the auction at the Hilton in Stamford. (Registration is at noon; the auction begins at 1.)
 But some developers have been willing to take that risk, given that their alternative is to continue to wait out the slack market. Stone Ridge is at least the third Fairfield County condo project in less than a year to use an auction to clean up inventory, allowing the developer to pay off lenders or free up capital.
 Sheldon Good & Company conducted two earlier auctions. Last September, E/N Properties of Stamford put 19 one- and two-bedroom lofts at Lofts 881, in downtown Bridgeport, up for bid. And just last month, Seaboard Properties auctioned nine condominiums at Clocktower Close, a converted factory in Norwalk.
 ''The market is suspect of pricing right now,'' said Sue Hawkes, the chief executive officer of Velocity Marketing Services of Boston, the company hired to conduct the Stone Ridge auction. ''In an auction, the market has the opportunity to set the price. That's where buyers are very comfortable pulling the trigger. You can see the person bidding against you. It's transparent, and there's a greater comfort level.''
 At the current pace of sales of high-end condos, Mr. Skolnick estimates it could take a few years for the market to absorb the remaining Stone Ridge units. From February through April, only 19 condos sold in Fairfield, at a median price of $325,000, according to figures provided by William Raveis Real Estate. More than 100 condos are for sale there.
 Last week, smiling hostesses from Velocity Marketing were posted throughout the Stone Ridge complex, welcoming visitors to the available apartments. Ms. Hawkes said about 300 people had come through so far, a promising sign for the auction.
 ''It's a numbers game,'' she said. ''It's all about generating traffic.''
 Jason Epstein was similarly optimistic going into the September auction for his downtown Bridgeport project, Lofts 881. City-backed efforts to revive the downtown had looked promising when Mr. Epstein began converting the office building on Lafayette Boulevard around 2005.
 As sales began in 2006, however, Mr. Epstein, along with other downtown developers, ran into a market slowdown. With about half of the 40 lofts in the red-brick building sold by last fall, he decided to try an auction.
 Nineteen lofts, with granite counters, bamboo floors and access to a roof deck, were offered at 40 percent discounts: $137,000 for a 700-square-foot model, $205,000 for 1,400 square feet. About 50 people turned out for the auction at a Trumbull hotel.
 As soon as they started to bid, Mr. Epstein knew he was in trouble. Units were selling for the bare minimums.
 ''I remember sitting there and feeling almost numb,'' he said. ''This was like five years of work that just ended right there. At one point in the auction we had enough pain and we decided to stop it.''
 When he left the auction that day, he thought the 10 lofts that had sold had gone too cheaply. Eight months later, however, in competition with more than 300 other condos for sale in Bridgeport, he's marketing the last five at the same price points.
 ''The auction people usually tell you what happens in the room is what the market is,'' Mr. Epstein said.
 The market sent a similar message to Seaboard Properties at the auction of nine units at Clocktower Close. The terms of the auction required Seaboard to sell at least four units at the lower bid levels, and it did, according to Jeffrey Hubbard, the senior managing director of Sheldon Good. Three other bids were accepted with reserve, meaning Seaboard could later reject them. Mr. Hubbard said he did not know the outcome, and Seaboard did not respond to several requests for comment.
 Stone Ridge was originally marketed as an investment opportunity. Across the street, a train station was in the works as part of a $250 million transit-oriented commercial project. But the economic downturn held up that project for years.
 Now, with the help of state and federal funds, the train platforms are under construction. For buyers, Mr. Skolnick said, the tangible progress ought to provide confidence.
 And, for the residents who bought at much higher prices, probably a small degree of relief.
Postscript: May 30, 2010, Sunday
The ''In the Region'' article in Connecticut and Westchester copies last Sunday, about cases in which some developers have decided to auction off new condominiums because of the poor sales climate, reported on an auction scheduled last Sunday for 15 unsold condos at the Stone Ridge complex in Fairfield. After the section had gone to press, the developers canceled the auction, in part because advance registrants indicated discomfort with the bidding process.

HEADLINE: Recession Played a Part, But ShoreBank Wounded Itself, Too

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING

 BODY:
As some of the nation's biggest financial institutions rushed to assemble a $150 million bailout of ShoreBank last week, people knowledgeable about the bank's image as a successful, crusading lender in some of the country's most impoverished communities began focusing on a related issue: How ShoreBank had fallen nearly to the point of collapse.
 While a severe recession certainly played a role, an examination of ShoreBank's financial statements and interviews with former employees and analysts show that ShoreBank brought many troubles on itself. An ill-timed, overly aggressive expansion at the height of the credit bubble, a headlong push into risky markets on Chicago's West Side and to the inner city of Detroit, and an unwillingness to foreclose on troubled loans combined to weaken the bank to the point that regulators last July ordered a major recapitalization.
The bailout that appeared to be coming together last week drew scrutiny in Washington. There were accusations from conservative lawmakers that Citigroup, GE Finance and Goldman Sachs -- which had put together a group to bail out the bank -- did so for political reasons. The legislators also called for an investigation into an expected $70 million loan to ShoreBank by the federal Troubled Assets Relief Program. 
 In fact, questions about political pressure on behalf of ShoreBank go back further than last week. Minutes from a board meeting of Illinois's bank regulator show that the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation was receiving calls from the corridors of power in both Washington and New York at least since the beginning of the year. Senator Richard J. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the United States Senate, contacted the department ''with a request to work with I.F.A. and the F.D.I.C.,'' according to the minutes. Representative Jan Schakowsky also called, and the regulator initiated talks with the bank and the state legislature.
 Former President Bill Clinton -- a ShoreBank booster from his days as the governor of Arkansas -- also spoke to the Illinois regulator in favor of helping ShoreBank. Mr. Clinton, who now runs a not-for-profit foundation based in New York, ''weighed in on behalf of the foundation on the importance of saving ShoreBank,'' according to the regulator's minutes.
 ShoreBank has become a potent political symbol, in part because for years the bank has drawn the attention of those who saw in its success a way to meld a social mission with a profit-making purpose. Those seeking to find lessons in ShoreBank's near-collapse say it stumbled for the simplest of reasons: It grew too fast, and stayed true to its mission at the expense of its bottom line.
 ''It was the desire to expand that got them into trouble,'' said Richard Taub, a University of Chicago professor who advised ShoreBank's board of directors for nearly 30 years.
 A bank spokesman declined comment, and executives did not return phone calls.
 ShoreBank emerged on the national scene in 1973 when local investors paid $3.2 million to buy the former South Shore National Bank, which had threatened to leave Chicago's South Side as its white population fled the racially changing area. ShoreBank grew steadily by practicing a sort of financial alchemy: lending in poverty-stricken urban neighborhoods where most commercial banks feared to tread.
 By 1987, ShoreBank was expanding to Arkansas. It later began lending in Michigan's economically battered Upper Peninsula. Over time, it opened small-business loan programs in Poland, Bulgaria and Russia and attracted support from the Ford and MacArthur foundations. (The MacArthur Foundation has provided a grant to the Chicago News Cooperative.)
 The bank's model of socially responsible lending relied on an ability to turn people with poor credit histories into profitable clients by offering care and attention to each loan. Over time, the bank began claiming it delivered a ''triple bottom line'' -- earning a profit, creating jobs in at-risk urban neighborhoods and improving the environment in areas like the Pacific Northwest, where ShoreBank backed ''green'' investment.
 It took ShoreBank until 2000 to accumulate $1 billion in loans. With the new decade and century came a growth drive that was symptomatic of the hard-charging economic times -- and ultimately disastrous to ShoreBank's bottom line. The bank doubled its loan portfolio in four years.
 From 2005 to 2007, the bank's assets grew more than 30 percent, to $2.2 billion. And when Joseph Hasten, a new chief executive, came on board in early 2007, he vowed to quintuple ShoreBank's lending over the next six years.
 But the bank had moved into two of the nation's toughest markets, Detroit and Cleveland, with troublesome results. The Detroit operation, in particular, became the source of management headaches and steep loan losses. At the same time, ShoreBank was reluctant to foreclosure on delinquent loans.
 By the time Mr. Hasten resigned under fire in 2009, the bank was operating under a cease-and-desist order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank's founders, Ronald Grzywinski and Mary Houghton, initially set out last summer to raise $50 million in new capital to forestall an F.D.I.C. takeover or liquidation, but by the time a deal took shape last week, the bank was in need of $220 million in private and federal funds.
 ''The question comes up, was this bank managed as well as it could have been?'' said Bert Ely, head of Ely & Co., a bank consultancy based in Alexandria, Va. ''Or were they too much into the social-welfare thing?''
 A look at ShoreBank's financial statements over the last five years shows how the bank's social mission may have led to practices that put off tough decisions and placed the entire operation at risk.
 At the end of 2006, ShoreBank had a nearly pristine balance sheet. The $2-billion-asset bank had placed only $22 million in loans on non-accrual status -- indicating that no interest or principal had been paid for at least 90 days. The current figure is more than 10 times that, $250.7 million in non-accruing loans at the end of March.
 Despite the deterioration in loan quality, ShoreBank's financial reports indicate the bank steadfastly sought to avoid loan foreclosures. It held only about $2.5 million in real estate obtained via foreclosure at the end of March.
 Banks that allow non-performing loans to stay on their books must finance their operations somehow, and beginning in 2006 ShoreBank moved aggressively into brokered deposits -- fast-moving money that ricochets from bank to bank, chasing high interest rates paid for deposits. Brokered deposits raise a bank's cost of funds and bring instability to operations.
 Over three years ending in 2007, ShoreBank's brokered deposits rose nearly 40 percent, accounting for 30 percent of deposits. At the time, banks in ShoreBank's peer group obtained only 6 percent of their total deposits from brokers. Of the banks that failed that year, brokered deposits amounted to 25 percent of their total deposits on average -- far less than the percentage held by ShoreBank.
 Its financial profile was alarming: Total risk-based capital -- an important measure of a bank's health -- had fallen from a strong 11 percent of assets at the end of 2006 to barely above 3 percent, a measure considered dangerous.
 Mr. Taub, the longtime board adviser, said ShoreBank suffered from an overly zealous commitment to its original mission and a lack of scrutiny by the bank's board of directors.
 ''The general mood of the board has been acquiescence,'' he said. ''It's very hard when you've been on a board a long time to intervene and say, 'Hey, this is a bad idea.' ''

HEADLINE: Online News Fights to Live On Its Merits

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com http://twitter/carr2n

 BODY:
It's telling that one of the more promising experiments in the next version of regional news is located in an industrial park near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The backdrop seems fitting.
 Joel Kramer will tell you as much. The founder, chief executive and editor of MinnPost.com, Mr. Kramer has built the online regional news site using a hybrid formula of membership, ads, sponsorships, events and foundation support. 
 As a result, MinnPost is viable, with the equivalent of 18 full-time employees, about 2,000 paying members (donations start at $10 and average around $50) and an estimated $300,000 in annual advertising sales after three years. 
 But that's not the kind of success that's going to shift paradigms any time soon. Mr. Kramer is quick to point out that MinnPost and other nascent online news sites face what might be called the tyranny of small numbers. 
 ''We knew it would be hard, but the most important lesson we learned was just how hard it is,'' he said. ''We had expected eventually to have an operational budget of $2 million now, and right now it's actually more like $1.1 million. We launched into a recession and we are in the same space, businesswise, as the news business.''
 It was not always thus for Mr. Kramer. Back in 1990s, Mr. Kramer was the editor and then publisher of a very robust Star Tribune, which was at the time the dominant regional paper and the strongest advertising vehicle for anyone looking to get in front of consumers in the Twin Cities. 
 I was the editor of a local alternative weekly, which spent a fair amount of time trying to bite his ankles -- weeklies and dailies are natural enemies in the wild -- but he always struck me as a practical sort who had the heart of a newsman with none of the swagger. 
 ''Those glory days are a distant memory,'' he said, sitting down in a conference room a few steps from an office he shares with four other people. 
 Mr. Kramer left journalism while people were still doing so of their own volition, but started MinnPost because he became concerned that the collapse in the newspaper business model was going to punch a large hole in civic engagement.
 MinnPost is one of a group of regional news sites, like the Texas Tribune (texastribune.org), The Bay Citizen (baycitizen.org), and VoiceofSanDiego.org, that are trying to use the cost advantages of digital news -- no presses, no trucks -- to overcome other fundamental challenges, chief among them that readers continue to see news on the Web as a commodity that will always be free. 
 For the time being, foundations have filled a large gap: MinnPost has received grants from the Knight Foundation totaling $455,000 since 2007. 
 Mr. Kramer -- a worrier by nature -- spends a lot of time thinking about what will happen when the attention and interests of foundations wane and sites like his have to walk on their own wobbly legs. 
 ''We want MinnPost to be able to stand on its own by 2012, and I have a very aggressive definition of sustainability, which is that we have enough revenues to survive without foundation money,'' he said. ''A lot of the foundation money for journalism goes to large, investigative-oriented sites, and I don't know that there will always be money for sites like ours where the emphasis is on regional coverage.''
 That means that some ambitions have been deferred. The staff is small, some of the work comes from freelancers and, journalistically, MinnPost is a careful, really smart site, but it is built on high-quality analysis rather than deep reporting and investigative work. Mr. Kramer was hard-pressed to come up with a single large story the site broke that changed the course of events. 
 The Star Tribune has gone through bankruptcy and lost 100 editorial employees since 2007, but the paper still provides much of the reporting that MinnPost and others pivot around. 
 Mr. Kramer, a former president of The Harvard Crimson who worked at Newsday and then found the Midwest to his liking, thinks plain old folks are going to have to place a value on local reporting for MinnPost to invest further.
 ''Whenever people call to tell me how much they like what we are doing, I very quickly turn the conversation to whether they are a member or not. No good deed goes unpunished. We have to pay a lot of attention to growing that base of members of the long term, but it is very time-intensive.''
 MinnPost's chronic efforts to expand its membership are led by Mr. Kramer's wife, Laurie, who, like him, works without compensation. By adopting something akin to a public radio model, they are hoping the site will be able to grow without getting out the tin cup and making the rounds of various foundations. 
 Last year, MinnPost still had to dip into its nest egg, but absent foundation money, it earned $675,000, more than half its operating budget, from a variety of other sources, including MinnRoast, an event that raises profile, money and membership interest all at the same time. 
 The trends are impressive, even if the numbers sound more like a successful taco stand than a big news operation. Of course, like many other nonprofit news sites, MinnPost is taking advantage of one of the upsides of the downsides: many skilled journalists with years of expertise are on the loose and looking for a way to continue to avoid getting a real job. 
 Doug Grow, a columnist at The Star Tribune for 20 years, has retired, but now finds himself filing as much as six or seven times a week for MinnPost.
 ''We don't have enough staff to have any meetings, we can write with a point of view, which is wonderful, and the psychic rewards are enormous,'' he said. And the money part? ''I worry about that. They haven't crossed the line in being able to sustain young reporters in the middle of their careers.''
 Mr. Grow, who was the union representative at the paper back when Mr. Kramer was the editor, said he thinks Mr. Kramer will figure it out or be very clear if he can't. ''He is a combination of idealism and brutal honesty,'' he said. ''If someone is going to pull this off, they have to be very hard-headed about it and I don't think that will be a problem with Joel.''

HEADLINE: More Is at Stake Than Saving an Old Stadium in Paterson

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PATERSON, N.J.
 It sits like a great ruin on a bluff above the Great Falls, a graffiti-spattered, poured concrete, Art Deco monument to better times in the Rodney Dangerfield of New Jersey cities.
 You enter through a tear in the chain link fence behind the rickety old scoreboard, innards gouged out, wires hanging down, and survey a place that's not past the point of no return but probably nearing it -- trees growing in the stands, a sinkhole in the east end zone and a steep drop in what's left of the old running track, past the pile of rubble and bricks. Arsonists and vagrants have set numerous fires. If the ghosts returned, they would barely recognize it.
 But when the National Trust for Historic Preservation put Paterson's Hinchliffe Stadium on its annual list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places last week, it was a respectful nod to those ghosts and to the efforts to bring Hinchliffe back to life. 
 Built for $350,000 in 1932 and enlarged in 1964, Hinchliffe Stadium is a 10,000-seat throwback to the days when our sporting obsessions took on a more intimate cast. Its main claim to fame, according to the National Trust, is as one of three remaining stadiums that were home to Negro League teams. For 12 seasons it was the home of the New York Black Yankees. It was also briefly home to the New York Cubans and in 1933 was the site of the ''Colored Championship of the Nation,'' the Negro League's version of the World Series.
 Many of the greatest black stars of that era -- Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and Larry Doby, an Eastside High School student in Paterson who became the first black player in the American League, played there.
 There was also football -- high school and semipro -- with teams like the Paterson Panthers and Silk City Bears, and auto racing and boxing. But eventually the school district took over the stadium, and it began to fray, and, when the sinkhole became a safety issue, it was closed in 1997. With the entire school system in state receivership, no one attended to the modest efforts needed to keep it up -- controlling vegetation and securing the property. It has deteriorated ever since.
 That could have been the end until a group calling itself Friends of Hinchliffe Stadium organized in 2002 to stave off demolition. The effort to save Hinchliffe coincided with what seemed like a quixotic attempt to have the area around the falls, the second largest east of the Mississippi and the birthplace of American manufacturing, be declared a national historical park. That happened a year ago, perhaps giving a boost to Hinchliffe's chances as well.
 People who love the stadium, like Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a former Paterson mayor who played third base there in high school, and Brian LoPinto, who grew up nearby and began the effort that led to the Friends group, are passionate about the park both as a part of sports history and as a part of Paterson. 
 This, after all, is New Jersey's third-largest city, which, thanks to immigration from around the globe, is one of the few old industrial cities that's more populous now than it was 50 years ago.
 ''Paterson is a mystery city, and this is a mystery stadium,'' Mr. Pascrell said, surveying Hinchliffe's remains. ''Someone should do a sociological study on how we've done it.''
 The dream is some kind of public and private partnership to rebuild an athletic facility. But it's a tough time to raise money, and Hinchliffe is in a bureaucratic no man's land amid local, school district and state control. Leonard Zax, president of the Hamilton Partnership for Paterson, which is leading the effort to develop the national historic park and the area around it, said it would be harder to revive the field in the depths of the Great Recession than it was to build it during the Great Depression.
 In truth, we tend to knock down our ballparks, whether as grand as Yankee Stadium, Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds or as modest as Hinchliffe Stadium.
 Still, you walk around Paterson's remarkably robust downtown, past Clinica del Pueblo, Los Immortales deli, Griselda's Peruvian Restaurant, past the Muslim women in their hijabs and the old men chattering in Spanish, and you wonder: Can you preserve the spirit and culture of a place in the same way that you can preserve its architecture and history? 
 If Hinchliffe is worth salvaging, can it really be harder now than in the Great Depression? Long after a world that mandated a separate Negro League, does Paterson offer its largely poor citizens opportunities that are greater, lesser or equal to the ones that existed in the heyday of the New York Black Yankees?
 There should be easy answers, but, in truth, it's as complicated as the prospects for returning a dreamy green ball field to Hinchliffe Stadium.

HEADLINE: Traffic Paint Shortage Threatens Roadwork

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
''The white line in the middle of the highway,'' Jack Kerouac rhapsodized in ''On the Road,'' ''unrolled and hugged our left front tire as if glued to our groove.'' 
 But this spring some of those white lines -- and yellow lines and double yellow lines -- may not unroll as long as people would like: a shortage of traffic striping paint has left road crews and transportation departments without the paint they need to separate northbound and southbound traffic.
 ''We really have guys sitting at home because we don't have the material to do the work,'' said Mike Liljestrom, the president of Apply-A-Line Inc., a pavement-marking company in Washington State. 
 The timing could scarcely be worse. Spring is when road workers emerge from their winter hibernations, and orange traffic cones pop up like yellow daffodils. In an industry whose favored medium is acrylic on pavement, the paint shortage is gumming up the works. 
 The Associated General Contractors of America, a major industry trade group, warned state and federal transportation officials last week that the shortage has ''very significant ramifications for completion of highway projects this summer,'' and asked them not to penalize contractors and suppliers if they are unable to finish projects on time because of a paint shortage that is beyond their control. 
 The scarcity stems in large part from the shortage of an obscure chemical compound called methyl methacrylate, one of the key ingredients in roadworthy paint, which must be sturdy, long-lasting and reflective. A major producer of the compound, Dow Construction Chemicals, had production problems this year at a plant in Deer Park, Tex. Other companies scaled back production during the economic downturn, said Phil Phillips, the managing director of the Chemark Consulting Group, which analyzes the coatings industry.
 The want of the chemical has started a chain reaction. Aexcel, a company outside Cleveland that makes traffic paint, just used up its supply and may be unable to make additional traffic paint until it gets more in mid-June. ''I think we emptied our tank yesterday,'' John Milgram, Aexcel's president, said Friday. He said he had been scouring the country to replenish his stock. 
 In Texas, officials say the shortage could delay plans to recoat the surface of some roads if there is not enough paint around to safely mark the lanes once the work is done. In some cases, officials said, the state may experiment with using raised reflective buttons to mark lanes if there is not enough paint. In others, workers may decide to paint the center dividing lanes on two-lane roads, but not the lines on the shoulders of roads. 
 ''The most important thing for us to do is stripe that center line on a two-lane road,'' explained Chris Lippincott, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation. ''So I know where I need to be to go north, and you know where you need to be to go south, and so we're not in the same place at the same time. The laws of physics tend to frown on that.''
