HEADLINE: Politics Entered Wildlife Refuges Long Ago

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Another G.O.P. Environmental Folly" (editorial, April 25):
You are right to condemn the so-called national wildlife refuge improvement bill now before the Senate. If enacted, this proposal will further weaken America's beleaguered preserves.
However, you are wrong to assert that the Interior Department has traditionally allowed commercial and recreational uses of refuges only to the extent that such uses do not conflict with wildlife conservation.
The refuge system has been compromised by political expediency for decades. 
 It began with hunting in the 1930's, when many refuge managers were encouraged to manipulate their precious scraps of habitat mainly to benefit waterfowl and other game animals.
It wasn't long before economic and recreational uses blatantly incompatible with wildlife preservation became the rule on refuges all around the country, from oil production on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska and intensive cattle grazing in the Charles M. Russell Refuge in Montana to water-skiing and speed-boating on Ruby Lake in Nevada.
Special interests and their political agents called the shots; refuge managers and officials in Washington either buckled under or suffered the consequences.
The low point was reached during the Reagan years when Interior Secretary James G. Watt tried to make increased economic use the top priority on refuge lands.
How to safeguard this vulnerable system against such shenanigans?
Dump the potentially catastrophic wildlife refuge legislation and instead pass legislation that would give refuge officials the autonomy and power they need to fend off political pressure and do what is best for wildlife.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Swiss Franc and German Mark Drop After Official's Comment

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the Swiss franc and the German mark after Switzerland's Finance Minister called for a weaker franc.
The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, recovering slightly from a two-day selloff. 
 Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger of Switzerland, in a speech in Zurich, said a strong franc was a severe hindrance to his country's flagging economy and called for a decline in the currency.
"The comments definitely served to weaken the Swiss franc," said Stephen Jury, chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland. "The market just got very excited."
The Swiss economy has fared badly in the last year, contracting in the fourth quarter for the first time in more than two years.
The Swiss franc's decline yesterday hurt the mark because the two currencies are tied closely, and because investors think Germany's central bank would also welcome a weaker mark to bolster its sluggish economy.
"The Swiss franc tends to move a little faster, but it's the same story for Germany," said Alex Sinclair, a commodity trading adviser in Twin Falls, Idaho, who invests in currencies. "They're scared."
The dollar rose as high as 1.2466 Swiss francs, its highest since Feb. 27, 1995. In late trading in New York, it settled at 1.2435 Swiss francs, up from 1.2372 Swiss francs on Monday.
The dollar climbed to 1.5310 marks, from 1.5265 marks, and to 105.13 yen, from 104.67 yen. The British pound traded at $1.5075, up from $1.5069.
Against the yen, the dollar fell in Asian trading on persistent concern that interest rates in Japan could soon rise, increasing the returns on yen deposits. Anticipated buying of dollars by Japan's central bank failed to materialize.
The dollar later erased its losses, helped by speculation that the Bank of Japan was still willing to help support the dollar against the yen.
"People have loaded up in the belief the dollar can't go down because the Bank of Japan would be there," said Varick Martin, manager of foreign exchange at Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. "The fact that we're not seeing an even more substantial selloff is because of the belief they can't let it go forever."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
What Fuels Nasdaq Rise? A Handful Of Big Issues

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It looks like heaven for smaller stocks these days. But in fact it is bigger stocks that are providing a lot of the action in the Nasdaq stock market.
Yesterday, for the ninth trading day in a row, the Nasdaq composite index set a record closing high. With yesterday's rise of 2.38 points, to 1,190.58, the index is up 6.2 percent in those nine sessions, a much better performance than either that of the Standard & Poor's 500 or the Dow Jones industrial average. [Page D8.] 
 This run is still a long way from setting a record for records. The peak string was 19 consecutive new high closes in 1979, but it is the longest in more than four years and has brought attention to the fact that many Nasdaq stocks have taken off since beginning the year with surprising weakness.
The move reflects an improved economic outlook and better earnings for many smaller stocks. But it also reflects a surge of investment in riskier mutual funds, which have tended to put cash into some of the largest companies in the Nasdaq market. As a result, it is the big Nasdaq names, many of them involved in technology, that have paced the market.
The latest surge in small-cap stocks began in mid-January. The Nasdaq composite index is up 20 percent since Jan. 15, vastly outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large stocks, which is up 9 percent.
In fact, small stocks are not doing nearly as well as that would seem to indicate. The Russell 2,000, an index of really small stocks -- ones not in the top 1,000 in market capitalization -- is up 15 percent since Jan. 15. That is good, but not nearly as exciting as the Nasdaq figure.
About 40 percent of the rise in the Nasdaq composite -- an index that includes more than 6,000 issues -- was caused by the movement of the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks. The Nasdaq 100 is up 25 percent in the period. And a full quarter of the rise in the Nasdaq composite can be traced to just eight large stocks: Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Worldcom, U.S. Robotics and America Online.
Why are the big little stocks rising so much faster than the littler stocks while the really big stocks do less well? One answer lies in the strength of the dollar, which has scared some investors regarding big international companies. The fear is that the stronger dollar will make them less competitive.
And Claudia Mott, the head of small-cap research for Prudential Securities, says that in part because the United States economy is now growing faster than many other economies, earnings of small-cap companies as a group are growing faster than those of larger companies for the first time in a couple of years.
But a bigger part of the answer would seem to lie where it has for much of the 1990's: in the decisions made by millions of mutual fund investors. And as a group, those investors are showing a willingness to take on more risk.
As interest rates have risen this year, the effect has been to scare some investors away from bond funds but not away from mutual funds. Some conservative investors who once put money in bond funds are now investing in conservative stock funds. Meanwhile, some who were once conservative stock investors have moved to aggressive-growth funds.
Such funds, the riskiest of diversified stock funds, took in $15.6 billion from investors in the first quarter, and the pace in April seems to have been greater. Not only was the quarter's performance a record -- up almost 25 percent from the previous peak, set in the third quarter of last year -- but it also amounted to more than 8 percent of assets in aggressive-growth funds, a very high figure by historical standards.
Adding to the upward pressure on stock prices, the managers of such funds grew cautious late last year and early this year; by Jan. 31 they had $18.5 billion in cash, a relatively high 9.3 percent of total assets. Two months later, they had spent $3.5 billion of that hoard, with cash down to a relatively low 7 percent of assets. The combination of big cash inflows plus the need to put previously unspent cash to work had a big impact.
That has also had the effect of sharply pushing up prices of computer technology stocks, which had sagged late last year after a period of stunning performance. Since Jan. 15, Microsoft is up 37 percent, Intel 26 percent and Cisco 54 percent. Some others have done much better. America Online has leaped 95 percent; U.S. Robotics, a maker of computer modems, is up 122 percent.
How long can this last? Many on Wall Street think it will continue for most of this year. They say that valuations of smaller stocks are not excessive, at least when compared with large-cap stocks, and add that they see no signs that the money will stop flowing in.
But there is one historic ratio that may suggest caution. That is the ratio of the Nasdaq composite to the Standard & Poor's 500. Back in the summer of 1983, the peak of small-stock popularity, and another time when technology stocks were soaring, Nasdaq became extremely popular, with the index 1.93 times as high as the S.& P. By the fall of 1990, the reverse had occurred. Tech stocks were hated, and large stocks had zoomed in value, relative to smaller ones. The ratio fell to 1.08.
Now, the ratio is back to 1.82. The Nasdaq composite has recovered about 85 percent of the ground it lost, on a relative basis, from 1983 through 1990. That suggests the party is well past the halfway point.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Pepsico's First-Quarter Net Rose 23%, to $394 Million

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Pepsico Inc. reported yesterday that it had strong first-quarter volume growth in its snack-food, soft-drink and restaurant businesses in a performance that analysts said presaged a return to the company's traditional double-digit increases in annual earnings.
The company, which was struggling to turn around its fast-food unit at the end of last year, registered a 23 percent jump in first-quarter net income, to $394 million, or 49 cents a share, from $321 million, or 40 cents a share, in the comparable quarter last year. 
 "It's a good first quarter," said Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst for Paine Webber, "that positions Pepsico not only for an excellent year but also for strong earnings-per-share gains over the next several years."
The first-quarter results, which equaled or exceeded many analysts' expectations, "mark the first time in three years that Pepsico has shown it can grow at a mid-teen clip," said Andrew J. Conway, a securities analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Wall Street welcomed the news, as Pepsico shares rose $2.125 each, to $63.50, in trading on The New York Stock Exchange.
On the strength of the first-quarter figures, several analysts said they were expecting yearly earnings of at least $2.90 a share, up 17 percent from last year's $2.48.
The highlight of the first quarter was "the strength of the Frito-Lay snack-food business," said Martin Romm, a securities analyst for CS First Boston. "With the kind of tonnage growth it's getting, Frito-Lay is definitely going to accelerate the earnings performance."
More than a third of the poundage growth of the company's $5 billion snack-food business was driven by the unit's low-fat offerings, including its high-margin Baked Lays and Baked Tostitos snacks. A new, fifth production line for Baked Lays will expand output 25 percent this quarter, the company said in a conference call for analysts.
Pepsico said that snack-food volume grew 10 percent in the United States, a rate more than double that of the industry as a whole. But because of large investments in new products, distribution and production capacity, operating profit grew only 6 percent, the company said.
As for Pepsico's domestic beverage business, the company reported a sales growth of 6 percent, spurred by the unit's fountain business, which contributed to a profit growth of 17 percent. "There was a dramatic margin expansion of the United States beverage business, thanks to price increases and cost-cutting initiatives," Mr. Conway said.
Internationally, beverage volume grew only 3 percent despite strong beverage increases in Asia, China, India and Africa, which were offset by a 6 percent decline in the huge Latin American business, reflecting problems with the Mexican economy.
The company reported that its restaurant business was improving as well, as worldwide sales in its three fast-food units grew 6 percent, and were up 5 percent domestically. Same-store sales grew 8 percent at Pizza Hut and 7 percent at the company's KFC fast-food chains, while the Taco Bell fast-food unit continued to improve its struggling performance, reporting a same-store-sales decline of 1 percent.
That decrease is something of a positive since it's "the smallest decline out of the last six quarters," Mr. Goldman said.
The gains at Pizza Hut and KFC "were related to the stark realization that people don't bring calorie counters with them to a fast-food restaurant," Mr. Goldman added, referring to high-fat introductions like Pizza Hut's cheese-stuffed triple-decker pizza. By contrast, Taco Bell's low-fat line, Border Lights, had an underwhelming performance.

HEADLINE: Wages Climb 1% in Quarter; Pace Is Fastest In Five Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
After years of concern about wage stagnation, the Labor Department reported today that wages and salaries advanced 1 percent in the first three months of the year, the fastest pace since 1991.
While the increase was still modest, the report provided the first solid evidence that many workers are beginning to enjoy increases in pay that outpace the rise in the cost of living. 
 For business, the effect of the pay increase was blunted by a slight decline in the cost of providing medical and other fringe benefits, the first time such expenses have fallen since the Labor Department began compiling its Employment Cost Index in 1982.
Today's report also showed that white-collar workers further widened their advantage over those holding blue-collar jobs.
The change in total employment costs was in line with that of previous quarters, but some analysts warned that the increase in wages, coming at a time when oil and grain prices have jumped sharply, raises fears of a step-up in inflation that could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep a tight rein on credit.
In a separate report, the Conference Board, a business-supported research group, said that there was less apprehension about the job market in April than in previous months, with consumers showing "dramatically" increased confidence about what the coming months would bring. The improvement in consumer confidence followed two months of outsized gains in employment and an easing in the wave of announcements of layoffs by large corporations.
Other indications of a quickened economic tempo came from a stronger-than-expected report on economic conditions from the purchasing managers of companies in the Chicago area and another, somewhat slower, advance for an index of purchasers in the New York area.
Analysts say it has become increasingly clear that the economy has pulled back from what many regarded last winter as the brink of recession. But in the "good news equals bad news" environment that often prevails on Wall Street, some economists have begun to worry that faster growth and higher incomes might rekindle inflation.
"I think there's grounds for some unease," said L. Douglas Lee, economist at HSBC Washington Analysis, a research company. In contrast to the effects of higher commodity prices, which often dissipate before reaching consumers, "when wages creep up, that tends to get into everything," Mr. Lee said. Pay and benefits account for some 70 percent of business costs.
Joel L. Naroff, chief bank economist for the First Union Corporation, said in a report to clients, "It appears as if the low unemployment rates coupled with continued good economic growth are putting some additional pressures on wages and salaries." He said that benefit costs were unlikely to decline further, so "inflation could begin to tick up" if pay keeps accelerating without offsetting increases in productivity.
Other analysts, however, found only a minimal threat of inflation in today's figures on overall compensation, which showed an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent for the January-March period, the same as the average for the two preceding quarters.
Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said the increases in wages and salaries were "narrowly based," with wages in retailing up a sharp 2.1 percent while other industries, including manufacturing, were "far more restrained."
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that labor costs were unlikely to spiral upward. "I just don't believe this is a harbinger" of serious inflation pressure, Mr. Kellner said.
Wayne Shelly, a Labor Department economist who works on the index, said the report found "some upturn" in wages from a long-established range as pay in private industry rose 3.3 percent over the latest 12 months compared with 2.8 percent for the 12 months through December and 2.9 percent for the year that ended in March 1995.
While reluctant to call the latest results a "trend," Mr. Shelly added that neither did they seem to be exceptional. "There's no reason to think this is an aberration," he said.
Financial markets reacted calmly to the reports, with both the bond and stock markets off only slightly.
The 1 percent rise in first-quarter pay for all civilian workers, including those in government and the nonprofit sector, was the biggest since a matching burst in the spring of 1991. It lifted the 12-month increase to 3.2 percent, from 2.9 percent at the end of last year, the report showed.
Benefit costs, which had jumped 1 percent in the final 1995 quarter, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in the latest period.
Benefit costs usually rise sharply at the start of a year but "insurance companies just didn't raise premiums this year," Mr. Shelly said. Besides health coverage, other benefit costs to employers include bonuses, holiday and vacation time, shift differential and overtime pay, and premiums for life and unemployment insurance and for workers' compensation.
For the 12 months through March, total compensation for white-collar workers rose 3.4 percent compared with 2.2 percent for those in blue-collar and service occupations. The larger increases for white-collar workers continued a trend that has prevailed for most of the last 15 years, the department stated.
In the first quarter of this year, the white-collar rise was 1 percent compared with two-tenths of 1 percent for blue-collar occupations. This reflected twice as large a gain in wages and salaries -- 1.4 percent against seven-tenths of 1 percent -- and a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in white-collar benefits while blue-collar benefits fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Over the latest 12 months, compensation costs rose 3.1 percent for nonunion workers and 2.7 percent for union members, a pattern that held for goods-producing industries but not in services, where unionization made almost no difference.
As for consumer confidence, the Conference Board's index leaped to 105.3 in April, compared with 98.4 in March. The component that reflects attitudes toward the present situation advanced to 118.2 from 110 while the expectations component rose to 96.7 from 90.7.
"This month's improvement in consumer sentiment is largely attributable to less apprehension about employment," said Edgar R. Fiedler, vice president and economic adviser to the board.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Offers Plan to Nurture the City's New Industries

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Aiming to capitalize on surprising signs of growth in New York City's manufacturing sector, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a plan yesterday to try to encourage the new industrial enterprises like computer software, video production, recycling and cargo shipping that have emerged as economic bright spots in recent years.
The proposals, which include tax breaks, technical assistance, job training and zoning changes, would broaden the city's economic vision beyond Wall Street and the service economy that had once been held out as New York's salvation. The Mayor said the proposals would not only help preserve the 280,000 existing manufacturing jobs in businesses like apparel and printing, but would also provide incentives for the vibrant new companies sprouting up in what has been called Silicon Alley. 
 The proposals, reflecting the city's budget constraints, contained no huge windfalls for the business community, and some provisions, like the tax breaks, face an uncertain future. They are dependent on approval by the State Legislature as well as the City Council.
But in tone and tenor, the Mayor's speech outlining the proposals signaled that manufacturing, long treated as a fading sector of the economy, has pushed its way onto the policy agenda.
"We never thought in the past that you would start to see real growth in manufacturing again," Mr. Giuliani said in the speech to the Association for a Better New York. "The thought was: 'Manufacturing? Nah, you can't do manufacturing in New York City.'
"I really think that it's now time for us to set forth a policy and a program to re-establish manufacturing and industry in the city of new York."
The theme of Mr. Giuliani's speech, reflected in several recent independent studies of the city economy, is that the nature of manufacturing -- who does it, how and where -- has drastically changed in New York. The resonant image of old industry, of smokestacks, mass-production machines and unionized armies laboring in grimy fortresses, bears little relation to the smaller, leaner companies that have grown up in TriBeCa, SoHo and immigrant neighborhoods in Queens.
Much of apparel manufacturing, for example, which is the largest goods-producing industry in the city, employing 78,000 workers, now depends on skilled workers and short-term production runs that can be changed quickly to fit consumer demand. Many new industrial companies are minuscule by the old standards.
A study issued last week by the Urban Research Center at New York University said that the average young manufacturing company in New York has only three employees. Nearly 41 percent are owned by immigrants, compared with about 12 percent nationally, the study said.
A higher proportion have grown through investment by family members, and through serving tiny local community niches, than is usually the case elsewhere in the United States. One company cited in the study, the House of Spice, began as a retailer to the Pakistani residents of Jackson Heights, and now has production plants in the Bronx, opened in 1989, and in Queens, in 1992.
The new manufacturers include some older industries employing new methods of production, especially in garment manufacturing, to the high-technology loft shops of software makers in lower Manhattan and niche manufacturers serving immigrant neighborhoods.
But if yesterday's announcement marks a shift in policy, it will clearly be wrapped in the complications of politics as it moves forward. For example, the plan proposes zoning changes that would make it easier for a manufacturer in some industrial zones to expand a business. Another set of zoning proposals, however, which received much criticism at a public hearing at City Hall yesterday, would allow wider use of so-called big box or superstore retailing in manufacturing zones. Some city officials say they already see a conflict.
"Big box rezoning works against the stability of manufacturing," said the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger. "Given that fact, there's not enough coming back in the Mayor's plan for manufacturing that will strengthen them into the next century."
Many of the proposals in the Mayor's plan are also technical and incremental and, by the multimillion-dollar standards set by the city in retaining some big-name companies in the last few years, quite modest. The total bill for the tax changes envisioned in the report would be $49 million a year, said Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Affairs.
Some are also speculative. The changes proposed in job training, for instance, would create a new link between the city and the manufacturing sector, with a kind of apprenticeship system in which new employees could be trained in part with public funds. But the Federal job training apportionment for New York, as for every other city, has been held up by the long budget impasse in Washington.
Some of the changes are administrative. One proposal would allow commercial cargo vans to use the Grand Central Parkway, which city officials say could speed and reduce the cost of air cargo shipments to and from LaGuardia Airport. The environmental licensing and permits process in Queens will will also be consolidated at a single one-stop location at the Department of Environmental Protection.
But unlike the giant packages meant to keep big employers in New York at a cost of millions, the new manufacturing plan would give something back to thousands of companies that have mostly been ignored in the past. One proposal would benefit 10,000 small companies, the plan said, by eliminating a tax provision that has encouraged companies to expand outside New York rather than within it.
Ms. Reiter said that, if nothing else, the manufacturing report underlines that New York's economy is more complicated and less predictable than it might have seemed either during the boom of the 1980's or the recession that followed in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The service economy is not the whole answer, she said, and neither is manufacturing, but neither can be ignored.
"The financial sector was where we really concentrated our resources," she said. "The city made a conscious decision that that's the kind of economy we wanted. It was foolish."

HEADLINE: U.S. Cites China for Failing to Curb Piracy in Trade

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration formally designated China today as the most egregious violator of agreements intended to combat the piracy of American products, a step that seemed to lay the groundwork for imposing long-expected sanctions against China in coming weeks.
In a report to Congress, the Administration said it was citing Beijing because of its blatant failure to rein in piracy of American videocassettes, compact disks, computer software and other products, despite an agreement last year to do so. 
 The Administration also said it would begin actions through the World Trade Organization against Portugal, Turkey, India and Pakistan for not complying with free-trade agreements on movies, music, software, books and other intellectual property.
In addition, it put eight trading partners on a priority watch list, saying they were at risk of failing to protect American copyrights and trademarks in some product categories or of failing to open their markets. Those placed on the list were Argentina, the European Union, Greece, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Turkey.
In the case of Japan, which has increasingly given way to China as the focus of American trade policy, the Administration said it was concerned about patent policies and the protection of trademarks, among other issues.
In still another area, involving procurement by foreign governments, the Administration said it was beginning proceedings under American law against Germany for discriminating against American companies including General Electric and Westinghouse.
The designation of China as a "priority foreign country" -- jargon for nations that are found to flout trade agreements and harm the interests of American businesses -- is largely symbolic. China is the only country to be given that designation this year, and the question of how to deal with China on a range of issues including trade, human rights and the spread of nuclear technology has become one of the Administration's most sensitive policy and political concerns.
Officials at the United States trade representative's office declined to give a timetable for a decision on sanctions. But the move appeared to narrow the Administration's options, if only by putting China in a category all its own. The Administration has been considering the imposition of sanctions on as much as $2 billion of Chinese imports into the United States.
"China has been given a very clear understanding of our concerns," a deputy United States trade representative, Ira Shapiro, said at a news conference. "We will not hesitate to enforce our trade laws."
Despite Chinese promises to crack down on the practice, "piracy remains rampant, and economic damage to U.S. industries continues to rise," the report said.
"Over all, China has made some progress in halting the retail trade in infringing goods," it said, "but has failed to stop illegal CD, video and CD-ROM production at some 31 plants operating in China, to prevent the export of infringing goods, or to honor its promise to grant market access for legitimate audiovisual products."
It added that "trade sanctions for noncompliance could be imposed at any time" after completion of an investigation in progress into China's trading practices.
The Administration has been constrained in its trade policy toward China by strong pressure from American business not to provoke the Chinese into further closing off their huge and potentially lucrative market or discriminating against American companies in favor of Asian and European competitors. The trade deficit with China last year was $34 billion, and is expected to grow this year.
In the next month, the Administration must decide whether to seek a renewal in Congress of China's most-favored-nation trading status. Although the Administration is expected to ask for a renewal, doing so is expected to bring sharp denunciations from legislators critical of China's human rights record. And it could give Senator Bob Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, an opening to criticize Mr. Clinton's record on China.
At the same time, the Administration is trying to decide what sanctions to impose against the Chinese for selling technology to Pakistan that could be used in developing nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: The Success of a Small Company May Ultimately Be the City's Loss

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
If there is new hope for manufacturing in New York City, one place to look is the fourth-floor loft overlooking Union Square Park where Yee-Ping Wu, a concert pianist turned high-technology entrepreneur, has increased her company's work force to 60 from 5 since 1994.
Ms. Wu is co-founder and president of Music Pen Inc., which makes CD-ROMs, video games and interactive computer products for children. Music Pen is also part of a growing array of more than 4,000 embryonic companies in and around the city that are finding new ways to link computers to the arts, advertising, publishing and movies. 
 While most of these companies, which are called new media, are little more than struggling start-ups, Music Pen has turned the corner. Its best-selling products are being marketed by such industry giants as Microsoft, Viacom and Virgin.
But success for Music Pen could also be New York City's loss.
"Other places are offering to support us with investments in job training, research and development, and tax reductions," Ms. Wu said yesterday, after Mayor Giuliani announced several proposals to support small manufacturers like her company.
Among those that have come calling on Music Pen, she said, are several other states and at least one other country, which she declined to name. "I love New York, but government policy has to be made to work with us," she said.
In many ways the antithesis of the gruff, hard-bargaining men who have championed New York City manufacturing in the past, the 41-year-old Ms. Wu has nonetheless brought together many of the same strands of immigrant zeal, artistic accomplishment and personal ambition that have fueled the city's economic growth for more than two centuries.
Born into poverty in Shanghai, she was recognized as a brilliant classical pianist and she performed with the Shanghai Chamber Orchestra as a child before enrolling in Manhattan's Julliard School when she was 16 years old.
There she met her husband, Philip Y. F. Lui, a composer, mathematician and immigrant from Canada with whom she founded Music Pen in 1987. They began by running the company out of their 350-square-foot studio apartment, cramming it with two pianos, seven computers and two cats.
But Music Pen was formed at a precipitous time, joining the vanguard of technological innovation that would spawn the explosive growth of the Internet, CD-ROMs and educational software for young children. Backed by $1 million from a Swiss investment firm, Ms. Wu and Mr. Lui introduced their first product in 1993, the Lenny Musictoons computer product for children.
Since 1994, when it moved into its Union Square loft, the company has created computer products that have become household names to many parents with preschool children. Music Pen's products include Wiggins in Storyland and Scholastic's The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body.
The company staff, mostly under 30 years old, includes writers, composers, animators, sound designers, computer programmers and musicians. Ms. Wu attributed part of Music Pen's success to New York City's vast supply of people skilled in both technology and the arts.
"This city is a tremendous source of creative talent," she said. "There is a critical energy and warmth in bringing people like these together in one place."
But for all its dynamism, she said, New York City "is just very expensive."
For city officials who hope to retain and attract companies like Music Pen, one risk is that the priorities of a small business can change when it becomes big business.
"Building a successful company is really my only concern, even if that means going to the moon or the South China Sea," Ms. Wu said.
Indeed, she said that paying for the future growth of her company could mean selling its stock to the public or merging with a larger corporation, either of which could create new pressure to find a cheaper location than Manhattan.
Nonetheless, she said, any help from City Hall would make a difference.
Although she had not reviewed all of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposals, and questioned when any of them would be adopted, Ms. Wu said she was particularly encouraged by the Mayor's plan to lower the commercial rent tax and sales taxes on businesses in the city.
"These things would make us happier about planning our growth in the city," she said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aids Beef Industry In a Season Of Low Prices

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
President Clinton moved today to soften the economic blow to beef producers caused by a spring drought and slumping cattle prices, ordering the Agriculture Department to open millions of acres of environmentally sensitive land for grazing and to start buying beef for next year's public school lunch program now.
The White House announced the moves after the President met in the Oval Office this evening with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and lawmakers from agricultural states to discuss the effects of high feed costs and the lowest prices in a decade for cattle, the nation's single largest commodity source of farm income, with annual sales close to $40 billion. 
 It was the second day in a row that Mr. Clinton used his executive authority to intervene in the market for a politically sensitive commodity. On Monday, he ordered the sale of 12 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to stop a recent surge in retail gasoline prices.
Mr. Glickman said that livestock producers would be permitted to graze cattle and cut hay on the nearly 36 million acres of land that the Government now pays private owners to keep idle for conservation and environmental reasons. Those who take advantage of the option would forgo 5 percent of the annual rental income the Government pays them.
At the same time, he said, the Agriculture Department will begin making beef purchases of up to $50 million toward its school lunch program for the academic year that begins in September and would consider further purchases if conditions warranted.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Glickman said it was unlikely that the beef purchases alone would increase prices significantly, but he said the Administration was "doing our best to keep the market from falling further" and to provide "a psychological boost" to the industry.
The President's decision was yet another sign that Mr. Clinton was determined to take aggressive steps to improve or maintain his standing, whether in the Great Plains states, which he did not carry in the 1992 Presidential election, or the mountain states, like Colorado and Montana, which he did win.
Dry weather, particularly in Texas and the Great Plains, has threatened grazing. Grain shortages have raised feed costs, while heavy slaughter of hard-to-maintain herds has caused a glut that is holding down beef prices.
Mr. Glickman also called for stepped-up promotion of beef exports, a survey of the credit needs of beef producers to see how they might be helped by easing Government restrictions and a meeting of producers and agribusiness leaders to discuss other options.
Earlier today, Representative Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who heads the House Agriculture Committee, urged similar action. "Without such forbearance, even the best and most efficient producers may not survive this financial emergency," he said.
Danny Klinefelter, a professor and agriculture extension economist at Texas A & M University in College Station, said that opening the land now in the Federal Conservation Reserve Program to grazing "could be a temporary fix to help farmers hang on where they are being forced to liquidate herds, or forced to buy grain at great cost."
"At least it buys time," he said. But he added, "There are very limited things the President could do right now," and he noted that the newly passed farm bill, which included a broad overhaul of farm subsidies, had "done away with some of these special disaster programs that would otherwise be available."
Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which represents a quarter-million beef producers nationwide, said the group strongly supported the President's efforts.
"We operate on a supply-and-demand free enterprise system, and we encourage minimal Government interaction in the marketplace," she said. "However, there are some programs out there intended to help in a crisis like this to keep some cattle producers from going out of business and those local economies growing."
The price of fattened cattle fell to the upper $50's per hundred pounds in April, compared with $62 and $63 in March and $77 in 1993. Today, though word of the President's proposals rippled through the markets, the price declined slightly, by 22 cents per pound, to $57.35 per hundred pounds.
At his daily briefing, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, took some needling over how the President could justify moving to buck up prices of beef just a day after complaining that gasoline prices were too high. Reporters wondered why low beef prices were not good for consumers.
"Well, they are -- may or may not be in the long term," Mr. McCurry said, adding that low prices could lead producers to sell off their herds, possibly creating shortages in the coming years. "Two or three years down the road, according to some of the analysis we've seen, there might be an artificial inflation in cattle prices as a result of the diminution of stocks now and some of the steps that ranchers are having to take, given the feed grain situation and given the weather situation in the Plains States. So not necessarily are short-term lower prices something that will be beneficial for the economy in the long run."
As an economic proposition, would not that same logic apply to gasoline prices? "Well," Mr. McCurry said to scattered laughter, "we've dealt with that issue yesterday."

HEADLINE: Republicans Push for Gasoline Tax Repeal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Republicans began pitching the repeal of a 1993 tax on gasoline today with all the fervor of a political campaign, pledging rapid tax relief to drivers who they maintained had been saddled with higher pump prices by a tax-loving Clinton Administration.
Democrats, meanwhile, worked deftly all day to steal the issue from under their opponents' noses. 
 Capping three days of publicity that pushed gasoline prices to the top of the political agenda, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader and presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, said today that he wanted to abolish the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax by Memorial Day. The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, predicted that a repeal bill would sail through the House, and some Republicans pushed for a Senate vote as early as Thursday.
Mr. Dole said the repeal would extend only until Jan. 1, but added that a permanent abolition would be written into budget legislation later this spring.
"We believe, with the skyrocketing prices of gasoline, jet fuel and other fuels, that the most certain way to give consumers relief is to repeal the gas tax," Mr. Dole said on the Senate floor.
Then he took dead aim at his likely opponent in the fall Presidential campaign, adding: "That was part of the 1993 $265 billion tax increase President Clinton proposed, which did not receive a single Republican vote in the House or Senate."
Mr. Dole had seemed to catch Democrats unawares when he first proposed repealing the tax increase last Friday. But today Democrats launched a counterattack directed at two perennial foes, the oil industry and Mr. Dole himself.
The Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, went before microphones to charge that producers had been the main beneficiary of the recent rise in gasoline prices and would also gain the most from a tax repeal.
He and a parade of other Democrats predicted that oil companies would simply pocket the savings from a gas-tax repeal instead of lowering prices to consumers. And many Democrats called for an investigation of possible price gouging by the oil industry, suggesting that petroleum companies had deliberately created a gasoline shortage.
"We ought to know what the real problem is here," Mr. Daschle said. "We're looking at mega-profits of oil companies." The solution, he added, was not a tax decrease but "more competition, more oversight" in the petroleum business.
The Justice Department said later that it would designate a team of five Government lawyers and economists to investigate whether the recent gasoline price surge was caused by oil companies' engaging in collusion.
Initially, the inquiry will center on whether the price increases were caused by market fluctuations. If not, the Justice Department's spokesman, Carl Stern, said the antitrust division would seek to determine whether the companies had broken the law.
The Justice Department has been under pressure from some lawmakers, like Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman, both Democrats of Connecticut, to make an inquiry. The investigation is separate from a report that President Clinton had sought from the Energy Department on the factors that led to the price rise last month.
Mr. Daschle also suggested that Mr. Dole and other Republicans were grandstanding on the tax issue, seizing on gasoline prices to divert attention from the Democrats' monthlong campaign to try to force a vote on raising the minimum wage.
Indeed, Mr. Daschle noted that Mr. Dole had voted to raise Federal gasoline taxes by five cents in both 1982 and 1990, increases that he repeatedly called the "Dole dime."
If Congress grants any tax reduction, he said, it should be used to offset college-education expenses, a White House priority.
"We only have so many tax cuts to go around this year," he said.
Democrats added the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax to a 14-cent Federal gasoline tax three years ago as a deficit-reduction measure. Its repeal would cost the Treasury about $4.8 billion a year, and the Republicans have yet to say how they would make up that loss.
Republicans offered their own grandstanding charge, leveled at President Clinton's decision on Monday to sell 12 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. Clinton cast the sale as an attempt to halt the rise in gasoline prices, but Republicans argued that the sale was their idea, inserted into spending legislation last week to pay for programs the White House sought to preserve.
"This is merely another example of the Administration's shameless pandering," said Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
But it was clear that for both parties politics, which had reared its head in the gas-tax debate from the start, was not likely to go away any time soon.
In a statement issued jointly today, Mr. Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich said that with gasoline prices at their highest level since the Persian Gulf War, repeal "is the least we can do for hard-working Americans whose pocketbooks are taking a major hit."
Adjusting prices for inflation makes that toll less apparent.
According to the American Petroleum Institute, regular unleaded gasoline dispensed from self-service pumps cost less last year than at any time since records have been kept, when it sold for $1.14 a gallon. By comparison, a gallon of gasoline in 1960 cost $1.60 in 1995 dollars and in 1980 a gallon of gasoline was $2.20 when adjusted for inflation.
Prices have reached an average national price of $1.273 for a gallon of unleaded regular at the pump.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Urge Council to Stop Mayoral Plan for Suburban-Style Superstores

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
It was billed as an "informational session." But as soon as the City Council took up the topic of bringing suburban-style superstores to New York City yesterday, scores of protesters came out to fight the idea.
The opposition, while largely staged by lobbyists for small businesses, was vehement and clearly showed that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will face a fight as his proposed zoning changes move through community boards and toward a final vote before the Council in the fall. 
 The superstores are common in almost every other major American city but are still quite rare in New York, in part because large tracts of real estate to accommodate them are hard to find but also because owners of thousands of small businesses in the city are fighting them.
Under the Mayor's plan, as many as 57 new superstores that would be as large as 200,000 square feet -- roughly the size of five football fields -- could open in former manufacturing areas, mostly outside Manhattan.
Yesterday, small-business owners spoke of financial ruin if the large, warehouse-type stores opened near them. In addition, a neighborhood association ferried elderly homeowners to City Hall on school buses.
Cashiers at some small supermarkets were sent by store managers, just to fill seats at the hearing, some of them said. At first, some were a little unclear on the issue of the day. But after hearing consumer and retail experts testify, several said they started to fear for their jobs.
But administration officials said New Yorkers are eager to shop in these kinds of stores because they offer convenience, more variety and lower prices. Joseph B. Rose, the City Planning Commission chairman, cited the success of the large new Fairway market in Harlem and the Home Depot in Ozone Park.
"The city is simply losing the retail investment battle with suburban areas," said Mr. Rose, adding that the city loses an estimated $3.1 billion a year in retail sales, not including food, to nearby communities.
The Mayor's plan essentially repeals restrictions that the city imposed on manufacturing areas in 1974 in a failed attempt to keep industries and lure new ones into manufacturing areas. As industrial companies fled, city officials prohibited large retail stores in those areas because they feared that retail outlets would drive up property prices and discourage manufacturers from returning to the city. That approach was misguided, Mr. Rose said.
Chris Collett, executive director of the Forest Hills Chamber of Commerce in Queens, said small-business owners see the Mayor's proposal as an attempt to attract big retailers with no similar consideration for smaller operators. "Nobody's keeping out the giant boys if they really want to be here," he said.

HEADLINE: Telecommunications Talks Postponed as the U.S. Balks

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
A 53-nation negotiation in Geneva on opening telecommunications markets to international competition was saved from collapse yesterday by moving the deadline to next year. Last-minute objections by the United States had threatened to scuttle the effort to liberalize the $500 billion global market in telecommunications.
Although participants avoided an outright breakdown of the talks, the result represented another setback for the fledgling World Trade Organization, which oversees international commerce. 
 Last year, the group failed to win American backing for a deal freeing trade in banking and other financial services, and its efforts to free maritime transport are also in difficulty.
American negotiators in Geneva complained that the offers that other countries had made in telecommunications did not represent "the critical mass" needed, meaning that the market access offered was not sufficient to make it worthwhile for the United States to further open its own telecommunications market to foreign competition.
Last weekend, Washington withdrew international services and satellite communications from its offer of completely free access to the American market. That decision covered the handling of international traffic in and out of the United States, including planned international satellite phone linkups.
The Europeans said that election-year protectionism was the real villain. "I regret and deplore the fact that the U.S. has reached this conclusion," Europe's chief trade negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, said. "I respect and understand that the requirements of domestic politics can make it very difficult to conclude an agreement in a pre-election year. But the multilateral system loses out as a result."
In a statement issued in Washington, the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said: "Over 40 percent of world telecom revenues and over 34 percent of global international traffic are not covered by acceptable offers. We will not enter an agreement on these terms.
"While 10 countries, including Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Britain and Sweden, have made offers acceptable to the United States, a further 36 national offers -- including those of Australia, Belgium, Mexico, Thailand and Venezuela -- need improvement before the U.S. can make a deal."
Four countries, including Indonesia and South Africa, have made no offers.
Negotiators now have until Feb. 15 to conclude a deal. By then, the United States will have conducted a Presidential election and protectionist pressures in Congress may be more muted, proponents of the deal said.
"I see a strong will to save what has been accomplished up to now," Renato Ruggiero, the trade organization's Director General, said. "What is also important is that there is a strong will to save the implementation date," referring to the Jan. 1, 1998, deadline for all members to open their telecommunications markets to foreign competition.
But the talks have already been under way for two years. A failure would cast a major question mark on the organization's usefulness as a trade-liberalizing body, many officials said.
Last summer, the United States walked away from a parallel agreement on freeing trade in banking, insurance and other financial services, saying that other countries were not offering enough access to their markets. Instead, the United States said it would negotiate directly with individual countries to obtain liberalization deals to give its industry better access. So far, no such deals have been concluded.
Talks on freeing trade in maritime transport are in difficulty, too, as a June 30 deadline for agreement approaches. The Clinton Administration is reluctant to repeal legislation requiring that American ships move goods between American ports.
It is against this background, diplomats said, that Mr. Ruggiero has been pressing behind the scenes for a meeting of heads of government on trade next year to mark the 50th anniversary of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, which preceded the World Trade Organization. The idea would be to inject some political momentum into the effort toward freer world trade.
Until Saturday, the omens for a deal in the global telecommunications industry had been looking reasonably encouraging. A meeting a little more than a week ago in Kobe, Japan, of four of the world's economic powers -- the United States, Canada, Japan and the 15-nation European Union -- ended on an upbeat note, with Ms. Barshefsky reporting "very important progress."
And yesterday, Sir Leon said the Europeans had been ready to make an improvement in their offer and sign a global deal.
But on Saturday, the United States put the negotiations into crisis by abruptly withdrawing its offer of completely free access to the American market in international services and satellite communications, complaining that other countries were not offering adequate reciprocity. Foreign companies would get access only if their home markets offered "equivalent competitive opportunities."
The European Union replied that an accord that excluded international services was unacceptable. And a senior Japanese trade negotiator said the United States position was "irresponsible, counterproductive, even threatening."
Under the most-favored-nation principle, which lies at the heart of the new system created around the World Trade Organization, countries must extend the same access they give one partner to all their trading partners.
The explanation for the American change of heart appears to lie in Congressional lobbying by companies like Motorola, with an interest in low-orbiting satellite telephone services. They are seeking protection against such foreign rivals as the London-based ICO Global Communications, in which Hughes Electronics of the United States, a unit of General Motors, is a shareholder and which Comsat of the United States wants to join.
Last week, four key Senators, including the majority whip, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, wrote to President Clinton, demanding firmness in the Geneva talks.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Heartland Geopolitics

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
For the past few years Congress has been cutting the foreign aid budget, refusing to pay U.N. dues and closing embassies and consulates (almost 40 out of 275 posts since 1992) on the knee-jerk assumption that this was what the public wanted at the end of the cold war. There is this view in Congress that out there in the "real" America, people don't care about foreign policy and certainly don't want to pay for it now that the Soviets are gone. I beg to differ. What you find when you go to the heartland is that many people are keenly interested in foreign policy and open markets and are far more willing to contribute to them than are the know-nothing freshmen Republicans who claim to speak in their names.
Patrick Buchanan undoubtedly touched a chord with his arguments about job insecurity, but the fact is, Mr. Buchanan's isolationist-protectionist foreign policy prescriptions were utterly repudiated by Republican primary voters throughout the mid-American farm belt, where Bob Dole trounced him. I asked Minnesota's Republican Governor, Arne Carlson, for an explanation. 
 "You listen to [Lamar] Alexander and he complains that he never got his message out," says Mr. Carlson. "The problem with Buchanan is that he did get his message out, and there was a very quiet 'no' vote. Dole swept North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. What you had here was a quiet understanding on the part of farmers that they benefited from Nafta. They want open, competitive relationships on the world market and while there might be some dissatisfaction with the question of equity, they were not willing to buy into the closed-door theory of Buchanan." It wasn't only farmers. Minnesota last year had $8.8 billion in exports. And with such companies as Honeywell, 3M and General Mills dominating the Twin Cities skyline, "you're not going to get anyone connected with the corporate structure who is going to be isolationist or anti-Nafta," said Governor Carlson.
"We as a state," he said, "rely very heavily on these consulates abroad. It means a lot when local business leaders are invited to the U.S. ambassador's home and can mingle with Minnesotans selling the Minnesota message. [The consulates] have the economic experts who can tell us when we are right and tell us when we are wrong. They set up the meetings. For Congress just to come and say 'no dice' is penny-wise and several pounds foolish. . . . They're going to regret it."
This isn't just about commercial diplomacy, argues Mr. Carlson. "The other piece is that we have to decide our moral obligations. Some of these minor conflicts have the potential for universal destruction. What are we going to do as a society in terms of third-world countries? If we don't learn to build bridges, to encourage investment and to encourage solutions we are going to seriously hurt ourselves. Look, as a state, we are in the prison-building business. But we are saying to the state, 'Well, you better also be in the prevention business because the prison business is very expensive.' Well, the war business is very expensive. It's a lot cheaper to build bridges."
Of course it makes sense to adapt, and even streamline, America's foreign policy apparatus in the wake of the cold war's end. But that doesn't necessarily mean shrinking it across the board. Japan, for instance, is increasing embassies and consulates around the world.
The neoconservative thinker Joshua Muravchik is just out with a book titled "The Imperative of American Leadership," which notes that polls consistently show that Americans think we spend 15 percent of the budget on foreign aid, and they think we should only be spending 5 percent -- when in fact we spend less than 1 percent. But instead of making that point, he argues, too many national politicians look to score cheap victories by accusing their opponents of a giveaway if they vote for a dime of foreign policy money. Foreign policy, argues Mr. Muravchik, "requires leadership from people who have traveled the world and understand our interests and responsibilities out there." Unfortunately, too many of those who should be leading on this issue have either abdicated or taken the easy way out by following the freshmen Republican herd. They are taking us over a cliff, and any governor from a supposedly hick, small Midwestern state can tell you that.

HEADLINE: Who Trains Trainers? Everyone and No One

BYLINE: By NANCY STEDMAN 

 BODY:
ALIX REDMONDE, who teaches aerobics classes in Manhattan, is still haunted by a session with the personal trainer she hired five pears ago while preparing for an aerobics competition. One day the trainer, a substitute for Ms. Redmonde's vacationing coach, pushed her left leg too far into a stretch. "I felt my hamstring go off kilter," she recalled.
Ms. Redmonde, 36, believes she has never properly recovered from the injury. "I can kick my right leg really high, but my left leg can only reach four inches lower," she said. 
 As the number of personal trainers grows -- one f'tness association, the American Council on Exercise, has seen its active-trainer roster rise from 2,200 in 1990 to 15,423 in 1995 -- so do questions about their qualifications. Trainers are not required to be licensed in New York and virtually all other states, and what's more, they need not fulfill specific education requirements.
"Legally, all it takes to become an $80-an-hour personal trainer is a client willing to pay $80," said Jonathan Bowden, the head of the trainer certification program at the Equinox Fitness Training Institute in New York, part of the Equinox Fitness Clubs. For clients, this means that unless they are sure about their trainer's background, the person they hire may do their bodies more harm than good. Even experienced exercisers have been injured by inadequately trained trainers.
In place of gopernment licensing, dozens of national and local organizations -- at least 100 by one reliable estimate -- have arisen that give certification tests to personal trainers. The tests, which show a minimum level of competence, vary markedly in difficulty.
All have a written portion; a few require that the trainer physically demonstrate that he or she can help an exerciser use strength-training equipment. Almost all organizations also require the trainer to hold a valid certificate in cardiopulmonary resuscitation before taking the test.
There are no figures on the percentage of person'l trainers in the country who are certified. In New York City, the larger health clubs require their trainers to be certified, but independent trainers are less likely have certificates, said Brian Moss, a trainer and the owner of the Better Bod'es Cross-Training Center in Chelsea.
From the client's point of view, certification may be a less valid indicator of a trainer's competence than where and how he or she was educated. The first generation of trainers -- men and women who are now in their 30's and 40's -- were informally trained by mentors at their gyms. But younger trainers, usually recent college graduates or people making a career change, often undergo at least a little formal education before taking a certification test.
Education, too, varies widely. At the top is the four-year program pioneered by the University of Texas at Austin; next are a handful of two-year programs provided by a few schools, like the University of Californ'a at Hayward. New York City has two well-regarded, though short, programs. Equinox offers a six-day course, and Marymount Manhattan College has a 12-night program.
Most trainers pass certification examinations by using home-study materials provided by the testing organizations or, more often, by attending the organizations' weekend-long cram courses.
Amity Hall combined hands-on experience with formal education. Ms. Hall, 24, started exercising as a young child; three months ago she became a personal trainer at Bio Design Complete Fitness on East 24th Street. She came to New York last year with a degree in psychology and an urge to star in musical theater. Last November, she went to Rochester to learn how to be a one-on-one trainer in a five!day course run by the nonprofit Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas.
Ms. Hall studied exercise physiology, nutrition and coronary risks. She learned how to test the fitness level of a client, how to create an exercise plan based on the individual's goals, how to lead a person through strength training and how to motivate a reluctant exerciser.
On the final day, she was given the certification test: she answered 100 mulpiple-choice questions, wrote up an exercise plan and completed a health assessment by measuring a fellow student's percentage of body fat, blood pressure and heart rate. After passing the test, she was deemed a "physical fitness specialist," what the Cooper Institute calls the personal trainers it certifies.
Ms. Hall now leads new members of Bio Design through orientation sessions on the exercise equipment. She also trains clients privately. But it is unlikely that any client will ever ask her to produce her certificate.
Mr. Bowden of Equinox said that he has never heard of a potential client who has inquired about certification. "You go on someone's recommendation," he said.
In health clubs, many people choose their favorite aerobics teacher as their trainer; some rely on looks. That's dangerous, experts say. "A trainer needs to know the bio mechanics of each joint," said Chris Fey, the director of the two-year fitness certificate program at the University of California at Hayward. "Shoulders are a big problem area. You are more likely to get hurt by mistakes done over and over again than by sudden trauma."
Sometimes these injuries end up in court. David Herbert, a Canton, Ohio, lawyer who specializes in liability cases, has catalogued hundreds of cases against health clubs and their personnel in the last 11 years. "These are mostly people injured on exercise machines or put into a program inappropriate to their fitness level," he said.
Some fitness experts believe certification is not enough to prove competence. "I see a lot of people with degrees in economics take a certifying exam and become a trainer," said Dixie Stan'orth, who teaches in the personal-trainer program at the University of Texas at Austin. "I would like to see the tests be more discriminating."
Much responsibility for assuring competence falls to health clubs. Debbie LaChusa, a vice president of the American Council on Exercise, one of the largest testing organizations, said, "The clubs, when they hire, have a responsibility to audition the trainers."
There is also a movement to make the tests more difficult. This month, the American College of Sports Medicine began testing for what it is calling "advanced personal trainer" certification, which involves extensive knowledge of sports-training psychology and techniques.
And some people, mostly professors, think that state licensing is the way to insure competence. Dr. Willibald Nagler, the chairman of the department of rehabilitation medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said, "Personal trainers can overstep their level of expertise and perform movements that a physical therapist should do."
But most organizations that certify trainers are opposed to licensing. So is Mr. Herbert, the lawyer, who said, "For all the people who engage in exercise at a health club, and for all the hours spent doing it, there are very few instances of people suffering untoward events."
Still, Ms. Fey of the University of California said, "Once you've gotten hurt, ydu may never be the same."
 
Brain First, Then Brawn
 
CHOOSING the right trainer calls for legwork and instinct.
"First, find out what the trainer's education is and what certifications he or she holds," said Jonathan Bowden, the head of the trainer certification program at the Equinox Fitness Training Institute in New York.
Also, ask about the trainer's experience and references. Typically, the more experienced the trainer, the higher the fee, said Chris Fey, who directs the fitness certificate program at the University of California at Hayward.
Then there are qualities that cannot be quantified. When you interview a potential trainer, you should see if you are "connecting or not," Mr. Bowden said. He added: "How do you know on a blind date if you want to see someone again? You want to feel that the trainer is on your side. You have to trust your intuition."

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Living Section yesterday about the training of personal trainers described a course at Marymount Manhattan College incompletely. The college's 12-day personal trainer program is an advanced course that must be preceded by a yearlong certification program for basic fitness instructors.

Triage With an Eye on Society's Costs

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
At one point in tomorrow night's thoughtful documentary on PBS, George Strait makes a telling observation about television's treatment of medical matters. The subject is the birth of a very premature baby, about 24 weeks old. Mr. Strait, a medical reporter for ABC News, confesses that if he had been covering this story on his usual beat, the birth would have been celebrated as a miracle and left at that.
He would never have gone back to tell what sort of life the miracle baby faced, whether, as too likely, he turned out to be mentally retarded, blind, deaf or otherwise severely handicapped. And the reporter would also have ignored the cost to society of delivering this baby, with the odds so heavily against any sort of normal life, and of paying the millions of dollars for his medical needs should he survive. 
 It is the attention to costs and to odds that makes "Who Plays God?" so welcome at a time when America's health care is in the throes of a revolution that is battering customary expectations. But these two hours are far from merely calculating; recognition of the constraints on helping everyone who needs help makes the case histories here all the more moving:
*Two men await lung transplants; otherwise they will die. "Every day after a transplant is a gift," one says. But it is a very expensive gift; organs are scarce, operations costly, consequences uncertain. We are made privy to what goes into their decision to seek a transplant and into a hospital's decision to grant or deny one.
*Two women have terminal cancer. We hear them and their families weighing the high price in money and in strain of keeping them alive for another year or two, probably in a steadily deteriorating and demanding condition. The program asks whether a family's natural desire to cling to a loved one is a good enough reason for expending tens of thousands of dollars that might be used to help others with better prospects. A Blue Cross official points out, "Money is a scarce resource."
*The mother of that premature baby says, "I intend to give my miracle baby every chance." But she is not the one paying for it. Medicaid pays for the delivery (which cost $70,000), with the prospect of paying, too, for a lifetime of care, no matter what the quality of the child's life. Should that be the mother's decision? A doctor says, "You're almost trapped by technology."
*In rural Kentucky, a poor working family (not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid) struggles to obtain an emergency operation for their son. "My time is not free," says the family doctor who has turned them away, and the mother is forced to make a public appeal. In Washington, a hospital devoted to serving the poor is spending so much money on victims of shootings that it is forced to cut back on ordinary medical care and preventive medicine.
*A man who is dying of AIDS seeks assistance in ending his life when existence becomes unendurable and finds it is not easy to obtain.
Each of the program's five segments is followed by a brief panel discussion, in which Mr. Strait is joined by a health-care economist and two specialists in medical ethics. Although their comments tend to be a bit fuzzy and familiar, the tough realities and hard choices come through.
Could the enormous sums spent on sustaining the dying be better spent on improving the health of new mothers? Who is to decide the point at which medical care becomes futile and wasteful? Should society countenance assisted suicides? Should sick people have to wait in an emergency room for hours while losers in shootouts receive instant and costly surgery? Should the possibility of a transplant depend on how much health insurance a person has?
The issues are profound, but on one point the panelists agree. If the nation is to try to give at least basic health protection to everyone, some sort of rationing of resources is essential. The choices will not be made easier by television's habit of stirring sympathy for sad cases without regard to the price of care. And that makes this program especially welcome.

The Biggest Election

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In 1975, when Indira Gandhi assumed dictatorial control of India and threw her opponents in jail, President Ford asked his U.N. delegate, Daniel P. Moynihan, what to make of that.
"Look at it this way, Mr. President," said Moynihan with a courtier's irony. "Under your Administration, the United States has become the world's largest democracy."
When Mrs. Gandhi later confidently stood for election, India's voters threw her out. Freedom was back, and the U.S. happily became the world's second-largest democracy.
This week, with dignity, honest balloting and relatively little violence, 400 million of India's citizens -- 65 percent of eligible voters, higher than here -- go to the polls to select candidates from 500 political parties. It is the most breathtaking example of government by the people in the history of the world.
Americans don't hear a whole lot about it. President Clinton is busy being campaign manager for the Labor party in Israel's May 29 election, in effect telling Israelis to vote for Shimon Peres or else.
When he is not intervening shamelessly in Israel's political affairs, Mr. Clinton is barnstorming with Boris Yeltsin, trying to help him defeat Yavlinsky's reformers and Zyuganov's Communists in Russia's June 16 election. Washington is also headquarters for the Clinton campaign for the U.S. Presidency, where he beefs up beef prices to consumers while pouring strategic oil on troubled motorists. But in all the campaigning, no mention is made of India, where voters outnumber those in Israel, Russia and the U.S. combined.
As a result of this uncharacteristic White House forbearance, television coverage here about the biggest election has been next to nil. Not only do Americans not know for which Indian candidate to root, but hundreds of millions of voters are forced to go to the polls ignorant of Mr. Clinton's preference.
Why? Do nearly 900 million Indians not matter? American lack of interest is not new; a former Foreign Minister of India, one of Nehru's acolytes, told a U.S. envoy: "We would far prefer your detestation to your indifference."
One reason is that India strikes a holier-than-thou diplomatic pose, remaining nonaligned when there is no longer one side to be nonaligned against. Year after year, India is near the top of the list of nations that consistently vote against the U.S. in the United Nations.
We're wrong to let that overly irritate us. China votes against us, too, and unbalances our trade and secretly ships missiles to rogue states and jails dissidents and oppresses Tibet and threatens Taiwan and (cover the children's eyes) pirates our CD's -- but we care more about what happens in China than what happens in India.
That's a mistake. Contrary to what all the new Old China Hands and other Old Nixon Hands tell you, India will draw ahead of China as a superpower in the next century.
Yes, China's economic growth rate has doubled India's, and China's Draconian control of births will see India's population exceed China's soon enough, to India's disadvantage. But China does not know what an election is. Despite the enterprise and industriousness of its people, despite the example of free Chinese on Taiwan and the inspiration of the dissident Wei Jingsheng, jailed in Beijing, China is several upheavals and decades away from the democracy India already enjoys.
Without political freedom, capitalism cannot long thrive. Already the requirements of political repression are stultifying the flow of market information in China, driving wary Hong Kong executives to Sydney. The suppression of dangerous data undermined technology in Communist Russia; it will hurt China, too.
Though more Chinese are literate, many more Indians are English-literate (more English-speakers than in Britain), and English is the global language of the computer. American software companies are already locating in Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley. Bureaucratic corruption scandals abound; India's free press reports and helps cleanse them, China's does not.
I'm rooting for Rao, the secular Prime Minister, who is more likely to move toward free markets than Vajpayee, his leading opponent. But whoever wins, it's a glorious week for the world's largest democracy.

Malaysia Looks Down on World From 1,483 Feet

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
In the afternoons, their twin pinnacles are lost in the monsoon rain clouds. At night they twinkle like parallel columns of stars. Malaysia officially became home recently not only to the tallest but even to the two tallest buildings in the world, the side-by-side Petronas Towers.
For the first time in more than a century, the United States is not home to the world's tallest building. Perhaps it had to happen. And where else should the title go but to Asia, where national economies are growing faster than anywhere else in the world? 
 Chicago was left pointing desperately to the television antennas atop the 22-year-old Sears Tower, which would still make it taller than the Petronas Towers, but in vain. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the international arbiter of the world's skyscrapers, voted on April 13 that television antennas are irrelevant, and awarded the title of world's tallest to Petronas, by 33 feet.
It was a heady achievement for Malaysia, which yearns to become a player on the international scene, and the symbolism is apt. Perhaps no nation is remaking itself physically with more ambition than this one.
Dr. Lynn Beedle, director of the Council on Tall Buildings, declined to call this a sad moment for America. "No, no, no," he said. "There are still many great things about American buildings. Oh, many, many great things."
The Petronas Towers, the 1,483-foot-tall, 88-story home to Malaysia's national oil company, have risen on the site of the now-demolished Selangor Turf Club, a last vestige of the British colonial heritage that has been methodically erased since independence 39 years ago.
"I call this the shaking away of the colonial mantle," said Ken Yeang, a leading local architect who is a member of the Council on Tall Buildings. "You rediscover your identity and self-confidence."
Tall as they are, the $1.2 billion towers will be dwarfed in scope, if not height, by other building projects here, including an entirely new $8 billion capital city to be called Putrajaya, a $3.6 billion international airport and one of the world's biggest hydroelectric dams, the $8 billion Bakun dam in Sarawak, which will create a lake the size of the entire island nation of Singapore.
Only recently a poor country whose economy rested on exports of rubber and tin, Malaysia seems eager to develop the kind of urban mass that now horrifies many people in the developed world.
"One day, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and our new airport will become one mega-city that can be compared to centers like Tokyo-Yokahama," said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, the driving force behind his nation's development.
His goal is to turn Malaysia into a fully developed nation by the year 2020, and with an annual growth rate of 8 percent or more, it is well on its way. Construction projects that total $73 billion are on the books, including cities, ports, highways and mass transit systems.
The Petronas Towers were topped off in February, and tenants are scheduled to begin moving in by the end of this year.
This heady growth has its critics.
"We are on a building binge, and I think one can question the need for all these big mega-projects," said Gurmit Singh, a leading environmentalist. "They come out with these projects and then they try to justify them. They build this big building first, and then they try to fill it up."
But supporters say the symbolism itself is worth the cost of construction. "The twin towers are a symbol of Asia's dynamism and growth," said Razak Baginda, executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center. "These towers will do wonders for Asia's self-esteem and confidence, which I think is very important, and which I think at this moment are at the point of takeoff."
He added, "This is not in any way to suggest that we are taller or better than the West, but it does have to do with that competition of growth."
People here may be careful not to gloat, but Chicago has been left only with consolation prizes: the Council on Tall Buildings, based in Bethlehem, Pa., says the Sears Tower is still the "world's biggest tall building," with 4.5 million square feet of space, and calls it home to the world's highest occupiable floor and world's highest elevator ride.
The highest occupiable floors in the Petronas Towers are 150 feet below that of the Sears Tower. But the Petronas Towers are crowned with 242-foot spires that the Council on Tall Buildings ruled are integral to their architecture in a way that Sears's television antennas are not.
Noelle Gaffney, the spokeswoman for Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, stood by her town. "While there still is a dispute over what qualifies as the tallest building in the world," she said, "there is no disputing the fact that Chicago would still have the highest observation deck in the world."
There is still more symbolism in this drive to be big. The "American century," as measured by the world's tallest buildings, might be calculated at 111 years, since the completion of the first skyscraper, the 180-foot Home Insurance Building in Chicago, in 1885. Malaysia's moment will be more fleeting.
Even as architects in the West are favoring low-rise, decentralized construction in the new era of telecommunications, ever-taller skyscrapers are rising all around Asia -- in Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China.
Malaysia is expected to lose its title before the decade is over, when the 1,509-foot World Financial Center is completed in Shanghai -- 259 feet taller than the Empire State Building, 59 feet taller than the Sears Tower and 26 feet taller than the Petronas Towers.

 An international group has declared the Petronas Towers in Malaysia the world's tallest buildings; the group includes their structural spires but does not count the television antennas atop the Sears Tower in Chicago. Both structures will be eclipsed by the World Financial Center in Shanghai in a few years.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Increase for 2d Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
An index of future economic activity rose two-tenths of a percent in March, following a rise in February. The consecutive monthly gains are the first in more than a year and suggest that the economy may continue to strengthen.
The index of leading economic indicators for March, issued yesterday by the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, also represented the index's highest level in a year. It follows an increase of 1.3 percent in February and a revised drop of six-tenths of a percent in January. 
 Other signs of strength came from a purchasing executives' survey showing that manufacturing improved in April for the first time in nine months and a Government report that construction spending shot up in March.
The leading index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance. The last time the index rose two consecutive months was November and December 1994. Economists see the index as a true indication of the economy's direction when it moves in the same direction for three straight months.
"There's an unmistakable message here that the economy is firming and economic growth in the two middle quarters of this year is going to be a lot stronger than many people want to believe," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The report that had the biggest impact, at least on Wall Street, was the manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management. It improved to 50.1 percent in April from 46.9 percent in March, the first time since July 1995 it has risen above 50 percent.
The result was seen as encouraging, but not stellar. Readings above 50 percent represent expansion in manufacturing.
"What the data did indicate was continued slow growth in the manufacturing sector, some pickup, but not the pickup that had been feared," said Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Inflation concerns were eased, however, by the purchasers' report, which showed a decline in prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials.
In another report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 3.1 percent in March, the biggest gain in four years. Residential, nonresidential and public outlays all posted sharp gains. The department said spending totaled a seasonally adjusted $548.4 billion annual rate, a record, up from $532.1 billion in February. It was the largest advance since a 3.5 percent surge in March 1992. The increase, the third in four months, was much larger than the gain of five-tenths of a percent that many analysts had expected.
The March gain in the index for leading indictors, which fell in line with Wall Street expectations of an advance of three-tenths of a percent, came amid recent signs that the economy was strengthening. For example, the Conference Board reported on Tuesday that consumer confidence surged in April. Worries over the ability to find jobs dropped to a six-year low, the research group found in that survey.
The leading index's March improvement also represented a validation of the prior month's gain, which was skewed by a big jump in the component measuring the factory workweek. The workweek was much longer than in January, when many people were kept home by winter storms.

Prices Show Little Change On Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended little changed yesterday, retreating from early gains after the Treasury said it would sell some notes and bonds more often.
Bonds rose early in the session after a survey showed that prices paid by manufacturers rose less than expected. The report prompted a wave of short-covering as investors who had bet that bond prices would fall bought securities to limit their losses. In a short sale, an investor sells a borrowed security hoping to buy it back at a lower price, and thus profit from the difference. 
 But the announcement by the Treasury on the size of its auctions next week and its changes in the frequency of auctions heightened concerns about the market's ability to digest new supply, and prices fell back to their lows for the session.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled unchanged at 8819/32 , leaving its yield at 6.91 percent.
Volume for the day was average as many buyers remained on the sidelines waiting for tomorrow's employment report for April.
Market participants were encouraged in early trading by the prices-paid components of the the National Association of Purchasing Management's manufacturing index for April. The prices-paid component rose to 40.1 in April from 39.5 in March, but it was less than the 46 that had been expected, suggesting prices paid by manufacturers were rising more slowly than previously thought.
The association's manufacturing index rose to 50.1, compared with 46.9 in March, and in line with market expectations.
Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company, said the purchasing managers' survey, along with two other reports yesterday -- on construction spending and on leading economic indicators -- showed that the United States economy remained on a modest growth path, with no evidence of a pickup in inflation pressures.
"So far, the industrial sector shows only faint signs of a pickup," he said, noting that the largest contributors to the rise in the purchasing managers' index came from production and inventory -- gains that might have been exaggerated by the end of a strike at General Motors.
Worries about new supply were rekindled by the Treasury's announcement that it would sell 10-year notes six times a year instead of four and would sell 30-year bonds three times a year instead of twice. The Treasury, however, did say that it might reduce the size of the auctions.
Still, the Treasury said that it would increase the size of an auction of three-year notes to $19 billion from $18.5 billion at the previous auction of the notes. The Government is also selling $14 billion of 10-year notes, the same amount as the previous auction, and $13 billion of cash management bills next week.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the 3-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.19 percent, and the 10-year note at a price to yield 6.69 percent.
In futures trading, Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said it was a very choppy market. "It's still making up its mind whether to sniff out a monthly low price at 1088/32 on the June bond contract and then rally to 113, or to dig deeper to perhaps as low as 104."
The June 30-year bond contract closed at 1094/32 .
In the municipal market, New Jersey's $820 million general obligation bond issue was the largest deal of the day.
The state sold $550 million in refunding bonds through Merrill Lynch at prices to yield from 4.1 percent for an issue due in 1998 to 5.4 percent in 2010, and $270 million in bonds representing new money through underwriters led by Prudential Securities. The bonds were priced to yield from 3.9 percent in 1997 to 5.5 percent in 2010.
Both series are rated Aa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor's. Dealers note that because New Jersey seldom borrows, the demand for its debt securities is always strong. The last time the state borrowed was in 1994.

HEADLINE: U.S. Hearing to Decide Rights of Women Who Flee Genital Mutilation

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
In a band of countries spanning Africa's midsection, more than 85 million women and girls have undergone genital mutilation and two million more are subjected to it each year, health experts estimate.
Halfway around the world, at the headquarters of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington, Clinton Administration officials have been trying to choose which of them, if any, should be given asylum here. 
 In a small courtroom in Falls Church, Va., today, the immigration service's general counsel, David A. Martin, aware of the large numbers, will try to convince the Board of Immigration Appeals that the dangerous rite should be grounds for granting asylum only in narrowly defined circumstances. He plans to argue that women who have already undergone it as children or who would be ostracized if they refused it would not qualify.
The issue of whether to grant asylum because of genital mutilation is before the board, the highest administrative tribunal hearing immigration cases, for the first time, in the case of Fauziya Kasinga, a 19-year-old who says she fled Togo to escape having a tribal elder "scrape my woman parts off."
Last August, an immigration judge denied her asylum and she appealed. She was detained for more than a year in a New Jersey detention center and Pennsylvania prisons until immigration authorities released her last week.
Worried that a broad ruling could provoke an unpopular surge of asylum seekers, Mr. Martin is asking the board to establish a framework that would deny asylum in most cases to women who had endured the practice as young girls "at a time when they consented or at least acquiesced." That would disqualify many if not most potential applicants, since the rite is typically performed on girls 4 to 10 years old.
He would also exclude women who face social and economic hardship for refusing to comply. "The home society persecutes if it forcibly subjects uncircumcised women to the knife," he says in his legal brief. "It does not necessarily persecute if it simply subjects such persons to ostracism or economic pressures."
Although Ms. Kasinga says her relatives would force her to undergo the procedure if she were sent back to Togo, the immigration agency's legal brief addresses the issue in general terms and does not argue for or against asylum in her case. Immigration officials say they want the board to set guidelines that a judge could follow in deciding Ms. Kasinga's case.
Advocates for refugees say Mr. Martin's vision would deny protection to many deserving girls and women. If a teen-ager's only choices were to undergo genital mutilation or to be a social outcast forced into a life of prostitution, she should be given asylum, they say.
"Instead of applying the Refugee Act to keep its impact limited, it should be interpreted in a way that fulfills its humanitarian promise," said Ms. Kasinga's lawyer, Karen Musalo, who heads the International Human Rights Clinic at the Washington College of Law, American University. "If that results in a large number of people eligible for relief, the United States should take a leadership position in negotiating with other countries for a form of burden sharing."
Ms. Musalo and other advocates point to the example of Canada, which in 1993 became the first country to make genital mutilation grounds for granting refugee status, and has found that only a small number of women have sought protection on those grounds. "We referred to it here as the floodgates argument," said David Austin, spokesman for the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board. "It just did not happen."
Ms. Kasinga's case is expected to set a precedent that will strongly influence the handling of other such claims. The ruling of the board, 12 civil servants appointed for indefinite terms by the attorney general, will be binding on all United States immigration officials, including asylum officers and 179 immigration judges.
Typically, in genital mutilation, the clitoris and the labia minora are cut off with unsterilized equipment and without anesthesia. In some cultures, the vulva is also stitched together to cover the vagina.
The custom is observed by Muslims, Christians and followers of traditional religions, primarily in Africa. Studies cited by the World Health Organization have found that the reasons given to defend the practice are that it is thought to discourage a woman's promiscuity, to increase a husband's sexual pleasure and to enhance a woman's fertility and matrimonial prospects.
Ms. Kasinga's case has brought into sharp focus what Mr. Martin, a former University of Virginia law professor, describes as contradictory impulses in American immigration policy: one is to give sanctuary to the world's persecuted and the other is to control the flow of immigrants to this country.
Mr. Martin argues for a balancing of these conflicting goals to avoid a large increase in the number of asylum seekers that could stir a public backlash against refugees generally. "People are legitimately concerned about too expansive a doctrine leading to numbers that are too high in the views of the body politic," he said. The immigration service says it has drawn up its proposal regarding genital mutilation on its own, without consulting the State Department.
A question that looms over this debate is simply this: How many of those who have been subjected to genital mutilation, or who will be, would come here if they could successfully claim asylum?
Only a handful of such women have asked the United States for sanctuary in recent years, and such cases have remained a rarity even since last May, when the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued guidelines that recognized genital mutilation as one of several forms of violence against women that could be a basis for asylum.
Officials in the asylum program say women have been unlikely to request asylum for practical reasons: Usually, genital mutilation occurs when women are too young to escape. Those old enough to flee usually live in patriarchal societies where fathers or husbands control the money needed to buy a ticket on an international flight. Finally, many are ashamed to talk about such an intimate problem with a stranger in a foreign country.
"The sad thing is that women refugees don't have access to the American asylum system," said Phyllis Coven, director of the Office of International Affairs at the immigration service. She added, "It's not going to be a growth industry."
Ms. Kasinga said that women in her tribe are generally mutilated at age 15, but that she had been protected by her wealthy father, who opposed the practice, until he died suddenly when she was 16. A grown sister helped her escape mutilation and a forced polygamous marriage by getting her to an airport in Ghana and putting her on a midnight flight out of Africa, she said.
Faustina Annan, 24, who was granted refugee status in Canada last year, said her parents' first daughter died of a pelvic infection after being subjected to the ritual. Ms. Annan said her parents fled to a different part of Ghana and changed their names at the time of her birth to save her from the same fate.
As a young woman, she said, she rejected the marriage proposal of a police inspector's son. He and his friends later kidnapped her, raped her, discovered she had not been "circumcised" and said they were bringing in someone to do it. She said she managed to get away and fled to Canada with the help of her priest.
Khadra Hassan Farah and her 10-year-old daughter, of Somalia, were granted sanctuary in Canada in 1994. The mother said she would be unable to prevent her daughter from undergoing genital mutilation if they were sent home -- the kind of mutilation she suffered as an 8-year-old.
The mother said her own mother, aunts and other women had tied her arms behind her back, grabbed her legs and spread them apart, while one of the women took out a knife. The panel that heard Ms. Farah's claim quoted her written statement at length in their decision:
"She was holding the blade in her hand when she disappeared between my legs. She inserted her finger into my inside to search for my clitoris. She got a good grip of my clitoris and started to pull it out, and I felt the pain and started to scream. She cut off my clitoris with the blade and I screamed more and more. This did not deter her nor did it make her to stop cutting my body any further. She continued slicing away my labia minora, at which point I lost consciousness."
In immigration law, persecution generally means the punishment of a person because of race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group.
But with genital mutilation, the society's intent is not to punish, but to follow a custom. Nonetheless, Mr. Martin said in his legal brief, when the custom itself "is so extreme as to shock the conscience of the society from which asylum is sought," it can be considered persecution.
Ms. Kasinga's lawyer, Ms. Musalo, is asking the board itself to grant her client asylum because she faces persecution as a member of a social group, women of her tribe who oppose genital mutilation and have no protection against it.

HEADLINE: Russia's New-Look May Day: Marching Is Out, Politicking Is In

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 1

 BODY:
The Soviet anthem blared through the loudspeakers. And the old Soviet flag was raised high, as the presidential candidate Gennadi A. Zyuganov sought to use Russia's May Day celebration to tap a wellspring of nostalgia for the Communist cause.
But Mr. Zyuganov was not the only candidate who took to the streets today. 
 Just a few blocks away, President Boris N. Yeltsin stood in a cold drizzle to read a speech to a rally of trade unionists, many of whom appeared openly uninterested.
Unlike Mr. Zyuganov, the 65-year-old President appeared without an umbrella or overcoat, an effort to demonstrate his vigor or to compensate for his aides' failure to anticipate the inclement weather.
Mr. Yeltsin also danced a slow jig with a Russian folk dancer. Displaying a touch of humor, he also tried to buy a doll of his political ally, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, only to learn that only traditional, nonpolitical dolls were available.
May Day in Russia has long been a time for marches and stolid patriotic themes. But with presidential elections set for June 16, today's holiday became a duel of rival political rallies and photo-ops.
With rampant rumors of Chechen terrorism, agitation by unspecified "provocateurs" and vivid memories of a 1993 clash between Communist demonstrators and the police, presidential aides took extensive precautions against disorder.
The Interior Ministry police seemed to be omnipresent. Police sharpshooters took up positions on the rooftops of nearby buildings before Mr. Yeltsin spoke.
But most of the city appeared to take advantage of the day off to relax, not engage in noisy marches. And today's demonstrations were largely without incident, which is not to say they were entirely without rancor.
Standing in front of a statue of Karl Marx, Viktor Anpilov, the leader of the Labor Russia movement, sought to whip up the crowd before Mr. Zyuganov's speech.
Shouting into the microphone, he vowed that the Communists would fight on "regardless of the election results."
Mr. Zyuganov warned the voters of dark plots by Mr. Yeltsin to steal the election, even as he engaged in friendly waves to the faithful.
Some in the crowd displayed hand-painted signs blaming Jews for Russia's financial problems. One placard warned that the creation of the stock market was a Jewish plot to "enslave" Russia. Anti-American themes were also common.
As the rally drew to a close, Mr. Zyuganov's aides asserted that their rally had drawn 200,000 to 400,000 supporters. But an Interior Ministry official said the crowed numbered no more than 10,000 and was probably thousands less.
Viktor M. Mudretsov, a 59-year-old veteran, typified much of the audience, which longed for a return to the security of a state-dominated economy. "I was brought up by Soviet power," he said. "It gave me my education and my apartment."
Mr. Mudretsov said private ownership should be allowed, but only within certain limits. Major communication, transportation and military-industrial enterprises, he said, should be owned by the state. Financial "speculation" should also be forbidden.
The posters honoring Stalin's memory was too much, however, for some in the crowd to bear. "So many people died because of him," said Tatyana, a pensioner, who declined to give her last name.
But she was angrily shouted down by a self-proclaimed group of Stalinists.
"Even if Zyuganov wins, nobody can do anything for us," she said quietly as she walked away. "I do not see anyone now who is worth the throne."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Republicans Choose Charity-Care Plan

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 1

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Republican legislative leaders agreed today on a new two-year plan to pay for hospital care for the uninsured. The plan would continue to rely on payroll taxes paid by employers and seek to move the state's uninsured into a managed care program.
But the plan, intended to end a five-month stalemate, is unlikely to get support from Democratic lawmakers. Democratic members of the Assembly Appropriations Committee walked out of the committee's meeting today, arguing that they had not had enough time to review the proposal, before their Republican colleagues voted 8 to 0 to support it. 
 The plan could also run into trouble in the Republican-controlled State Senate, where several Republicans remain opposed to any financing system that continues to use payroll taxes designated for the state's unemployment insurance fund to cover the cost of charity care.
As part of the new agreement, the state would abandon its ambitious subsidized health insurance program, called Health Access New Jersey, and would provide only enough money to continue health benefits for the 22,000 people now enrolled in the program. The proposal does not provide financing for any new enrollees this year, nor does it expand the program to include almost 100,000 uninsured children, as Governor Whitman requested in December.
The legislation directs the state health commissioner to implement a health care program that provides residents "with eligible charity care services on a managed care basis." Lawmakers were unable to explain how the plan would be carried out, and officials said it would probably require federal approval.
The Legislature and the Governor have been struggling for more than five months over how to pay for free medical care for the uninsured, because the state's authority to continue taking money out of the unemployment insurance fund to pay for charity care expired on Dec. 31. Since 1993, the state has paid for charity care with $1.6 billion in payroll taxes that had been earmarked for the unemployment fund.
Despite strong opposition from business leaders, the new plan would take another $660 million out of the unemployment fund over the next two years. The rest of the charity care bill would be paid with $56 million from the state budget.
To win support for the proposal from organized labor, the Assembly Appropriations Committee also voted on a separate bill today to take another $350 million out of the fund to extend unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 39 weeks this year and to stop collecting employee payroll taxes for the fund through the end of next year. Governor Whitman said she needed to study the cost of extending unemployment benefits before deciding whether she would support it.
The plan would also reduce unemployment payroll taxes for employers by $300 million, but business leaders said today they were more concerned about the prospect of higher taxes in the coming years.
"We just don't see how the numbers add up," said Jeff Stoller, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents 14,000 businesses around the state.
Most representatives from the state's hospitals, which have continued to provide charity patient care without any reimbursement from the state since January, were relieved that state officials appeared to be moving toward a solution, even though they would receive $78 million less this year than last. The state distributed $388 million to 84 hospitals last year. Under the plan, $310 million would be distributed this year, and $300 million next year.
But many of the state's hospitals, particularly those in urban settings, are hoping that the state will begin sending out reimbursement checks soon. Several hospitals have been struggling to balance their books by delaying payments and by readying plans to close wards and lay off workers.
"I think it is progress," said Dr. Jonathan M. Metsch, president of Jersey City Medical Center, who has stopped construction and renovation at the hospital until the charity care issue is resolved. "It is time to get a bill passed."
But some hospital officials said privately that the hospital association was opposed to the legislation because managed care would mean less money for some suburban hospitals.

HEADLINE: Strong Auto Sales Point to Rising Confidence

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 1

 BODY:
Despite rising gasoline prices, two of the biggest auto makers reported strong April sales today that exceeded analysts' expectations, providing another sign that consumers' confidence is growing.
The General Motors Corporation said its sales rose 7.7 percent last month, compared with April 1995, despite a recent strike that crimped the production of some of its hottest sellers. 
 The Chrysler Corporation said its sales surged 33 percent, for its best April ever.
The Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Corporation also reported double-digit gains, although the results at some other Japanese car makers were weaker.
The overall strength in April auto sales indicates that economic growth may have perked up considerably in the last several weeks after the economy seemed to nearly stall in late winter.
Other economic statistics released today, including the index of leading indicators for March, also pointed to a pickup in the economy. [Page D4.]
The auto sales seem especially strong because April 1995 sales were weak. But by any measure, last month's results were robust.
Gas-guzzling pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles remain top sellers, and so far, rising gasoline prices have not dampened sales, analysts and auto dealers agree.
That could begin to change as early as next month if gas prices stay high. "Demand might shift towards more fuel-efficient vehicles," said Scott F. Merlis, president of Merlis Automotive International, an independent research firm based in Westport, Conn.
General Motors sold 441,254 vehicles in April, for its 7.7 percent gain. Its car sales spiked up 12.1 percent, while its sales of light trucks rose just 1.3 percent, mostly because truck sales were slowed by the strike. There were 26 selling days last month and 25 in April 1995, so percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate.
General Motors expects its sales to heat up later this year. "We anticipate a more robust performance throughout May, June and July," said Ronald L. Zarella, vice president and group executive in charge of G.M.'s North American sales, service and marketing.
Chrysler sold 230,469 vehicles last month, with a good part of the 33 percent advance coming from its popular trucks and mini-vans.
"Over all, truck sales jumped 40 percent over last year, including double-digit increases for mini-van, pickup truck and Jeep truck sales," said James P. Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing. "Car sales vaulted for the third consecutive month -- up 22 percent over year-ago totals."
The Ford Motor Company is scheduled to report its April sales Thursday, and they are expected to be flat or down slightly.
Among the Japanese auto makers, Honda sold 74,981 vehicles, up 21.2 percent from April 1995, while Nissan's sales rose 16.6 percent, to 57,105.
But Toyota's sales dipped two-tenths of 1 percent in April, to 89,397; Mazda's sales dropped 21.8 percent, to 22,321, and Mitsubishi's sales were nearly flat at 15,148.
Wall Street analysts were delighted with Chrysler's sales, which were higher than expected. The numbers "are just terrific," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers, adding, and G.M.'s were unexpectedly strong as well.
The analysts said the year was shaping up to be a strong one for the entire industry. "If you look at all of the economic variables -- confidence, income, even interest rates -- to me the signals are all green," said Mr. Phillippi, who predicted the industry could sell 15.2 million light vehicles this year.
G.M. reported its sales after the stock market closed; its shares ended at $54.50 each, up 25 cents. Shares of Chrysler, which announced its results earlier, rose 75 cents to close at $63.75.
Mr. Merlis, the analyst, said April's strong sales made him confident that annual car and light-truck sales would reach 15.2 million this year. "We were nervous that our estimate was too high at the beginning of the year, and we feel much more comfortable," he said.
Mr. Phillippi said G.M.'s sales were hurt by the 17-day strike at an Ohio brake factory in March. "Their numbers in trucks should be a whole lot better," he said.
Robert H. Moody, a River Falls, Wis., dealer who sells Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Geo lines, said his showroom customers did not not seem too concerned by rising gasoline prices. "People that are buying a $30,000 to $35,000 Suburban -- if they have got to worry about gas prices, they shouldn't be buying it in the first place," Mr. Moody said.
Some auto dealers said they could not keep enough pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans on their lots.
Alan B. Helfman, a Houston Chrysler and Ford dealer, said April sales were so strong that he hoped they would stay at that pace "for the rest of eternity." People are in the mood to buy, he said, partly because they are getting their tax refunds and the economy is picking up. "You're just not hearing a lot of gloom and doom right now," he said.
Pickups, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans are strong sellers, and car sales have been helped by offers of rebates or underpriced leases, he said. People visiting his showroom were also not too concerned about the rise in gasoline prices, Mr. Helfman said.

HEADLINE: What Gasoline Crisis?

BYLINE: By Daniel Yergin; Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, is the author of "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
It is not surprising that this week's debate over gasoline prices is occurring in a Presidential election year. Furor over gas prices is part of the American political tradition. In 1923, just as the nation was becoming motorized, the Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette launched Congressional hearings on rising prices at the pump.
"If a few great oil companies are allowed to manipulate oil prices," motorists would soon be paying a dollar a gallon, thundered Fighting Bob. In fact, gasoline prices went in the opposite direction, falling to 13 cents a gallon by 1927. 
 Ever since, any upward surge in the price of gas has set off a national political clamor. In response to today's public outcry, Senator Bob Dole has proposed rolling back the 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. There have been Congressional calls to investigate price-gouging. And President Clinton has announced plans to sell off a small part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
These proposals, however, don't focus on the source of the increase. Gasoline prices are up because crude oil costs are up. In commodity markets -- and oil is very definitely a commodity -- prices go up and go down in response to market conditions.
A freeze in Florida brings sympathy for citrus farmers who nurse their groves through the cold night. The resulting higher juice prices are taken in stride. Corn and wheat prices are relatively high right now, but no one seems to be pillorying the American farmer. Newspapers have been raising their prices because of high newsprint costs. Some people may have canceled their subscriptions, but there are no calls to investigate alleged collusion between the paper industry and publishers.
Gasoline, however, is treated as a special case. First, it is the one commodity whose price has the ability to make people mad, really mad, even in nonelection years. It is the true in-your-face expense, the one that most consumers see every day, in big numbers, on the road to and from work. They can drink a little less orange juice or stop buying the Sunday paper, but they can't live without gasoline, especially for commuting.
Second, consumers have been suspicious of oil companies since the days of the muckrakers. In 1902, Ida Tarbell, the crusading journalist, exposed the ruthless market machinations of John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust, revelations that helped lead to its historic breakup in 1911.
This distrust of the oil industry was replayed in the long gas lines of the 1970's. In 1974, Senator Henry Jackson led highly charged Congressional hearings on the energy crisis. Senior executives of the seven largest oil companies tried to explain, without much success, why their companies were reporting large increases in profits while the Arab oil embargo was still in effect.
Less well remembered is how Federal intervention in the market led to the lines at the pump. Price controls, imposed in 1971 by President Richard Nixon, and an irrational allocation system helped insure that gasoline would be amply supplied where it was not needed and in short supply where it was.
Since the 1970's, gasoline has changed from a regulated to a market commodity, and in the United States it has become one of the great bargains of the Western world. Over the last few years, prices, adjusted for inflation, have been as low as any time since World War II.
Even with the 20-cent increase since the beginning of February, gasoline, at about $1.30 a gallon, is still inexpensive. And it is exquisitely cheap when compared with the almost $5 a gallon that motorists pay in France, where the Government imposes high taxes at the pump.
The actual explanation for the American price run-up -- those fabled market forces -- does not do much to placate the public's anger. Three villains -- Old Man Winter, Asian economic growth and Saddam Hussein -- do bear significant responsibility. But they are unlikely to appear in an American court anytime soon.
 World demand for crude oil jumped in the last few months because of the unexpectedly cold weather across the Northern Hemisphere. At the same time, consumption is growing around the world, owing to economic growth, particularly in Asia, which has increased global demand.
 Meanwhile, the oil world has been waiting to see what would happen with Saddam Hussein's on-again, off-again "deal" with the United Nations to resume oil exports.
Iraq has been out of the oil market since its invasion of Kuwait almost six years ago, an absence that has cost Iraq about $80 billion in revenues. At various points over the last several months, Iraq has seemed close to accepting the terms of a United Nations resolution that would allow Mr. Hussein to resume limited oil exports under tight restrictions. The resumption of even limited exports could lead to a major drop in the price of oil.
That expectation in the first part of the year led refiners to reduce their already low inventories. No one wanted to be stuck with higher-cost oil when their competitors could purchase lower-cost supplies.
But so far there has been no deal between Iraq and the United Nations. Acceptance of the export restrictions, in Iraq's eyes, would taint its "sovereignty," especially since part of the revenues would go to the Kuwaitis, the Kurds and the United Nations.
Afew weeks ago, with demand strong and Iraq still out of the market, refiners found that they could no longer hold off buying crude oil. They needed to meet demand, and rushed into the market. When they all bought more or less at the same time, prices went up.
Added pressure comes from Wall Street commodity funds, which find it profitable to trade in oil (along with wheat, corn and anything else that shows volatility in prices).
So in those few weeks, the price of oil increased by about 25 percent, to almost $25 a barrel. Reflecting the lag that results from the logistics of transportation and manufacturing, gasoline prices have naturally gone up.
But markets move fast these days, faster than they did in the 1970's. The price of crude is already falling with the arrival of warmer weather and the anticipated buildup of new production from OPEC and non-OPEC members alike.
Barring the unexpected -- for instance, a surge in demand or turmoil in an oil-producing country -- prices for crude will continue to decrease along with prices for gasoline. How far they come down is pretty much up to Saddam Hussein, and whether he agrees to the United Nations export restrictions. But by the time Americans hit the road for summer vacation, gasoline prices should be lower.
In the meantime, as part of the American political tradition, politicians are trying to do something about gasoline prices. It is clear what should be done -- pretty much nothing. Repealing the gas tax or selling off small parts of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not have much impact. As things stand now, the market is already on the way to solving the problem. That's what markets often do.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Said to Vow Wage Vote Soon

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Under unrelenting pressure from Democrats and facing increasing clamor within his own party, Speaker Newt Gingrich today promised House Republicans who support increasing the Federal minimum wage a vote on the issue within a few weeks, several of them said.
"One way or the other, it will be resolved this month," said Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut. Mr. Shays, a moderate, is one of the leaders of a breakaway group of House Republicans who helped force Mr. Gingrich over the last two weeks to drop his resistance to a vote on raising the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour. 
 Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader and his party's presumed Presidential nominee, has already suggested that he would allow the minimum wage question to come to a vote in the Senate, possibly tied to a measure to reduce the Federal tax on gasoline. It is widely agreed that there is enough support in both houses of Congress to pass an increase in the wage, something President Clinton has been advocating.
Conceding that Republicans were taking a political beating from Democrats over the minimum wage, Mr. Gingrich told House Republicans on April 17 that they should prepare for a vote on the issue. But today, in a 75-minute meeting devoted entirely to the issue, the Speaker went even further, saying he had decided to schedule a vote within two or three weeks on a measure to increase the wage to $5.25 over two years.
Several lawmakers who attended the meeting said Mr. Gingrich appealed to his 235 colleagues -- especially a bloc of 20 members who caught him off guard last month with their mass defection on the issue -- to hold off throwing their political lot in with the Democrats and give him time to come up with a bill that would win support from Republicans on both sides of the debate.
"We're going to vote for it," Mr. Shays said. "The next issue is, we can vote for it under terms written by Democrats or we can vote for it under terms written by Republicans as a team."
Democrats have proposed a "clean" bill -- that is, not attached to any other legislation -- that would raise the minimum wage to $5.15 over 15 months.
Representative James T. Walsh, a Republican from upstate New York who also is a strong proponent of raising the minimum wage, said Mr. Gingrich suggested that he might introduce the issue as an amendment to a legislative package that would include tax credits and other incentives for small businesses.
"Support is growing within the Republican conference for the minimum wage," said Mr. Walsh, who spoke at length in favor of an increase at today's meeting. "I am happy to see minds being changed."
The Federal minimum wage was last increased in 1989, when the legislation was passed by an overwhelming majority and survived a veto by President George Bush.
Informal surveys have shown that a majority of the members in both the House and the Senate support an increase in the minimum wage. But until recently Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich have been opposed to the idea. They maintain that an increase in the minimum wage would cost jobs.
As public opinion and the views among Democrats, and even those of some fellow Republicans, have turned against them on the wage issue, both the Senate leader and the Speaker have moved in recent days toward devising some face-saving compromise.
Republican strategists agree that Mr. Dole will be better off in his Presidential campaign if he can put the issue behind him. Mr. Gingrich has a more complicated problem: his powerful deputy, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. Mr. Armey, a former economics professor, ardently opposes an increase in the minimum wage, a position held by about two-thirds of the Republican majority.
Both Mr. Armey and the Speaker oppose an increase, "but one believes it is going to happen and another believes he can stop it," Mr. Shays said. "There is going to be a vote on the minimum wage, let's face that fact, and every week that we delay it, the more politically painful the outcome will be."
Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, said it would be left to Mr. Armey to set a date for a vote. But Mr. Blankley added, "I would expect that we would move with some briskness."
In the three weeks since Congress reconvened after its spring break, hardly a workday has passed without Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, or some other Democrat speaking out on the wage issue on the Senate floor or trying to maneuver opposing Republicans into an embarrassing vote on raising the minimum wage.
"Sooner or later Republicans are going to have to come to the realization that they're not going to avoid that vote," Mr. Daschle told reporters today.
Democrats in the House surprised the majority last week by trying to amend a procedural rule that was on the floor to turn it into the vehicle for a vote on the minimum wage.
House Republicans narrowly fought off that attempt on a 220-to-200 vote that saw 13 Republicans desert their party's leadership. Democrats used a similar strategy today that ended with a similar outcome.
But still, today's vote of 219 to 203 was enough to give Republican leaders pause. Democrats put up the most solid front to date, with only one member, Representative Bill Brewster of Oklahoma, breaking rank and 12 Republicans, along with the lone independent in the House, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, joining the effort to force a vote.
"We've been through this same chicanery before, just last week," said Representative Deborah Pryce, an Ohio Republican who was floor manager for the bill the Democrats tried to hijack.
The bill would allow the director of the United States Marshals Service to appoint marshals. Under current law, the President appoints marshals, subject to Senate confirmation. It was passed on a 351-to-72 vote, but not until gleeful Democrats had their fill of taking political potshots at the Republicans over the minimum wage.
"We have seen this Republican Congress attempt to eliminate the minimum corporate income tax, attempt to cut way back on capital gains for the large corporations, but when it comes to lifting from beneath the poverty rate of the lowest workers in this country, they constantly try to stifle us," said Representative Ron Klink of Pennsylvania, one of the last Democrats to take the floor in today's debate. "Somewhere between Abraham Lincoln and Newt Gingrich, this party has reversed its position on slavery."

HEADLINE: Mexico Happy With Response To New Bonds

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 1

 BODY:
Mexican officials crowed today about the response to a sale of a new 30-year Government bond, though market analysts gave more mixed reviews.
Mexico announced the results of an unusual offer to exchange two types of Brady bonds, which are partly backed by the United States Treasury, for up to $2.5 billion of the new 30-year global bonds, which are not backed by collateral. 
 It was the first major long-term bond offering the Government has made since the peso collapse of 1994, and finance officials regarded it primarily as a test of investors' slowly returning confidence in their policies. The challenge was all the greater because the sale followed two weeks of doubt and confusion in the bidding process determining the value of the bonds.
After receiving more than $3 billion in swap offers, Mexico said it would issue $1.7 billion in the global bonds. They will yield 12.4 percent to the investor, or 552 basis points above the comparable United States Treasury bonds. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"This was a successful transaction," said Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, who called reporters to convey his satisfaction. "The market spoke for itself."
Since the worst fear of Mr. Ortiz was that the bonds would be a market failure, he said he was not dismayed that they did not reach the $2.5 billion maximum the Government had projected. Some analysts took the considerably lower amount to be the measure of a tepid response.
The Government offered to exchange the new dollar-denominated bonds for the Brady bonds, in the process freeing up that collateral for other purposes. To induce investors to make the switch, Mexico had promised a yield of at least 4.25 percentage points above similar United States Treasury bonds.
Only about 25 percent of the new bonds went to Mexican banks, dispelling fears in the markets that the Government might have offered special privileges to Mexican investors to buy them.
The result of the global bond issue was good news for the Clinton Administration, which lent Mexico $12.5 billion last year as part of an international rescue package. Mexico has been paying down that loan on time.
Mexico said it expected to reduce its foreign debt by $1.25 billion as a result of the sales because it would use the proceeds to pay off some of its high-priced short-term debt.
Finance officials said they also expected to be able to finance the Government's debt on more favorable terms in the future.
Some analysts on Wall Street seemed to agree with Mr. Ortiz on the success of the bonds. Amy Falls, director of emerging markets fixed-income research at Morgan Stanley, called the bonds a good buy and said they signaled a vote of confidence in Mexico.
"The Mexicans have shown their commitment to issuing long-term debt in a market-sensitive way," she said.
Brady bonds lost much of their value in late 1994 and early 1995, in large part because of Mexico's economic crisis. They are named for the former Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, who developed a plan to overhaul Latin American debt. Repayment of the principal on Brady bonds is backed by United States Treasury bonds owned by the issuing country and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

HEADLINE: Critics See Politics in Economic Policy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
For a President who professes faith in the free market, Bill Clinton has, in the view of some economists and business executives, been caught this week in some remarkable if politically unsurprising contradictions.
There he was on Monday, saying he knew how upset Americans were about the rapid rise in gasoline prices. So, to try to nudge them down, he announced that he would begin selling some of the Government's oil reserves, a decision his spokesman described as a "precise, prudent and modest step designed to move the market in the right direction." 
 A day later, Mr. Clinton met with legislators from agricultural states and heard them bemoan the low prices ranchers were getting for cattle. This time the response was aimed at "doing our best to keep the market from falling further," as Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said, helping farmers but potentially forcing consumers to pay more for meat.
Administration officials argued today that the actions on both gasoline and beef prices were good policy as well as good politics, even if they did try to push one set of prices up and another down.
But whatever political gain Mr. Clinton might reap in California, with its dependence on cars, and in the farm belt, his uncharacteristic market-intervention binge this week raised questions -- in Washington, in the business community and in the financial markets -- about the extent to which he would sacrifice economic principles to electoral calculus.
"The President's empathy with the pain of every special interest group might help in the election, but it undercuts his credibility with the business community on serious policy issues," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, an influential lobbying group.
Coming days after Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, proposed repealing a 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, and against a backdrop of a continuing debate over raising the minimum wage, some analysts said Presidential politics was rapidly pushing aside economic prudence among Republicans and Democrats.
While politics always plays a role in economic policy, especially in an election year, analysts said the issues were particularly sensitive now because they could call into question the commitment of both Presidential candidates to priorities like eliminating the Federal budget deficit.
"These moves scare me to death," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment firm.
"I look in the last few weeks at the proposed hike in the minimum wage and at the intervention in the food and energy markets," Mr. Roach said, "and I see classic examples of how politicians cannot resist the desire to try and make things better through inappropriate policies. Politicians are always prepared to do whatever is necessary to get elected, so it's not unexpected, but it's discouraging to see it so early in an election year."
In that sense, analysts said, Mr. Dole is as guilty as Mr. Clinton, particularly in proposing the gasoline tax reduction without saying how he would make up the $4.8 billion revenue shortage it would create. Indeed, gasoline prices have risen rapidly in recent weeks, but they remain near their historical lows when inflation is taken into account, and far below what consumers in most other countries pay.
"The President is pandering to the electorate, but only because he's been provoked by even greater pandering by Senator Dole," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who is now with the Brookings Institution.
Still, Mr. Dole's advisers were quick to attack Mr. Clinton for what they said was another instance of Democrats meddling in markets.
"I thought that the President announced the end to the era of big government," said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, who serves as an informal economic adviser to Mr. Dole. "Today it looks like its business as usual when a liberal Democrat President relies on big government solutions to solve free market situations."
By adopting deficit reduction as a primary goal, however reluctantly, Mr. Clinton had eroded the traditional suspicion in the financial markets that Democratic presidents cannot be trusted to cut spending and keep inflation in check. And on the issue of layoffs and corporate responsibility, he has publicly acknowledged that some companies need to cut costs to remain competitive.
Today, facing questions about whether that credibility was being squandered on electoral politics, Administration officials said it was unjustified to read into the oil and beef decisions any change in economic approach. They said the back-to-back announcements -- timely and effective uses of existing policies -- was simply coincidence.
"We are doing what we think is appropriate in both of these cases," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the Administration's chief economic policy adviser, told reporters today. "We are not undertaking new policies here."
Ms. Tyson said the sale of 12 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this year was mandated by Congress last week as part of an effort to raise more than $200 million for deficit reduction. By beginning the sale now, while oil prices are still relatively high, the Administration was maximizing the proceeds of the sale, while also giving a downward push to prices that might eventually show up at the gas pump, she said.
"If this was not a political season, we would have taken the same action and it would have been written about in a different way," Ms. Tyson said.
Just as the Administration was selling high in the oil market, she said, it was buying low in the beef market. By accelerating its purchase of at least $50 million worth of beef for school lunch programs while prices are depressed, the Government will be getting more beef for its money, Ms. Tyson said.
"This is a perfectly sensible time to buy," she said.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Workers Aren't Stealing Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Roy Beck's claim that immigrants have been used to depress wages in fields like computer engineering is surprising (Op-Ed, April 30). I work in a Silicon Valley semiconductor company, and many of my engineering co-workers are immigrants. I wouldn't describe our wages as "depressed." In 14 years, my salary has grown 9 percent annually. Last I checked, this was significantly ahead of inflation. 
 The plant where I work also has a large number of immigrant line workers, yet hourly wages are higher than those of the mostly native-born operators outside California. Maybe Minnesota, for example, could use more immigrants, because their effect in California has been to drive wages up.
Immigrants at my company aren't "taking jobs away from Americans." Far from it. They are filling jobs that would otherwise go unfilled, and working hard once they get them.

HEADLINE: PANEL URGES SHIFT IN HOW NEW YORK PAYS HEALTH BILLS

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
A mayoral advisory panel has recommended that New York City fundamentally change the way it pays for health care for the indigent, proposing that the government subsidize insurance for the uninsured rather than maintain the current system of subsidizing hospitals that treat the poor.
The seven-member panel, whose report is scheduled for release today, said its proposals were intended to "promote and encourage the use of primary and preventive care and minimize overreliance on an expensive hospital system." 
 The proposal for subsidizing insurance would cost $1.5 billion annually, with most of the money coming from a 2 percent tax on the fees of doctors, hospitals and insurers, a cost bound to be passed on to private customers through higher premiums. Although the report does not use the word "tax," the assessment it describes is just that. The word was apparently avoided to deflect criticism from insurers and providers who have been opposed to paying such surcharges and are likely to lobby against it if the Mayor embraces the panel's recommendations.
In a further effort to blunt opposition, the panel said the 2 percent tax, which would raise $900 million a year, would be levied against "the two private sector industries that will benefit most from the proposal: insurers and providers."
The insurers, the report notes, "gain a vastly expanded market of insurance eligible residents, while providers earn larger and more direct reimbursement for the care they provide to the indigent."
The panel's report comes at a time when cities across the country are grappling with ways to pay for health care for the uninsured, as hospitals are buffeted on one side by managed care companies demanding deep discounts and on the other by cuts in government reimbursement for Medicaid, the program for the poor, and Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled.
In New York, the State Legislature is considering a plan by Gov. George E. Pataki to end most government regulation of the fees charged by hospitals. The Governor has said that allowing competition to determine rates would push down costs and encourage the growth of cheaper care outside of hospital settings.
The report on financing health care for the indigent -- parts of which were read to The New York Times -- is the second proposal put forth by the hand-picked mayoral panel. Last August, the panel recommended that the city abolish its public hospital system, saying that it delivered inefficient and low-quality care at its 11 hospitals and its network of clinics and nursing homes. The Mayor roundly endorsed the panel's findings.
But when he assembled the panel, the Mayor also asked it to tackle the thorny question of indigent care, a problem that would be made more acute if the city dismantles the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency responsible for the public hospital system. The agency each year provides care for hundreds of thousands of patients, most poor and many uninsured.
In addition to the tax on provider services, the panel also proposed in its latest report that $400 million of what the state currently pays to public and private hospitals to help cover care for the poor be redirected to pay for insurance, on the presumption that the need for such philanthropy would be diminished if more people had insurance coverage.
Under the current system, after the state sets the rate for what each hospital can charge insurers, it then adds on a surcharge that goes to defray the costs of charity care.
The report also says that by enrolling more Medicaid recipients into managed health care plans, and by including this new group of people in negotiations with insurers, the city would have leverage to get better insurance rates and the government will save $200 million that can help
pay for the panel's plan. About 800,000 of the 1.5 million New Yorkers who lack health insurance would get coverage under the panel's proposals. For those earning below 133 percent of the poverty level, the insurance premiums would be totally subsidized, while those with higher incomes could "buy coverage using their own resources according to a sliding scale."
The Giuliani administration would not comment yesterday on the panel's latest findings. A spokeswoman, Colleen Roche, said the administration preferred to wait until the report's official release today.
The New York State Health Commissioner, Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, said yesterday that she had seen the report and she described it as "a preliminary attempt on the part of this panel to grapple with the very challenging issue of charity care."
"I applaud the efforts shown to care for indigent New Yorkers," Dr. DeBuono said. But she added that the report lacked many details and left her with concerns about the "financial mechanisms proposed and the distribution of these dollars," particularly given the Governor's extensive proposals to revamp health care financing.
She and other government officials agreed that virtually all of the panel's proposals for raising revenue for the plan would require approval by the State Legislature.
Some members of the Legislature said they were disturbed that the mayoral panel, which was headed by the Mayor's special adviser for health policy, Maria K. Mitchell, was prepared to issue its recommendations without having briefed people in Albany who will be critical in getting it implemented.
"No one on the Mayor's behalf has discussed this with the Legislature that I know of, even though months ago, I urged Maria Mitchell to do that and she said she would," said Assembyman Richard N. Gottfried of the Health Committee. "I have no idea what their plan includes. But it would be more likely to be something that the Legislature would support if we had been able to contribute some thoughts to it."
Many states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, already tax hospital and nursing home revenues to pay for, among other programs, charity health care. But if the panel's plan is adopted, New York would be among few places that tax insurers, hospitals and other health care providers specifically to raise money for buying insurance for the poor. Minnesota, for one, has a tax on doctors and hospital fees and insurance premiums to subsidize coverage for low income families who do not qualify for Medicaid.
Some economists and analysts who follow the health care industry said that New York City could expect to meet fierce resistance from doctors, hospitals and insurance companies if it tries to impose a new tax to finance care for the poor.
Chris Petersen, a vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a Washington trade group, said that New York "should be very wary of adding a tax on insurers that would drive up the cost" of premiums because it could result in other people dropping coverage.
But James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, said the plan displayed a "thoughtful, positive, long term strategy" that represented a "more efficient way to deliver quality health care to the poor."
"This plans adds the specific and positive focus of an insurance subsidy strategy instead of an institution subsidy strategy for indigent care," said Mr. Tallon, whose group does research and philanthropy. "And secondly, it brings the Mayor into the Albany discussions as a significant player with a quality proposal that all parties would be well advised to take a look at."
Dr. Martin Cherkasky, a doctor and health care consultant who is on the panel, said that when the Mayor first explained what he wanted the group to accomplish, he "said he thought H.H.C. had outlived its usefulness and he wanted to assure that people who use the public hospitals as a provider of last resort would be covered by any plan."
He said this task was complicated by a climate in which there is "great uncertainty over the resources available to do this."
But recently, said Dr. Cherkasky, who would not specifically address the report, "I began to see a scheme emerging in our discussions in which I could see where the resources could come from."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Soars Against the Pound In Advance of British Elections

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against the British pound and Swiss franc in thin trading yesterday. It posted more modest gains versus the German mark and Japanese yen.
The dollar set two-year highs against the pound, which was unsettled by speculation that Britain's ruling Conservative Party would suffer another humiliating setback in elections for local governments today. 
 "You've got selling pressure on the Swiss franc and on the pound," Anne Parker Mills, a currency analyst at Lehman Brothers, said. "So we ended up with the dollar higher against Europe and not much changed against the yen."
The dollar extended recent gains against the Swiss franc and the mark, hitting fresh 14-month highs at 1.2530 francs and 1.5382 marks, before trading volume nearly evaporated when London closed. Many European markets were closed for national holidays yesterday.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.2505 Swiss francs, up from 1.2435 on Tuesday, and at 1.5363 marks, up from 1.5310. The dollar also rose to 105.32 yen, from 105.13 yen.
The pound settled at $1.4915, down from $1.5075. It was the first time the pound had been traded at less than $1.4950 since May 1994.
The pound has been rattled several times in the last two years, ahead of previous local elections and special elections for vacant Parliament seats on concerns over the stability of the Government of Prime Minister John Major.
While the opposition Labor Party already dominates local government, an expected loss of 500 or more local council seats by the Conservatives would be seen as sharp blow to the ruling party.
A strong local showing by Labor could increase pressure for a general election. Polls show the Conservatives would be likely to lose their one-seat governing majority.
"A Labor victory is priced in at these levels," said Susan Stearns, a director of foreign exchange sales at Bank of Montreal.
The Swiss franc fell through important technical levels against the dollar on Tuesday, after Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger of Switzerland said a strong Swiss franc hindered economic growth and called for a decline in the currency.
Buying of the dollar against the Swiss franc continued despite remarks by the new president of the Swiss National Bank, Hans Meyer, suggesting that the bank did not seek to alter a strong Swiss franc policy.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Leader Quietly Adopts A Warmer Approach to the U.S.

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 1

 BODY:
In a series of quiet policy changes, President Ernesto Zedillo has recently reversed some dearly held tenets of Mexico's historically prickly relationship with the United States.
For the first time, Mexico recently approved American requests for the extradition of two of its citizens to the United States. 
 Mexico also recently abandoned a long-held position rejecting international discussion of its human rights record, and in a separate move allowed Washington to begin airlifting illegal immigrants back to their hometowns deep inside Mexico.
Last week the Defense Minister approved a military agreement providing for training of Mexican soldiers at American bases and the provision of United States weaponry. It is the first pact on this scale since the 19th-century invasions that convinced Mexico that the United States was its principal enemy.
The Clinton Administration officials who have negotiated these policy changes, and who will discuss further cooperation when a senior delegation headed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher visits Mexico on Monday for annual meetings, have praised Mexico's more accommodating posture.
But in Mexico the changes have aroused debate over whether the country is slowly surrendering its sovereignty, continuing a trend that critics trace back to the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, and that accelerated last year when Washington and Mexico worked closely in the effort to rescue the Mexican economy.
Mr. Zedillo's Government has seemed to avoid publicity for the recent shifts. But in an interview today, a senior Government official said Mexico's increasingly intimate ties with the United States showed the tremendous respect with which both Governments viewed each other and were signs of "the intelligent management of our bilateral relationship."
On the other hand, some Mexican academics and opposition politicians portrayed the changes as a symptom of their country's financial and political vulnerability.
"These shifts carry tremendous symbolic meaning," said Lorenzo Meyer, the author of a standard history of United States-Mexico relations. "In the end, this chain of events means we are losing the relative independence Mexico achieved for 50 years. The Government is weak, and the United States, sensing a power vacuum, is injecting itself into our affairs."
At least since the 1930's, successive Mexican presidents have overseen a foreign policy characterized by polite but distant relations with Washington and routine opposition to American interests in forums like the United Nations.
"For decades Mexico sought to defend itself by saying no," said Humberto Garza Elizondo, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico, "even sometimes to United States initiatives with which the Government was not really in disagreement."
The tectonic plates of Mexican policy first shifted during the previous administration, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, seeking approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, reversed decades of economic protectionism and began seeking cooperation with Washington on a broad front.
Analysts described the recent changes as mini-earthquakes, still rattling to the surface in the wake of that strategic shift.
All embody an approach to United States relations by President Zedillo that has led analysts from both countries to describe him as more pragmatic and less doctrinaire than his predecessors.
Mr. Zedillo's aides point out that he has forcefully defended Mexican interests when he has felt them to be under siege by Washington. He has encouraged Mexican consular officials in the United States, for instance, to vigorously defend the rights of migrant workers, including those without documents.
"What we have sought, and are achieving, is a new class of communication, a new form of contact with the Government of the United States," Mr. Zedillo said last week in a speech in Tijuana, in which he responded to Mexican critics who have accused him of cooperating too submissively with Washington. "We cannot confuse diplomacy with machismo."
Throughout its history Mexico has declined to extradite its citizens. But on April 17, Mexican officials delivered Francisco Gamez Garcia, who fled to his homeland after being convicted in Arizona of sexually abusing a boy in 1993, to the United States authorities in Phoenix.
The Foreign Ministry said the extradition request had been granted because Mr. Gamez could not be tried in Mexico without violating the principle of double jeopardy.
On April 25, Mexico sent another of its citizens, Aaron Morel Lebaron, to Houston, where he is charged with the murder of four people, including a child. The ministry approved that request "taking into consideration the infamous nature of the crimes," as well as the fact that the United States Government says he is an American citizen.
The extraditions followed lengthy discussions with the Clinton Administration.
American officials say they are hopeful that Mexico will now turn over top drug traffickers it succeeds in arresting to the United States, especially in cases in which the suspect faces charges in the United States but not in Mexico.
Mexico delivered the reputed trafficker Juan Garcia Abrego to the United States authorities in January, but he was not extradited. Instead, the Government declared him to be an American and expelled him as an undesirable foreigner.
The senior Government official, while acknowledging that the two extraditions were the first in Mexico's history, denied that they represented any change in policy. His comments suggested that it was not at all certain that Mexican traffickers arrested in their homeland would be extradited to the United States.
"There has been no shift in our extradition laws, and we will in the future examine each situation on a case-by-case basis," the official said.
The recent thaw in military relations is also partly the result of United States pressure for heightened anti-drug efforts here.
Until the 1980's, Mexican military manuals portrayed the United States as the country's natural enemy.
Besides Cuba, Mexico has been the only country in the hemisphere to consistently keep the American military at arm's length, apart from the training of a trickle of officers at American military schools over the years and a purchase of American jets once in the 1980's.
But an agreement approved by Defense Minister Enrique Cervantes on April 24 in a meeting with Defense Secretary William Perry reverses course, setting up the immediate transfer of 20 UH-1H Huey helicopters to the Mexican Air Force, perhaps 50 or more additional helicopters next year and the training of Mexican soldiers in anti-narcotics tactics at Fort Bragg, N.C., as well as helicopter pilots and mechanics at other bases.
Helicopters previously provided by the United States have been transferred to the Mexican anti-drug police, not to the military.
"This is a major policy change by both Governments," said Roderic A. Camp, a Tulane University professor who studies the Mexican military.
Mexico has also markedly changed its political stand on human rights inquiries. For decades, like China, it held that international criticism of its human rights record amounted to unwarranted meddling by foreigners. But, continuing a recent trend toward more openness, Mexico announced in Washington on Monday that it had for the first time invited a fact-finding rights delegation from the Organization of American States to visit Mexico.
Such delegations, which broadly review human rights concerns, have visited nearly all other Latin American countries.
A sign of the evolution of Mexico's immigration policies came when Mexico agreed to a pilot program, financed by Washington, in which migrants who have been detained illegally crossing the border can elect to be flown back to central Mexico for return to their homes.
In four flights since April 3, 63 Mexicans have been ferried from San Diego to Guadalajara, and a United States spokesman estimated that 450 more would be flown home by July.
The United States is financing the program to get the illegals as far from the border as possible. Mexico is cooperating as a way to support would-be migrants who have spent their last pesos trying to get across the border.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Dole bill to revise tort law may lure some centrist Democrats.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THIS week or next President Clinton is expected to veto a bill that would limit punitive damage awards in product liability suits. In response, Senator Bob Dole plans to introduce a new bill to change tort law -- one even more ambitious than the full-blown makeover for civil justice proposed by Republicans last year.
This counterpunch will no doubt be interpreted as a pre-election reminder to corporate America where its bread is buttered. But the new bill also represents a sharp change in substance, and it may win over centrist Democrats. 
 The 104th Congress treated legal reform as a zero-sum game in which defendants' gains inevitably meant plaintiffs' losses. By contrast, the Dole-McConnell bill (for Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican) takes dead aim at the lawyers who, its proponents say, confound the process. "We now have a civil justice system that might as well have been invented by Kafka," said Michael Horowitz, a policy analyst at the Hudson Institute and a part of the brain trust behind the Dole-McConnell bill. "The core issue," he said, "is how to get more money into injured people's pockets, faster."
Civil justice revision, as conceived by business lobbies, would make it harder to win damages and limit the latitude of courts in making the punishment fit the transgression. The new Federal "loser pays" law, for example, deters securities fraud lawsuits by requiring the losing side to pay everyone's legal bills.
This approach pleases corporations more likely to see themselves as defendants than plaintiffs. It also fits the world view of conservative legal scholars, who argue that the courts have grown too willing to play Robin Hood. But it has made tort reform an easy target for trial lawyers, who have successfully tarred it as antipopulist.
Peter Kinzler, a former Congressional staff member who is now a partner in the consulting firm of Kinzler-Swab, notes that it wasn't always thus. "No fault" auto insurance, designed to compensate injury victims without expensive legal confrontation, was a liberal cause. "Mike Dukakis sponsored the first state no-fault law to pass," he noted.
But the coalition of consumer groups and labor unions backing no-fault broke up in the early 1980's after Ralph Nader took on all who dared restrict access to courts. And civil justice reform refocused on the issues that most concerned business. Now the pendulum is swinging back.
The Dole-McConnell bill resurrects no-fault auto insurance with some clever twists. "Auto-choice," invented by Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia Law School along with Mr. Horowitz, would require that insurers compensate their own policyholders for economic losses. Those who wish could maintain the right to be compensated for intangible pain and suffering by buying extra coverage from the insurers.
With no need to establish fault in court, the cost of insurance would fall sharply. Allan Abrahamse and Stephen Carroll, economists at the Rand Corporation, estimate that it would save one-third in premiums -- $40 billion in 1996 -- provided people chose to do without pain and suffering coverage. "Tort reform would be transformed from political broccoli to ice cream," Mr. Horowitz said.
The other big piece of the Dole-McConnell package would restrict contingency fees to cases in which plaintiffs' lawyers bear significant risk of working for nothing. "In most injury suits, settlements are virtually guaranteed and even the size of the settlement follows standardized guidelines," explained Lester Brickman, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York.
Plaintiffs would be obliged to give defendants a chance to make a settlement offer before the lawyers had invested much in legal maneuvering. The plaintiffs would not be obliged to accept an early offer. But contingency fees, which now run to a third or more of judgments, could not be collected by their lawyers on any smaller sum.
Suppose a defendant's insurer offered $50,000 to settle an injury case after being notified of the suit. And suppose the victim turned down the offer and years later won a judgment for $60,000. The victim's lawyer could collect a contingency fee only on the last $10,000. He or she would be limited to an hourly fee for the routine work involved in soliciting the $50,000 early offer.
The likely savings? According to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress it would amount to "a significant portion of the over $45 billion in tort costs attributable to lawyers' fees."
The big lure here, Mr. McConnell argues, is the potential consumer savings. "This is the tax cut for the middle class both Republicans and Democrats want," he said.
Could any piece of this bill be enacted before the election? "This is not arcane legislation that is difficult to explain," Mr. McConnell allowed. "All things are possible."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day on May 2, about Congressional moves to revise the civil justice system, misstated a provision of a new Federal law involving securities litigation. While the new law makes it somewhat easier for courts to impose penalties on lawyers who file abusive lawsuits, it does not include a "loser pay" rule that allows the winner of a lawsuit to collect legal fees from the loser.

The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, which is shedding a variety of businesses, said today that net income fell 3.7 percent in the first quarter but that profit from the operations it was retaining rose about 2 percent.
Sales increased in the United States and at a faster rate abroad, 3M said, but the stronger dollar reduced the size of the foreign increase. For all of 1996, 3M said it expected solid sales and earnings growth despite the strong currency. 
 The company announced last November that it would spin off its imaging and data-storage businesses, shut down its audiotape and videotape production and take some smaller steps. It will concentrate on its industrial and consumer group and its life-sciences sector, whose products include a wide variety of medical supplies. It plans the spinoff for July 1 and expects to close the tape businesses by the end of the year.
In reporting earnings today, 3M did not include the operations that are being discontinued in the results for the 1996 first quarter but did so in the results for the 1995 quarter.
Net income in the latest quarter equaled profit from continuing operations and stood at $362 million, or 87 cents a share. That was down from the net income of $376 million a year earlier, or 90 cents a share, which included $21 million, or 5 cents a share, from the discontinued operations. But it was up 2 percent from the 1995 profit from continuing operations of $355 million, or 85 cents a share.
The profit of 87 cents a share in the latest quarter matched the average forecast of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. On the New York Stock Exchange today, 3M's shares fell by 50 cents, to $65.375.
Revenue rose 3.2 percent in the first quarter, to $3.47 billion from $3.36 billion.
"We achieved record sales and profits despite slow growth of major world economies, strengthening of the U.S. dollar and negative effects from raw material costs," Livio D. DeSimone, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
He added, "While we saw solid growth in a number of business areas, including pharmaceuticals, consumer products, office supplies and personal-care products, demand was soft in the industrial markets." Demand was especially slow in the auto, furniture and textiles industries, the company said.
International revenue increased 4 percent in the quarter, lifted by sales in Japan, elsewhere in Asia and Latin America, 3M said. Unit sales rose 6 percent and prices rose 2 percent. The stronger dollar, however, pared the results.

HEADLINE: Business Group Sees Strong Job Creation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Contending that public anxiety about job insecurity has been exaggerated, a major business organization argued yesterday in a new report that the economy was creating millions of higher-paying jobs and this "occupational upgrading" should in time ameliorate the fear over layoffs.
The report from the Committee for Economic Development, a research group financed mostly by major corporations, comes on the heels of a similar report by the National Association of Manufacturers. Together they constitute an endorsement by big business of the Clinton Administration's position, set forth in its own white paper last week. They also represent an unusual appeal to Republicans, usually closely allied with business, to resist attacks on the Administration that focus on the anxiety about corporate layoffs. 
 "We tend to agree with the Administration that some of the hand-wringing is inappropriate," said Van Doorn Ooms, the committee's research director. "Our message to Republicans is: Recognize that we need investment in education and training, so that people who lose jobs can move successfully to the better jobs that are being created."
Republican leaders say they are still debating how to approach the issue.
The Committee for Economic Development acknowledged that layoffs and concern about widespread income stagnation were powerful and closely linked national issues. But while big companies have eliminated millions of jobs, the report said, they create just as many as they destroy by cutting jobs in some departments and adding them in others.
Relying on available data, the committee's report said that the quality of these new jobs was rising. "Fifty-four percent of the net employment growth during 1983-1993 took place in occupations with above-average earnings," the report stated. It also found, however, "rapid job growth in the lowest-paying service occupations."
Like the committee, the Administration and the lobbying group representing manufacturers called attention to the anxiety about jobs so evident in anecdotal evidence and opinion polls. But Jerry Jasinowski, president of the manufacturers association, called the fear "less and less rational." And the Clinton Administration, in a white paper prepared by the President's Council of Economic Advisers, suggested that layoffs had declined since 1993 while steady improvement in the economy was translating into better jobs.
"The news about the quality of net job growth is encouraging, and bodes well for the future," the White House economists declared. "Although there is still much to be done, recent trends show that the labor market is on the right track."
Many Democrats, convinced that emphasizing the good news about job creation should have top billing in the coming election campaign, are lining up behind the new message.
Republicans are having a more difficult time sorting out their approach. Senator Connie Mack of Florida, the Republican chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, acknowledged in an interview that his party was divided over whether to emphasize job insecurity, an issue highlighted by Patrick J. Buchanan during his failed bid to win the Republican Presidential nomination. "We are in discussions on this in the Senate," he said, "but the discussions have not jelled yet."
But if the Administration and the two business organizations are embracing the evidence of robust job creation, some economists say the reports fail to explain why wages for most of the nation's work force, totaling 125 million people, have barely improved after five years of economic growth. Amid the job churning aimed at improving economic competitiveness, the median wage for all American workers, adjusted for inflation, has remained essentially unchanged through the 1990's. (The median means that half of all workers earn more and half less.)
The Administration's report focused only on the 8.5 million jobs added since Mr. Clinton took office, and examined in detail the net job growth of about four million between February 1994 and last February. The report concluded that two-thirds of the growth was in full-time employment at more than $480 a week, the nation's median wage.
Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged in an interviewthat this was not the whole story. "We don't really know what is happening to wages," he said. "But it is better to have a balanced discussion based on available statistics, than to have one based on stereotypes and hysteria."
The White House paper examined a variety of occupation categories and found that most of the job creation was in the better-paying, higher-skilled categories. None were named, but the number of computer programmers and systems analysts, for example, grew to 1,486,000 in 1995 from 1,465,000 in 1994. Programmers and systems analysts earn more than the national median. But the statistics available to the council -- or to any researcher -- do not disclose much more.
Based on the available data, it cannot be determined whether those holding the 21,000 additional jobs were paid above or below the median wage for their categories. What is more, the report did not say whether the median for any of the categories studied by the council rose or fell in the two-year period or how many people moved from higher-paid to lower-paid jobs or vice versa.
"We don't have the data to address the angst that might result from losing a job without being able to find another at comparable pay," Mr. Stiglitz said. "Going from anecdotal evidence to statistical evidence is not easy, but we are going to try to do this eventually."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Drops by U.S. Stocks and Bonds Push the Dollar Down Broadly

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly yesterday, following United States stocks and bonds lower.
The dollar slid from 15-month highs against the German mark, and also fell against the Swiss franc and Japanese yen. 
 The bond and stock markets tumbled after the United States Government reported that the country's gross domestic product grew by 2.8 percent in the first quarter, faster than expected and raising fears of inflation.
"You could use the argument the dollar came off with the bond market," said Jim Phoenix, director of foreign exchange sales at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. "But if you did, then you clearly weren't aware of what's been going on the last several weeks, where the dollar has continued to climb on good numbers."
Strong economic reports have recently bolstered the dollar by indicating that interest rates would remain steady or rise. Higher interest rates typically bolster a currency by making deposits denominated in it more attractive.
But currency traders chose to focus yesterday on the effects of foreign investors selling American stocks and bonds and converting the proceeds into other currencies.
"When people are cashing out of North American markets they do that via the dollar into something else," said Kevin Harris, an international economist at MCM Currencywatch.
In early trading, the dollar continued its recent climb against the mark and Swiss franc. But after the strong G.D.P. report was released, United States bonds fell and the dollar soon followed.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5283 marks, down from 1.5363 marks on Wednesday, and at 1.2440 Swiss francs, down from 1.2505 francs. The dollar fell to 104.35 Japanese yen from 105.32 yen.
The British pound, which fell sharply on Wednesday on concerns over the stability of the ruling Conservative Party, recovered to $1.5025 yesterday, up from $1.4915.
Anticipation of today's report on April employment in the United States may have accelerated the selling of dollars yesterday.
Stronger-than-expected payrolls data in February and March roiled the bond and currency markets and traders sought the safety of neutral positions ahead of the data.
"I'd say there was profit taking because the dollar has made new highs for the up cycle and we're coming into more significant data," Mr. Harris of MCM Currencywatch said.

HEADLINE: In a Sign of Changing Times, Shanghai Shelters Battered Women

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 2

 BODY:
In a country where family problems have traditionally remained behind closed doors, wife-beating has often been endured without relief or outside interference.
But untold side effects from China's deep economic and social change are bubbling up everywhere. The upside is Shanghai has opened its first shelter for battered women; the downside is that there appears to be a growing need for such a place. 
 Since early this year a slow trickle of women have made their way to the Nanfang Family Violence Protection Center, a collection of spartan rooms in a bare, concrete building on the outskirts of town. There are 20 beds and a friendly but untrained staff.
It is telling, too, that the shelter was established by a private entrepreneur, and not by the Government, which seems unable to cope with the array of problems that now yank at the corners of China's social fabric.
"Our society is changing so fast it creates pressures and problems that weren't there before," said Zhang Zhijing, the businessman who set up the center with $60,000 from his company, Zhijing Baoye Ltd. "Some men take out their frustrations at home, and I thought we should do something about it."
Mr. Zhang believes that the problem, still not as serious as in many Western countries, is getting worse. Yet no one keeps statistics on complaints of violence against wives in China, and part of the growing awareness of family violence comes from women who are shedding the age-old reluctance to openly discuss a problem that has always existed.
China Women's News recently reported that family violence is now cited as a cause of about one-quarter of the nation's divorces, which topped one million last year. In many cities and towns, neighborhood committees organized by the Communist Party, which once mediated, and intruded in, family disputes, are now receding.
In one city, Changsha in Hunan Province, the local government recently passed what appears to be China's first regulation specifically aimed at preventing violence against wives. The Constitution already bans the mistreatment of women, but the new regulation instructs the police to respond to complaints of wife-beating thoroughly and sympathetically.
Mr. Zhang said he got the idea of opening Shanghai's center last year when he read a newspaper report that among failed suicide attempts by women jumping off a bridge into the Huangpu River in Shanghai, two-thirds were women who said family troubles were too hard to bear.
"In America, there are more than 2,000 centers like this," Mr. Zhang said. "We should have at least one."
Whether his company will attract favorable treatment by the Government, such as tax relief, for its good deed, Mr. Zhang said, is unclear. But he said he welcomes support from individuals and foundations.
Most women who come to Nanfang -- hundreds of calls so far, a few dozen stay-overs -- do so because they have been beaten repeatedly. There are also a few unusual cases.
"Three schoolgirls came because they were afraid their parents would beat them since they'd done poorly on school exams," Mr. Zhang said. "We let them stay overnight and called their families the next day."
More typical is the case of Yin Jianqin, who said she had suffered violence at her husband's hand ever since they married 15 years ago, a union arranged by their mothers. "I tried to leave a couple of times, but my neighbors and family always urged me to go back," she said. "The women here are different. They say it's my own decision what I do."

HEADLINE: Market Place: Lowering the Bar For Corporate Earnings;
Does Wall St. Forecast Performance or Set the Pace?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It all depends on what you expect. If a child comes home from school with nothing but C's on a report card, parental reaction may be outrage and anger. But if the preliminary indications had been for D's and F's, the reaction may be one of relief and even congratulations.
So it is now with Wall Street's view of corporate America's first-quarter earnings. "There has been a lot of talk about how great profits are and how they are so much better than expected," said Melissa Brown, the director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities. "But they are just better than recently reduced expectations." 
 In fact, by one measure, corporate America underperformed Wall Street's original expectations by the greatest amount in years. Not since the recession of 1990 have as few companies done better than Wall Street originally hoped.
Consider Compaq Computer. Last week, it announced first-quarter profits of 85 cents a share, better than the 82 cents that had become the Wall Street consensus, and the stock leaped up. But back in January, the Wall Street consensus was $1.04 a share. The company had talked that figure down, warning of pressure on profit margins.
Compaq's saga is an illustration of the expectations game on Wall Street, where forecasts change regularly and small investors can easily be baffled. Many companies now "pre-announce" earnings, causing the stock to rise or fall well before the actual release. When the real number does come out, it appears that the analysts had a good handle on what was happening, and what would have been bad news a month earlier can be perceived as positive.
In this year's first quarter, the slashing of earnings expectations was, in part, a result of fear that the economy was slowing and that earnings would be disappointing. But when actual earnings reports were released beginning last month, much of the commentary said they were better than expected -- that is, better than the lowered expectations -- and many stocks rose.
A composite earnings report of about 1,000 large companies would show first-quarter profits up about 8.5 percent from the similar period a year earlier, Ms. Brown said, or about three percentage points better than expected. "But estimates came down a lot in the month from March 15 to April 15," she added. "If you compare the actual profits to March 15 expectations, they were just about in line."
One data series that ignores such last-minute adjustments is kept by Tom Doerflinger, an analyst at Paine Webber. It takes the consensus estimate for 335 large companies one month into the quarter -- when it really is a forecast -- and compares that with what is actually reported.
With 273 of those companies having reported, Mr. Doerflinger said, only 11 percent have registered positive surprises, while 29 percent have registered negative surprises. A surprise is defined as actual earnings at least 10 percent above or below the estimate.
In many cases, of course, when those earnings are reported, they are viewed as being better than expected. "Expectations for earnings fell a lot over the three months starting in November," Mr. Doerflinger said, "and earnings are generally meeting lowered expectations."
But considering where expectations were before they were lowered, the numbers do not look good at all, though they are only a bit worse than the fourth quarter of last year, when the figures were 12 percent positive surprises and 27 percent negative surprises. The figures have generally been declining since peaking in the fourth quarter of 1994.
Not since the final quarter of 1991 had so many companies done worse than forecast; not since the final quarter of 1990 had so few done better.
The companies most likely to do better than had been expected have been primarily in two industries blessed by surprisingly good business conditions: Wall Street and oil. The oil companies are selling oil and gasoline for a lot more than anyone expected, to the consternation of President Clinton, among others. And Wall Street has basked in the profits from strong sales of new securities and rising stock prices, notwithstanding the fact that bond prices have fallen. A lot of utilities also did better than expected, probably thanks to cold weather bolstering sales.
But there were disappointments in many companies that specialize in commodities, from paper to chemicals, where strong gains in prices last year have come under pressure this year.
To be sure, there is nothing unusual about Wall Street earnings estimates coming down. Analysts usually start off overly optimistic about most companies, and then pare their estimates as the year goes on. Some cynics say that reflects the fact analysts are trying to sell stock, but it is more likely that they are reflecting the hopes of the companies they follow. The pattern is not unlike the optimism many students feel in September when the school year starts, with a tempering of expectations coming later.
Late last year, that tempering on Wall Street took an extreme form. With concern about a slowing economy, analysts shaved their 1996 estimates at a rapid rate. By late December, analysts were cutting two estimates for every one they raised, according to figures from IBES, which monitors brokerage house estimates.
In fact, as the Government reported yesterday, the first quarter's economic growth was stronger than many had forecast, and the earnings of many companies were not as bad as they had come to fear.
Now, with widespread talk of a relatively strong economy and concern that growth is so strong that the Federal Reserve may actually begin to tighten credit later this year, analysts are back in a happy mood. For the last two weeks, they have raised more estimates than they have cut.
Just as analysts went too far this winter in reducing expectations, it is possible to go too far in raising them as well, as some students have learned after bringing home report cards with mostly A's but one or two B's scattered in. If that happens on Wall Street, a quarter later this year could find companies reporting numbers that are in fact pretty good, but that nevertheless are deemed disappointing by investors.
 For when it comes to earnings, the reality can be less important than how they compare with the sometimes-arbitrary and often-changing expectations generated by the companies and the analysts who follow them.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Plunge On Signs of Strong Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Data indicating a strong economic expansion sent Treasury prices tumbling yesterday, pushing interest rates to their highest level in a year.
The selloff followed reports showing faster-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter and a drop in the weekly unemployment claims report that was larger than expected. The losses were exacerbated by a report showing a big increase in March factory orders. 
 The data sketched an economy that is taking its first strides toward a full-blown expansion, and thus raised concerns among investors that inflation -- which diminishes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds -- would soon accelerate.
Still, the selloff was somewhat surprising since the market had previously seemed to be in a holding pattern awaiting today's release of April employment data.
"Is the economy growing quickly enough to warrant serious concern about overheating?" asked James Padinha, an economist with MMS International. "The jobs report will help answer the question, at least the debt market thinks so."
Unless the employment numbers todaysubstantially revise the views of market participants, many traders and analysts now expect that the Federal Reserve will soon have to raise short-term interest rates to keep a damper on inflation.
"Given the widening spread between the Federal funds rate and the yield on a two-year Treasury note, the market clearly is building in a Fed tightening at some future point," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
The Federal funds target rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans and a sensitive indicator of the direction of interest rates -- stands at 5.25 percent, and the spread between it and the yield on the two-year note, 6.18 percent, widened to 93 basis points yesterday from 74 basis points the previous session. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended the day down 122/32 , to 86 30/32 . Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions from each other, and the selloff yesterday drove the yield on the 30-year bond -- a crucial benchmark for mortgages and other consumer rates -- up to 7.05 percent from 6.91 percent on Wednesday.
It was the highest the yield has been since May 4, 1995, when it was 7.16 percent. Bondholders lost about $16.88 for every $1,000 they invested in bonds.
Bonds began to tumble after the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent for the first three months of the year -- much faster than the market had expected.
"The economy's performance during the first quarter seems even more remarkable given the hindering effects of the Government shutdown, the blizzard, and the G.M. strike," Mr. Fine said, referring to labor strife afflicting the General Motors Corpration.
Signs of an expansion were also visible in other reports. Initial claims for unemployment insurance dropped last week to a rather low level of 348,000. And March factory orders rose 1.5 percent, aided in large part by a 2.5 percent surge in new orders for durable goods.
The gains in yesterday's reports made market participants even more jittery about today's employment report. The two previous monthly employment reports showed surprising strength in the job market, roiling the market both times.
Mr. Fine said that economists had forecast that the report today would show a rise in the number of jobs nationwide, anywhere from a small gain of 25,000 to a rather large one of 225,000.
"Any payroll gain in excess of 175,000 would very likely be viewed in an unfavorable light and continue to justify the bond market's decidedly negative tone," he said.
"Conversely, an increase of 100,000 or less would be constructive, but given the one-way nature of the recent spate of economic data, the market would likely view it more as an aberration rather than as a reason to change its collective view," Mr. Fine said.

HEADLINE: David Kennedy, Ex-Treasury Chief, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
David M. Kennedy, who was Secretary of the Treasury in the first two years of the Nixon Administration, died Wednesday at his home in Salt Lake City. He was 90, and had long suffered from a heart ailment.
Mr. Kennedy, whose career included a succession of Government and business posts, came to prominence as chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company when it was Chicago's largest bank. As chairman, he was credited with reinvigorating it after a long malaise and establishing a strong overseas presence. 
 He was chosen by President-elect Richard M. Nixon in late 1968 for the top Treasury job, which he held until resigning in late 1970 under pressure from Mr. Nixon, who was unhappy with the nation's stagnant economy and rising inflation. Mr. Kennedy was succeeded by John B. Connally, a politically astute former Governor of Texas who had been Secretary of the Navy under President John F. Kennedy.
An early gaffe committed by David Kennedy even before being sworn in to his Treasury post was his refusal at a news conference to rule out the possibility that the Government might raise the price of gold, then fixed officially at $35 an ounce. Shortly afterward he caused another stir with a similar comment about imposing wage and price controls to curb inflation.
On leaving the Treasury, Mr. Kennedy was appointed Ambassador at Large, remaining in the Nixon Cabinet, and the President subsequently named him United States Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Mr. Kennedy was the son of a Utah rancher and legislator, working on the ranch in the summer and attending school in nearby Ogden in the winter. He frustrated his family's expectations that he would succeed his grandfather as president of the Bank of Randolph when, as a student at Weber State College in Ogden, he decided on a law career.
After a two-year mission in Britain for the Mormon Church, Mr. Kennedy came to Washington to work as a technical assistant in the Federal Reserve System. He later described this experience -- reopening and liquidating banks -- as having turned his interest to economics and banking, "and I became impressed with the cooperation possible between business and government."
He later rose to special assistant to Marriner Eccles, another native of Utah, then chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Kennedy also received a law degree after attending George Washington University at night.
In 1946, passing up an offer from a New York bank that would have paid him six times as much, Mr. Kennedy joined the bond department of Continental Bank. By 1955 he was named president, shortly after returning from a 14-month period in which he served as assistant to Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey.
After leaving the Government, Mr. Kennedy developed a close business relationship with Michele Sindona, the financier who controlled Franklin National Bank in New York, which collapsed in scandal. Mr. Kennedy testified at a 1979 trial of three former Franklin executives that he had introduced Mr. Sindona to bank regulators and officials here and abroad, and had once borrowed $200,000 from the financier for a land venture in Arizona.
Mr. Kennedy held various lay positions with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including special representative -- a kind of international ambassador -- for the First Presidency, the top governing body of the Mormon Church.
Mr. Kennedy's wife, the former Lenora Bingham, died last fall. The couple had four daughters.

HEADLINE: At the Pumps, High-Octane Pain

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: McLEAN, Ill., May 2

 BODY:
Pulling his thirsty rig into the truck stop, Dave Morisset longed for the good old days of cheaper fuel -- about six weeks ago.
Then, it cost him $160 to fill his truck. Now it costs him $200. The worst of it, he said, is that it will cost him a chance to watch his son's track meet this weekend. 
 "I've had to add an extra trip every week," said the 38-year-old Minnesota trucker, "just to pay for the extra fuel costs." So Mr. Morisset, who is married and has four children, now spends six or seven days a week on the road, instead of the usual five.
"My boy's got another meet I'll have to miss," he said. "And now that it's starting to warm up, I'm going to want to go fishing with my girls. It really hurts."
Around the diesel pumps at the Dixie Trucker Home on the old Route 66 here, long a favorite among over-the-road professionals, there has been a lot of talk this week about the soaring gas prices -- and about who is responsible.
"You don't know exactly who to blame," said Bill Caddenhead, 45, a long-distance trucker from Houston who takes turns behind the wheel with his wife, Donna, 49. "And you can't drive any slower, or you won't get over the hills."
Across the nation, many Americans have begun to notice a hole in their pockets, and have reacted with a mix of outrage, suspicion, puzzlement and it-could-be-worse (and probably will be) fatalism.
Among farmers in the Mississippi Delta and cab drivers in Manhattan, plumbers in California, truckers in Wyoming and commuters in far-flung suburbs of Virginia, the increases are seen as a real threat, especially because people feel helpless.
"There are some things you can't do anything about," said Ray Makamson, 64, who raises cotton and soybeans in Greenwood, Miss. "You can't quit."
In the biggest increases since the Gulf War in 1991, diesel fuel prices have risen nationally by an average of about 17 cents, or 15 percent, in the past 10 weeks, and more than 5 cents in the past week alone. The price of gasoline also has increased, by about 10 percent, to an average of $1.27 for a gallon of regular. Oil companies say many factors, including a harsh winter and higher demand, are to blame.
Some trucking companies have tried to pass along some of the price increases. "You are probably going to see prices going up a little for everything from food to clothing," said Ed Pooser, the director of operations for the Florida Trucking Association.
Even the neighborhood ice cream vendor is feeling the pinch, and asking children to ante up a little extra.
Kirpal Chauhen, who drives a 5 Star Ice Cream truck in Santa Rosa, Calif., said he could not bear the rising gas prices alone.
"I had to do it," he said, defending the increase in the red, blue and white Superstar Stick to $1, from 75 cents.
But most businesses say they will be forced to absorb the extra costs. Al Degendorfer, whose plumbing business in Los Angeles has three vehicles and monthly fuel bills of $500, said the increases would surely cut into profits.
Mr. Degendorfer added that he was unhappy with Federal levies on gasoline. "We pay 18 cents a gallon in tax," he said. "That's ridiculous."
Some people said that most of the complaints were just talk. "We moan and we groan," said Frederick D. Smith, 44, who lives in Orange, Va., and makes the long commute to Washington, "but we still pay the price."
Nobody is expected to feel the price increases more keenly than truckers, at least those like Mr. Morisset who own their rigs and pay for their fuel.
As it is, many long-haul drivers sleep in their trucks, instead of motels, to cut costs. Mr. Morisset, who bunks in his cab and relies on truck-stop showers, said he could net as much as $40,000 a year if he was careful with expenses.
But the price of fuel, if it continues to rise, could virtually ruin an operator like Mr. Morisset, who is paid at flat rates that have not yet reflected the higher costs. He would like to see prohibitions against Iraqi oil sales removed.
"Without all of the Middle Eastern oil in the world supply," he said, "prices could really skyrocket."
Fuel prices have actually remained comparatively low in the past decade, especially when inflation is taken into account.
In the view of a German tourist on vacation in Florida, Americans may be making too big a fuss about the increases. "I think no German would change plans in the United States because of the price of the gasoline," said Ernst Zieringer, who noted that back home in Munich, gasoline costs the equivalent of $3.78 a gallon, largely because of taxes.
Even talk of such high fuel prices would be verboten in this country, of course. Americans tend to feel about cars much the same way they do about, say, oxygen.
And while some people have talked lately about car-pooling, bicycling and walking, the freeways do not seem any less crowded.
In some cases, angry words are directed at the oil companies, or at President Clinton, who gets more blame for successfully pushing for a 4.3-cent addition to the gasoline tax three years ago than credit for his recent decision to sell some oil reserves in an effort to keep prices down.
The President should be blamed for the higher prices, said a 42-year-old Illinois man who declined to give his name. "I'm the same age and size as Rush Limbaugh," the man said, "but not as liberal." He said he hoped the gas increases would send the economy into a tailspin, and doom Mr. Clinton's re-election chances against his likely opponent, Senator Bob Dole.
But more often, people did not seem to view the oil price as a partisan issue. "Clinton or Dole, I don't see where that's going to make any difference about what the pump reads," said Mr. Caddenhead, the trucker from Houston.
Skepticism about big oil companies has long run deep in American society, from resentments toward the old Rockefeller barons to anger over the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
"The oil companies are ripping us off again," said Steve Allen, 37, a contract administrator in Fairfax, Va., who drives 50 miles to work every day. "They're blaming it on cold weather. They haven't fooled me and they haven't fooled most people. It's profits."
Kwasi Ampadu, a New York taxi driver, also voiced suspicions. "Even during the gulf war, the increase was not so high," he said. "I don't get it."
In the view of Susan Sysler, a 53-year-old worker at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, it all boils down to muscle and influence. And the average consumer does not have enough.
"I think it has to do with where the oil comes from, and who has the strongest lobby, and who has the most power," Ms. Sysler said.
A few people, but only a few, looked elsewhere for the culprit: into the mirror.
"This is all about supply and demand," said Walter Ossanna, a 36-year-old trucker from Bondurant, Wyo., who stopped at the Dixie truck stop for its $4.85 Mudflap Special of steak, eggs and hash browns. "Look at the way we're living, the way we consume, the way we waste our resources. The oil companies charge what the market will bear. It's not that complicated."
To be sure, Americans have once again become infatuated with gas-guzzlers, especially sport-utility vehicles. Three-car garages have become standard in many expensive new houses. And suburbia marches deeper into formerly rural America every year, raising commuting distances and gas consumption.
Mr. Ossanna offered that he would not win any popularity contests with his views. Anyway, he cheerfully confessed to being a hypocrite on the subject.
"I'm as guilty as anybody else," he said. "I seem to own one of everything that comes with a set of wheels."

HEADLINE: Paris Journal;
At Dinner Table, More Than Beef Falls From Grace

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 2

 BODY:
Mad cow disease may be changing menus and habits throughout Europe, but in France, beef is not the only thing that is disappearing from the table.
The French eat less daily bread and not even a quarter of them drink wine daily with meals any more, as their way of life becomes more hurried, more health-conscious, and, well, more like life everywhere else, including the United States. 
 And for all the 70 percent butterfat cheese the French still consume, health consciousness and weight watching have begun to change the way they look at eating meat. Making money used to be known as "earning your beefsteak." No longer.
Marc Nourry, wearing a white apron the other day in his Boucheries Reunies meat market, sees the changes every day. "We've been selling less and less red meat even before the crisis, but since March I've been selling less than half as much beef as I usually did.
"But all kinds of things are very different nowadays -- Sunday used to be our biggest day, but these days most people go away for the weekend, and everybody always seems to be on a diet."
Since Britain set off an international crisis by reporting a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy in British cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which destroys human brain tissue, beef has been piling up in freezers all over Europe. The European Union banned the export of British beef on March 27, but millions of European consumers no longer want beef or veal, no matter where it comes from, according to butchers here who fear the change will be permanent.
Mr. Nourry's meat market is the kind of place you picture when you think of the way people have traditionally done their food shopping in France -- often, still, at open-air markets, with separate stops at the butcher's, the baker's, the greengrocer's and, this being France, the local wine merchant's as well.
But 65 percent of the French buy most of their food in supermarkets these days, though some are having second thoughts, perhaps because they cannot ask a live butcher where the meat comes from.
"I never bought meat in supermarkets, and I wouldn't think of it now," said a customer making her way down the Rue des Belles Feuilles. "At least with butchers we have some guarantee that the meat really isn't British, but at the supermarket, who knows?"
Even before the "mad cow" scare, the French were consuming 17 percent less beef than they were in 1980, and 28 percent less veal, according to statistics gathered by the consumer division of the Finance and Economics Ministry.
But the bottom fell out of the French meat market with the British crisis in March. Since then, wholesale butchers' business has slipped 20 to 50 percent, trade groups say.
Consumption of fish and fowl has been rising here since the late 1980's, along with health awareness, but vegetarianism has not yet become as widespread in France as it is in the United States, despite such famous converts to the cause as Brigitte Bardot.
Even bread isn't sacred in France any more, according to the baking trade. Where the French ate a daily average of 20 ounces of bread per capita in 1960, last year they ate an average of 5 ounces of it.
Women eat even less, an average of barely 4 ounces of bread a day, according to the National Association of French Millers, and often the bread they eat is not the traditional crusty baguette but softer stuff sold prepackaged in supermarkets.
"Bread is a part of our identity," said Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur recently. The baking industry began a campaign last year to encourage more people to eat bread, with the slogan, "If we don't keep eating bread, one day there won't be any more."
At the Bechu Bakery on the Avenue Victor Hugo, where the words on the window advise window shoppers that bread is even better if people actually eat it, customers still line up on Sunday mornings to buy baguettes for lunch, but according to Roland Amon, the owner, "Younger customers buy a lot less than their parents did."
"Bakers are like winemakers -- we all use very simple basic materials, but everybody produces a product that tastes unique," he said. "It's uniformity that will kill us."
But today, if you think the French never sit down to a table without a bottle of wine, even rough vin ordinaire in plastic containers, marketing surveys done by the wine industry say you are wrong. Drinking wine with meals is no longer a daily habit for nearly 80 percent of the French people today. As recently as 1980, it was, for 41 percent of them, according to the Vinexpo Institute, affiliated with the principal wine trade organization in Bordeaux.
And the trend away from wine drinking is even stronger among people under 25, according to a poll of 4,000 people the institute commissioned last year.
Nearly 70 percent of 14- to 25-year-olds surveyed then said they never consumed any wine, compared with 48 percent in 1980, and 87 percent of young non-drinkers said the reason was that they did not like the way wine tastes. Fifteen years ago, nearly a quarter of all 25-year-olds in France said they drank wine regularly with meals. Last year, fewer than 5 percent did.
Colette Barbey, a widow in her 80's who lives in Neuilly, said: "I can't get over how my granddaughter cooks. She will fry a couple of crepes and maybe a bit of ham, with a salad, and call that dinner."
Describing herself as "part of a tradition dating from the 19th century, really," Mrs. Barbey said that family lunches 30 years ago at her house always consisted of four courses. "My husband always wanted a carefully composed meal at fixed hours, and we always had wine."
A survey by the Center for Research on the Study and Observation of Conditions of Life recently showed that 47 percent of the French now eat lunch outside of the home at least once a week. The noontime family meal at home used to be the only one at which meat was served, but the urban way of life of dual-income, commuting families has altered that tradition.
Surprisingly, most said their usual meal was often potatoes and vegetables. Only 5 percent admitted to eating hamburgers at restaurants.
Doing as the French do can have its advantages. According to the International Journal of Obesity, only 6.2 percent of men in France and 6.3 percent of women were classified as obese last year, compared with 32 and 33.5 percent in the United States.

HEADLINE: Mayor Keeps His Distance From New Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani distanced himself yesterday from a report by an advisory board he appointed, which proposed that the city levy a surcharge on hospital fees and insurance premiums to subsidize health insurance for those without it.
Calling the recommendations a "very important beginning" in solving the problem of how to finance health care for the uninsured, the Mayor nevertheless said he was not ready to endorse them. 
 "It's a very thoughtful proposal and has a lot to it," Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall briefing. But he added that he didn't want to be "locked into one way" of providing and paying for health care for the indigent.
Although the panel has been studying indigent care since August, the Mayor referred to its plan as a beginning and a vehicle for encouraging debate. Even though his chief health policy adviser, Maria K. Mitchell, headed the task force, he stopped short of embracing its findings.
"There's no one naive enough to think that this plan will get through in this form," Mr. Giuliani said.
The plan would involve a fundamental departure from the way the city now pays for medical care for people who don't have insurance, in which hospitals that treat them are subsidized and reimbursed.
The seven-member panel called the current system fragmented and inefficient, offering little incentive for people to seek primary care and forcing the uninsured to rely on emergency rooms.
The plan, which would subsidize insurance for 900,000 of the city's 1.5 million uninsured residents, would cost $1.5 billion annually. Most of the money would come from a 2 percent tax on the fees of hospitals and insurers. The rest would come from the state charity fund that now subsidizes hospitals treating the poor and from savings projected from the moving of Medicaid recipients into managed care plans.
Several administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the Mayor's reluctance to embrace the plan stemmed from fear of the political repercussions if he supported a new tax.
"Call it what you want," said one City Hall official, "an assessment, a surcharge, whatever. It's a tax and taxes are not popular." Mr. Giuliani is expected to seek re-election next year.
The advisory panel's proposals drew mixed reactions from politicians and workers in the health care industry. While expressing pleasure that the group had focused attention on the question of how to help the uninsured, many analysts were doubtful about the financing proposals and their support among legislators and health care providers. They also said they were not sure how this plan could be reconciled with a proposal by Gov. George E. Pataki to overhaul the financing of hospital care, which would include an end to the state's setting of hospital rates.
"We're glad there's a recognition here that a system to protect the indigent needs to be set up," said Michael Clendenin, a City Council spokesman. "But we're going to have to take a harder look at the financing. Who would really be paying the tax? It's easy to assume it will be passed down to the consumer."
In a clear sign that Ms. Mitchell was working hard to encourage industry support of the plan, she invited the directors of two leading health care trade organizations to join her at the City Hall news conference: Kenneth Raske, executive director of the Greater New York Hospital Association, and Stephen I. Lewis, first senior vice president of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York and chairman of the New York State H.M.O. Council.
"It makes good economic sense and good health sense to re-enfranchise this disenfranchised population," Mr. Lewis said.
Mr. Raske called the report "an enormous leap forward as a statement." But financing it, he said, remains "a vexing issue for all of us."
Like the Mayor, Mr. Raske referred to the plan as a starting point; he called it a blueprint and a springboard. And he, too, stopped short of endorsing its recommendations for raising the necessary revenues.
Bill Gradison, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group in Washington, said he supported subsidizing health insurance for people who cannot afford it because it allowed people to get health care in appropriate settings: primary care in doctors' offices and clinics, and hospitalization when necessary.
But he said that taxing insurance premiums "would be counterproductive," because it would force insurers to raise premiums and would encourage employers to cut back workers' health insurance coverage.
One thing left unsaid in the report is how the plan would work if the administration succeeded in dissolving the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency that runs the city's 11 acute-care hospitals. In a report it issued in August, this advisory panel called on the city to dismantle the agency and sell off all the public hospitals, which each year serve hundreds of thousands of poor and uninsured New Yorkers.
John Ronches, executive director of the Committee of Interns and Residents, which represents the doctors-in-training who provide most of the front-line care at the city's public hospitals, criticized the panel's proposals, saying the public hospital system met the needs of the indigent "most efficiently and cheaply."

HEADLINE: Can Nashville Say No to N.F.L. Team? Maybe

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, April 30

 BODY:
For nearly a decade now, the status-hungry boomtowns of the South have sought instant membership in the major leagues through the relentless recruitment of professional sports teams. And in city after city, local governments have raided their treasuries to build expensive new stadiums, with barely a peep of protest from the taxpayers.
Now it is Nashville's turn. But unlike Charlotte (home to the N.F.L.'s Panthers and the N.B.A.'s Hornets) and Jacksonville (N.F.L.'s Jaguars) and Orlando (N.B.A.'s Magic) and St. Petersburg (where baseball's Devil Rays will play in 1998), a surprising degree of resistance has risen here to a May 7 referendum on building a publicly financed football stadium that would bring the Houston Oilers to middle Tennessee in 1998. 
 The anti-stadium movement has been stoked, leaders on both sides of the debate say, by an underlying sentiment that Nashville is growing too quickly. Although studies suggest that professional football would have negligible direct impact on the city's economy, many here see it as a symbol for progress that is not universally embraced.
After being repeatedly thwarted in efforts to get Houston to build a stadium to replace the aging Astrodome, the Oilers last year began making overtures to Nashville, the second-largest television market without a professional sports team.
No city without an N.F.L. franchise has ever rejected a team's offer to locate there.
But the Nashville referendum, said Mayor Philip Bredesen, has become "almost a cultural vote," not unlike the 1967 referendum that approved the sale of liquor by the drink.
"On one side are people who just really like the way Nashville was 20 years ago as a somewhat isolated, genteel Southern city," said Mr. Bredesen, who is leading the campaign to lure the Oilers. "And on the other side you've got people that want to be more like Jacksonville and Charlotte and Indianapolis and some of those kinds of frontline, growing cities."
Even if the referendum passes -- and a recent poll suggests that it will -- Nashville's anti-stadium heretics have managed to mount a challenge to the pro-growth theology preached so energetically by Sunbelt mayors and Chamber of Commerce officials.
After the Metro Council approved the $292 million stadium construction and team relocation plan earlier this year, opponents gathered 43,600 signatures on petitions in 20 days, more than enough to force a referendum. In the last two months, the anti-stadium forces have waged a spirited, David-versus-Goliath battle against the city's political and corporate establishment.
The coalition of opponents includes libertarians, who believe that government should play no role in financing the stadium, and liberals, who believe the city's money would be better spent on social programs. "It's not an appropriate priority for public funding," said David L. Kleinfelter, a member of the Metro Council. "We are not in a period when we need economic stimulation."
The stadium fight has been emotional. During a televised town hall meeting on Monday night, an audience member essentially told Michael McClure, the Oilers' executive vice president, that he was not welcome in town. After the event, a stadium proponent rejected a handshake offered by Mr. Kleinfelter.
Some families are deeply divided. Whenever Councilman Durward G. Hall has appeared on talk radio to explain his opposition to the deal, his son, Daron, has phoned in to tell him he is wrong. Mr. Hall's wife, Gayle, has planted a pro-stadium sign in their front yard.
"Will you be a witness at my divorce?" Mr. Hall asked in an interview.
Few would have thought such a brawl would break out in Nashville. Despite the renaissance of country music, it remains a triple-A town whose leaders are desperate to broaden their city's one-dimensional image and keep pace with the region's other aspiring Atlantas.
"This is a way for us to get noticed as something other than a small town with good country music," said Dick Darr, the chairman of Yes for Nashville, the pro-stadium campaign committee.
If the referendum fails, Oilers officials say they will take their team elsewhere. N.F.L. owners approved the move to Nashville this week.
The referendum is needed to approve the sale of $80 million in general obligation bonds for construction of the 67,000-seat stadium. The city's total contribution to the project would be about $150 million. The rest of the cost would be covered with state money and proceeds from the sale of licenses that permit fans to purchase season tickets.
Mr. Bredesen estimates that the city's annual debt service payments would be $8 million, less than 1 percent of its $900 million budget. Half of that amount would be collected by tapping surpluses amassed by Nashville's water utility, which charges some of the highest rates in the country. The rest would come from existing tax revenues.
Interestingly, Mr. Bredesen and Mr. Darr do not base their arguments for the referendum on the contention that professional football would inject millions of dollars into the local economy.
"I agree with the professors who say you can't justify building a stadium just on the direct economic benefits," Mr. Bredesen said, referring to numerous studies pointing out that professional sports primarily generate low-wage, part-time jobs. "It's a piece of it."
But in addition, Mr. Bredesen said, a pro team would help enhance the city's national presence, attract new businesses, keep young people from leaving town, and spur development of the east bank of the Cumberland River, where the stadium would be built. That area has long been an eyesore, dominated by aging factories, rusting barges and huge pyramids of sand.
Stadium opponents argue that public money should not be used to enrich a wealthy Texan, Bud Adams, the Oilers' owner. But they also pose questions about traffic and taxes and misplaced priorities in a metropolitan area where road and bridge and school construction has struggled to keep pace with 27-percent population growth over the last 15 years.
During that period, nonfarm employment in the eight-county metropolitan area has grown 65 percent. Violent crime in Nashville, while down 2 percent in the last year, is up 121 percent since 1980. The public school population, up 11 percent since 1985, has grown out of its buildings and now relies on 476 portable classrooms. Traffic flow on Nashville's interstates has increased by 40 percent in 10 years.
With the heavy support of downtown businesses, the Yes for Nashville organization has raised $399,000 in cash and another $60,000 in in-kind contributions. That is more than 20 times the money collected by Concerned Citizens for Nashville, the anti-stadium committee.
The pro-stadium group has advertised on television and radio and in newspapers, distributed 30,000 yard signs, made 16,000 phone calls and sent out three mailings. The anti-stadium group is so poor that it has asked volunteers to pick up postcards at headquarters and mail them at their own expense.
A poll published in The Tennessean this week showed that 56 percent of the 636 likely voters surveyed said they would vote for the referendum, with 34 percent opposed and 10 percent undecided.
But officials with both campaigns agree that anti-stadium voters are more committed to their cause and predicted that the vote would be closer than indicated by the poll.
And Mr. McClure, the Oilers vice president, said his team's history demonstrates the folly of predicting victory too early.
"Remember, I work for a football team that blew a 30-point lead not so long ago," he said, referring to the Oilers' second-half, 32-point collapse in its 1993 playoff game against Buffalo. "So I never feel comfortable until the final gun goes off."

HEADLINE: Victims Can Sue Gun Makers Over Sales, Judge Rules

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
In a novel Federal ruling, a judge in New York has held that victims of handgun violence may proceed with a lawsuit against the firearms industry to discover whether it failed to take adequate steps to prevent weapon sales to illegal buyers like teen-agers.
The ruling was announced in March by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn and elaborated on in court papers filed yesterday. It comes at the early stage of a lawsuit brought against 47 weapons producers by the families of two New Yorkers killed by handguns. 
 The decision also opens the doors for plaintiffs' lawyers to delve into the files of the world's biggest firearms companies to learn whether the industry has been negligent in preventing weapons from flowing into the vast illegal market for guns.
In the past, gun producers have been successfully sued for selling defective weapons and dealers have also been held responsible for selling their guns to illegal buyers, like people who were drunk. But several legal experts said the current case appeared to be the first that involves the industry's marketing practices.
"This is the first case that I'm aware of where someone has tried to hold the industry collectively liable," said Dennis Henigan of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, an advocacy group in Washington.
Under the Federal law, gun manufacturers distribute their weapons through dealers who are licensed by the Government to sell firearms. Still, a vast underground market for weapons has existed for years, often supplied by those who buy guns illegally or legally in states that have lax gun control laws for resale in places with tighter controls.
Richard Feldman, the executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, a trade group based in Atlanta, said gun makers complied with all rules and regulations established by Congress and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, the Federal agency that oversees the gun industry.
"After a consumer purchases our product, we have no control over what happens to that product," Mr. Feldman added.
Still, the New York lawsuit comes at a time of mounting legal pressure against gun producers. Last year, a California state judge ruled that relatives and victims of a 1993 shooting that left seven people dead and six wounded in San Francisco could proceed with a lawsuit against Navegar, which produced the assault-style weapon used in the attack.
Last week, the owner of the Nevada pawn shop that legally sold the weapon used in those shootings reached a out-of-court settlement with plaintiffs, Mr. Henigan said.
The New York case was brought on behalf on the families of Njuzi Ray and David Johnstone, who were killed in separate shootings with legally obtained weapons. While Judge Weinstein denied efforts to turn the case into a class action, he has allowed plaintiffs lawyers to bring up to 28 more additional shooting victims into the case.
Elisa Barnes, a lawyer who represents the families of the two victims, said it was her intention to prove that gun manufacturers were aware of a booming illegal market for guns but did not take adequate steps to prevent illegal sales, like limiting the production of handguns.
"Their negligence is that they failed to distribute their products carefully," Ms. Barnes said. Manufacturers have denied the charge.
In March, Judge Weinstein initially denied a motion by manufacturers' lawyers to dismiss the case and ruled that it could proceed to trial, which is tentatively set for September. The court papers spelled out the reasons for his decision. Judge Weinstein noted, for example, that while firearms companies had pledged to sell weapons only to legitimate licensed retailers, the pledge did not appear to bind manufacturers to make sure that their distributors also adhered to it.
"At the heart of the plaintiff's theory, apparently, is the claim that defendant's negligence in methods of marketing handguns and flooding the handgun market has fostered the development of an extensive underground economy in handguns," Judge Weinstein wrote.
He also theorized that if the underlying cause of handgun violence was the growth of an illegal weapons market, then an appellate court might decide to divide responsibility among gun producers based on their share of the legal gun market.
Mr. Feldman, the trade group official, said he expected manufacturers to move again to have the case thrown out before it goes to trial.
"People are looking in the wrong direction by trying to use civil liability to solve a criminal problem," he said.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin's Bold, Risky Welfare Plan

 BODY:
Gov. Tommy Thompson has signed far-reaching legislation that, if he gets Washington's approval, would make Wisconsin the first state to end its welfare program. Under the law, the state would instantly stop giving cash aid to able-bodied applicants. Instead they would be put to work in private-sector jobs, subsidized if need be, or in community-service jobs.
There is much to admire in Wisconsin's forthright emphasis on work and support services. Mr. Thompson is one of the few Republican leaders who acknowledges the fact that welfare reform is expensive. The plan will initially exceed Wisconsin's current welfare expenditures by about $40 million a year, or 13 percent. The program would provide generous health and child-care subsidies to all working-poor families, not just those on welfare. That way welfare parents would no longer face the loss of these key benefits when they find work. The plan would also allow mothers to keep most of the child-support payments that are made by absent fathers. Individuals who are incapable of holding steady jobs could receive ongoing support for engaging in limited work and rehabilitation activities. 
 But there are troublesome provisions that are most easily seen by comparing the Wisconsin plan with President Clinton's welfare proposal. Mr. Clinton would have allowed welfare parents to spend up to two years in training or education programs. The Wisconsin plan provides for no training that is separated from work. This may steer some parents from intensive literacy and other needed training.
Mr. Clinton's plan would have imposed a two-year time limit on cash benefits, after which parents who obeyed the rules would be given a public-sector job if they could not find work on their own. The Wisconsin plan would impose no time limits on health or child-care benefits. But it would set a time limit of five years on job subsidies, without any commitment to extend the limit for parents -- perhaps half of those who start out in subsidized jobs -- who obeyed the rules but could not find unsubsidized work.
Mr. Thompson points out that, under his plan, the state would have the leeway of extending job subsidies beyond five years on a case-by-case basis. Guarantees, he says, muffle the welfare parent's incentive to find work and invite endless judicial challenge. That may be so. But his proposal exposes innocent children to risk. The record of states in creating public service jobs is poor. What happens when Wisconsin ends aid not tied to work, but fails to create the 40,000 jobs it might take to empty out its welfare rolls? What happens if Wisconsin's economy turns sour and the state cannot find money to cover health benefits for needy families?
Mr. Clinton's best response is to embrace the good parts of the Wisconsin plan without embracing all of its risks. He should insist that the plan be phased in slowly so that, for example, welfare benefits of large families would not, as proposed, be cut quickly. Wisconsin should be required to monitor its programs and publicize how many needy parents are thrown out of subsidized work. Mr. Clinton should also require a concrete commitment from Wisconsin that it will spend whatever it takes to provide the benefits it has promised.
Mr. Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it" -- with its ironclad job offer for parents who obey welfare rules -- is better than Wisconsin's pledge to end welfare, period. But Mr. Clinton can nevertheless embrace Wisconsin's right to experiment as long as he insists that the state smooth the plan's harshest edges.

HEADLINE: Giuliani to Propose New Agency To Get Around Borrowing Limits

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will propose the creation of a public authority that would allow New York City to sidestep a state constitutional limit on the city's debt, increasing the amount of money the city could borrow to build or repair everything from schools to bridges, senior officials said yesterday.
The Mayor's aides insisted that they did not want to borrow more money immediately because of the city's nagging fiscal woes. In fact, they said, Mr. Giuliani would announce a $1 billion reduction in construction spending -- a 9 percent cut -- over the next four years when he unveils the capital budget today. 
 By proposing the new authority, however, the Mayor and his aides said they were creating a vehicle that could ultimately provide an enormous infusion of cash to repair the city's crumbling schools and build new ones. And that, they said, would give them room for negotiation with the City Council, whose Democratic leaders have vowed to make spending for school construction a make-or-break issue in this year's budget fight.
The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has proposed extending the city's temporary surcharge on the personal income tax -- used to pay for 6,000 new police officers since 1993 -- to raise $1.4 billion for school construction over the next four years. And Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson said yesterday that Mr. Vallone's idea had provided "a good seed" for the Mayor's proposal. But he added that the authority could raise even more capital dollars for schools and other projects without having to extend the tax surcharge, scheduled to expire in December.
"It allows us to do everything he had in mind," Mr. Dyson said.
Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, responded cautiously, saying the Mayor's proposal did not in itself set aside the money that would be needed to rebuild the city's schools. "We're still missing a major infusion of school funds," Mr. Clendenin said, "but we'll work with them on it."
The proposed agency, to be called the New York City Infrastructure Financing Authority, would have the ability to raise billions of dollars for construction projects by selling bonds that would be repaid over a period of up to 30 years with a dedicated stream of revenues from the city's personal income tax, rather with money from the general coffer.
The authority, which would require the approval of the State Legislature, would thus greatly expand and broaden the city's means of borrowing money for capital projects at a time when it has virtually exhausted its ability to take on added debt under the limit established by the state's Constitution when it was last revised in 1937.
The debt limit, by law, restricts the city's outstanding general obligation debt to 10 percent of the city's full taxable value of real estate. It was included in the state's Constitution as a way to prohibit cities and counties from borrowing more money than they could realistically afford. For most localities, real estate property taxes are by far the largest source of revenue. But New York City collects a large portion of its revenue from income and business taxes.
Since the economic downturn that began in the late 1980's, New York City's property values have fallen drastically. That essentially lowered the limit even as the city scrambled to try to catch up on capital improvements to bridges, subways and other public works that had been deferred during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
The Mayor's budget director, Joseph J. Lhota, said that if the city continued to pay for capital construction projects at the current rate, it would reach the state's limit by fiscal year 1998 and exceed it by $900 million and then $2 billion in the fiscal years that follow.
The Mayor has cut spending on capital projects significantly since taking office nearly two and a half years ago. Officials said the Mayor would propose still more cuts in the capital budget unveiled today. That would help the city avoid hitting the debt limit and also reduce the spiraling costs of paying interest and principal on the city's outstanding debt, which now totals $25 billion.
"We are being hamstrung by our debt limit," Mr. Lhota said.
The state's limit applies to outstanding bonds -- or general obligation debt -- that are paid off from the city's general tax revenues. Since the city would repay bonds issued by the proposed authority with dedicated tax revenue, the authority's debt would not be subject to the limits.
The city's bond raters also responded cautiously. Robert A. Kurtter, vice president of Moody's Investors Service, said that the proposal clearly allowed the city to sidestep the debt limit but that the city would also need to find ways to pay for essential capital costs. He said it remained to be seen whether the Mayor would use the new authority to borrow more money and add still more costs in interest payments to an already strained budget.
"The city has a dilemma," Mr. Kurtter said. "They can't afford to borrow more, and they can't afford not to borrow more."
Richard J. Raphael, the executive managing director of Fitch Investors Services, another of the city's bond raters, expressed similar concerns, adding that the authority could prove an enticing way to greatly increase borrowing, even if the Mayor's aides are promising no immediate increase.
"We would be concerned if this type of financing vehicle, to the extent that it can bypass the debt limit, is an opening of the floodgates," Mr. Raphael said.
Under the Mayor's proposal, the new financing authority would raise money not only for schools, but also for bridges, highways, tunnels, ferries and mass transit. Last week, the Mayor reached an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide $500 million over four years for improvements to the city's subways and buses, in exchange for $250 million in cash.
Although Mr. Giuliani plans to announce a reduction in capital spending, the city's Board of Education is the only agency that does not face a cut in its capital budget, which totals $2.6 billion over four years.
Although he has not proposed a cut, the Mayor has responded tepidly to Mr. Vallone's proposal to use the income tax surcharge to pay for a significant increase in school construction, saying he did not believe the Board of Education would spend the money efficiently.
The Mayor and his aides suggested that the crucial factor would be how and by whom any school construction projects would be managed.
If the authority became a vehicle to provide new money for schools, the Mayor and the Council could restore a portion of the proposed reduction in capital projects and still reduce the city's overall total capital budget. The savings from that overall cut could replace the lost income from the personal income tax that would be needed to repay the bonds.
Mr. Lhota said the authority would simply supplement the city's current financing power and give the city flexibility to move ahead with projects in areas like education and mass transit. "There's no way we can impair moving forward with these basic governmental services," Mr. Lhota said.

HEADLINE: Orange County Creditors Said To Accept Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2

 BODY:
The largest municipal bankruptcy in United States history neared a conclusion today with the announcement that the creditors of Orange County, Calif., appeared to have accepted a recovery plan.
Lawyers involved in the lengthy negotiations said that an informal tally of ballots filed by all the county's creditors, from bondholders to suppliers of office products, showed that they had approved the plan. That makes it likely, the lawyers said, that the Federal bankruptcy court would accept the plan at a hearing scheduled for May 15. The final count of the ballots will be ready on Monday or Tuesday, the lawyers said. 
 If the plan is accepted, the county is expected to emerge from bankruptcy at the end of June, nearly 19 months after huge losses in the county's investment portfolio caused a crisis that rattled the financial markets and pushed the largely affluent county, south of Los Angeles, into bankruptcy protection.
"Our count, based on a pretty careful look, is that when the final tally is completed, all classes of creditors will have accepted this plan," said Bruce Bennett, the county's lead bankruptcy lawyer. "I have no doubt that the court will then accept this plan."
Robert Moore, a lawyer representing the county's creditors, said he was pleased with the news, but remained cautious. "We believe this is a giant step forward," he said. "This is not the last hurdle in the race, but it is a good sign."
The substantial remaining step for Orange County is to sell about $800 million in new bonds to repay some of its existing creditors. That sale, which is expected to go ahead in the next few weeks, was virtually assured, investment bankers said, when the county received a form of insurance from a leading municipal-securities insurer, MBIA, this week.
Jan M. Mittermeier, the county's chief executive, said: "Although we don't have the official count of the creditors' acceptance of the county's plan, I am extremely delighted to hear the results of the preliminary tally. This is another important step along the path of our emergence from bankruptcy."
Initially, there had been concern that the financial shock of December 1994 could affect the municipal-securities markets for years. But the county's bankruptcy seems to have had a less drastic general impact, though it has earned huge sums for the lawyers involved and has taken a big bite out of social programs for many poorer people among the county's 2.6 million residents.
The bankruptcy was prompted by an estimated $1.6 billion in losses from a $7.4 billion investment fund run by Orange County's former treasurer, Robert L. Citron. The fund, actually a pool of money from numerous local government agencies and cities as well as from the county itself, was heavily invested in derivatives, fast-moving speculative securities that plummeted in value when interest rates shot up through much of 1994.
Since the collapse, the participants in the pool have received most of their money back. School districts got about 90 cents of each dollar invested; other agencies and municipalities received about 80 cents.
The county has filed suit against its lead securities broker, Merrill Lynch & Company, seeking more than $2 billion in damages. The agencies in the pool are to receive the rest of their money from anything the county might win in that suit, which Merrill Lynch is contesting.
The investors in county bonds and notes will receive all their money, plus interest, if the plan goes through and the new bonds are sold.
But there has been a cost. The county slashed about $180 million from its general budget almost overnight -- a cut of roughly 40 percent -- taking a big bite out of many programs for the poor. The county laid off more than 1,000 employees.
In addition, to repay its bondholders, the county is diverting a total of about $18 million a year from its transportation agency and from programs for parks, harbors, beaches and flood control.
But the economy is again growing, and with the recovery plan, the government is likely to begin to rebuild.
The sale of the new bonds could close on June 30, and the county may formally emerge from bankruptcy that day.

HEADLINE: South Africa Losing Battle to House Homeless

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: DIEPSLOOT, South Africa

 BODY:
A year ago, when Maureen Mkhize was brought to this field north of Johannesburg and given a spot for her shack, she was told she would have real housing within six months. Since then, hundreds of families have joined her -- brought here by the truckload from sordid urban squatter settlements, the flimsy bits of their old shacks dumped beside them so they can rebuild.
As far as the eye can see in a vacant section of this black township, small white stones mark off thousands of future plots. There are tractors busy making dirt roads in a grid pattern, and portable toilets and barrels of drinking water are set up at regular intervals. 
 Johannesburg officials insist on calling the development, known as Plot 139, a "temporary emergency measure." But there are no plans for improving it, and it looks like a slum in the making.
In its heady early days, President Nelson Mandela's Government promised 1 million new homes within five years. The political stakes could hardly be higher. South Africa has eight million homeless people, almost all of whom are black, live without running water, electricity or even chemical toilets, and vote for Mr. Mandela's African National Congress.
Two years later, only 11,000 houses have been built, and 23,000 more are under construction. Mrs. Mkhize, an enterprising grandmother whose arthritis cost her a job as a maid, no longer expects to leave her shack soon. She is hoeing the weeds from a bit of ground near a future bus stop where she hopes to put up a fruit stall. Plot 139 is far from anywhere she can find work -- but it's also far from any supermarkets for her new neighbors.
In some ways, the Government's housing plans were novel, a rejection of American and European models. Rather than build large scale housing projects, it wanted to give families up to $4,000 each, then help them get bank mortgages so they could own their own homes. Thus far, the idea is a failure.
Studies blame everyone from inept government bureaucrats processing applications to bankers and building contractors who refuse to cooperate because profit margins are low and they think the poor won't pay their debts. Refusing to pay rent and electric bills was a common way of protesting apartheid, and many have not lost the habit.
"The Government expects the private sector to solve all the problems," said Lance Edmunds, a spokesman for the Council of South African Banks. "But 45 percent of the population is unemployed. You can't expect the private sector to take all the risk."
William J. Cobbett, director of the Government housing program, says he still believes in the plan but that he's "fine-tuning" it -- offering banks guarantees against losses, considering building rental housing or simply buying wood, cement and tin for the poor and telling them to build their own homes.
Some housing experts sneer that this is just an echo of the apartheid Government's "toilets on the veld" policy -- a return to the days when blacks were given land in the middle of nowhere with a few water lines installed. They want the Government to do more.
"The starting point of the present policy is wrong," said Odette Geldenhaus, a housing expert at Witwatersrand University's Center for Applied Legal Studies. "You can't rely on the private sector here. There is no profit margin. The state has to play a bigger role. They have to start building housing."
The cities, meanwhile, are drowning in squatters like Mrs. Mhkize. For decades, they lived in shacks in black townships like Soweto, often paying huge rents to the occupants of the tiny government-owned houses who let them build in the yard. But in the late 1980's, when the Government stopped rigorously enforcing apartheid, thousands began slipping into the white cities, squatting on any vacant patch. Thousands more came in from rural areas.
In Johannesburg, there may be 250,000 people living in downtown parking lots, near highways, beside garbage dumps, on the banks of flooding rivers or on unstable mounds of mine tailings. Many have invaded land intended for low-income housing.
As a result, courts have ordered evictions, shacks have been burned, and groups of poor families have fought pitched battles over who will get housing, if it is ever built. Driven out, the squatters are constantly on the move. "Reception areas" like Plot 139 are being created to break that cycle.
"We are simply trying to respond to the crisis," said Tshepiso Mashinini, Johannesburg's director of urbanization. "While we have been busy transforming the national and local governments, the problem of housing did not stop growing. This just may give us some time."
But even some Government officials admit privately that vast squatter camps far from any job possibilities are potential disaster areas. "They are a very ugly business," said one who declined give his name. "They are simply a dumping ground for people the Government doesn't know what to do with. "
The irony is that many squatters like the arrangement. Years of living in fear that the police will evict them are over.
"If you are landless and homeless, then 80 square meters that you can stay on with toilets and water might seem pretty good," said Lindsay Bremner, who heads the urbanization committee of the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council.
Mavis Moyo feels that way. The police tore down her last shack beside a highway in Bryanston, a rich suburb. Since then, she's been collecting wood for a new one. But when she was dumped here recently, she didn't have enough timber. She plans to use plastic tarpaulins to cover holes and make a roof. Even when she realized that the ground was full of termites, she only shrugged.
"I am happy today," she said, looking over the bleak landscape as at a promised land. "The Government is trying. There are too many of us."
Squatter settlements here hardly resemble the camps of the homeless under bridges or in parks in American cities. These squatters are not mentally ill or alcoholics or drug addicts. The settlements are usually collections of 30 to 300 families. One adult per household usually has at least part-time work, but at wages far too low to buy a house.
The camps are usually highly organized, with a leader and a rule-making committee. A camp called Newtown in downtown Johannesburg taxes every resident 25 cents a week for security and pays it to whomever stands sentry on weekends.
On the outside, the shacks are untidy looking heaps, built of scraps of wood, tin and plastic, but inside they are often meticulously maintained. Beds are curtained off with lace, mismatched dishes are neatly arranged on planks serving as kitchen counters, walls are carefully papered with newspaper.
But the new camps will bring together squatters from many different sites. There have already been clashes between factions.
Many of those taken to Plot 139 went unwillingly. Some had a week's warning that trucks would come for them. But none knew that they would be taken here, about a half hour from downtown and miles from the white suburbs where they had worked.
For the first two nights, Paulina Mashebe and her six children slept on strips of carpet around an open fire. By the third day her husband had largely rebuilt their shack. It had gone slowly because, although he had carefully saved all the nails when they were evicted, he had had to straighten the bent ones.
Mrs. Mashebe, who had been chased from five previous sites, was relieved to have permanence at last. But as she scanned the horizon, she sighed. As the family's only wage-earner, she makes about $180 a month. Her boss used to send the truck to pick her up. But he won't come this far and she now faces travel costs of $50 a month.
"When they came for us," she said, "I said no, we could not move. But they said we had to. There was no choice."

HEADLINE: Upbeat Data On Economy Hurt Markets

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Already in a jumpy mood, investors sent stock and bond prices tumbling yesterday after they were spooked by another report that showed the economy is stronger than was expected earlier this year.
The resulting selloff sent long-term interest rates over 7 percent for the first time in a year while the Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 100 points before closing at 5,498.27, down 76.95 points. 
 The main villain yesterday was the Commerce Department's report that the economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate during the first quarter of the year. That pace exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts by private economists and exacerbated fears of an overheating economy.
Although the market rout was less severe, it was similar to the two that followed the release of unexpectedly strong employment reports for February and March. The report for April is due today.
While the one-day tumble added to the volatility that has characterized the stock market this year, the drop was not dramatic in percentage terms, shaving just slightly more than one percentage point off the Dow. "With bonds down almost 1 3/4 points and a 7 percent yield, the market could have been off 250 points," said Peter Anderson, senior vice president for investments for the American Express Financial Corporation. "It could have been a lot worse."
While strong growth can translate to higher corporate profits, which makes every stock investor happy by causing stocks to rise, investors are always on the lookout for the possibility of renewed inflation and higher interest rates. Inflation makes corporate profits look less impressive, while higher rates serve as a brake on the overall economy and can draw money away from the stock market.
Because financial markets tend to reflect investors' judgments about which force will prevail, growth that is perceived to be too fast can be seen as a threat to rising stocks.
"The market likes a little bit of good economic news but can't take too much of it," said Arnold Kaufman, the editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter. Yesterday's market drop represented "a little indigestion in this trade-off between earnings and interest rates," he said.
Investors most worried about inflation seemed to prevail yesterday. Even the hot Nasdaq composite index, which is composed mostly of smaller stocks and had been up about 14 percent this year, fell almost 2 percent. Only a few selected stocks -- those that directly benefit from a humming economy, like Intel or Caterpillar -- were left unscathed.
Contributing to the market's recent volatility is a muddy economic picture. It is anybody's guess about the economy's ultimate direction, and investors looking for guidance have found little in recent months. Earlier in the year, for example, some market analysts were predicting a recession. "It's been amazing how many people have been wrong about the economy this year," said Peter Canelo, a market strategist for NatWest Securities. "This finally puts an end to the silly idea that we're heading into a recession."
Current concerns are now focused on whether the Federal Reserve, in reaction to signs of nascent inflation -- like rising commodity prices and a strong economy -- will decide to raise short-term interest rates and bring everything to a halt, just as it did two years ago. Most forecasters think the Fed is unlikely to do so. "We do not see pressure developing on interest rates," said Alfred Goldman, the chief investment strategist for A. G. Edwards.
"The probability of an interest rate hike between now and November is minimal," agreed Mr. Canelo, who said the Fed did not have enough evidence to raise short-term interest rates right now and would rather not do so in an election year. He argued that the economy was clearly not as strong as it was in 1994.
But there is clearly some anxiety among investors that the Fed, which has been aggressive in its aim to tame inflation, might raise short-term rates anyway. "The Fed has tightened in election years," said David Schulman, the managing director of investment strategy for Salomon Brothers, who noted the Fed raised rates in both 1984 and 1988. While Salomon is not forecasting an increase in rates at the end of this year or in early 1997, Mr. Schulman thinks the market is factoring in the possibility of a quarter-percent increase.
The next economic report that could push interest rates higher and stocks lower is today's April employment report from the Labor Department. While Mr. Schulman thinks the report will be a nonevent unless job growth is negative or exceeds 200,000, investors will be examining it carefully for signs of how the economy appears to be faring.
If all the ingredients for a bull market -- low interest rates and benign inflation -- continue, investors should have little to worry about. But no one is expecting anybody to relax. Even Mr. Goldman, who considers yesterday's drop "a buying opportunity," acknowledges investors should be prepared for the bumpy ride to continue. While the volatility in the stock market is closer to its historical average, it is a sharp reminder that 1995 is unlikely to be repeated. "Last year was a one-way parade up," Mr. Goldman said.
While there are few strategists willing to bet that there is a ferocious bear market in the future, some are less than bullish about the market's possibilities, especially if long-term interest rates do not stabilize or start to head down once anxieties over the economy have been resolved. Since investors tend to move toward bonds or even money-market instruments when yields begin to increase, there could continue to be selling.
"It's been a while since the stock market looked at a 7 percent bond," noted Mr. Schulman. He predicted a choppy market with a downside draft that would leave the Dow somewhere around 5300, roughly 4 percent lower than yesterday but still 4 percent higher than where it started the year.
Fears of higher interest rates depressed financial stocks. Merrill Lynch fell 2 3/4, to 57 7/8; Freddie Mac fell 3 7/8, to 79 1/8; J. P. Morgan declined 1 5/8, to 82 7/8; Nationsbank lost 2 1/2, to 77 1/2, and American Express dropped 1 1/4, to 47 1/4.
Telephone stocks also came under pressure. Among the declinerss were AT&T, down 1 1/8, to 59 3/8; MCI, down 1 3/8, to 28 1/4; Nynex, down 1, to 47 5/8; Bell Atlantic, down 1 3/4, to 63, and BellSouth, down 1 3/4, to 38 1/8.
Among the stocks that bucked the downtrend was Sun Microsystems, up 1 3/8, to 57, as it continued to gain strength from investor optimism about its Java programming language.
And Quantum Health Resources rose 1 3/4, to 16 1/4, after Olsten announced Wednesday evening that it would buy Quantum Health for about $273.3 million in stock. Olsten's shares fell 1 7/8, to 29 1/8.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY REVIVED AT PACE OF 2.8% IN FIRST QUARTER

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The economy sprang back to life in the first quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said today, growing at an annual rate of 2.8 percent after practically coming to a halt at the end of 1995. The Clinton Administration quickly took credit for reviving an economic expansion that once seemed about to expire.
The growth, which exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts by private economists, was strong enough that it immediately complicated the Presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole. The presumptive Republican nominee and his supporters, citing the anemic growth rate of five-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter of last year, have been talking about the arrival of "the Clinton crunch," blaming higher taxes and government regulation for extinguishing economic growth. 
 And the gain -- which would have been even greater, economists said, had it not been for the January blizzard in the East and a strike at General Motors in March -- suggested that further advances were likely this spring and summer.
But what was good news to the White House was sobering to investors, who feared that the quickening of the economy posed a threat of higher inflation, rising interest rates and a tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. In the bond market, traders dumped existing bonds, pushing interest rates on long-term Treasury securities to more than 7 percent for the first time in a year. On Wall Street, where investors feared that higher rates might make stocks less attractive, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 77 points to close at 5,575.22. [Page D1.]
The 2.8 percent estimate issued today, an "advance" figure that is subject to revision up or down in coming months, was fueled by a 12 percent surge in the rate of investment by businesses, including a jump of nearly 50 percent in the pace of computer purchases. Consumer spending also soared after a slow Christmas, increasing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. The only negative news was a great slowing in exports and a surge in imports. (All the figures are adjusted to try to eliminate the effects of inflation and seasonal variations.)
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of the White House's National Economic Council, called the revival of growth "more evidence that the President's economic strategy is paying off."
Mr. Dole's advisers declined to speak for attribution, but one of his economic strategists speculated that the figures would further force the Dole campaign to focus on issues of character, leadership and experience, rather than critiques of Mr. Clinton's economic record. For their part, Mr. Clinton's strategists said that while the signs of a reviving economy built a solid foundation for the campaign, they were hardly a guarantee at the polls in an era of job insecurity.
So just hours after members of the Administration paraded out to take credit for the economy's continued strength, Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary -- who has been used frequently to test themes for Mr. Clinton -- argued that the Administration now had to focus on workers left in the wake of economic transition.
"Even if we can't supply job security, we can supply some economic security," he said in pressing the Administration's agenda of tax credits for college tuition and worker training, among other programs. "There is still good reason for all that anxiety out there."
As one Administration official said today, explaining the strategy of talking about corporate downsizing and economic growth in the same breath: "If you only do good news and ignore the bad news, it just doesn't sound credible."
While today's numbers are extraordinarily good compared with expectations -- Merrill Lynch & Company, along with many other forecasters, predicted only a 1.5 percent annual growth rate for the quarter -- they are not particularly remarkable when viewed against other economic advances since World War II. And the figures still leave room for Mr. Dole and others to argue, as the conservative Heritage Foundation has recently, that more than a million new jobs would have been created and employee wages would be significantly higher had the Democrats not pushed through a tax bill three years ago.
But that is arguing a might-have-been, compared with Mr. Clinton's ability to refer to the here-and-now of more than eight million net new jobs added in the midst of an era of widespread corporate downsizing.
Until recently, one of the greatest fears at the White House was a rerun of 1992 in which the economy appeared to languish in the six months leading up to the Presidential election. Administration officials referred to this as the "Bush scenario." (Only later was it clear that the economy picked up steam that summer.) While economists and political strategists can argue the point of what Mr. Clinton could have done to help the economy further, he can campaign on numbers that give the promise of prosperity -- and hints that the wage stagnation of the last several years is slowly reversing.
"The Achilles' heel for this Administration is that the American workers are unhappy campers," Allen Sinai, the chief global economist of Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview from Boston today. But now, he added, "anecdotally and regionally almost all of the indicators are good. The result of this is that the economic card is a losing card for the Republicans."
While some economists suggested that the economy would slow down later this year, especially if bond yields remain above 7 percent, others guess that while growth may moderate, the economy is likely to meet or exceed the White House estimate of 2.2 percent for the year. "It's on track to something closer to two and a half," Mr. Sinai said.
For Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, the remaining big issue is the second quarter. The "advance" figures for that quarter will be issued on Aug. 1, just before the Democratic and Republican conventions, and will be revised through the heart of the campaign. The first look at the third quarter will not come until Oct. 30, just days before the election.
What threw off the economic forecasts of the country's first-quarter performance so severely was the surge in business investment, particularly for factory equipment and computers, which rose 14.5 percent, compared with an increase of 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995. Nonresidential building grew 5.8 percent, compared with a meager nine-tenths of a percent.
For Mr. Clinton, perhaps the most damaging part of today's report is the evidence that exports are slowing down. That was one of the shining sectors of the economy, which Mr. Clinton has claimed as his greatest success. The slowing, while expected, creates an opening for Mr. Dole to say that some of the market-opening initiatives have failed to narrow the country's trade gap.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Except Against Yen In Thin and Technical Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reversed course and advanced against the Japanese yen yesterday but fell against most other leading currencies in a quiet session driven largely by technical factors.
Widely anticipated data on employment in the United States presented traders with mixed signals, as the nation's unemployment rate dipped to a 14-month low of 5.4 percent in April but job growth came to a meager 2,000. Job growth the prior two months had been powerful. 
 "Really, everybody's just sort of stymied right now and they're going back to a neutral posture," said Randolph Donney, director of research at the Pegasus Econometric Group.
Most of the dollar's movement did not reflect directly on the dollar but on the secondary effect of trades between the German mark and the yen, Mr. Donney said. That weakened the yen against the dollar, reversing the yen's strong gains a day earlier.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 105.05 yen, up from 104.35 yen Thursday, and 1.5245 marks, down from 1.5283.
The British pound, which tumbled on Wednesday on fears that the ruling Conservative Party would be trounced in local elections on Thursday, showed little change yesterday, after results indeed showed a resounding defeat for the party. In New York, the British pound traded at $1.5070, up from $1.5025.
The dollar fell sharply on Thursday, following American bond and stock markets. The markets tumbled after the Government reported that the country's gross domestic product grew by 2.8 percent in the first quarter, faster than expected and raising fears of inflation.
When the employment report pointed to moderate economic growth, currency traders rushed to buy dollars. The dollar moved immediately higher against the yen, with many traders reversing the positions they had taken a day earlier.
"I think it was overdone yesterday, quite honestly," said Stephen Jury, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Union Bank of Switzerland.
Against the German mark and other major currencies, the dollar was not able to hold on, turned lower and added to the previous day's declines. United States stock and bond prices, which initially rallied on the employment news, turned down later in the day and helped drag the dollar lower.
Traders hesitated to read too much importance into the day's action, as trading was thin and many people simply did not want to carry uncertain positions into the weekend.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Rises on Supply Concerns As Strike Seems Near in Norway

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday as a strike threat by Norwegian oil workers and continued refinery problems raised concerns about supply at a time when supplies are low.
On other markets, copper jumped to a seven-month high, propelled by concern that a strike at the world's second-largest copper mine might be a prolonged one. Wheat and soybean prices were mixed. 
 The harsh winter, which left crude oil stocks unusually low, has overworked oil refineries and caused shutdowns for repairs, said Bill O'Grady, an analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Concerns over shutdowns and prospects that Norwegian offshore oil workers would strike for an extended time sent crude oil for June delivery up 32 cents yesterday, to $21.18.
A strike would reduce Norway's oil output by half and gas production by more than one-third. Norway is the world's largest oil producer outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It produces three million barrels a day.
Workers have threatened to walk off the job today, and the Norwegian Government has said it will not intervene.
June unleaded gasoline rose 1.52 cent, to 69.92 cents a gallon.
The July copper contract jumped 2.15 cents, to $1.2220 a pound -- a seven-month high -- on the New York Mercantile Exchange on fears about the strike at the Chuquicamata mine in Chile -- the world's second-largest copper mine. The loss of production comes as the United States economy seems to be strengthening. An economic expansion would probably increase demand for copper, which is used in industry and construction.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed, as traders shrugged off a new report that contained sharply reduced estimates of the winter wheat crop.
Prices rose modestly early after the Sparks Companies of Memphis, a widely respected private consultant, estimated the 1996-97 American wheat crop at 2.103 billion bushels, compared with last month's estimate of 2.415 billion bushels.
But the market already knew this year's wheat yield would be one of the worst in decades, said Mickey Luth, an analyst with the Laifa Group brokerage firm in Chicago.

Long-Delayed Power Plant Gets Go-Ahead in Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 3

 BODY:
The Government announced today that it had resolved financing and other difficulties that for four years have delayed construction of a $647 million electric power generating plant near the northern industrial city of Ciudad Juarez.
Construction of the Samalayuca II plant is to begin within a month, the Government said. 
 The project had been delayed for so long that some had dubbed it "Samala-nunca," or "Samala-never," and Government officials said today that their recent success in clearing away the hurdles was a breakthrough for the economy.
Samalayuca II is to be next to an already operating plant about 30 miles south of El Paso, and will generate power not only for Ciudad Juarez, a city of a million residents and more than 300 factories, but also for American customers under United States-Mexico electricity interchange agreements.
A consortium including the General Electric Company, the El Paso Energy Corporation, the International Generating Company of Boston (a joint venture between Bechtel Enterprises and PG&E Enterprises Inc.), and Emica, a Mexico City construction concern, will design and build the plant. They will lease it to Mexico's state-owned electric utility, the Comision Federal de Electricidad, for 20 years after the start-up, which is projected for 1998. Ownership will then transfer to the state utility.
Mexico's electricity demand is soaring, and President Ernesto Zedillo said in a ceremony today that before the year 2000, when his term ends, he hopes to assemble $9 billion in new capital for other power plants. "Certainly we will take this operation as a model for the coming years," Mr. Zedillo said.
The Government calls the project "Mexico's first large privately funded power project," which means that it is the first whose financing is not guaranteed by the Mexican Government, officials said.
The financing package, which took years to assemble, contemplates two parts. Construction will be financed with $132 million put up by the design and building consortium, led by GE Capital Services. And the Inter-American Development Bank and a group of private banks -- Citibank, a unit of Citicorp; Union Bank of Switzerland; ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, and Dresdner Bank of Germany -- will provide $515 million.
Once the plant becomes operational in the fall of 1998, the Export-Import Bank will take over $440 million of the private bank debt.
Glen T. Matsumoto, a vice president of the Export-Import Bank, said on a visit here that his bank, which is a dependency of the United States Government, became involved because "commercial banks are not quite comfortable with having long-term financial exposure in Mexico, not as of yet."
The contracts signed today guarantee that the plant will be able to generate sufficient electricity and revenue to repay and service the debt, Mr. Matsumoto said. "I'm comfortable that with the contracts signed today, they will be able to pay off the debt," he said.

HEADLINE: Look Who's Minding the Shop;
California Garment Makers Try to Police Workplace

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
In the latest crackdown on sweatshops in the nation's largest garment center, investigators working in teams of two stand watch outside sewing factories, noting the number of employees and their arrival times.
Then, moving inside, they split up. One inspector occupies the management, checking time cards, immigration work permits, tax forms and other documents. The other talks to workers on the floor, interviewing enough of them to insure that none can be singled out as a whistle-blower. 
 The investigators' reports, grading the workplace for compliance with state and Federal laws on safety and wages, can be damning. There is just one catch: these are not Government agents; they are employees of a private company, the Cal Safety Compliance Corporation. And their reports are not sent to law-enforcement officials, but rather to Cal Safety's clients, the big clothing makers who contract with the small sewing shops and are under pressure from the Federal Government to clean up their act.
In fact, the 52 inspectors who work for Cal Safety have instructions to introduce themselves as "manufacturers' representatives," so that the owners and their employees "will know we're not the Government," said Carol Pender, who founded the company in 1990.
So how effective can their efforts be? That is an important question in an industry that has thwarted numerous attempts over the years to eliminate the exploitation of its workers. Critics say the self-policing is doomed to failure because the interest of the big clothing companies to have clothes made cheaply runs counter to the Government's goal to end exploitation.
But the Labor Department thinks otherwise. With fewer than 800 labor standards inspectors to police American workplaces, a 19 percent decline over the last decade, it is the inspiration behind the private sector's involvement in the drive against sweatshop abuses.
[In Washington on Friday, the department issued its first-ever report on the nation's garment workers, showing that almost half of the sewing shops that were investigated had violated Federal labor laws. The largest number of enforcement actions, 86, taken in the six months ended March 31 were in California, while the total of back wages recovered for employees was greatest in New York, at $593,000.]
In November 1992, the Labor Department began invoking an obscure provision of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act that authorized it to confiscate "hot goods." It threatened manufacturers with the seizure of clothing produced by exploited labor, unless they could show they were making honest efforts to buy only from legitimate operators.
The effort got under way slowly but was bolstered last summer by the public furor over the discovery of a slave camp for Thai immigrants in El Monte, Calif. The police found nearly 70 workers locked inside a dilapidated garment factory surrounded by barbed wire and spiked fences. The prisoners had been forced to stitch together American brand-name clothes under threats of death if they tried to escape. Federal labor officials later notified more than a dozen large retailers that goods from the plant might have ended up in their stores.
[Two of the owners were sentenced to six years in prison last Monday, and five others are scheduled to be sentenced next Monday.]
Meantime, the Labor Department's threat to confiscate tainted merchandise from clothing companies has spawned a new industry concentrated in the Los Angeles area of private "sweatshop cops." These specialists are hired by the clothing manufacturers to audit the payroll practices and interview the employees of their subcontractors.
The biggest is Cal Safety, which has already signed up more than 100 garment makers, charging $200 for each quarterly audit it makes. Other inspection companies include Apparel Resources of Yorba Linda, Calif., which was founded in 1992 and has 40 clients, and Stonefield Josephson, an accounting firm in Santa Monica, Calif., which began offering the service to its clients 1992. In addition, many manufacturers say they themselves monitor their subcontractors.
Most clients receive detailed quarterly reports on their subcontractors, with failing grades given for violation of wage or safety laws or payroll discrepancies. Ms. Pender of Cal Safety said her auditors had inspected 90 percent of the state's 4,000 licensed contractors and had given so many low ratings that half had been cut off by at least one manufacturer.
The Los Angeles metropolitan area is the main battlefield of the Government's war on illegal sweatshops. Fed by an influx of immigrant labor from Asia and Latin America, the city's apparel industry has surpassed New York's to become America's biggest, with $15.2 billion in sales last year and one-quarter of the nation's million garment workers.
In industrial parks and decaying office buildings in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, they cut, stitch, knit, iron, trim and dye fabric for 4,000 registered sewing contractors and an estimated 1,000 underground ones. According to a survey by state officials conducted in 1994, just as the effort to enlist the private sector in policing the shops was getting under way, 90 percent of them worked in sweatshop conditions that flouted state and Federal wage and safety laws. Even sewing shops that stay within the law rarely offer their employees paid vacations or health benefits.
Given the low-tech nature of the sewing business, unscrupulous entrepreneurs can easily escape investigators -- whether those sent by government or the manufacturers -- by keeping duplicate books and shutting down a site one day and opening up elsewhere the next.
So far, the Federal Government's initiative has won scant support from any of the parties involved. Some California labor officials privately grumble that it is aimed more at placating public opinion than bringing about meaningful change. And representatives of both the sewing-factory owners and their workers question the wisdom of giving an enforcement role to clothing manufacturers. Patrick Cheung, president of the Northern California Chinese Garment Contractors Association, accuses the garment makers of hypocrisy for insisting that his members pay fair wages to their workers while simultaneously lowering the rates they pay the subcontractors for stitching work.
"They know it's not enough," Mr. Cheung said. He said 40 sewing shops closed in the Bay Area last year, and added that profit margins among his remaining 350 members had shrunk to 3 percent from 10 percent since 1988.
For their part, the unions representing garment workers decry the new monitoring system as a case of the fox guarding the hen house. "I can't say things have gotten better," said Steven T. Nutter, regional director of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. For him, the only solution is more Government intervention. "You can't terrorize an industry when you have 15 people policing it," he said. "You hit every contractor once every seven years. They'll take that chance."
For all the doubts, there is some evidence that self-policing is doing some good. A new survey of the California garment industry by the state and the Federal Government shows that while abuses are still rampant, "companies with monitoring programs have a significantly better rate of compliance than nonmonitored companies," said Jose Millan, California's interim labor commissioner.
Mr. Millan said the survey turned up 20 percent fewer overtime violations than were found in a similar study two years ago, though little progress was made in meeting record-keeping, safety or minimum-wage requirements. "There's been slight improvement," he said. "It would be foolhardy to withdraw from the program now."
And while the big clothing companies are not happy about what they regard as another bureaucratic intrusion, they are at least going through the motions of leaning on their subcontractors to abide by Federal minimum-wage and safety laws. And Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, at least, is hoping for a long-term payoff.
"We've got to stop this exploitation, and we can't do it alone," Mr. Reich said in a recent interview.
Law-enforcement officials have had a few successes. Most big garment makers --including Guess Inc., Chorus Line and 43 other companies -- have signed a voluntary agreement with the Labor Department to shoulder responsibility for back pay owed to workers by their contractors. So far, the agency has recovered more than $7.3 million in back wages for more than 25,000 garment workers since 1993.
But some garment makers say the cost of policing their contractors puts them at a disadvantage to companies with overseas operations. "Our competitors can make goods anywhere in the world," complained Christopher L. Bryer, a vice president of Chazz, a unit of CMG Inc. that makes private-label apparel.
Since his company began monitoring its four sewing contractors, Mr. Bryer said, it has cut off one. But he wonders if the action did any good, saying the extra expense played a role in Chazz's decision last year to hire sewing contractors in Mexico.
Such protests fall on deaf ears in many quarters. Edna Bonacich, a sociology professor at the University of California at Riverside who specializes in the Los Angeles garment industry, said manufacturers were getting off easy. "The department's demands are minimalist," she said. "It's the language of compliance rather than a recognition of the industry's evil, exploitive practices."
Mr. Reich, meantime, is trying to extend the self-monitoring effort to retailers. In newspaper ads and radio commercials, his department is urging consumers to shop at stores that are on its "No Sweat" list of chains that keep close tabs on their suppliers.
Mr. Reich says it is the civic duty of big companies to lead the attack on worker exploitation. "It's a matter of corporate responsibility," he said.

 BODY:

Jobless Rate Eased in April, Despite Steady Payrolls
The Government reported that the job market was lackluster in April, a day after reporting unexpectedly sharp growth in the economy in the first quarter. But even signs of modest growth failed to dissipate the inflation fears that rattled the financial markets on Thursday. The nation's unemployment rate eased to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6 percent in March and was at the lowest level in 14 months, even though there was no growth in business payrolls.
The results reduced chances that the Federal Reserve would find it necessary to tighten monetary policy soon. [Page 1.]
 
Car Sales Cool Down
Car and truck sales weakened in April to an annual pace of 14.6 million, seasonally adjusted, down from a sizzling 15.9 million in March. The slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at Ford and some shortages of General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of the strike. Ford sales dropped 2 percent below April 1995. [35.]
 
Merger to Form Insurance Giant
Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance plan to merge, forming Britain's second-largest publicly traded insurer and largest general insurer. The merger will result in annual savings of at least $262 million by 1998 for the combined company. [34.]
 
Viacom Earnings Firm
Viacom turned in a better performance than expected, helped in large part by its alliance with the Kirch Group of Germany. While earnings fell 61 percent, Viacom avoided the loss that Wall Street had forecast. Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and Blockbuster Video, earned $27.8 million in the quarter, and cash flow was stronger than expected. [37.]
 
Mexico Power Plant to Serve U.S.
Mexico is ready to begin building a $647 million electric power generating plant 30 miles south of El Paso, having resolved complex financing issues. Construction is to begin within a month, according to the Government, which called the step a breakthrough for the economy. The plant will serve not only Ciudad Juarez, a city of a million residents and more than 300 factories, but also American customers. [34.]
 
Upjohn Operating Profit Up
Pharmacia & Upjohn said first-quarter operating earnings rose 8 percent, which was less than expected, on slow growth in pharmaceutical sales. Profits from operations increased to $229 million, but a big charge for integrating the two companies reduced net income to $50 million. [36.]
 
New Chief at National Semi
National Semiconductor named Brian Halla as its chairman, chief executive and president, succeeding Gilbert Amelio, who left in February to head Apple Computer. Mr. Halla, 49, had been executive vice president of LSI Logic. His appointment came a week after National Semiconductor warned of disappointing earnings because of decreasing sales of its electronic parts. [43.]
 
Transit Programs Halted in China
Qingdao, China, a port city eager to attract foreign investment, had planned to build a subway system, cross-harbor tunnel and a 10-mile bridge. But now all the projects have been suspended for lack of financing. Throughout China, basic transportation projects are being canceled or truncated. [3.]
 
Anger at British Cow Slaughter
Britain began slaughtering cows that are at risk of contracting mad cow disease but so far, the program has been a disaster for the beef industry: farmers are unsure of how they will get their backlog of animals slaughtered, and the $6.5-billion-a-year industry remains devastated by the export ban. [5.]
 
Strike Threat Lifts Oil Prices
Crude oil prices rose on a strike threat in Norway and tight supplies. Crude oil for June delivery climbed 32 cents, to $21.18. [32.]
 
Dollar Advances Against Yen
The dollar rebounded against the yen but fell against other leading currencies in a quiet session. The dollar rose to 105.05 yen, from 104.35 yen Thursday, while the British pound climbed to $1.5070, from $1.5025. [32.]

HEADLINE: William S. Brennen, 72, an Aide In Luring Business to New York

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
William Stuart Brennen, who helped the Beame and Koch administrations to lure businesses to New York City, died on Wednesday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 72.
He suffered a brief illness, said Mort Lawrence, a family friend. 
 Mr. Brennen also served Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller as First Deputy Superintendent of Banks for four years and was then chairman of the now-defunct Greenwich Savings Bank. At his death, he was a partner in Brennen & Stack, a law firm dealing with banking, international commerce and real estate.
Mr. Brennen first seemed headed for a career on the high seas. He graduated as a licensed ship's officer from the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, L.I., and served in the Allied landings in North Africa, Anzio, Italy, and Normandy, France, during World War II. After three and a half years of sea duty, he went on to graduate from Columbia College in 1947 and from Columbia Law School two years later. He then joined the state's Banking Department.
Starting in the late 1940's, he took part in politics as a member of the Young Republican Club, helping to map strategy for local and statewide campaigns.
He supported Mr. Rockefeller's bid for the gubernatorial nomination in 1958, and when Mr. Rockefeller moved into the Governor's mansion he promoted him to First Deputy Superintendent.
The Greenwich Savings Bank recruited him as senior vice president in 1963 and elected him president in 1969 and chairman in 1971. He retired 10 years later when the bank was merged into the Metropolitan Savings Bank.
While still at the bank in 1974, Mr. Brennen was asked by Mayor Abraham D. Beame to form the New York City Industrial Development Agency, which he served as volunteer chairman for 12 years. During that time, the agency approved more than $500 million in loans to companies wanting to do business in the city.
In 1983, Mr. Beame's successor, Edward I. Koch, called on Mr. Brennen to help revamp the city's economic apparatus, and he served successively as Commissioner of Business Development and Commissioner of International Business Development. He retired from city service in 1986 to practice law.
Mr. Brennen is survived by his wife of 45 years, Justine Bright Brennen; two sons, Stephen, of Chicago, and Robert, of Pearl River, N.Y., and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Tribe to Invest Casino Profits in a Boatyard

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The old-salt maritime culture of New London, Conn., has appeared headed for the history books in recent years. The whaling fleets are faded memories, the submarine bays mere shadows of their cold war height.
Ten miles up the Thames River in Ledyard, the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe has surged from one triumph to another as owner of what is estimated to be the country's most profitable gambling enterprise, Foxwoods Casino. From hotels and golf courses to spas and gravel quarries, the tribe has poured its millions into the local economy, becoming the economic engine of the region and its largest private employer. 
 Yesterday, the two trajectories met.
The tribe, in an announcement at New London City Hall, said it would single-handedly return shipbuilding to New London. Tribal officials said a new subsidiary would begin building and selling ferryboats, first to be used to transport casino patrons across Long Island Sound, and after that for a national and international market that the tribe thinks will keep New London welders and pipe fitters at work well into the next century.
The boats will be designed to be among the fastest in the world. They will cost $11 million each and have a capacity of 330 passengers.
Although the Pequots spoke grandly of their desires to revive the New London maritime business, the plan would bring obvious benefits to the tribe. In the short run, the ferryboats would serve to bring more customers from New York City and Boston to the casino.
But more broadly, the shipyard would be the first part of an aggressive diversification program the tribe announced last year, in the belief that the Pequots' gambling bonanza would eventually wane because of growing competition from other casinos in the Northeast. They would build their conglomerate in their own backyard, tribal officials said, where they have lived for centuries, where their 12,000 employees live and where local investments, in the often hostile and jealous environment of local politics, also make for good public relations.
Building their own shipyard, a far costlier endeavor than would be necessary to supply their own needs for boats, is the first major step in that process, tribal officials said yesterday. In New London, they said, they will also get a skilled work force, as the Electric Boat submarine yard continues to lay off workers through the end of the century. There may also be Federal training money available, as former submarine workers are retrained in aluminum building techniques instead of steel.
"We are setting up a marketing company at the same time, and if we can sell these boats aggressively, it will be a new future," said Henry J. Sockbeson, a tribal lawyer and leader for the boat yard project.
"What this means," said the New London City Manager, Richard Brown, "is the return of shipbuilding to New London."
The Pequots do not do things in a small way. Since they opened their casino in 1992 on a wooded reservation that had, not too many years earlier, been reduced to a few trailers inhabited by people struggling at businesses like hydroponic gardening and pig farming, they do not appear to have failed at anything they have touched. Operating as a sovereign nation outside the reach of Federal and state tax collectors, the roughly 350-member tribe earned $600 million in gross revenues last year on slot machines alone, according to a spokesman.
The new boats are unlike anything in use in North America, tribal officials said. Designed two years ago by a British company, FBM Marine Group, there are only five of the boats in existence, crossing the straits between Hong Kong and Macao at a cruising speed of 47 knots, Mr. Sockbeson said.
"Fast enough to rip the contacts right out of your eyes," he said.
The boats will offer airline-style first- and second-class seating, and will be built by an initial crew of 60 people. They will work in the three bays of a bankrupt steel company that provided deck plates for the Navy's submarine fleet before going under in 1990.
The new tribal subsidiary will have an initial annual payroll of $2 million, but Mr. Sockbeson declined to disclose the total investment.
But there are barriers to the plan. Because the ferryboats are a new design for United States waters, featuring innovations like a computer-controlled foil to cut through waves for a smoother ride, the first hurdle, Mr. Sockbeson said, will involve approval from the Coast Guard. Consultants and engineers have been retained by the tribe, he said, to codify the construction plans and work with Coast Guard officials.
A second question, especially for the first four or five boats to be used by the tribe, is where they will be allowed to dock, especially in New York and Boston.
The Pequots' tribal chairman, Richard A. Hayward, said that part of the appeal of the project was how it combined elements of the past and future. Pequots earned their livelihood from the sea for centuries, he said, so the venture is a kind of psychological homecoming.
"In a sense, with us returning to the sea to carry out this enterprise, we are closing the circle," Mr. Hayward said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Unveils Reduced Capital Budget

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a capital plan yesterday that would cut spending by $1 billion even after accounting for revenues and savings that would require a reversal of a judge's ruling and an unlikely change in a state law.
In unveiling the $16.2 billion, four-year capital budget, Mr. Giuliani said the spending plan would be financed in part by the $1 billion he still expects from the sale of the city's water and sewer system. The Mayor's proposal last year to sell the system -- with the proceeds to be used for school construction and other projects -- collapsed in March when a state judge declared it illegal. 
 The Mayor's proposal yesterday also relies on more than $600 million in savings that would depend on a revision Mr. Giuliani has proposed in what is known as the Wicks Law. The state law, first passed in 1921, requires local governments to hire at least four separate contractors for any public works project costing more than $1 million.
Without the change in the law or the proceeds from the sale, the Mayor and his aides said, the city would have to make still deeper cuts than those proposed yesterday or to borrow more money to maintain even a reduced level of construction or repairs for buildings and highways.
The unveiling of the Mayor's proposal came a day after mayoral aides disclosed that Mr. Giuliani would propose the creation of a new public authority that would allow the city to circumvent the state's constitutional limit on the city's debt. At its present level of spending, the city will reach the limit within the next year or so.
In a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Giuliani said his capital budget proposal would insure that there was "no major interruption in the rebuilding of our buildings, our roads, our bridges, our highways, our schools and also our subways" after the drastic cuts during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
"That will continue, even though we've made reductions," he said.
But the Mayor's proposal faced sharp criticism from the Democrats who control the City Council and who will almost certainly fight for more spending as budget negotiations proceed in the weeks ahead.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said, in particular, that money for rebuilding the city's crumbling schools, which would stay about at current levels in the Mayor's proposal, should be increased. Mr. Vallone has proposed extending the city's temporary surcharge on the personal income tax to raise $1.4 billion for additional school construction over the next four years. He has said that extending the surcharge, which expires in December, would be a major priority for the year.
"We have no place to go but up," Mr. Vallone said of the Mayor's proposal. "It has no additional funding for education. It is certainly silent about what we have put down as our No. 1 priority, which is increasing spending for schools."
Mr. Giuliani said he needed to include the estimated savings from the Wicks Law change and the proceeds from the proposed water sale because he was lobbying in the State Legislature for the revision and appealing the judge's ruling against the sale.
The Mayor's proposed change in the Wicks Law would allow the city to reduce the cost of many of its construction projects by hiring one contractor instead of breaking each project over $1 million into separate contracts. While Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed exempting projects in New York City that cost less than $5 million, Mr. Giuliani has proposed raising the threshold to $20 million. He has argued, as have previous mayors, that the law unfairly saddled the city with higher construction costs and delays.
But various efforts to repeal or revise the law -- including a pitched battle three years ago led by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- have died in the face of lobbying by the construction trades that are the law's main beneficiaries. And the prospect that the revision will pass the Assembly or the Senate are bleak at best, officials on both sides said yesterday.
The Mayor's plan would cut capital spending in virtually every municipal agency over the next four years. Those reductions would result in the delay or cancellation of a number of construction projects for housing, courts, parks and highways.
One of the biggest reductions -- at $183 million -- would come in bridge repairs, including the delay of a renovation of the Brooklyn Bridge, scheduled to begin in 1998, until after the year 2000. The Mayor said it made sense to delay the project until the continued renovation of the Manhattan Bridge was finished, to avoid major tie-ups at two East River bridges.
The plan also includes sharp cuts in housing renovations that in part reflect the administration's efforts to put repossessed buildings in private hands rather than rebuild them with city funds.
The Mayor's proposal did include a $500 million increase to the city's subway and bus systems that Mr. Giuliani promised to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last week in exchange for an immediate $250 million infusion in cash for operating expenses.
The city's school system was among the few areas that faced no reduction. The Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew, expressed relief that school construction had been spared. At the same time, however, he said the system did not now have enough money for all the repairs and construction it needs and alluded in a statement to the Council's alternative proposal for more money.
"I am heartened," he said, "that the school system's numerous and urgent capital needs, the vast majority of which cannot be addressed at current funding levels, are recognized as a priority."

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Freed of all legislative burdens until Tuesday, the Senate today devoted the first day of its four-day weekend to politics -- and history.
On a more or less contemporary note, Senator Bob Dole attacked President Clinton over the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase that was enacted in 1993 despite unanimous Republican opposition. Seizing on the recent rise in gasoline prices, Mr. Dole said, "Americans are overtaxed and need relief." 
 Then Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, outbid him by 32 years, marking the 35th anniversary of Mr. Dole's first vote against increasing the minimum wage.
"Bob Dole was wrong then," Mr. Kennedy said. "And he's wrong now" in opposing an increase in the hourly minimum to $5.15 from $4.25. "No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty," Mr. Kennedy said.
Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, appeared before the friendly Republican-majority Senate Finance Committee, which is considering his proposal to repeal the gasoline tax increase before the summer driving season begins in earnest on Memorial Day.
"This tax hike has not only hurt Americans who drive to work, school, worship or on vacation, it penalizes truckers and others who drive for their livelihood," Mr. Dole said. "Repealing this gas tax immediately will lower transportation prices, help to keep inflation in check and help to protect the jobs of millions of Americans who work in transportation-related businesses."
Democrats on the committee defended the tax increase as part of a package that had reduced the Federal budget deficit. "We need this revenue," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said of the nearly $5 billion that the 4.3-cent increase provides the Government in annual receipts. "I hope we keep it."
The next battleground was the minimum wage, where Senator Dole, as majority leader, has used a variety of parliamentary devices to prevent a vote for more than a month.
First the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told a news conference that it appeared that Mr. Dole was trying to turn the Senate into the House, with "no votes, no amendments, no debate, no opportunity for real discussion about some of the more important issues we're facing, including the minimum wage."
Then Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Senators Kennedy, Carl Levin of Michigan, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont held another news conference, with a television commercial from John F. Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign as exhibit A. In that commercial, Kennedy criticized his opponent, Richard M. Nixon, for calling a 25-cent increase, to $1.25, "extreme."
"A number of Republicans," Mr. Leahy said, "tell us privately if it comes to a vote, they will vote with us." At least four of them have stated so publicly, so that, with the Senate's 47 Democrats, a wage increase now commands a majority.
Senator Kennedy and Mr. Reich answered Republican accusations that they neglected the issue when Democrats controlled Congress in 1993-94 and were bringing it up in this election year only for political reasons. Mr. Reich said the earlier, and ultimately unsuccessful, fight for universal health insurance coverage "took precedence." Mr. Kennedy, who said the cost of guaranteed health insurance would have been 40 cents to 50 cents an hour per worker, declared that workers had madeclear that they overwhelmingly preferred "a guarantee of good, quality health care" to a minimum-wage increase.
Mr. Kennedy said he did not think Republicans could continue to forestall a vote.
"This is a corruption of the process in terms of the United States Senate," he said. "They can do it for a period of time. But as a former heavyweight champion said, 'You can run, but you can't hide,' and there are not enough parliamentary tricks to preclude us from getting a vote on the Senate floor."
Then Mr. Dole appeared briefly on the floor and announced that he would seek to prevent any wage amendment from being offered during next Tuesday's legislative activity: consideration of a bill to reimburse discharged employees of the White House travel office for legal expenses. Mr. Daschle said the Democrats would filibuster.

HEADLINE: Off-Duty Officer Kills Robbery Suspect

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: OYSTER BAY, L.I., May 3

 BODY:
An off-duty New York City housing police officer shot and killed one of four men trying to rob his father's gasoline station here Thursday night, the Nassau County police said today.
The three other suspects, who were arrested shortly after the attempted robbery, told the police that the slain suspect had bragged about holding up the same Getty station on Pine Hollow Road a year ago. 
 This time, however, Joseph Capapano, a 23-year-old officer assigned to a police housing unit in Brooklyn, was working at the station, filling in for his father, Joseph Capapano Sr., who purchased the station only six weeks ago.
"He was helping his dad out, pumping some gas, when around 9:30 this fellow walks in and begins talking about maybe buying some cigarettes," said Detective Sgt. Robert Edwards.
"The fellow hung around for a few minutes and Joe asked if he wanted any help and he said he was waiting for his girlfriend," Sergeant Edwards said. "When Joe turned around to walk into the service bay, this fellow grabbed him from behind, put his arm around the neck in a choke hold, stuck a hard object into his back and said: 'All I want is your money. Don't do anything crazy and you won't be hurt.' "
At that point, Officer Capapano, who was dressed in mechanic's clothes but carrying his service revolver under his belt, grabbed his gun, turned and fired two shots into the robber, Sergeant Edwards said.
The police said they later determined that the slain suspect, Dwight Oliver, 33, of Glen Cove, L.I., was not armed and had apparently formed a fist and pressed a knuckle into the officer's back.
"There was no way for Officer Capapano to know that the suspect was not armed," Sergeant Edwards said. "The respone was instantaneous."
Sergeant Edwards said he did not believe that Officer Capapano had done anything wrong. Like Nassau County police officers, he said, Mr. Capapano was required to carry his service revolver while off duty.
Sergeant Edwards said another off-duty New York City housing police officer who worked with Officer Capapano in Brooklyn had witnessed the incident. He said the other officer, who was not identified, had brought a car in for repairs and was in the bay service area when he saw the attempted robbery.
The police said Mr. Oliver was unemployed and had an arrest record in Nassau for a robbery in 1995 and an illegal drug sale in 1993.
The three other suspects -- Kenneth Wilson, 19, Stan Ambles, 25, and Matt Laboy, 23, all of Glen Cove -- were arrested in a parking lot behind the gasoline station in a car that the police said had stolen license plates.
They were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, and all pleaded not guilty at their arraignment this afternoon in First District Nassau County Court in Hempstead. Judge Leah Ruskin set bail for Mr. Wilson and Mr. Ambles at $25,000 each and for Mr. Laboy at $50,000, because of an arrest record. None of the suspects made bail, and they were remanded to the county jail. A hearing was scheduled for Tuesday.
Sergeant Edwards said that the four men had been drinking beer in their car when they decided to commit a robbery.
"One of them said he had done this station before," Sergeant Edwards said, "so they gave him a hooded pullover sweatshirt -- what they call a hoodie -- and he wore that into the gas station."
Police records showed that an unsolved robbery had occurred at the station a year ago. "And the description of the robber fits that of Dwight Oliver," Sergeant Edwards said.

HEADLINE: Rally in Dow Is Quashed By Nervous Bond Market

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Technology and speculative stocks rallied yesterday from Thursday's steep retreat. But an early rebound in the broader stock market quickly wilted as interest rates rose in the bond market, which remained nervous about inflation despite a weaker-than-expected April employment report.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.24 points to close at 5,478.03 after clinging to a modest gain most of the session. For the week, the gauge of blue-chip performance was down 89.96 points. 
 On Thursday, the Dow plunged nearly 77 points and broader indexes tumbled as mounting evidence of a revitalized economy compounded fears that yesterday's employment report would disclose the third consecutive big monthly increase in jobs. Investors have been worried that rising payrolls would create too much spending power and bring on inflationary pressures that would lead to higher interest rates.
But yesterday morning, the Labor Department reported that while the nation's unemployment rate dipped in April the number of payroll jobs increased by only 2,000.
Bonds rallied early on the smaller-than-expected increase in jobs, lifting the stock market. But the bond market's underlying worries about inflation soon became obvious as Treasury prices fell. Long-term interest rates, which on Thursday closed above 7 percent for the first time in almost a year, rose even higher, undercutting the recovery in the broader stock market.
Still, the Nasdaq market -- one of Thursday's biggest losers as investors locked in profits on the recent rally in technology and smaller-company shares -- rose 6.27, to 1,184.60. But that was down sharply from a gain of more than 15 points earlier in the session.
Other indicators dominated by more speculative issues also managed a gain for the day.
The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies, which had risen with the Nasdaq to 10 consecutive record closes before Thursday's selloff, rose 0.91, to 346.85. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.72, to 589.69.
But broader market indicators followed the Dow lower. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index fell 0.81, to 345.40, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.75, to 641.63.
Declining issues led advancers by a slim margin on the Big Board, where volume totaled 434 million shares as of 4 P.M., down from Thursday's session.
Speculative issues have been outperforming the blue-chip market for weeks on expectations that those businesses will benefit most from an improving economy.
The Government reported Thursday that the economy -- as measured by the gross domestic product -- expanded at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year.
In addition to increased spending on consumer goods, the G.D.P. report attributed much of the first-quarter growth to heavy spending for business computers. That news reinforced a series of strong earnings reports and other encouraging news in the technology sector, which was one of the few sectors to withstand some of Thursday's selloff.
Yesterday, technology shares rallied again. Among the Nasdaq's most active issues, Intel rose 11/16 , to 6811/16 , Cisco Systems gained 1/2, to 50 5/8, and Sun Microsystems rose 3/8, to 57 3/8.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola gained 2, to 62 5/8; Compaq Computer rose 1 1/8, to 47 3/4, and Digital Equipment rose 3/4, to 57. I.B.M., a Dow component, rose 1/4, to 108 1/8.
Zenith Electronics continued to surge, gaining 2 3/4, to 15 3/4. The stock more than doubled this week after Zenith announced plans to enter the on-line business with two new modem systems.
Overseas, the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed in observance of a Japanese national holiday. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index tumbled 1.8 percent and London's FT-SE 100 fell 0.7 percent.

HEADLINE: PAYROLL GROWTH WAS FLAT IN APRIL

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
A day after the Government reported unexpectedly sharp growth in the economy in the first quarter, the Labor Department said today that the job market during April was lackluster. But the signs of more modest growth failed to dissipate the fears of a rise in inflation that rattled the financial markets on Thursday.
The nation's unemployment rate eased to 5.4 percent in April -- an improvement from 5.6 percent in March and the lowest level in 14 months -- despite a meager growth in payrolls of only 2,000 jobs. 
 The bond market was initially pleased with the job data, which were accompanied by a Commerce Department report of moderate increases in incomes and spending. But bond prices subsequently skidded, pushing up interest rates, after investors found several things to worry about, including possible hints that wage pressures were beginning to mount. [Page 33.] Stock prices gave up early gains, and blue chips sank in late trading.
Unlike the two preceding months, when job growth far exceeded expectations and frightened inflation-wary securities markets, the April results reduced chances that the Federal Reserve would find it necessary to tighten monetary policy soon.
Fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates -- perhaps as early as this month -- mounted on Thursday, when the Government reported that the economy grew at a 2.8 percent pace in the first three months of the year, about double most predictions.
The Clinton Administration, quick to take credit for good economic performance, pointed to what is now 20 consecutive months with unemployment below 6 percent and to a rise in wages that it says is enough to help long-squeezed workers but not so much as to risk inflation. But it skirted over the lack of any significant increase of jobs last month.
"There's no sign of accelerating inflation in terms of wages pushing prices," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview. Mr. Reich also appeared at a White House briefing, joined by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and by Martin N. Baily, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, to trumpet economic gains.
For the Republicans, Senator Connie Mack of Florida, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, focused on the "disappointing" rise in April of 2,000 jobs, all of them in government, and on the fact that the two-tenths of a point decline in the unemployment rate was entirely a result of a contraction in the labor force.
The Republican National Committee finally joined the fray, contending that the economy today was weaker than in 1992, when Mr. Clinton was attacking President George Bush for presiding over the "worst economic performance in 50 years."
The committee said that "the Bush economy Clinton so shrilly attacked grew 4.7 percent" in the first quarter of the election year, not a "sluggish" 2.8 percent. And it added, "Even in the last quarter of Bush's Presidency, when Clinton's attacks had reached a fever pitch, the economy was growing at a rate of 4.3 percent -- more than half again faster than today's economy, about which Bill Clinton crows so loudly."
In contrast to today, more than five years into an economic expansion, the economy in 1992 was coming out of a recession and was plagued by unemployment that averaged two percentage points above last month's 5.4 percent rate.
The April job figures were particularly difficult to interpret, reflecting not just economic crosscurrents but unusually big adjustments for recurrent seasonal variations, like the surge each spring in construction jobs.
For example, today's report showed that the construction industry actually added 221,000 jobs in April. But because such jobs normally surge in April, the gain fell short of what the adjustment factor anticipated, resulting in a reported decline of 53,000.
In some parts of the country, the department reported, hiring was held down because workers were already in jobs as a result of unusually favorable winter weather. In others, poor April weather dampened activity and delayed hiring.
Over all, employer payrolls jumped 795,000 but they edged up by only 2,000 when adjusted for seasonality, far below the 120,000 or so that analysts had predicted.
The seasonal problem was compounded by the fact that there were four weeks between job surveys this year while in two of the two preceding years there was a five-week interval, a difference weighing heavily on the adjustment factor.
And the 17-day March strike at General Motors also muddied the statistics as 28,000 returning strikers limited the reported loss of factory jobs to 17,000, the second consecutive decline. The March loss, swelled by strikers, was 61,000.
Despite all the conflicting data and market fears, a top Federal Reserve official expressed satisfaction with the course the economy appeared to be following. "The basic message on the statistics that we've seen in recent months and recent days is that the economy continues on a fairly solid, moderate growth path with low inflation," Edward G. Boehne, president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, told Reuters. "I think if you look at several months running," added Mr. Boehne, who serves on the policy-making Open Market Committee, "we have a growth in employment of 166,000 on average per month, which is a number that's quite consistent with this moderate growth path."
The Labor Department's survey of households found the labor force shrank 294,000 in April, enough to push the unemployment rate down to the bottom end of the range of 5.4 to 5.8 percent within which it has fluctuated since October 1994.
The number of newly unemployed -- those idled for less than five weeks -- fell for the second consecutive month, consistent with other figures showing a decline in first-time claims for unemployment insurance.
Over all, private analysts tended to combine the April results with those of preceding months in concluding that the economy was showing solid but not runaway growth.
The job data from February and March "overstated economic strength," Edward S. Hyman and Nancy Lazar of the International Strategy and Investment Group told clients. "The April employment report probably overstates economic weakness."
For workers, the signs of higher hourly pay were welcome, but analysts said the markets seemed to focus their fears that inflation might heat up on the calculation that average hourly earnings jumped last month by 7 cents, to $11.75, after a 2-cent March rise.
Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, noted that the 12-month increase in hourly earnings was now 3.1 percent, close to what prevailed over the last year but "somewhat higher" than the experience from 1992 through early 1995. But others dismissed the latest jump as another example of how hourly earnings tend to surge in the first month of each quarter before settling back.
Geographically, the department reported that the jobless rate in the Northeast, which jumped six-tenths of a point in March, retreated five-tenths of a point in April to stand at 5.8 percent. Changes in the South, Midwest and West were limited in each case to a statistically insignificant one-tenth of a point.
Consumer spending rose six-tenths of 1 percent in March, just half the February pace, the Commerce Department said. Spending spurted in February after severe weather had curbed consumption.
The department also reported that personal incomes rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March, slower than the eight-tenths of 1 percent advance a month earlier. The February increase was the largest since a nine-tenths of 1 percent advance in January 1995.
The March increase in incomes would have been higher except for the widespread effects of the strike at General Motors, the report said.

HEADLINE: 'Save the Whalers' Effort Is Extended for 2 Weeks

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 3

 BODY:
The Hart ford Whalers are not leaving Con necticut at least not yet. A campaign to "Save the Whalers" by selling 11,000 season tickets in a month has been extended two weeks, after the National Hockey League team reached 69 percent of that goal, team and state officials said today.
But as state leaders congratulated themselves on selling 7,601 season tickets thus far -- more than the Whalers sold last season -- Mayor Michael P. Peters warned that selling 3,400 additional tickets in less than two weeks would be difficult. 
 "It's a very tough order," Mr. Peters said. "I'd rather have the campaign go to September, but that's not going to happen."
The effort may be as much a campaign to save a linchpin of Hartford's economy as a bid to keep Connecticut's only major league sports franchise. The team, which plays in the Coliseum of the Hartford Civic Center, brings, on average, 13,000 people into the downtown area 43 nights a year. One restaurant owner, Michael A. Seaver, credits the Whalers for 20 percent of the business at his Chuck's Steak House.
State leaders have been trying to pitch the effort as a statewide campaign, and the Speaker of the House, Thomas Ritter, Democrat of Hartford, expressed frustration that southern Connecticut had not shown more support.
Mr. Ritter pointed out that several major corporations outside the Hartford area, like Union Carbide in Danbury and General Electric in Fairfield, had declined to subsidize their employees' purchases of tickets, as some Hartford companies have done.
"It's the rest of the state that will now determine the future of the Whalers," Mr. Ritter said. "Just as we in Hartford do positive things for the rest of the state, I think it's important for the rest of the state to step up to the plate."
At today's news conference, Gov. John G. Rowland joked, as he had before, about Fairfield County residents rooting for the wrong team -- the New York Rangers.
Some supporters are hoping that a promise the Whalers made today will help boost sales -- a pledge not to negotiate with any other cities while the ticket campaign continues.
Ticket sales may have been hindered by news stories and admissions by the Whalers' owners that they were looking at other cities. As recently as Tuesday, officially the last day of the campaign, the team's general manager, James E. Rutherford, said the Whalers had to begin looking at alternatives to Hartford.
But today the league's Commissioner, Gary Bettman, said: "The Whalers will not be exploring other alternatives. They will not be talking to other cities."
Still, the Whalers assert that if they sell anything less than 11,000 season tickets, they will be forced to consider moving. "If we stop short of 11,000, we run the risk of losing millions," Mr. Rutherford said.
The Coliseum seats 15,600 for hockey games, and with their 13,000-per-game average, the Whalers' attendance ranks 24th among the 26 N.H.L. teams this season. In the last two years, officials say, the team has lost $30 million.
In the meantime, the Whalers will begin negotiating more seriously with the state on revising their contract so that the team gets money from food concessions and parking -- another requirement for the Whalers to stay in Hartford.

HEADLINE: NBC Will Buy Rockefeller Center Space

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
They will not even officially take title to the property till later this month, but Rockefeller Center's new owners have already sold a huge chunk of one of the center's 12 landmarked buildings.
Yesterday NBC announced that it would pay $440 million for the 1.6 million square feet it has long occupied at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the flagship building of the 63-year-old complex. 
 "This seemed the best way to insure our permanence in what we see as a premier facility with continuing cachet," said Michael Sherlock, an NBC executive vice president.
The sale raises the question of whether Rockefeller Center, which has been buffeted first by a highly publicized bankruptcy and then by bidding wars by several would-be investor groups, will now find itself parceled out.
The new owners vehemently deny that. "This is a long-term investment; we did not buy this to sell it," said Jerry I. Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer Properties, which along with Goldman, Sachs & Company and David Rockefeller, is acquiring the center's 12 buildings.
Indeed, most real estate people doubt that there would be much demand for office condominiums like the one that NBC will now own. But many do wonder whether, down the road, the temptation to sell entire buildings might prove irresistible. They note that Rockefeller Center sold 1251 Avenue of the Americas, the former Exxon Building, to Mitsui Fudosan in 1986, and that McGraw-Hill has always co-owned its Rockefeller Center building.
"They may all just decide they have too much commercial real estate space in their portfolio," said Stephen B. Siegel, president of the Edward S. Gordon Company, a big real estate service firm.
Others suggest that the new owners had to sell the space to finance the purchase of the center, much as the leveraged buyout specialists of the 1980's financed their takeovers of companies by selling off pieces of the businesses they acquired. But Mr. Speyer said such speculation was absurd. "We certainly had the internal equity to finance this purchase," he said. The sole reason for the sale, he said, was to insure that NBC did not leave the center and sublet the space to someone else. "We did this to insure NBC's continued commitment to the center," he said.
The new owners of Rockefeller Center are paying slightly more than $306 million, or $8 a share, to buy out the investors in the real estate investment trust that held the $1.3 billion mortgage on the center. The group will also assume about $845 million in debt and other liabilities. The sale of the center is scheduled to be completed when the group submits a plan of reorganization to the United States Bankruptcy Court later this month.
The sale of the space to NBC should not make much difference for tenants and visitors to Rockefeller Center. NBC has been a tenant since the center opened in 1933, and the purchase represents neither a consolidation nor an expansion of its space. The network will continue to broadcast the "Today Show" from space in a nearby center building, 10 Rockefeller Plaza, which it did not buy. "It's really not going to mean much change for anybody," Mr. Siegel said.
But for Rockefeller Center itself, the sale represents yet another fray in the fabric of what had once been viewed as the All-American building complex, a place on every tourist's must-see list in New York.
Indeed, Americans outside New York as well as within the city were surprised when the Rockefeller Group took 12 of the center's 16 buildings public, through a real estate investment trust that in effect allowed shareholders to hold a mortgage on the center. For many, surprise was followed by dismay when, in 1989, this quintessentially American property was suddenly in Japanese hands, as the Rockefeller family sold an 80 percent stake in the Rockefeller Group to the Mitsubishi Estate Company.
The public's worst fears about the transaction were not realized. Life, both for tenants and tourists, was not appreciably different at the center under Japanese rule. Mitsubishi's worst fears, however, were realized. The real estate investment trust's debt service on Rockefeller Center had been predicated on having the annual rents rise as high as $65 a square foot by the early 1990's; the center was lucky to get half that amount after the recession hit.
Last year Mitsubishi walked away from its investment in Rockefeller Center as losses mounted, and the Rockefeller Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for its 12 landmarked buildings. Four other buildings that are either co-owned, or owned by others and managed by Rockefeller Center, were not included in the bankruptcy. Since then, various groups -- including one in which General Electric, the parent company of NBC, would have been a partner with the Chicago investor Sam Zell -- have negotiated to buy it.
For NBC, buying the space is a good deal. The current lease, which was signed in the landlords' market of 1986, included a huge rent increase next year. The purchase will thus save NBC a good deal of money during the next decade, according to real estate brokers.
"NBC got a real good buy, especially in light of the bump," one real estate executive said, referring to the scheduled rent increase. "From a landlord's point of view they signed one of the last great leases of the 80's, so buying their space is clearly a huge savings to them."
NBC will not talk finances, but Mr. Sherlock, its executive vice president, insists that cost was not the driving factor. He said the company wanted the flexibility to install technology and otherwise move people and furniture around without constantly having to deal with the Rockefeller Center bureaucracy. "We still have to get everything approved by the owner, but now that owner is us," Mr. Sherlock said.
NBC also got options to renew the lease on the space occupied by the "Today Show" studios, which were not included in the sale. The current lease, which runs out in 2003, can now be renewed through the year 2022. The new deal also included revisions of various restrictions the television operation had faced. For example, under its old lease, NBC had to hook and unhook the camera kiosks "Today" used to interact with people on the street; now they can be left up permanently if NBC wants.
There may soon be more for the network to show at Rockefeller Center. Television City, a theme restaurant, is scheduled to move into space recently vacated by Lindy's, and Orvis, an outdoor clothing shop, is said by real estate brokers to be negotiating for space occupied by Herman's, the sporting goods chain that has just announced plans to liquidate its stores.

HEADLINE: SUNY: Grand Vision and Pragmatism Collide

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The vision was a grand one: a state university system to rival California's, offering inexpensive education to students from Buffalo to Long Island and training a skilled work force to attract business to the state.
But three decades after Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller pushed the establishment of the nation's largest public system from a patchwork of teachers colleges and specialized schools, representatives of a new Republican governor say that the State University of New York does not work. 
 The governing trustees appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki describe SUNY in terms that could apply to the East German steel industry, circa 1988: a centralized, overregulated system whose lackluster campuses have little incentive to improve.
"Central planning is counterproductive," said Thomas F. Egan, the chairman of the board since February. "It saps the vitality and the resourcefulness of an administrator to perform better."
In this, he and the six other trustees appointed by Mr. Pataki last winter are at odds with the six Cuomo-era appointees, who say the problem is a lack of state aid, not too much central control. The dispute led to the resignation of Chancellor Thomas A. Bartlett this week.
The Rockefeller vision resulted in a sprawling system of 64 campuses, but without a distinguished flagship, no Ann Arbor or Berkeley or Chapel Hill.
With campuses in almost every legislative district, the sprawl of the system has created its own political pork. Legislators, particularly upstate Republicans, oppose anything that threatens the SUNY economic engine in their districts.
The $4 billion SUNY budget, which must be approved by the Legislature, props up lesser campuses at the expense of those with more potential, the Pataki appointees say. Only the universities -- Binghamton, Stony Brook, Buffalo and Albany -- and a couple of specialized campuses, like the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell or the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, enjoy anything approaching national reputations.
The Pataki appointees -- one vote shy of a majority on the 14-member board, which has one student member -- propose a free-market approach to give campuses control over their finances.
Campuses could retain budget surpluses; any extra money now goes back to Albany headquarters. They could set their own tuitions, so Binghamton might charge several thousand dollars a year more than Cortland. And, they could set individual academic standards.
This approach, they argue, would free campuses from central restraints and force them to compete for resources and students. Though critics say that some campuses will wither, Mr. Egan contends that the system will be healthier.
"You've got to give them a little more flexibility and freedom," Mr. Egan said.
In this, he is at odds with the older trustees, most of them appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and many administrators who say the system is lackluster because the state has cut its share of SUNY operations by more than a third since 1988.
Both sides agree on the need for cuts, but they disagree on how to achieve them. The Cuomo appointees believe that central headquarters should engage the campuses in a deliberate planning process to decide whether to close campuses. They argue against leaving those decisions to the vagaries of the market.
Mr. Bartlett, who was hired by the Cuomo board 16 months ago, has argued with the Pataki trustees over their approach. He resigned on Tuesday and will leave June 15, or earlier if a replacement is found.
"What is at stake is the view of the future direction of the university and what is to be the meaning of mission of access and quality in the future," he said in an interview.
Time and again, the SUNY officials and trustees have asked the Legislature for help, either by giving them more money or by allowing them to do what most state universities have done -- eliminate weaker departments to protect or expand the stronger ones.
"You and your colleagues in the Legislature must make the decision about the future of the State University," Chancellor Bartlett told a group of legislators at a hearing this winter. "We can only go so far in cost cutting. Then the challenge becomes one of public policy."
 
Political Ties For Rural Areas
But legislative ties run deep. A case in point is the Agricultural and Technical College at Cobleskill. In farm country 30 miles west of Albany, it offers farming courses, like the management of dairy herds and repair of tractors, as well as teacher training, hotel management and medical lab techniques to about 2,400 students. It typifies the Rockefeller philosophy: access to higher education for students who might not be able to travel far from home.
"My parents would never have let me leave home for school, but they were O.K. about me commuting to Cobleskill," said Susan Reilly, an education major. "This way, I can be home when they need me to help at harvest time, but I'm also learning a skill so I can get a job somewhere else."
Last year, when Mr. Pataki proposed cutting SUNY's operating budget by $290 million, out of a $920 million appropriation, the trustees announced that they might have to close campuses. Reports circulated that Cobleskill and the five other agricultural and technical colleges would be the ones. It costs SUNY $400 more to educate each student there than at the system's 16 four-year colleges and university centers because of their small size and expensive technical programs.
But Cobleskill is in Senator James L. Seward's district. The campus employs 496 people from Schoharie and surrounding counties, and brings in $6 million a year for businesses.
"It's the core of the economy in that area," said Mr. Seward, a Republican who is the chairman of the energy committee and a member of the higher education committee.
After a long battle, with upstate Republicans protecting their campuses, the Legislature restored some of the SUNY cuts. Democrats oppose closures because they believe students from throughout the state should have campuses nearby and because of the political support they receive from SUNY unions, like the United University Professors.
 
Beyond Education For Some Regions
Republicans do not want to lose the jobs and prestige a campus provides their districts. "Many campuses are the economic and cultural center for a region," said Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, the Republican chairman of the higher education committee in the Senate. "Closing these institutions really isn't a possibility."
So when Mr. Pataki named new trustees for the university system and sent them to the Senate for confirmation, Mr. Seward and his colleagues made their position clear. "They found out there were a number of members of the Senate who didn't want to hear any more talk about closure of these campuses," Mr. Seward said.
The new trustees took that message to heart, and the administration is trying to improve the marketing of the agriculture and technical schools by creating an alliance to cut overall administrative costs and to offer more classes through computer networks linking campuses. One campus would offer, say, the dairy management course; students on other campuses could take it.
For the new trustees, it is another example of how they are trying to help campuses become more competitive with private colleges and with one another.
"You should encourage each of those campuses to go out and reinvent itself, or recreate itself, or sharpen its focus, or even alter its mission to be more responsive to what it perceives to be its market," Mr. Egan said. "It will get everyone working harder to try to please parents and students."
He argues that the goal is improvement and expansion, not scuttling campuses. "I would like to look back at my tenure as chairman and say that the State University better educated more students," he said this week.
Both sets of trustees acknowledge that the state can no longer support SUNY as it once did. They say it is inefficient to run 64 campuses, including 30 community colleges, with an average size of 5,000 students rather than the national average of 9,000.
Chancellor Bartlett, who presided over two systems, Oregon and Alabama, that cut programs, believes that closing a few campuses is preferable to eroding quality on all, or "thinning the soup."
"I would prefer to make the system smaller," Chancellor Bartlett said. "The legitimacy of our programs is one thing we cannot give away."
In 1988, the state contributed $1.2 billion, or 90 percent, of the system's operating budget. This year, the state's contribution is $733 million, or 49 percent, , and under Mr. Pataki's proposed budget for 1996-97, it would fall to $661 million.
In the same period, tuition has more than doubled, to $3,400 this year from $1,375 in 1988. Tuition will rise at least $250 next year and as much as $700 or $800, depending on the budget agreement being negotiated in the Legislature.
Enrollment across the system dropped by 10,000 students this year and applications are down 8.5 percent, which officials attribute in part to increased tuition.
"We're shifting the responsibility for public higher education in the state of New York from the state to the students and their families," said Theodore Sommer, a trustee from Binghamton, who led a board committee that examined tuition last fall.
New York State's investment in higher education -- including SUNY, the City University of New York, financial aid and subsidies for private institutions -- is the third largest in the nation, behind California and Texas. But its investment per capita is 47th in the nation. Higher education made up 4.4 percent of the total state budget in 1995.
 
New Round of Cuts, For Faculty Now
 Most campus presidents say that after years of coping with budget gaps by cutting maintenance or administration, they now need layoffs.
At the College at New Paltz, Alice Chandler, the president, said she needs to eliminate the physical education requirement and close the department, a savings of $300,000 from the dismissals of six faculty members and several adjuncts.
And SUNY wants to shed its three large teaching hospitals -- Upstate, Downstate and at Stony Brook, L.I. Years behind much of the health care industry, these hospitals have not been permitted to form doctors' networks or participate in health maintenance organizations. The new trustees want to turn them over to private management.
If the Legislature refuses to give SUNY budget authority for a free-market approach, some trustees say they will be unable to balance the books.
"This devolution plan is really the deliverance of SUNY," said Candace de Russy, one of the more vocal of the Pataki appointees. "Those who do not back devolution will be responsible for putting campus closure back on the table."
But SUNY traditionalists believe that closures are inevitable under the free-market plans, carried in a policy document the trustees wrote last fall called "Rethinking SUNY."
"Rethink SUNY means Downsize SUNY," said Edward C. Sullivan, a Democrat from Manhattan who is the chairman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee.
The trustees must manage an ever-shrinking budget without the freedom to treat the university as a business, unless the state chooses to add financial support.
"There's this notion that SUNY is very big and it is something that New York State can't afford," a former chancellor, D. Bruce Johnstone, said in a recent interview. "New York State may not choose to afford it, but that's not the same thing."

HEADLINE: Stupid Baseball Tricks

BYLINE: By Tom Friend; Tom Friend is the West Coast sports correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE MAN WHO WOULD SAVE baseball keeps Bazooka bubble gum in his front pocket. "Addicted," he says. He also has coins in his pocket, in case he stumbles upon an arcade. He isn't above racing with 14-year-olds to get to the best video games first, and he usually wins. "I kick kids out of the way," he says.
He also keeps a pen in his pocket, in case he sees a napkin. Sometimes he writes ideas on these napkins and files them under B -- for Brainstorms. "But, mostly, I doodle on them," he says. "Do it all the time. Pathetic. My wife thinks I'm mad. I tell her, 'If you think I'm mad, why'd you marry me?' " His hair is silver, his neckties are pink, his accent is Australian and, when he can't find a napkin, he writes on an easel that he carries from room to room.
A career counselor would spend 30 minutes with this 49-year-old man and assign him a most eccentric place. A place that tolerates surprise trips to the amusement park, napkin memos, an easel-on-wheels and jars of candy. A place that is insane enough to put baseball in its front pocket.
Fox Sports. 
 Fox, the network of the 90's, is about to take on the sport of the 50's. Rupert Murdoch will pay $565 million over the next five years to telecast the most selfish professional sport on earth, and the man leading the way -- David Hill, president of Fox Sports and occupant of a Sunset Boulevard office full of licorice -- fell asleep on his sofa last year during the fifth inning of a broadcast. The closest sport to baseball Hill has ever televised is cricket, which makes him about as qualified as . . . CBS.
Beginning in 1990, CBS paid $1.06 billion over four years to televise baseball -- and about five people watched. The network has itself, baseball owners, a recession and cable television to blame, but the essential fact is that baseball became terminally ill under CBS's watch. "Everyone at CBS who cared about the game felt like they went through hell with it," says Ed Goren, a former CBS executive who is now the executive producer of Fox Sports.
In its heyday, televised baseball had bonded grandfather, father and son. From 1953 to 1989, the Saturday-afternoon time slot for the Game of the Week had been written in granite at NBC. With little competition from local and cable television -- in the early 1970's, for instance, the Los Angeles Dodgers televised only their nine games up in San Francisco against the Giants -- ratings rose as high as 7.6 in 1978. (One rating point now equals roughly 954,000 homes).
But the Saturday afternoon ratings plummeted as the sport inundated local and cable television. By 1985, NBC's Saturday baseball ratings had sunk to 6.4 and by 1989, NBC's final year, the ratings had plunged to a subarctic 4.9. The ratings fell not only because baseball was overexposed; a new generation had taken over the remote, and basketball and football were now the preferred sports.
Neither CBS nor major league baseball had an antidote. CBS's ratings went from a 4.7 in its debut year of 1990 to a dismal 3.7 in its final year of 1993. By 1993, 30-second commercials were going for a minimal $15,000 to $20,000, and even the 55-and-over audience was scratching its head because CBS would show only an occasional Saturday Game of the Week. Viewers never knew when to tune in, and, by the tragic end, CBS had lost half a billion dollars.
"If you brought back Harry Coyle, Curt Gowdy, Tony Kubek, Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola as announcers," says Bob Costas of NBC, "the Saturday Game of the Week could still never get the same ratings as before."
SO, HOW LONG DID IT TAKE DAVID HILL TO agree to take on this foolish sport of baseball?
"A nanosecond," he says.
Fox executives, are arrogant to the core, and believe they could market even a game of pool. Reviving baseball is either the hip-retro thing to do or suicide, but Fox is diving in, assuming that baseball fans have no lawns to mow and that younger viewers have an attention span longer than 30 minutes. "We're the best marketers in all of sports -- us and Nike, that is," says a Fox executive. Of course, baseball has nowhere to go but up. If Fox fails, no one will blame the messenger; they will blame the game.
So, the master plan is to reach back into the 1970's and show Fox Saturday Baseball like clockwork, starting June 1 and ending the last weekend of the season. They will probably need a dramatic post-season to break even financially, and they can only hope Randy Johnson pitches every Saturday -- because all their pregame hyperbole won't help a bit once the games start.
Fox Sports had talked the same good game when it stole football from CBS. But its regular season ratings in 1994, its first year, were 6 percent worse than CBS's final season (12.1 for Fox versus 12.9 for CBS) and 3 percent worse in 1995. Of course, it may have taken the public some time to find Fox on the dial. But the point is, football is football, and Fox probably cannot reinvent baseball, either. "Actually, the game doesn't need that much," Goren says. "A tweak here, a tweak there."
Fox will televise four games regionally -- with few exceptions, the games will start at 1 P.M. locally -- and no other network (cable or local) will be allowed to show a Saturday afternoon game. Fox will then share the playoffs with NBC and ESPN, televise the World Series three times in five years, sell 30-second commericals for about $50,000 in the regular season and $300,000 in the World Series and try something baseball has never fully comprehended: promotion.
If ever a sport needed a personality transplant, it is baseball. The players do not always do interviews (witness Albert Belle of Cleveland, profanely trying to drive NBC's Hannah Storm from the dugout for no apparent reason before a World Series game). In 1994, they did not even do the World Series. They went on strike that summer, and when they finally returned last spring, attendance and ratings were down. Baseball was not so much a pastime as past its prime.
The sport has taken baby steps back, of course: Cal Ripken Jr.'s record for consecutive games played, the electric Yankee-Mariner playoff series and the usual ratings bonanza for the World Series. But Fox is about to ask people to stay indoors on a summer Saturday afternoon, and it is going to need a gimmick or Cal Ripken Jr. or both.
David Hill considered all of this during a January business meeting. He pulled out his black pen, could not find a napkin, settled for his daily planner and ended up drawing a microphoned base -- as in second base. The same network that invented the glowing hockey puck would now invent a base with ears. Does Roberto Alomar say, "Hey batter, batter . . . swing"? What does the runner at first say to the first baseman? Now we would know. David Hill sat in a daze that day, intending to turn baseball into another video game. Maybe this would get kids watching, and maybe it would keep him from snoring in the fifth inning.
He called his staff together and read them the rules. They would invent a new base; they would invent new music; they would make Albert Belle likable; they would hire announcers with famous announcer dads (or granddads); they would all watch "Field of Dreams" and "Bull Durham"; they would build their own Fox Field; they would be different for the sake of being different.
"And one more thing," Hill told his top executives. "If anybody talks about any dead guys during a broadcast, I'll sack 'em. I'm sick of dead guys! Whenever I turn on baseball, all I hear about is dead guys. If I hear a name, I'm gonna ask, 'Is he dead?' And if he is, you're fired. You're all fired!"
IT IS A MATCH MADE IN MAD MAGAZINE: baseball and Fox.
Baseball, for instance, cannot even get out of its own way. The men who run the game have no idea how to market it. Their idea of promotion is a stadium billboard saying, "Game Tonight."
"Yes, we've been conservative," says the acting commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig. "Does baseball have to lighten up? You bet we do."
Fox has several suggestions, and not one of them is a glow-in-the-dark baseball. Fox intends to aid the viewer in more subtle ways, like turning the base runner into a dot.
For instance, if a runner is on first, and the camera is zeroing in on the pitcher-batter confrontation, Fox's graphic department might place a miniature diamond in the bottom corner of the screen. And when the runner moves, he will be represented by a dot in that miniature diamond. So, if there is a single to right field and you want to know if the runner is rounding second, just follow the dots.
"Cool," says Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres. "Did you see ABC, NBC or CBS trying anything innovative like that? Heck no."
Of course, the graphic is not written in stone -- "How often do we put it up? And will it be distracting to the viewer?" asks George Greenberg, the creative director of Fox Sports -- but what is written in stone is Fox's baseball theme song.
"Guess what?" Greenberg says. "It's not 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame.' "
Greenberg put Hank Williams's music on ABC's "Monday Night Football" eight years ago and was urged in a frenetic phone call from Hill -- from an amusement park -- to put "Batman"-style music on Fox's football telecasts. "I want Batman plays football," Hill told him.
The baseball theme is a sort of "Tom Petty plays baseball." It has a lot of guitar, and will be accompanied visually by a 21st-century, robotic baseball player straight out of the video game Virtual Fighter.
The theme song will lead into an interactive pregame show that is an all-or-nothing attempt at romancing the 16-and-under population. Called "In the Zone," the show is part sitcom -- a teen-ager needs money to repair his VW bug, and forces his little brother to take a job as a Dodger Stadium vendor -- and part instructional. Kids will be taught how to steal a base, how to bunt and how to have their wishes come true. One segment, called Cyber-base, will invite kids to E-mail their fantasies, which Fox will then bring to life. Over Easter weekend alone, the network received 40 such requests, including one from a 13-year-old who wrote: "I want to take Ken Griffey to school with me. He could come to all my classes and even eat lunch with me."
There will also be segments called Away From the Plate (human interest stories about major-league players who, for instance, adopt children or who love to bowl), and the Hot Corner (a trendy round-up of baseball news and fashion, like whether to wear baseball caps backward this year). There is also the obligatory bloopers segment, and Fox executives nearly approved a feature called Hot Foot -- glorifying a prank of the week, like a player setting a teammate's cleats on fire -- until they realized that would set a poor example for their young audience.
Considering that the sport is failing to reach younger fans, this is baseball's rare chance to charm a new, impressionable generation. Atlanta's Cy Young Award winner, Greg Maddux, is scheduled to play Sega on the show -- which should help ratings -- and the hope is that these youngsters might just stay tuned for the adult pregame show at 12:30.
Not that the 12:30 show is designed for your grandfather. It will be staged in front of a stadium scoreboard and will showcase Steve Lyons, baseball's version of Terry Bradshaw. Lyons, who is known as Psycho, is the former Red Sox and White Sox player who once yanked down his uniform pants in front of 35,000 fans, so he had just the resume for Fox. With him will be Dave Winfield, the former Yankee who may finally get the last word on George Steinbrenner. The straight man will be Chip Caray, son of the Braves broadcaster Skip Caray and grandson of the legendary Cubs broadcaster, Harry Caray.
Fox's game analysts, meanwhile, are three extroverted former catchers -- Bob Brenley, Jeff Torborg and Tim McCarver -- and Ken Singleton, a former outfielder. It is a solid team, but traditional, one your grandfather would feel comfortable with. Baseball needs something more.
This is where the microphoned base comes in.
It is bound to be a contentious negotiation. Baseball would not dare let CBS put a mike in the bullpen, so the notion of a microphoned base seems implausible. Hill, who was to pitch the idea to Selig this spring, insists he is not doing it for gossip, but simply for the sounds of the game.
"I don't want to hear infielders," Hill says. "Because probably I lose our license."
On the other hand, it has been done -- sort of. In the 1970's Tommy Lasorda, then a Dodger third-base coach, was miked during several games and kept it fairly clean. During one conversation with Pete Rose, then the Reds' third baseman, Lasorda said, "Pete, our team just voted on who's the best-looking guy on your team."
"How'd I do?" Rose asked.
"You finished second," Lasorda said.
"Who's first?" Rose asked.
"The other 24 tied," Lasorda said.
Baseball fans adored it. Fox executives privately want to do it again -- 90's style -- but will have to win a unanimous vote of approval from the owners. "We're hopeful, but anyone can veto it," Goren says. But Fox also has baseball right where it wants it -- desperate -- so their innovations should win in a landslide.
"They have to trust us," Goren says of baseball. "We're not the enemy."
Selig agrees, up to a point. "You must remember there are some sensitive lines we can't cross. We can't disturb the game, but it's also in our best interest to listen. We can't be rigid in our thinking. We're in a new era, a new generation.
"One thing's for sure -- we can't do business the way we used to."
Fox seconds that emotion. The network has just hired the best play-by-play broadcasters nepotism can buy. They already had Caray in the studio, but now their lead game announcer will be Joe Buck, the son of the St. Louis announcer Jack Buck, accompanied by Thom Brenneman, son of the Reds announcer Marty -- and two more will be hired. "See, we're not rounding up the usual suspects," Goren says.
Of course, these sons and grandsons will do fine, as long as they remember the rule: no dead guys. "I'm only 27," says Buck. "How many dead guys could I have known?"
THE NETWORK THAT WOULD SAVE baseball first has to mingle with baseball.
It must make small talk with baseball the same way it did with football. The same way it persuaded Reggie White to sing "Amazing Grace" for Fox viewers on camera. The same way it cajoled Nate Newton, the rotund Dallas Cowboys lineman, into inviting a camera crew into his walk-in refrigerator.
They must also win over baseball's cabinet members -- Ken Griffey Jr. and Cal Ripken Jr., to name two.
Fox's marketing director, Tracy Dolgin, was assigned to Griffey. He flew down to spring training and (a day before breaking his arm skiing) extended his hand to the superstar. "Hi, I'm Tracy Dolgin."
"I'm George Griffey. . . . But don't call me that. Only my mom gets away with calling me George."
"O.K. Nice to meet you, George."
"You like your shins?"
Right away, Griffey and Fox were speaking the same language, so it was 1 down, 41 players to go: Fox's plan was to shoot promotional ads with 21 teams (two players from each) to extract some personality from the sport.
The key figure in Fox's marketing plan is Cal Ripken of Baltimore. He had broken Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak last summer -- which had helped revive the sport -- and Fox desperately needed to turn him into a comic.
Good luck, said Ripken's little brother, Bill. "I mean, the night Cal broke Gehrig's record, he went out and painted the town beige," he said.
Goren was assigned, nevertheless, to Cal. They met for breakfast in Beverly Hills, Goren handed him five scripts and Ripken shocked him by begging to do three of them. One commercial had Ripken being razzed by a mailman, who had never missed a day of work either -- even with barking dogs. Another revealed that Ripken set the record with the help of an evil twin, Hal Ripken, who lived in a trailer park. The third, a 60-second spot to be shown in movie theaters this summer, shows Ripken being run over by a speeding truck, hurtling 100 feet into a water fountain and still saying: "I can play tomorrow. It's just a scratch."
"We Wile E. Coyote him," Dolgin says.
To get an idea how much the spot meant to Ripken, he even took half a day off to film it.
All 42 players not only did the commericals for free, they also promised to stop by Hollywood this summer to check out Fox Field -- a portable diamond now under construction in a narrow, concrete alley adjacent to the studio. The field will be used on game days for television demonstrations and it will have a Green Monster, a pitcher's mound, a batting cage and -- if David Hill gets his way as usual -- grass.
"Well, as you know," says Greenberg with a wan smile, "Fox grass is purple."
 
Fox's Ad Campaign: An Attitude Adjustment
 
Commercial No. 1: Matt Williams, the Giants' third baseman, bald since high school, is backing out of his driveway in his 1969 Camaro convertible.
A chubby young fan asks him to stop. "Excuse me," the boy says, "aren't you Matt Williams?" The camera zooms in on Williams, who is wearing an enormous head of wavy black hair and black shades.
"You play third base for the Giants, right?" the chubby kid asks.
"I'm kind of in a hurry," Williams replies.
The fan looks at a baseball card of Williams in which he's bald, looks back at Williams and says, "Wait. . . . Something's different."
Williams says, "I really have to go."
The camera then focuses on the baseball card to show a close-up of Williams's shiny pate. "Ahh," says the kid, "wait a minute. . . . sunglasses."
Williams looks in the rearview mirror, slicks back his hair with both hands and zooms away.
The theme from "Miami Vice" kicks in. "Baseball on Fox. Same Game. New Attitude."
Commercial No. 2: Tino Martinez, the newest Yankee first baseman, is lying on a psychiatrist's couch and rambling. "You know, in Seattle, I was always 'that other Martinez,' " he says, referring to the Mariner designated hitter, Edgar Martinez. "I hit 31 homers last year, had 111 R.B.I., but it was always 'Edgar this,' and 'Edgar that.' "
The camera pans the psychiatrist's wall, on which hang pictures of Lou Gehrig and Don Mattingly, the legendary Yankee first basemen. "But, you know," he continues, "with the Yankees I'll have a chance to be my own Martinez, to not live under someone else's shadow."
The camera then shows the psychiatrist's note pad, which has a list of Yankee first basemen: Lou Gehrig. Don Mattingly. Tino Martinez????
The doctor nods at his patient and writes one last note: "Who's this guy kidding?" Rock-and-roll music kicks in. "Baseball on Fox. Same Game. New Attitude."
Commercial No. 3: Randy Johnson, the hard-throwing Cy Young Award winner for Seattle, has a paper route in his spare time, and no one knows why. From his station wagon, he's throwing newspapers onto people's front porches. One curves and breaks a window. Another is a fast ball that flies through a small window and hits a fat man in the shower.
It's evident that this isn't Johnson's first trip through the neighborhood. When they see him coming, people start running for cover. "Obviously, it's not for the money," Johnson says, casually talking to the camera while a man dives inside a front door. "I guess I just like people."
Music. "Baseball on Fox. Same Game. New Attitude."

HEADLINE: Why the Best Doesn't Always Win

BYLINE: By Peter Passell; Peter Passell writes about economics for The Times. His last article for the Magazine, "The Rich: How They Spend It," appeared in November.

 BODY:
APPLE COMPUTER, THE COMPANY THAT BROUGHT YOU THE idiot-friendly Macintosh, is staring at bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the great army of technocrats at Microsoft, which only last year managed to reproduce the look and feel of a 1980's Mac, lumbers on, invincible.
A bad break for Apple? A rare exception to the Darwinian rules in which the best products win the hearts and dollars of consumers? No. Economists are finally beginning to acknowledge what others have long suspected: the best doesn't always win. Just as biologists are challenging the idea that natural selection drives evolution along "efficient" and predictable paths, economists are discovering the disorder that lurks in the shadows of their simple, elegant models of capitalist progress. Adam Smith's invisible hand, it seems, does not always assure that superior technology will survive the rough-and-tumble of the free market. 
 Recent wisdom on this subject dates back to 1985. That's the year Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford University, published an article about QWERTY in The American Economic Review. Q-W-E-R-T-Y, of course, are the first six letters on the upper left of the typewriter keyboard -- the universal standard since the 1890's. But why these? Why not one of half a dozen other keyboard layouts that are said to permit faster typing?
David's answer is that QWERTY was the solution to a fleeting technological problem, an arrangement that would minimize the jamming of keys in primitive typewriters. While this explanation has since been challenged, what matters is that one keyboard, chosen for reasons long irrelevant, remains the standard. For all their ingenuity, competing designs have made about as much headway against QWERTY as Esperanto has made against English. That's because a standardized layout allows typists to learn just one keyboard in order to use all. Once thousands of people had learned to type using QWERTY's merely adequate layout, the technology was effectively locked in. Keyboard design is thus the classic example of "path dependence," the idea that small, random events at critical moments can determine choices in technology that are extremely difficult and expensive to change.
In the typical path-dependence scenario, producers or consumers see one technology as slightly superior. This edge quickly snowballs into clear economic advantage: production costs fall with greater experience in manufacturing, and consumer acceptance grows with greater familiarity. And along the way, the weight of numbers makes the leading product more valuable than one based on competing technologies. With more MS-DOS computers around, it pays to write software to the Microsoft standard, which in turn makes it more useful to own an MS-DOS computer.
The most familiar example of path dependence is the triumph of Matsushita's VHS standard for videocassette recorders over Sony's Betamax. Betamax was first and, by most accounts, better. But Sony made two strategic marketing errors. To get the product out the door faster, it initially sold Betamax machines that played one-hour tapes -- too short for an entire movie. And to sell more Sony machines, the company chose not to license Betamax to competitors.
VHS, introduced a year later, in 1976, played two-hour tapes. And since Matsushita freely licensed the technology, half a dozen other brand-name VHS players hit the stores in a matter of months. Sony soon countered with a two-hour machine, but it was too late.
While VHS versus Betamax makes great fodder for business school seminars, the outcome hardly made the earth move. The stakes have been much higher in technologies that are now so entrenched it's hard to imagine the world without them. Take the automobile engine. At the turn of the century, gasoline was locked in a three-way race with steam and electric power. The Stanley Steamer was a technological marvel, setting a world speed record of 122 miles an hour in 1909. But the manufacturer priced the car as a luxury, never trying to achieve the economies of mass production and of "learning by doing" that might have made it the people's car.
Moreover, steam's economic problems were compounded by an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in 1914 that briefly closed public horse troughs and denied steam cars a convenient source of water for their perpetually thirsty boilers. With better technology or simply many more steam cars on the road, this liability would have evaporated. But car buyers had little incentive to make a leap of faith when plausible alternatives were available. One of those alternatives was the electric car, whose weakness was a driving range limited by the storage capacity of its batteries. That problem seemed well on its way to solution around 1915. But innovators in the battery industry were distracted by the more immediate need to perfect a high-amperage battery to crank the new electric starters in cars with gasoline engines.
Apparently all the gasoline engine needed to triumph was a brief period in which its technological and price edge led to rapidly expanding sales. This cut production costs, which expanded sales even more -- and made it more convenient to fuel and service gasoline vehicles.
Today, of course, dependence on gasoline engines is a fact of life. While electric or steam vehicles would reduce air pollution and dependence on imported oil, it would take an investment of tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars to leap the technological chasm. Indeed, California, which has mandated the use of electric cars, is just now facing the reality that the existing technology is wretchedly inadequate to the task.
Robin Cowan of the University of Western Ontario offers a second cautionary tale of path dependence. The world is stuck with another functional, but environmentally problematic, technology: the "light water" nuclear reactor, whose momentary superiority over reactors that use inert gases led to the virtual abandonment of alternatives.
In the mid-1950's there was no particular reason to believe that light-water reactors were the cheapest to build and operate. But the Navy invested heavily in light water, which was seen as the most compact and reliable design for submarines and aircraft carriers. When Washington pressed for a quick scale-up to commercial nuclear power after the Soviet Union exploded a nuclear weapon, American manufacturers took the route of least technological resistance.
Later, Washington used subsidies for design and manufacturing to persuade the Europeans to switch to a light-water standard. And once light-water reactors were produced in quantity, the manufacturers learned-by-doing, cutting costs well below those of competing designs.
Perhaps light-water reactors would have prevailed in any event. But there is little doubt that a competing gas-graphite system was safer because it offered greater protection against catastrophic loss of coolant. With global warming now looming, the "lock-in" to atmospherically benign -- but widely feared -- light-water nuclear technology must count as an opportunity lost.
If path dependence is such a big deal, why are college freshmen unlikely to encounter the idea in Econ. 101? Brian Arthur, a pioneer in the field at Stanford in the early 1980's who now does research at the Santa Fe Institute, blames tradition-bound economists. Put it another way: the "technology" of modern economics is itself path dependent, because economists have so much invested elsewhere.
More important, free marketeers fear that path dependence will become a rationale for bigger government -- and is thus the Devil's work. If competitive markets do not guarantee that the best technologies survive, the thinking goes, surely sometime-liberals like Bill Clinton will be more tempted to try to pick winners.
The twist here is that the perspective of path dependence offers no succor to industrial-policy enthusiasts. It was Washington, after all, that locked in light-water nuclear reactor technology. And it was Tokyo that cursed its manufacturers with a high-definition television that was obsolete before the first receiver was sold.
But a world haunted by path dependence does cry out for a different sort of intervention. Government as the referee who makes everyone play by the same impartial rules is not quite enough.
The first goal is to get government to slow down and think twice before setting hard-to-reverse technological standards. The Federal Communications Commission was criticized for dragging its feet on setting standards for the new high-definition television. Because it dawdled, however, digital technology had a chance to prove itself before the F.C.C. got around to writing the final rules. But the lesson also applies to cases that everyone would rather forget, like Washington's premature decision to back recyclable space shuttles over throwaway rocket launchers.
The more controversial issue is antitrust -- think Microsoft. It often pays an individual company to set a standard by flexing its own marketing muscle long before a clear winner has emerged. And the risks of path dependence suggest that Washington would do well to slow such private standard-setting until competitors had a chance to strut their stuff.
The Government will no doubt be called on to take a stand on some looming path-dependence battles: all-purpose personal computers versus cheaper, appliance-like "network computers" that do one thing well; wireless personal communications versus high-capacity cable; Internet software built around Netscape's browser versus software that piggy-backs on the Microsoft Network.
Would Adam Smith approve of venturing where the invisible hand doesn't have a clue? Perhaps not. But then the old guy never had to worry about Microsoft's clumsy software chewing up a chapter of "The Wealth of Nations."

HEADLINE: Fresh Faces Are Making an Impact on the L.I. Landscape

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
ON the surface, Port Washington is a quintessential Long Island suburb, peopled by yuppie commuters clutching Starbucks coffee cups and bound for the next train to Pennsylvania Station.
Its Main Street is so prim that the locals are leery of sharing the sidewalk with McDonald's, but they have quietly made room for one bodega, two international money couriers, a Spanish-speaking domestic service and a pay telephone center where lonely immigrants squeeze into special booths to summon the sweet voices of home in El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. 
 Off Main Street, its fortresslike stone Roman Catholic church, St. Peter's, is crowded on Sunday mornings with immigrants from El Salvador -- women who work as live-in maids for as little as $150 a week and men who struggle to pay rent and send money home to Central America on a landscaper's pay.
These are the new faces of Long Island, immigrants who made up more than a third of the people who moved to the island last year while a majority of people departing were native-born, many of them retirees or former military workers.
The trend is as visible as the restaurants selling pupusa meat pies in Hempstead, where the concentration of Salvadorans is so large that the Republic of El Salvador briefly opened a satellite Government office and some residents have nicknamed the area Little El Salvador.
According to March estimates by the Census Bureau, the net international immigration to Nassau County was 28,993, and 18,229 to Suffolk County. But Census experts consider the unofficial growth rate much higher because it does not count undocumented immigrants.
"We estimate that there are about 100,000 Salvadorans living in Hempstead, Freeport and Uniondale," said Miguel Ramirez, president of the Centro Salvadoreno, a Hempstead community organization for Salvadorans. "It's not growing as dramatically as it was before, mainly because it's more difficult for undocumented people to get a job. All these myths have been created that we're stealing jobs from U.S. citizens."
This is the season to spot the latest immigration trends, when the street corners of communities like Westbury and Franklin Square or Glen Cove and Inwood fill with immigrant day laborers in search of gritty work as landscapers and construction workers. Many are so new to the country that they need to use a special list of basic English expressions provided by a local community group. The list carefully spells out the phonetic pronunciations: "I want to work on the books!" and "I have rights, too."
Already, one community organizer, Omar Henriquez of the Workplace Project in Hempstead, has noticed the early signs of new immigration streams from other countries. "On some corners, there are more Hondurans now than Salvadorans," he said."In others, there are more Mexicans. I don't know what's happening in Honduras, but there must be something going on there with the economy. There's a lot more coming."
The new Census estimates do not give an ethnic breakdown of the newcomers, but anecdotal evidence indicates they are mostly Asian and Hispanic. Long Island's original immigrants were English Protestants, who squeezed out the native Indians and dominated the area from the colonial period to World War I.
The development of aircraft industries and suburban housing led to a new wave of immigration after World War II, and an influx of people of mostly Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Russian backgrounds.
And now, with yet a third wave of immigration, members of some of the earlier ethnic groups are watching with some dismay as a pattern unfolds that they experienced themselves. Since 1979, Salvadorans have come searching for the same kind of low-wage, unskilled jobs that drew Italian immigrants to Glen Cove decades earlier to work on the great estates of the Gold Coast.
The Salvadoran population was originally small, but in a common pattern of immigration, the original pioneer scouts invited their relatives. Their numbers grew through the pull of jobs and the push of the intensifying 12-year civil war in El Salvador, which ended in 1992. Their numbers grew, through the push of war and the pull of jobs. Most came from the rural town of Poloros in the province of La Union, where much of the fighting was concentrated.
Italians remain the largest ethnic group in Glen Cove, but now the Loggia Sons of Italyshares the main street downtown with a Hispanic grocery store. The rest of the community also shares a parking lot with a group of immigrant men who gather early mornings in search of day work. But the arrangement is not always amicable; typically police enforcement against such offenses as loitering or disorderly behavior becomes tougher and more unyielding in the months before a mayoral election.
With the start of the spring landcaping season, the same tensions are already starting to surface in other communities like Westbury, where the immigrant day workers and the local police recently met to develop a compromise labor site after complaints increased about the gathering of the men.
But as long as there is demand for their labor, the corners will not be empty. "In suburban communities and the rest of the country, you can expect to see more immigration," said Douglas Massey, a University of Pennsylvania sociology professor who has studied immigration trends. "Immigration goes where the low-wage jobs are. And as those jobs shift from the cities to suburbs, they will be there."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
State's Biggest Residential Renter Keeps Growing

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THREE years ago three senior management partners of Trammell Crow Residential's Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Groups, two of them based in New Canaan and one in Alexandria, Va., decided that given the tortuous process of borrowing money for development in a recession it was worth the risk to go public.
That was a direction that Trammell Crow, the groups' parent and one of the country's largest privately financed builders, did not wish to follow, so an amicable parting was arranged. A new company called Avalon Properties was formed as a REIT, based in Wilton, with offices in Alexandria and Richmond, Va., Braintree, Mass., and Princeton, N.J. 
 In Connecticut alone, the company, which builds, owns and manages rental complexes, has 3,296 units completed or under way in Middletown, Manchester, Hamden, Stamford, Trumbull and Wilton. It is the state's biggest residential landlord.
Avalon Properties is headed by Richard L. Michaux, 52, chairman of the board and chief executive; Charles H. Berman, 42, president and chief operating officer, and Samuel B. Fuller, 34, vice president of development.
They took over the 8,500 rental apartments that they had built under the Trammell Crow banner since 1988 and "the Crow family and I took stock in exchange," said J. Ronald Terwilliger, national managing partner of Trammell Crow Residential in Atlanta.
"We still hold the stock and we're very pleased with their management," he added. "They have been in a dominant position among the top Real Estate Investment Trusts in the Northeast."
(A real estate investment trust is an entity, usually publicly owned, that invests in real estate and pays out at least 95 percent of its taxable income as dividends to investors. The entity essentially pays no taxes.)
Since 1993 Avalon has completed 1,255 units, with 2,500 more under way, and has acquired 2,745 units in addition to those from Trammell Crow. Some of the 2,745 "were in foreclosure with 15 percent occupancy rates," said Mr. Berman, "but with extensive renovation they have outperformed our expectations."
Currently, Avalon's total of approximately 11,807 apartments, reaching from Massachusetts to Virginia, are 95.7 percent occupied. Its revenues for 1995 were $97.2 million, and it recently crossed the $1 billion mark in market capitalization.
In Connecticut, the 400-unit Avalon Grove in Stamford will open in June. Avalon Gates is near completion in Trumbull with 107 of its 240 units already leased -- some to corporations and nearby colleges. And the 102-unit Avalon Springs will l open in Wilton in mid-May. They will variously offer one- to three-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 700 to 1,900 square feet, priced from $950 to $2,575 a month.
T HE development company was named for the Avalon of Arthurian legend -- that final Elysian resting place of heroes. The Avalon system of management is called "Legendary Service," and it seems to work, judging by the high percentage of satisfied customers who live in its low-rise, village-style communities.
At the 238-unit Avalon Glen, which opened in Stamford in 1991, praise from tenants is almost numbingly repetitious. "If something goes wrong you just call up and they come and fix it," said Kathleen Nagle, a tenant who is a retailing director at Nine West Corporation, a women's shoe manufacturer based in Stamford. "Whenever you renew your lease they clean the carpeting and touch up the painting." She is moving into one of the larger apartments.
"We moved in when I was pregnant," said Faith Schachne, a three-year resident, "and my husband travels a lot. The atmosphere here is warm, enclosed, friendly -- especially in summer, when everything is centered around the courtyard and pool. We've made great friends -- that's unusual for apartment buildings." She and many other tenants will attend the imminent wedding of the building's supervisor, Paul G. O'Bday.
Lee Spenadel, a computer networking director for Viacom, the entertainment conglomerate, met a woman in the elevator, he said, with whom he is taking a larger apartment. "I grew up in Manhattan and I didn't want the impersonal, high-rise lifestyle any more. This is unique in the marketplace -- the pool, the workout room, the racquetball court, the parties and events that the management puts on for the residents."
Hotel-style services and amenities are becoming popular within the industry but Avalon was one of the first to recognize their importance in a changing suburban demography. Affluent professionals and managers who wanted service rather than home ownership, empty-nesters and people whose lives were in transition through job relocation, divorce or a new marriage, had little choice in housing.
"People talk a lot about location," said Mr. Michaux, "but timing is very important. We had great timing." By 1993 the Northeast had been virtually written off by developers, most of whom had focused on suburban single family housing.
"The rental market in the Northeast was dramatically underserved and underzoned for the demand," said Mr. Berman. In Connecticut, rejection of Avalon's proposals prompted litigation against the towns of Trumbull and New Canaan. Trumbull settled, but the New Canaan case is still winding its way through the courts.
In both instances Avalon used a state program in which 20 percent of the units are designated for rent at below-market rate. The developer is permitted higher density in return for maintaining the units for 30 years at the lower rate.
"In New Canaan," said Mr. Fuller, "the units would rent for $800 to $1,000 less to people with incomes at 80 percent of the $77,000 median for the area." Resist as they may, towns rarely prevail against judges who are carrying out a state mandate that requires municipalities to show cause why such development is injurious to the community.
"It's a useful way to build in towns that we hope will embrace our complexes," said Mr. Michaux. "When they see that they are just short of a country club there's a more positive reaction."
Libraries, handsomely furnished club rooms with kitchenettes for parties, lifeguarded pools, indoor and outdoor basketball and volleyball courts, fully equipped outdoor playgrounds and indoor fitness centers, and security and fire-alarm systems are standard features, as are decks or patios, heated storage sheds, and soundproof construction. Garage space costs about $75 a month and is the only extra charge.
A RCHITECTS are hired at the local level to insure neighborhood compatibility and focus groups are held with adjacent property owners and prospective renters to determine preferences for everything from siting to appliances to closet sizes, which are 6-by-8 to 6-by-12 feet.
Stamford, with its urgent demand for upscale rentals, has seen the construction of such luxury high-rises as Canterbury Green, The Biltmore, The Classic, and The Fairfield, some with pools, lounges and fitness rooms. Square footage and prices are slightly lower than Avalon's and vacancies are rare.
"Now that Avalon Grove is coming in with 400 new units, and The Fairfield has 95 new units under construction, we may see prices driven down a bit," said Jan Melikan, president of the Stamford Board of Realtors and a broker with Coldwell Banker.
To become residents of an Avalon community applicants for apartments must submit detailed, documented financial histories certifying an income and/or savings equal to 30 percent of a lease, which range from 7 to 16 months. Late rent payments are subject to a 10 to 20 percent penalty. However, if a tenant is unhappy for any reason, the management will terminate the lease after 30 days and refund the security deposit, minus any damages.
"By 2002," Mr. Michaux said, "we expect to grow to a $2.5 billion company, all Northeast and Mid-Atlantic development and acquisition -- and all rental."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Briarwood, Queens;
Where Cultural Diversity Is an Old Habit

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
FRIENDS used to ask Seymour Schwartz why he stayed in Briarwood, Queens, when he could be living in the suburbs of southern Connecticut.
"I could have lived anywhere, economically it was no problem," said Mr. Schwartz, 70, a retired pharmaceutical industry executive and co-president of the Briarwood Civic Association. "But I never felt the need. Here everyone who passes my door greets me. You can't get that in a purely suburban environment." 
 Bordered by four major roadways, the rectangular Briarwood neighborhood is a predominantly middle-income, multi-ethnic community of one- and two-family houses interspersed with five-, six- and seven-story apartment buildings, nearly all now co-ops.
Mr. Schwartz is not alone in placing community togetherness high on the list of Briarwood's virtues. Others remark on convenient subway and bus connections to Manhattan, arrays of stores and shops on Queens Boulevard and bordering roadways, and a relaxed and accepting attitude about cultural diversity, an old habit here.
Realtors say the market for one- and two-family detached and unattached houses is strong. "Briarwood is very desirable, people want it, so there's an excellent market," said Jennifer Dupree, the office manager at Century 21 Big M Realty on Hillside Avenue.
Bill Blumenthal, a sales agent at Mattone Real Estate in Bayside, Queens, said the upper end of the Briarwood market was in Briarwood Estates in the northwest corner of the neighborhood, an enclave where stand-alone, red brick one-family houses, some with Tudor touches, mix with large wood-frame dwellings.
Briarwood was long a part of Jamaica, where English settlers arrived in 1656. In 1905, Herbert A. O'Brien launched a development in the area now known as Briarwood Estates. His wife, Adeline, coined the name because of the briars stuck to her husband's clothing when he returned from forays to the wooded site. Briarwood Estates was well established in 1936 when contemporary classified ads showed houses ranging in price from $3,000 to $9,500.
Many homes on the market today were built during the 30's and 40's. A few were moved from the right-of-way for the Van Wyck Expressway in 1949.
Diane Cohen, district manager of Community Board 8, said recent rezoning protected areas of one- and two-family homes against apartment-house intrusion.
Apartment buildings began rising in the early 50's, followed by an influx of new residents from the Bronx and Brooklyn. The number of apartments increased markedly over the next decade, raising Briarwood's skyline but not, residents insist, obliterating its neighborhood feeling.
A T the Arlington at 139-15 83d Avenue, a 281-unit, 7-story apartment that became a co-op in the early 80's, 2-bedroom units range from $50,000 to $60,000. Monthly maintenance is $500 to $600. Two-bedroom rentals start at about $900. The building has 24-hour-a-day doormen and an underground parking garage.
Parkway Gardens, with 675 apartments in 109 one- and two-story buildings on a 35-acre campus with two private roads, was started in 1946 for employees of the United Nations, which then was briefly based at Flushing Meadows and in nearby Lake Success, L.I. The complex, completed in 1948, is bounded by Main Street, Union Turnpike, Parsons Boulevard and the Grand Central Parkway service road.
Many of the original tenants remained after the U.N. moved to Manhattan, setting the tone for the ethnic diversity that has been a hallmark of Briarwood.
The co-op board chairman, Paul J. Cameron, said that some of the 1,600 trees growing in common areas were planted by the early tenants with seeds from their native lands. "It adds to the international flavor," said Mr. Cameron.
To the south, near Parsons Boulevard and on hilly streets leading down to Hillside Avenue, Archie Bunkeresque wood-frame houses bunch together, impressive in size if cramped by their neighbors. Otherwise, appearances are deceiving. This is not now and never was Archie Bunker's place.
"You always had dozens of languages in the elementary school," said Ellen Hofstetter, the director of the Hilltop Early Childhood Center, a nonprofit community nursery school licensed to care for for 33 children from ages 2 1/2 to six. "Here, kids from everywhere play together, and go to each other's houses."
The 1990 census listed 41.4 percent of Briarwood's residents as white and non-Hispanic and 14.7 percent as black and non-Hispanic. More than 26 percent were of Hispanic origin, including 5.8 percent who were of Puerto Rican origin. Asians and Pacific Islanders accounted for 15.7 percent, including 4.6 percent of Chinese origin.
Briarwood's substantial Jewish population declined in recent years as older Jews retired to Florida, but has recently been revived by Russian immigrants.
At the Briarwood Jewish Center, an Orthodox and Conservative synagogue on 86th Avenue, a Russian congregation now meets in an upstairs sanctuary. The center has programs for children and the elderly.
A Greek community is served the St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church, where 160 pupils from prekindergarten to grade eight are enrolled at the Jamaica Day School. Courses in religion, Greek language and computer literacy are offered. A parochial high school in the church, Archbishop Iakovos, has 42 students. The school offers Regents test preparation, Greek studies and Spanish as a second language.
At the Victoria Congregational Church on 87th Avenue, services are offered in Hindi, Urdu and English.
R ESIDENTS say that in recent years Briarwood's Indian population has grown. On Queens Boulevard, Patel's Food Mart, which opened recently, bills itself as "your one stop Indo-Pak-American Grocery Store." It rents videos and stocks Indian spices. Samosas, deep-fried vegetable patties, are 65 cents each. The Gateway of India restaurant is nearby.
On Parsons Boulevard, students of Sri Chinmoy, a spiritual teacher known for prolific musical composition and espousal of physical fitness, operate a print shop, the Guru Stationary and a meditation center. Sanatan Curchack, a volunteer at the print shop, said many of the teacher's 400 students live in Briarwood.
The Annam Brahma, a nearby vegetarian restaurant at 84-43 164th Street, offers a vegetable curry luncheon special with basmati rice and dal for $2.95. An eggplant Parmesan dinner with salad and garlic bread is $6.95 on Italian night each Thursday. Soy turkey is a Thanksgiving feature
Traditional American fare is served at the Flagship, a popular family restaurant at 138-30 Queens Boulevard.
Briarwood is in School District 28, where most schools are above city and national averages in math and English. P.S. 117 at 143 Street and 85th Drive prides itself on cultural diversity among its approximately 1,150 students in kindergarten through the sixth grade. The school has a computer lab and classroom computers. It stresses cooperation between parents, teachers and administrators.
About 1,237 students attend Intermediate School 217 at 85-05 Jamaica Avenue. The school has programs for gifted and talented, peer tutoring, and peer conflict resolution. Slightly more than half of students scored above national averages on standardized math and English tests.
H ILLCREST HIGH SCHOOL at 160-05 Highland Avenue, the nearest public high school, has about 4,000 students. In a 1994 survey, 56.4 percent of graduates went on to four-year colleges, slightly above the city average. Advanced placement courses are offered in several subjects; average scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test were 360 in verbal and 402 in math, near the city average.
The 500-pupil Roman Catholic St. Nicholas of Tolentine, covering kindergarten through grade eight, offers a computer program and intramural sports. Sixth-grade pupils recently visited Philadelphia as part of a history class.
Nearly all of the 1,550 students at Archbishop Molloy, an all-male Roman Catholic high school at 85-53 Manton Street, go on to four-year colleges according to Brother Richard Van Houten, the principal. He said Scholastic Assessment Test scores were typically 150 points above the city average. The school also offers advanced placement courses and has won city championships in many sports. Admission is competitive. Tuition is $3,630 a year.
The five-acre Hoover Avenue Park, across the street from the high school, has handball and basketball courts.
Ms. Hofstetter of the Hilltop Early Childhood Center, who raised four children in Briarwood, said the local Little League exemplified what was good about the community. "It's a kind Little League," she said. "The parents don't yell at the kids and they have a rule that every kid plays."
She said a manager who screamed at one of his players was not allowed to manage the following season, even though the player was his son.

HOME FOR THE HOMELESS: In a measure of civic character, Briarwood has remained supportive of a shelter for the homeless that opened four years ago at Union Turnpike and 134th Street, even though the community had fought vigorously to keep it out. The shelter, which is run by the Salvation Army, has room for 90 families. Some of the local volunteers had opposed the project when it was frst proposed. "From its opening day, it has never been a problem," said Seymour Schwartz, co-president of the Briarwood Civic Association, which had sued to keep the shelter out of this middle-class area. Members feared drug users, unruly people and a loss in property values. But after losing its case on appeal, "We turned about," said Mr. Schwartz. "We decided to try to make it into a model shelter, and we believe we have accomplished that." Members of the association sit on a shelter advisory board. "After the shovel hit the ground, people said as long as it's going in let's make it the best it can be," said Diane Cohen, the district manager of Community Board 8. "Instead of fighting it, we made it part of the community." Real-estate brokers said the shelter has had no impact on property values in Briarwood.

Equity 24 Housing in New Jersey
 
Q Is there a state-run program in New Jersey similar to the Mitchell-Lama program in New York City? And if so, whom can I call for more information? . . . Carl Duren, Brooklyn.
 
 A The New York State Mitchell-Lama Housing Program provides affordable housing for middle-income residents. Some Mitchell-Lama residents are tenants while others own their apartments. 
 To be eligible for Mitchell-Lama housing, the income for a family or household of up to three people cannot exceed seven times the annual rent or carrying charge. For families of four or more, income cannot exceed eight times the annual rent or carrying charge.
A few years ago the law was amended to provide that a family with two or more dependents with income less than 25 percent above the income limit could still qualify for Mitchell-Lama housing by paying a rent surcharge. At present, the waiting lists for most Mitchell-Lama developments are closed.
In New Jersey, the program that most closely resembles New York's Mitchell-Lama is Equity 24, a lease-purchase program administered by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. Under the program, potential buyers lease homes for up to two years. Their rents are used toward the down payment, and they can then obtain mortgage financing at below-market interest rates.
Potential homebuyers must first obtain a list of approved housing projects from the agency. The list includes single-family detached and attached homes and condominiums. To qualify for the program, applicants must not have any bad credit reports and must have two years of continuous employment.
Generally, total household income may not exceed 200 percent of the median income -- adjusted for family size -- in the county where the eligible housing unit is situated. Moreover, the purchase price may not exceed the higher of 250 percent of the annual maximum income of an eligible buyer or the median sales price of existing single-family homes in the county.
For example, in Hudson County the maximum allowable income for a family of four or more is $78,400, and the maximum purchase price for eligible housing is $196,000. In Bergen County, the income limit for a similarly sized family is $117,000 and the maximum purchase price is $292,500.
Information regarding the Equity 24 program, and various other low-interest-rate mortgage programs, can be obtained by calling the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency at (800) NJ-HOUSE.
 
Exculpatory Clause In a Lease
 
Q What is an exculpatory clause in a lease agreement? . . . Burton Blesko, Manhattan.
 
 A Andrew P. Brucker, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, explained that an exculpatory clause is generally used in commercial leases to insulate a landlord from liability.
"It's like the landlord saying to the tenant: 'If anything goes wrong, you can't sue me for any amount more than my interest in the building,' " Mr. Brucker said.
In many cases, he said, instead of or in addition to using exculpatory clauses, landlords who own multiple properties also form separate corporations to own each property, thereby limiting liability in each building to the value of the landlord's equity in the building.
"Without exculpatory clauses or holding corporations," Mr. Brucker said, "landlords who own several buildings could be liable for millions of dollars."
He added that exculpatory clauses are rarely used in residential leases and that under New York law, an exculpatory clause that would limit liability for a landlord's negligence would be considered void.

HEADLINE: From the Heights of Space to the Fall of an Industrial Empire

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
WHEN the gates opened for shift changes at the Grumman Corporation aerospace plants in Bethpage, neighbors used to complain about the traffic snarls. "You literally could not get out of your own driveway," recalled Linda Mangano, who lived on Route 107, which borders the site.
Today, driving past Grumman is a breeze. The company's 600-acre complex in Bethpage is largely deserted. 
 Now, many people would put up with the traffic frustrations, if only Grumman were bustling again with engineers, welders, designers, accountants, mechanics, secretaries, riveters and test pilots.
But the old Grumman, after decades of fueling the Long Island economy as its largest company, is mostly gone. Only a few divisions have survived.
"The loss of Grumman is horrible," said Gary Bretton, owner of Bretton's Deli in Bethpage. "It's killing us. Our lunch trade is the key, and it's off 25, 30 percent."
Bretton's is lucky. At least it is still in business. Grumman's ripple effect has sunk many other enterprises. "We've been losing stores on a weekly basis -- right now we have 32 vacancies," said Dennis P. Brady, president of the Bethpage Chamber of Commerce. "The whole community used to revolve around Grumman. Places had Grumman burgers and Apollo plates. Now if somebody comes and says, 'Do I get a Grumman discount?' they laugh."
Trying to fill the Grumman vacuum, Nassau County officials are scrambling to lure new businesses to the Bethpage property. The Robert Plan Corporation, an insurance company, is moving there, and Cablevision Systems Corporation is considering it. Suffolk officials are struggling to redevelop 2,900 acres that Grumman formerly occupied at Calverton.
Twenty five years ago, Grumman's demise would have been unthinkable. The company was in its glory after the momentous success of its gawky lunar module, which in 1969 enabled the first human to set foot on the Moon.
In 1970, Grumman again rose to the challenge when Apollo 13's astronauts radioed: "Houston, we've got a problem here" after an explosion in part of their spaceship built by other contractors. Ingenious Grumman engineers on the ground figured out makeshift adaptations of the Grumman part of the ship, which rescued the mission from an outer-space disaster.
More triumphs lay ahead in the 1970's, as Grumman developed orbiting astronomical observatories and the F-14 Tomcat, the rakish, swept-back variable-wing fighter that later co-starred with Tom Cruise in the hit movie "Top Gun."
Grumman's downfall came in the 1980's, with the collapse of Communism. When the cold war ended, so did the arms and space races. As military spending plummeted on Long Island, Grumman shrank drastically and in 1994 was swallowed up by the Northrop Corporation, based in Los Angeles.
Just 10 years ago, Grumman's payroll on Long Island was 25,000. Today the staff of the merged Northrop Grumman Corporation divisions remaining on the island has dwindled to 3,800. Thousands more local jobs were lost by hundreds of subcontractors.
Coming on top of the recession, Grumman's decline dealt the Island's economy a double blow that still reverberates.
"Grumman had essentially held together the manufacturing sector of Long Island's economy," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business group. Grumman's annual sales peaked in 1990 at $4 billion.
With Grumman's decline, its reputation has faded as a model employer and civic leader whose achievements gave Long Islanders pride and identity.
"In school we were all made aware we had helped put a man on the moon," said Ms. Mangano, publisher of The Bethpage Tribune.
Grumman helped organize the United Way fund on the island and led its corporate givers. Its executives helped found hospitals and supported other causes.
"Grumman was a symbol of Long Island, its stability, its future," said James M. Shuart, president of Hofstra University. "It had a warm, friendly, family image. It might have been an illusion, and when they started behaving like any other business, it was a big disappointment to a lot of people."
Leroy R. Grumman and his partners started their tiny company in 1930, repairing small propeller planes. Despite the Depression, the plucky enterprise grew into a giant that produced the Hellcats and other aircraft that helped win World War II. Then Grumman soared into the jet era and the space age, largely on the strength of Navy contracts.
Nowadays, pride in the company has distinctly lapsed into the past tense. Lawrence A. Feliu, a retired engineer who volunteers in the Grumman history center, a recently exanded archival and display area, said: "Grumman had a magnificent history and still does have a magnificent history -- they can't take that away from Grumman."
For many former workers, their once ardent loyalty to Grumman has soured. At the old Grumman, no unions were needed. Its open-door policy was real; the lowliest worker could walk into the president's office without an appointment. Workers with difficult ailments were sent to the Mayo Clinic, at company expense.
There were turkeys at Christmas, birthday cards, watches after 25 years, bouquets for spouses, scholarships for children, the "green car service" for commuters with flat tires and the world's biggest company picnic, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. No more.
After years of paternalism, the cutbacks came as a shock and betrayal to many workers. Dr. Barbara M. Kelly, a history professor and curator of Long Island studies at Hofstra, said, "It felt more like a divorce than a simple layoff."
Lynn V. McDonald, an engineer who took early retirment in 1990 at 65, said he was treated fairly. "But so many of my friends were bitter and upset at the time of the buyout or sellout or whatever you call it," he said, "especially younger ones who lost their jobs when jobs are tough on the island." Some dismissed workers have gone to court challenging the legality of Northrop Grumman's severance pay.
Could Grumman have avoided its fate? Its attempts to diversify included ventures in solar energy panels, waste disposal, modular housing, fire engines, windmills, refrigeration, organ transplant transporters, motor homes, yachts and ambulances.
Most of the efforts failed, because of poor marketing, unlucky timing or other factors. Defective Flxible buses became a public relations fiasco. There were a few successes, like the Gulfstream corporate jets and the boxy postal delivery vans, but those divisions were sold or shifted off Long Island before they could make any significant impact on the company's balance sheet.
"They could have done more," said Paul Townsend, editor of Long Island Business News. But President Shuart of Hofstra said, "They deserve an A for effort."
In the 1980's, a feisty Grumman fought off a hostile takeover attempt by LTV, an electronics concern with military contracts, with the help of many blue- and white-collar employees who bought Grumman stock to strengthen its resistance.
But by 1989, seeing a limited future in aerospace, Grumman proposed a redevelopment of its Bethpage property into an industrial park with a high-rise hotel. Residents opposed it as excessive, just as they had thwarted an earlier plan to expand airport operations on the Grumman runway.
The company's fortunes continued to decline. In 1990, John O'Brien resigned as chairman after allegations of kickbacks.
Eventually Grumman's top executives decided that the company's only hope was merger, and they huddled over a secret plan called Project X. After their offer was spurned by their first two choices, they flirted with Martin Marietta. When word got out, a bidding contest erupted with Northrop, which bought out Grumman.
The new Northrop Grumman pared even further, leaving four divisions on the Island, for data processing, electronic aviation systems, military planes and research and development.
But after building 33,000 planes and several lunar modules, the old Grumman factories have finally closed. "The last plane made here went over the fence last year," said Richard C. Dunne, a company spokesman. There was no ceremony. The plane, a Hawkeye early-warning radar plane, was destined for Taiwan, which wanted its departure kept confidential at the time.
In the end, the company that helped put men on the moon was unable to save itself. Robert Silver, owner of the Bethpage Medical Pharmacy, who had -- and lost -- many Grumman workers as customers, said, "It's never going to be the way it was before."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Worldwide Plaza and Its Neighborhood;
In Hell's Kitchen, Retail Is on the Front Burner

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IN the late 1980's, the first renters at Worldwide Plaza, the condominium and office complex that fills the block between Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 49th and 50th Streets, figured they had the best of all worlds.
Zeckendorf Realty, the building's owner, was offering low rents, individual lobbies and huge contributions to building out the space to those pioneers who would chance coming so far west. Yet the shabby neighborhood seemed ripe for gentrification. 
 "A lot of people believed that Eighth Avenue would develop in the early 1990's the way that Sixth Avenue did in the 1960's," said Thomas J. Brady, director of security at the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather, the building's first tenant.
The faltering economy tabled such hopes, of course. But the tenants, apparently, have grown to love the neighborhood as is.
"We haven't had any significant problems with crime, and you can get a cab at any time," said Samuel Butler, presiding partner at the law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore, which moved to the building in 1989.
"You don't have the constant crush of tourists, and you don't have to pay Fifth Avenue prices to buy a lunch," said Carolyn Joy Lee, a partner at the law firm Roberts & Holland, which moved from Rockefeller Center to Worldwide Plaza in late 1994.
Indeed, while the neighborhood, known interchangeably as Clinton and Hell's Kitchen, is low on glitz, it is high on bargains. Cineplex Odeon has had such a rush of moviegoers to its second-run, six-screen Worldwide Plaza theater that two months ago it raised its ticket price to $3 from $2.
"It caught on like wildfire," said Howard Lichtman, a Cineplex Odeon executive vice president. "We had more than a million people attend last year, more than quadruple the number we had expected."
He may soon get even more. With the economy reviving, and with 42d Street redevelopment spurring interest in the whole West Side, those who enjoy the lack of gentrification may be in for a shock.
Jack Resnick & Sons is ready to put up an apartment building in the big parking lot it just bought at 49th Street, across Eighth Avenue from Worldwide Plaza. Zeckendorf may do the same on the former site of the Adonis Theater, an X-rated moviehouse between 50th and 51st Streets on the west side of Eighth.
Brokers say that retailers, too, are eyeing the neighborhood, although few agree on whether Eighth, with its large buildings and decent sized stores, or Ninth, with its preponderance of tiny spaces in narrow buildings, is having the biggest resurgence.
"Eighth Avenue in the 50's is already a here-and-now neighborhood, but Ninth Avenue is just up and coming," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Retail Services, who owns 850-856 Eighth Avenue, four adjoining buildings at 51st Street.
N OT so, counters Howard S. Aaron, a broker at New Spectrum. He says that Ninth Avenue landlords are finally able to turn away locksmiths and delis in favor of pretty little cafes that enhance the value of the walk-up apartments upstairs.
"Ninth Avenue is getting the trendy places you expect to see in the Village," said Mr. Aaron, who says he recently had 10 tenants clamor for a space at 676 Ninth Avenue, near 47th Street. (An Italian restaurant is slated to open there in a few months.)
It is all coming too late, however, to help Zeckendorf Realty realize the gold mine it had expected when it first started building Worldwide Plaza on a site that once held Madison Square Garden. Back then, Prudential Insurance and the developer George Klein were still planning to put four huge office towers on 42d Street. New office buildings were going up on Broadway in the 40's, and the Coliseum on Columbus Circle seemed destined for office or retail use.
"We figured new retailing, hotels and apartment houses had to be on the way," recalled Arthur W. Zeckendorf, Zeckendorf Realty's executive vice president.
They never came. Zeckendorf did get market prices for most of the residential condominiums, but the office space is not bringing the revenues it had expected.
The developer had to give equity in the building to Cravath Swaine, Ogilvy and N. W. Ayer to get them to move in. And it had to offer very low rents. Ogilvy, for example, signed on at an annual rent of $32 a square foot, at a time when rents for far less amenity-rich buildings in midtown averaged about $40. Later tenants, including Polygram Records, Microsoft and Roberts & Holland, also cut sweet deals.
Until recently, Zeckendorf was not as willing to compromise on retail rents. The result is that, while a health club, the movie theater and sundry local service stores have sopped up much of the complex's 90,000 square feet of stores, it still has 25,000 square feet empty.
"The retailing just wasn't well conceived," Mr. Zeckendorf admitted. Added Tom A. Javits, a Zeckendorf managing director: "It is difficult to get retailers to invest in stores in this area."
Mr. Javits says that Zeckendorf is now offering "realistic leases and huge incentives" -- translation: low rents and large contributions to building the stores -- to entice retailers to come. Last year Super Natural Health Foods and Bulbtronics, a specialty lighting store, moved into Worldwide Plaza's Ninth Avenue storefronts, and Mr. Javits says he is negotiating with two restaurants for other spaces.
Z ECKENDORF is also paying more attention to security in an area that, because it often feels deserted at night and full of rowdy students by day, sometimes feels threatening to tenants and visitors alike. Two years ago Zeckendorf's security force teamed up with the police, the Board of Education and the Times Square Business Improvement District to control students at two nearby schools, the High School of Graphic Communication Arts and Park West High School.
Chemical Bank, at the request of several Worldwide Plaza tenants, has increased security around the ATM machine it operates in the building. And Zeckendorf recently converted an empty store on Ninth Avenue into a security office that will be jointly staffed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Zeckendorf's private security force, to further dispel any feelings -- justified or perceived -- of danger in the tenement-ridden area.
But perceptions are stubborn. "I don't think any of our clients would be interested in coming here," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company who specializes in retail brokerage. "The look of the buildings, the nature of the local bars, all of it feels like the bad areas of Brooklyn or the Bronx."
Indeed, a thrift shop that had long operated at 767 Ninth Avenue, at 51st Street, recently moved to more expensive East Side space "because the people who were donating their clothing did not want to come to this area to drop it off," recalled Mr. Aaron. He rerented the space -- for far less rent -- to a druggist who had operated a smaller store nearby for a decade.
More than the lack of surrounding gentrification is bedeviling Worldwide Plaza's attempts to rent its stores. Much of its empty space is on the plaza that separates the office building from the condominiums. Plazas, which are by their nature tucked out of view, have trouble generating much traffic even in a bustling neighborhood. In a sleepy one a plaza can be a ghost town.
"There are still people in the building who don't know we are here," said Richard Barber, who has operated the New World Grill, a 35-seat -- triple that in summer, when he puts tables outside -- restaurant in the plaza for three years.
Like Cineplex Odeon before him, Mr. Barber is now banking on bargain hunters to boost his sales. He lowered his prices last year, and he is thinking of amortizing the cost of his kitchen by opening another small space in the plaza, where he would serve soups, salads and sandwiches.
"We expect that interns on piddling salaries will come down from the offices for a $5 meal," he said.
It may take longer for the local stores to catch on with outsiders -- if, in fact, they ever do.
"This neighborhood will never be like the Upper West Side," said Samuel Mizrahi, who owns Super Natural Health Foods and the Metropolis Drug Store at Ninth Avenue at 50th Street.
Nor is it yet commanding Upper West Side rents. "I haven't seen a lot of dramatic increase in values yet," said Bruce A. Spiegel, a senior managing director of Rose Associates, which owns the Ellington, an apartment building at 260 West 52d Street. A health and beauty aids store that moved in when the building opened six years ago pays an annual rent of about $50 a square foot; Mr. Spiegel doubts he could get a good deal more than that if he rented the store today.
Maybe not -- but a few years from now, if the long-postponed development of the area really happens, he just might.
"Eighth and Ninth Avenues already are getting the benefit of the activity on Broadway," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director of the Garrick-Aug brokerage, who says that discounters and accessory stores are looking in the area. "The neighborhood has always been stable. But now, it is getting chic."

Warehouse and Distribution-Center Demand Rises

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A RELATIVELY healthy demand for industrial space has given rise to a spate of projects being built for specific tenants or on speculation. Most are focused on big boxy warehouse and distribution centers.
As of the first quarter, 14 such projects under way in the state total nearly 3 million square feet, more than double the 1.3 million feet in the similar 1995 quarter, according to the East Rutherford office of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage. 
 The activity is a response to the reconfigured space needs of today's companies, said Jules Nissim, a Cushman & Wakefield broker. Some concerns are expanding their operations and others, following a trend that began a few years ago, are consolidating from scattered locations to increase efficiency, said Mr. Nissim.
Moreover, brokers say, tenants are passing up many older buildings because their ceiling heights do not allow for modern racking systems for distribution and inventory retrieval. Most new buildings have ceilings at least 30 feet high and are 200,000 square feet in size or more.
Asking rents have risen to reflect the cost of new construction in some markets. As of the first quarter, rates for all types of industrial space have risen from an average of $4.21 a square foot a year ago to $4.56, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Rents vary from market to market.
The activity is expected to continue, albeit more slowly, said John G. Orrico, senior vice president of the New Jersey offices of Grubb & Ellis, a real-estate brokerage based in San Francisco. One factor tempering the pace, he said, is the still-tight lending climate in which developers must contribute 35 to 40 percent of their own equity into projects. The pace will also depend, he said, on continued improvement in the state's economy and job growth.
Since 1992 the state has regained 189,000 of the 261,000 of all kinds of jobs it lost during the recession, 126,000 of them since January 1994. As of March the three distribution-industry sectors -- wholesale trade/ durable goods, nondurable goods and trucking and warehousing -- accounted for 335,600 jobs, or 9.3 percent of the state's total, the state's Department of Labor says.
As new construction moves ahead, 1.5 million square feet of space has come back onto the market over the last six months -- due to, among other reasons, the bankruptcies of some companies. Jamesway, for example, gave back an 800,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution building in Cranbury. That pushed up available space from 58.4 million square feet in the third quarter of 1995. the lowest since December 1990, to nearly 60 million square feet. But much of the space is in older buildings and some of them, brokers said, will never be leased.
L EASING and sales activity in the first quarter, though down from the same time last year, rose by 35 percent to 7.2 million square feet from the end of 1995. Among the largest leases was one for a 175,000-square-foot building on Woodbridge Avenue in Edison by U.S.A. Detergents, an expanding North Brunswick-based manufacturer, for a warehouse and distribution center.
"The last six months is a temporary blip, following 18 months of activity, that will work itself out," said Mr. Nissim of Cushman & Wakefield.
Much of the new construction is centered in the areas around Exits 10 and 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike in Middlesex County, one of the state's main industrial hubs. The Meadowlands, another big market, continues to draw firms that need to be near Manhattan, but land there is limited.
Projects in the county involve build-to-suit distribution centers to accommodate companies consolidating space.
In Sayreville, the Morris Companies of Secaucus is erecting two such buildings at its Morris Industrial Park. One, with 225,000 square feet of space, is for Guest Supply of New Brunswick, which supplies toilet articles to the lodging industry. It will relocate four distribution centers in the state to the building. The other is a 205,000-square-foot building for Nippon Express of Manhattan, where three distribution centers elsewhere in the state that store business equipment will be consolidated.
Both buildings will be completed in November, said Ronald F. Schram, senior vice president at the Morris Companies. He said his company was also seeking approvals for other build-to-suit projects, including an 800,000-square-foot distribution center in the Cranbury area of 8A for Nobody Beats the Wiz.
Among those planning to buy or lease build-to-suit projects under way elsewhere in the region is Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., the Manhattan-based sportswear manufacturer, which is leasing 340,000 square feet at the 500-acre Forsgate Industrial Center in South Brunswick.
Volkswagen of America is buying a 323,000-square-foot building nearing completion at CenterPoint, a 900-acre business park straddling Monroe and South Brunswick Townships. Volkswagen will move into it from Orangeburg, N.Y., and the Washington area. The distribution center, which is in South Brunswick, is being constructed by the Matrix Development Corporation of Cranbury, the developer of CenterPoint.
"It is not like the mid-80's when the market was crying out for space, but it is tight for the more functional high-ceilinged space," said Alec Taylor, a principal at Matrix.
That factor among others led to Matrix's decision to begin developing a new park farther south along the turnpike at Exit 7A with up to 5 million square feet. The park's maiden project, a 115,000-square-foot build-to-suit warehouse and distribution building, is now under construction, said Mr. Taylor.
I N Edison, the Heller Construction Company has built half of the 300,000-square-foot first phase of a 1 million square foot office and distribution building, the state's largest speculative project. The project, with 37-foot-high ceilings, is rising at the company's 410-acre Heller Industrial Park on Mill Road, near Exit 10 of the turnpike.
Jeffrey J. Milanaik, the Heller vice president, said his company was offering below-market-rental rates in the $3.50-a-square foot range, made possible by a tax abatement from Edison, and the project's location to draw large users consolidating operations. It is also near the crossroads of Interstates 287 and 440, the Garden State Parkway and Routes 1 & 9.
"For tenants today, the focus is price and many are finding value in newer buildings," he said, noting that the space could be divided into areas as small as 70,000 square feet.
The first phase is to be finished by July, said Mr. Milanaik, adding that his company expected to have the entire project completed and leased by the middle of next year.
Not all speculative buildings lease quickly. A 248,000-square-foot building completed more than eight months ago at Forsgate Corporate Center by the park's developer, the local Forsgate Industrial Complex, is still vacant.
"The building, designed as a corporate headquarters, is not for everyone," conceded Anthony J. Scaro executive vice president at the Teterboro-based Charles Klatskin Company, Forsgate's leasing arm. "But with the lack of large blocs of quality space in the region it will lease."
The company is also erecting a 70,000-square-foot speculative building on North Street near Route 80 in Teterboro for smaller tenants needing 9,000 to 18,000 square feet of office and industrial space. "There is a pent-up demand for such space in this area," said Mr. Scaro, adding completion is expected this summer.

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
THE sky glowed so infernally on the night of Dec. 16, 1835, that firemen in Philadelphia turned out to fight what they believed was a blaze in their suburbs. What was burning, however, was lower Manhattan.
Former Mayor Philip Hone told his diary the next day that 500 to 700 buildings and their contents, including all of those on Stone Street, had been reduced to "an indistinguishable mass of ruins." Yet only a year later, Hone exulted that "the whole is rebuilt with more splendor than before." 
 Astonishingly, a dozen brick storehouses built on Stone Street after the Great Fire of 1835 survive today in recognizable form, some even retaining their Greek Revival granite shopfronts or the pintles from which window shutters once hung. Complementing these are later structures with Dutch, Gothic, Italianate or Tudor details, arrayed along a crooked, narrow road that was laid out in the days of Nieuw Amsterdam.
If all this sounds like the making of a landmark designation, it is.
But in the proposed Stone Street Historic District -- 14 buildings on two small blocks between Broad and William Streets -- the Landmarks Preservation Commission is trying to set the stage for economic revitalization even as it imposes a regulatory regime. Rather than sparring with business interests, the commission is working closely with the Alliance for Downtown New York, which manages the Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District.
A master plan is being drafted that would specify a range of pre-approved alterations that owners in the district could make to their properties without having to go through time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable review.
For example, the plan would show how the owner of Block Hall, 45 Stone Street, could add windows on the south and east facades to make that seven-story structure more attractive for residential conversion. It would show how the owner of 44 Stone Street, a three-story ersatz Colonial structure on what was once Coenties Alley, could either improve the existing facade or add two stories in keeping with the architectural texture of neighboring structures.
The plan would show owners throughout the tiny district where they might build rooftop additions. And it would specify a variety of treatments that would be permitted for shopfronts and signage. "It was important that we work with owners to show them how they could convert shuttered ground floors into usable retail space," said John Belle, of Beyer Blinder Belle of Manhattan, the architectural firm that is drafting the plan.
Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said the master plan would probably be scheduled for a public hearing as soon as the district is designated, probably in June. Because the master plan is to be voted on by the commission. it would have the weight of regulation.
"I didn't just want a suggestion of what you could do," Ms. Raab said. "I wanted something with the force of a pre-approved commission vote. You, the owner, can open the book and say to your contractor: 'This storefront is already approved. You take this over to 100 Old Slip and you'll be in and out of there.' " The commission's Old Slip office is only three blocks from Stone Street, paring more time from the process.
E VEN the Real Estate Board of New York, which generally takes a dim view of historic districts, has endorsed the idea of a master plan. "It minimizes significantly the subjectivity in the approval process for any changes that are required," said Michael Slattery, the board's senior vice president for research.
To encourage development further, the landmarks commission has obtained an $800,000 grant through the Federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act toward a $1.43 million street reconstruction project, including bluestone sidewalks, a granite-block roadbed and cast-iron lampposts. The balance of the money is to come from New York City ($480,000) and the Alliance ($150,000).
The Alliance has also underwritten a report by the Praedium Group, a consulting firm based in Manhattan, on the economics of commercial revitalization along Stone Street. The report recommends the development of moderately priced restaurants aimed at the lunch trade, the creation upstairs of residential lofts and one- or two-bedroom apartments, and the use of other retail space for sporting-goods stores, hair salons, dentists' offices, gift shops or bookstores.
Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said that Stone Street had "not only great historical importance but tremendous commercial potential" and that the creation of a landmark district would allow for the cultivation of its character, flavor and economic vitality.
One owner who said he is ready to go is Tony Goldman, of Goldman Properties, who has renovated buildings in SoHo and the South Beach section of Miami Beach. After he opens the Wall Street Kitchen and Bar at 70 Broad Street next September, Mr. Goldman said, he will turn his attention to Stone Street, where he owns No. 53 and leases Nos. 52 and 55. He said he was prepared to open three or four restaurants and create living-and-working lofts.
"It's a magnificent little enclave," Mr. Goldman said. "Being an oasis, it has that much more differentiation, and differentiation is where it's at. You've got to have the only kind of product on the market to give yourself the marketing edge."
O ASIS" is probably not the word that would occur to most visitors to Stone Street today, beholding what is essentially a dingy, ill-kept back alley that serves a few restaurants along Pearl and South William Streets. It is no festival marketplace, although it gained a reputation in the 80's as a drug market.
Stone Street was known first as Brouwers Straet. The brewery of the West India Company was in operation there by 1646 and Oloff Stevensen van Cortlandt had built a brewery sometime before 1656. Brouwers Straet ran only a block, to a canal along the line of the present Broad Street.
Complaining that the street was "becoming more and more unfit for public use," 10 residents petitioned the burgomasters in 1655 "to pave the said street with round stone on the first favorable opportunity." The neighbors pledged themselves "to furnish the stone, the raising and lowering necessary thereto, each to the extent of his house and lot." In Mr. Weisbrod's eyes, that makes Stone Street the first business improvement district.
This being New York City, nothing was done about the street work for another three years. And then, the residents balked at paying the assessment.
Paving stones were eventually laid and Brouwers Straet showed up as "Stony Street" exactly 300 years ago on a map drawn by the Rev. John Miller, chaplain to the King's forces in New York. A century later, Stone Street was merged with the former Hoogh Straet (or High Street), on the east side of Broad Street.
Stone Street underwent its most thorough rehabilitation after the Great Fire of 1835, when a four- or five-story brick storehouse was built on almost every lot. Though these are the most historic of the Stone Street structures, they are the least easy for a casual viewer to appreciate, since they are quite plain and, in numerous cases, considerably altered.
Some distinguishing features, however, include the massive granite piers and lintels at Nos. 51, 53 and 55; the pintles surrounding the windows at No. 58 and the star-shaped tie-rod plates at No. 60 that look like starfish climbing up the brick wall.
In 1854, the Hanover Bank (ancestor of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company) built an elegant Italianate palazzo on Hanover Square. Since 1914, it has been the home of India House, a private club. Over time, the building was expanded to encompass Nos. 60, 62 and 64 Stone Street, all built in 1836. India House was designated an individual landmark in 1965.
Fanciful recollections of Dutch architecture can be spotted at No. 57, an 1830's structure that was given a new facade by C. P. H. Gilbert in 1903, including a stepped gable with a bull's-eye window. (Also known as 13 South William Street, it is now the Cafe du Cervin.)
A remodeling also transformed two older storehouses into a seven-story structure known as the Armitage Building, at No. 54. It was extensively altered in 1919 for the marine underwriting firm of Chubb & Son.
Another marine underwriting firm, William H. McGee & Company, was housed in the most graceful structure in the proposed district: a seven-story office building at No. 59. Its delicate facade is composed of multi-pane leaded glass windows in limestone-framed, neo-Gothic bays, topped by a cornice ringed with lion's heads.
Over the main entrance, at 9 South William Street, is inscribed the name "Lehman Brothers," testifying to the building's role as an annex for the investment banking house when it was across Mill Lane. The building has been empty since the 1980's. The owners, South William Street Associates, contemplate turning it into a 46-room inn.
T HE architect of the McGee building, William Neil Smith, also designed Block Hall, also known as 21 South William Street, which has a plain facade on Stone Street but erupts in half-timbered neo-Tudor fantasy on South William Street. It was built for an affiliate of McGee & Company and originally served as a private clubhouse. Beginning in the 1940's, it was the home of the City Midday Drug and Chemical Club.
Block Hall was purchased in 1960 by Robert Norden, who also operates Fraunces Tavern two blocks away. The Midday Club moved to 140 Broadway in the late 1960's and Mr. Norden leased the building to the Italian Alps restaurant, which closed seven years ago.
Block Hall has been empty since and Mr. Norden said he has no plans for the property at the moment, although he thinks it is a "definite help" that the master plan spells out his options.
Easily the greatest blow to Stone Street since the Great Fire occurred in 1980 when it was "de-mapped" by the Board of Estimate between Broad Street and Coenties Alley to accommodate the development of 85 Broad Street, the 30-story headquarters of Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Although the street itself was eradicated, its route is marked through the lobby and plaza of 85 Broad Street with 4- by-4-inch dark brown paving blocks. The walls of the lobby also make two gentle turns, following the alignment of old Stone Street.
Mr. Weisbrod believes that "having Goldman, Sachs next door is a big plus for Stone Street economically and having Stone Street is a plus for Goldman, Sachs."
But Mr. Norden looks at 85 Broad Street as an example of the city's mercurial approach to land use. "In another administration years ago, we decided to give away half of Stone Street to Goldman, Sachs as a lobby for their building," he said. "Now, you almost can't get to it. It's a back alley of a back alley. And now, the city says, 'Gee, we want to do something good.' Is landmarking going to be the saving grace? I think it's the only thing we have but I personally don't think it's the proper approach to saving buildings."
For one thing, owners are concerned about the development rights attributable to their properties, said Mark A. Levine, of Sive, Paget & Riesel, who represents a group of landlords. With bonuses, existing zoning would permit a building on Stone Street with a floor area as much as 18 times the lot area.
But it is almost inconceivable that the landmarks commission would ever permit such a thing, leaving owners with tens of thousands of square feet of unused development potential. Mr. Levine said one possibility would be a zoning mechanism allowing the transfer of development rights outside the district.
A potential economic advantage of landmark status is the Federal Investment Tax Credit, which offers a credit equal to 20 percent of the money an owner spends in rehabilitating a historic property -- both hard costs like construction and soft costs like professional fees. There are numerous restrictions and conditions, but Anne B. Covell, a principal in the Praedium Group, said it could provide a "big financial kick" along Stone Street.
A S an example, Praedium devised a renovation scenario for Mr. Goldman's building at 52 Stone Street, also known as 85 Pearl Street. In the high range of assumptions, rehabilitation of the facade, basement and first two floors for retail space would cost $856,530; 50 percent of that, or $428,265, being the owner's equity investment. The cash flow (gross rent less operating expenses, debt service, real estate and Federal income taxes) would be $46,334, equal to a return on the investment of 10.8 percent.
The Federal Investment Tax Credit would be $171,306, or 20 percent of the rehabilitation cost. If taken over five years, that would mean an annual credit of $34,261, increasing the cash flow to $80,595 -- a much more favorable return of 18.8 percent.
Mr. Goldman insists he would build with or without the tax credit. But there is a pitfall he hopes to avoid: an overly picturesque reconstruction along the lines of the Rouse Company's treatment of the South Street Seaport.
"Stone Street has to have a sense of grit to it," he said. "I would like a little saltiness to prevail."

HEADLINE: The Visionary Pioneer of Hilton Head Island, S.C.

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE 

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.

 BODY:
WITH some regularity, Charles E. Fraser used to invoke the age-old Chinese saying of "knocked down 9 times, get up 10." Now, the 67-year-old developer says he would rather avoid being knocked down.
The years may have lessened the fight. But none of the spirit has diminished in the man who 40 years ago began this island's first resort, where bicycles, not cars, were the primary mode of transportation and trees and shrubs were the focal part of a homesite, not a huge, brightly painted house. 
 The 5,000-acre Sea Pines Plantation on the southern tip of Hilton Head Island, 35 miles north of Savannah, Ga., today shows how careful planning -- and strict covenants -- can create a livable community that time does not change.
Mr. Fraser's concept is standard practice in resort developments around the nation, especially here on the South Carolina coast where as many as 35 resorts have applied Mr. Fraser's ideas. The new town of Celebration, Fla., under construction by the Disney Company outside of Orlando and scheduled to open in October, employs many of his theories.
But to Mr. Fraser, his greatest contribution to real estate development is the young men and women who came here to work with him in the early years, many of whom have gone on to develop resorts themselves, such as Spring Island near Beaufort, S.C., and Kiawah Island near Charleston, S.C.
Peter Rummell, head of the Disney Company's worldwide development arm, is a Fraser protege, as is Philip Lader, director of the Small Business Administration. J. Ronald Terwilliger is a managing partner with Trammell Crow Residential, one of the nation's largest apartment builders.
"Mr. Fraser is definitely a visionary," said Peter Pollack, a partner in Dolan & Pollack, which is developing a 40-acre parcel on Hilton Head. "His influence is felt in our project."
Mr. Fraser recruited at the nation's best colleges, drawing from all disciplines because he believes a good project involves 26 specialties, from education to ecology, transportation to finance. Urban planners need not apply. The ever-blunt developer considers them a "weak breed," compiling statistics and reports and lacking an understanding of how to create a viable community.
"I wouldn't give one plugged nickel for all of the places that are called city planning or for their output from the past 25 years," he said. Because of them, many modern developments segregate the various activities of the community. Mr. Fraser believes in "family-friendly planning."
"Planning should be focused on not having missing pieces in a neighborhood, a school you can bike to, businesses, churches, ballfields, parks, a mix of housing types," he said.
It is much like small towns of another day, where residents live near their work and can walk or ride bikes or buses virtually anywhere. He wants communities where residents need only one car.
Mr. Fraser became interested in land use planning while a student at Yale Law School in the early 50's. There, under the tutelage of Prof. Miers McDougal, he became convinced that landowners needed to be bolder in writing deed restrictions and covenants.
"It was a concept that was generally ignored in this country," he said.
A FTER graduating from law school in 1953, he served in the Air Force and then practiced law in Augusta, Ga., 130 miles northwest of Savannah, where he grew up.
His father and a group of investors owned 80 percent of Hilton Head Island. He convinced his father, whose family owned a lumber manufacturing business, to sell him, on a 20-year note, the southern third of the island so he could put his theories into practice.
A bridge to the mainland was built in 1956, and Mr. Fraser moved here, living much like a hermit on an island outpost.
In those days, development along the South Carolina coast consisted mainly of small cottages perched atop cinderblocks. Mr. Fraser began assembling a small city behind gates. Over the years, four golf courses, a town square, 100 tennis courts and 3,400 homes were built at the oceanfront Sea Pines, all under the tight restrictions imposed by Mr. Fraser. Home plans must be approved by an architectural review board, which requires homes in muted colors and varying styles.
Critics said the South Carolina courts would never stand for such restrictions. But the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in Mr. Fraser's favor.
O UTSIDE Sea Pines Plantation there is an abundance of strip malls and traffic congestion on the William Hilton Parkway, the 42-square-mile island's main thoroughfare. But within Sea Pines, roads meander rather than lunging ramrod-straight through the community. It seems almost an understatement to say landscaping is lush. Azaleas, live oaks and dozens of other kinds of native vegetation, planted decades ago, are mature and flourishing.
Mr. Fraser said skeptics became convinced he was onto something after the first 150 homes were built.
"People liked the idea," he said. "The covenants were copied in 150-200 places. People knew exactly what to expect."
From 1965-75, construction was nonstop and home sales followed suit, former employees remember. Mr. Fraser sent workers on flying trips around the country to see how things were done elsewhere. James Chafin, who worked for Sea Pines and is now developing Spring Island, remembers Mr. Fraser's chartering a DC-9 to send 115 employees to study a Southern California project.
"It was like being around Beethoven, Napoleon and Jefferson all at the same time," Mr. Chapin said of Mr. Fraser. Mr. Chapin left his doctoral studies in psychology to work for Mr. Fraser. He said he was captivated by Mr. Fraser and his ideas at a dinner at Hilton Head in the late 60's.
In the late 60's and early 70's, the Sea Pines Company branched out, buying 3,000 acres at Amelia Island in Florida, 2,700 acres in Puerto Rico, 4,000 acres on the north end of Hilton Head, 2,600 in Richmond.
But then the recession hit. Interest rates rose and the Sea Pines Company fell into trouble. James Light, the new company president who is now Mr. Chapin's partner, started selling off assets. By the time the crisis ended, the company was much smaller and some of the bright young employees had moved on. Mr. Fraser regained control in 1976.
The company was sold in 1983 for $12 million, and Mr. Fraser has been consulting and dabbling in other pursuits ever since. He has worked for the last seven years with Mr. Rummell on Celebration, which will have a 34-building town center, including a town hall, movie theater, churches, neighborhood grocery store and medical complex.
The first phase will have 3,200 homesites. It is one of a few examples of this type of design being used for primary homes.
Mr. Fraser said his ideas are not often mimicked in primary-home construction because huge tracts near cities are expensive to assemble, city planners do not encourage such development and nearby landowners turn out in droves to say "not in my backyard."
"They only want big house developers near them," he said.
Moreover, developers often lack the core group needed to pull off such a complex assignment. That is one of Mr. Fraser's new pursuits -- getting the information needed by developers on the Internet.
Mr. Fraser is about a third of the way toward creating an Internet service to give developers quick and easy access to consultants in the 26 fields he says are needed to plan a town. A master contract will be worked out between a developer and Mr. Fraser, who in turn will pay the consultants. Consultants and developers will be linked by video-conferencing technology.
"I am very optimistic about that," he said. "I am not satisfied with the last 30 years of development. It's time to take what we know, mobilize it and do it."

HEADLINE: While You Were Sleeping

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
At 3 A.M., New Jersey can seem like a lonely place -- almost deserted except for the police officer prowling suburban streets, the night owl huddled over a cup of coffee in a diner, the motorist whizzing through an unattended tollbooth on the parkway.
But if you know where to look, the armies of the night are out there. 
 At midnight the workday is just getting under way for thousands of New Jersey residents -- in bakeries and in emergency rooms, at radio stations and in warehouses, in college dormitories and in supermarkets. AT&T employs an entire staff of network engineers to keep its lines of communication open round the clock. And Atlantic City's casinos, of course, support a 24-hour culture of newsstands, nightclubs, pawnshops and limousine and escort services.
Even when it comes to matters of the spirit, New Jersey never sleeps: the Catholic Youth Organization of the Archdiocese of Newark organized an all-night youth revival inside the C.Y.O. office in Kearny last night, to be followed by an outdoor mass at 5:30 A.M.
No one keeps statistics on whether the number of New Jerseyans working or otherwise active at night is on the rise (though a recent study found New Jerseyans to be more sleep-deprived than the nation as a whole). But the state's relative affluence and population density make it worthwhile for many sectors of the service economy to function round the clock, making it possible for you to have your teeth filled, work out at the gym, get your refrigerator repaired or have your mice exterminated at any hour.
And while there may not be as many factories operating around the clock as there once were, James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, noted that the state's position as a distribution hub insures that commerce never stops.
"Trucking activity keeps the highways bustling at night, much more so than historically was the case," Mr. Hughes said. "In many activities, whether they be manufacturing or service, just-in-time inventory practices mean many more distribution trips."
A week spent touring the state in the wee hours turned up a wide array of nocturnal activities. Next time you can't sleep, you can think about all the people out there keeping you company, by choice or by necessity:
What are 135 people doing in the school cafeteria adjoining St. John Vianney Roman Catholic Church at midnight?
They are playing bingo. But the crowd is small this week, because the progressive jackpot is only up to $952.
Which is fine with Jack Hare.
"One thing a lot of us are tired of is the progressive," says Mr. Hare, a 35-year-old pharmacy worker who plays bingo here in Colonia and elsewhere half a dozen times a week. "Ever since the progressive started last year, it's caused more trouble, more fights, people fighting with each other to get in."
Mr. Hare's main complaint about the progressive, however, is that he's losing money.
"Before the progressive," he says, setting down purple markers on the dozen cards laid out in front of him, "I used to spend $20 a night. Now I spend $40 a night. I've gone into debt $3,000 borrowing money from my employer."
Angel Nieves, the fiance of a friend of Mr. Hare's, wins $150 in the first game of bingo he has ever played. Beginner's luck, Mr. Hare and several others sigh. "It's a good start," Mr. Nieves says.
"That's a bingo," the announcer says after Mr. Nieves's numbers are read back. "Are there any other bingos? Are there bingos in the classroom?"
"No bingos in the classroom," a woman's voice calls over the loudspeaker, like a chiding teacher, from down the hall where the nonsmokers play.
AT 1 A.M. there is a Code Red at Hackensack University Medical Center. The fire alarm bell clangs relentlessly, but John Rowohlt and Michael Evans go right on sleeping, oblivious to the noise and the 17 sets of electrodes glued to their bodies.
This in itself is a useful piece of information to the polysomnographers at the Institute for Sleep-Wake Disorders, who spend the night watching the two men on closed-circuit monitors and tracking their vital signs -- heart rate, blood oxygen, eye and leg movement.
"We are awake at sleep lab to watch people sleep," says the clinic director, Dr. Susan Zafarlotfi.
Both men are in a state of chronic sleep deprivation caused by sleep apnea, a condition that causes their breathing passages to close and disturbs their rest, so that when they do sleep, their slumber is unnaturally deep. "Sleep is very, very fragile," Dr. Zafarlotfi says, "like a crystal."
An hour later, in a tiny studio tucked away in a warehouse in Lodi, Chris Greene steps up to the microphone.
"This is Chris Greene with the hourly forecast as of 2:05," Mr. Greene says. He zips through the one-minute update -- rain today, highs in the mid-60's, small craft advisory -- in one take and hits a button.
What does the weather-hot-line weatherman do when he's not reading the weather?
Not much.
"I probably end up working five minutes out of the hour," says Mr. Greene, whose voice can be heard weeknights from 2 to 10 A.M. by dialing 976-1212. Mr. Greene uses the rest of his time at Sun Dial Productions to watch television and study the sports pages.
Mr. Greene, 27, says his body has never adjusted to three years of working nights.
"It's a treat for me to go to bed on Friday night when it's still dark out," he says. "That's one of the best parts of the weekend."
At 2:25, the bingo players file out of the church cafeteria, faces drained by exhaustion and poor luck. Several groups seem to perk up slightly in the chilly parking lot, however, among the friends of Mr. Hare, who leads an expedition to the Galaxy Diner in Rahway.
 Across the street from the Galaxy, on the second floor of the Pyramid Health Club, Joe DiComo is winding up his nightly workout with a stint on the treadmill, buoyed in part by the knowledge that the people in the diner probably think he's crazy.
"I only need four hours of sleep a night since I started really working out," says Mr. DiComo, 34, adding that he has lost 30 pounds since the beginning of the year on a diet that forbids fresh fruit, among other substances. "I wish I didn't have to sleep at all."
With three hours of weights, abs and cardio under his belt, Mr. DiComo, a manager at a health food company, is more than ready to begin his day. "I'm going to go home and have my protein shake and my oatmeal," he said, "then go to Shop-Rite and get my chicken and tuna and brown rice for the week."
The night manager of the health club, Jay Haddad, says the club's 24-hour operation is "probably its biggest selling point."
"People love it," he says. "It puts your mind at ease. You don't have to rush to get to the gym before it closes."
In Atlantic City, a man who gives his name only as Marcus works on his body-building in a G-string, in time to throbbing dance music against a backdrop of green neon springs. He is a go-go dancer at Studio 6, one of the state's biggest gay bars, "Where Entertainers Are Entertained."
"I basically want to learn how to dance better so that I can do a better presentation," Marcus, a 41-year-old retired Air Force sergeant who has been bodybuilding competitively since 1978, says later. "I know how to pose, but putting together a choreographed routine that's pleasing and natural is very difficult."
Marcus, whose wife and two children think he is at his other job as a nurse, says he does not mind the work environment.
"It's not really a sexual thing," he says. "It's a very practical way to reach my goals and make some money."
On the floor below, the other dancer, Adonis Poulos, is getting more attention and having a slightly more difficult time of things. One man, rather than tuck his bill into Mr. Poulos's waistband, reaches into the pouch of the G-string itself, and Mr. Poulos, a tall blond with magnificent cheekbones and a steady girlfriend, shoots him a dirty look. The man dances away.
Out of doors, in woods and swamps and meadows across the state, the natural world, unaided by electric lights, caffeine and other modern conveniences, more or less shuts down. "The middle of the night is kind of like the middle of the day," said Dave Jenkins, a zoologist for the state division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. "Things pretty much come to a stop." Even nocturnal animals -- raccoons, bats, owls -- do most of their food gathering just after dusk or just before dawn.
Indoor animals modify their schedules, and Ed Gorczynski of E & G Exterminating in South Amboy says he is occasionally summoned to go out in the middle of the night and rid a house of vermin. "A lot of times it'll be women," Mr. Gorczynski said. "They get nervous when they hear mice and rats scratching in the attic."
Underwater, where day and night mean much less than they do on land, life goes on. Striped bass prowl the surf in search of eels. Blue crabs swim in the channels. And in Cape May, the third-busiest fishing port on the East Coast, entire schools of fishing boats crowd the harbor, rushing to make the offshore canyons by dawn.
"Urnngh," John Rowohlt says in his sleep. "Urmmngh, grnnmgh, mmnnng." It is 2:32 in Hackensack, and Mr. Rowohlt, a 53-year-old limousine driver from Lodi, is having an obstructive hypopnea: his throat muscles are relaxing, closing off his air supply.
"It's like breathing through a collapsed straw," explains Donna Marshall, a senior sleep technician. "The harder you breathe the more it collapses."
Mr. Rowohlt does not wake up, but he tosses and pitches in bed, throwing off his covers. Ms. Marshall goes into his room and reattaches a stray electrode.
AT 3 A.M., Angelo B. Brugno Jr. is awakened by a beep of a pager at his home in Hamilton Township. He dresses quickly and meets his boss at the office. Together they drive to the house nearby where a 75-year-old woman has just died of cancer.
Mr. Brugno, a funeral director at Hamilton Brenna Cellini Funeral Home, counsels the woman's grown children for a few minutes, then asks them to go into another room. He and the manager lift the woman's body in her blankets and sheets and set her down on a stretcher. They refold the bedding carefully -- "We always try to leave the room looking nice," Mr. Brugno said -- and carry the body to the hearse and return to the funeral home, where Mr. Brugno begins embalming immediately.
"I've become accustomed to losing a night's sleep now and again," Mr. Brugno said, "but there's a lot of personal satisfaction that I get from this job. You take the good moments with the trying moments."
Frank Cosgrove sits in his car down by the tracks at a quarter past three, watching a towering, insectlike freight loader known as a Packer as it makes its way down a line of just-arrived tractor-trailer containers. The Packer hovers briefly over each 45-foot container, then leans down, wraps an arm around it and hoists it onto a train car.
"They're spooky to look at at night," says Mr. Cosgrove, the night trainmaster at Conrail's South Kearny Intermodal Terminal. "Like a big monster coming at you."
The 50-car Mail Train, filled with containers from United Parcel Service and the United States Postal Service, is bound for East St. Louis, Ill., in the morning.
"The cutoff for this train is at 5 A.M. and it's already 60 or 70 percent loaded," he says. "That makes me happy."
After their shift ends at 4, the go-go dancers, Marcus and Mr. Poulos, sit a table at the bar downstairs and wax philosophical. Mr. Poulos, who plans to quit dancing when he enters the police academy in the fall, says that discipline is the key to successful go-go dancing.
"Dancing is 99 percent mental," he says. "It's like there's cameras on you and you're in a movie. You have to convince yourself of what you're doing, and you have to convince other people that you're enjoying what you're doing."
Marcus, who says he plans to keep dancing until his looks give out, takes a longer view.
"I made less than $100 tonight, but I'm meeting people, I'm networking," he says. "Tonight I met someone who introduced me to another manager. This is all about who I can benefit and who can benefit me."
"We are subhuman life forms of the deep," Stephen Sprague intones over a 4:30 A.M. mid-shift break of cookies, coffee and chunks of fresh tuna. "Lobster man, tuna man, fillet man . . ."
Indeed, the years of carving up fish in refrigerated chambers in the dead of night have given Mr. Sprague and some of his colleagues at New York Fish House in Elizabeth an undeniably subterranean cast. But the place is bustling and cheerful. Gerard Hoff, the fillet man, sings along with the radio at the top of his lungs as he pulls his knife through a striped bass and pulls pinbones out of salmon. And Mr. Sprague, whose oil painting of a fellow tuna man hangs in the office down the hall, seems to have a bottomless passion for his chosen fish.
The business day at New York Fish House, a custom seafood packer that claims to be the East Coast's leading purveyor of sashimi-grade tuna, begins at 8 P.M. when chefs start calling in the next day's orders. By 1 A.M., the company's truck drivers are on their way to airports and the Fulton Fish Market, rounding up snapper and orange roughy from New Zealand, sea urchins from California, tuna, flounder and striped bass from local waters.
In the tuna room, surrounded by enormous slabs of pink and red and maroon, Mr. Sprague opens a box and tips a 160-pound Ecuadorean bigeye onto the metal table. With a few strokes of his knife and a whack of his cleaver, he cuts the carcass in half, then in quarters. He pauses for a second and points to a nearly luminous log of flesh on the shelf across from him.
"That's a beautiful tuna over there," he says. "The meat is translucent. You can't describe it, it's like trying to describe the color red. You can see through it, look into it, it's opulent. It reminds me of Rembrandt's painting of the slaughtered oxen.
"It was somewhat scandalous at the time," he went on. "You didn't paint slaughtered oxen in the 17th century."
As the dawn comes up like house lights over Route 495, the access road to the Lincoln Tunnel, tunnel and bridge agents from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey signal the start of a new day by converting one of the outbound lanes into an inbound bus lane. In a process known as plunking, a worker riding on the side of a slow-moving rig plants yellow plastic lane markers in holes in the road spaced every 20 feet or so.
At the Tunnel Diner in Jersey City, the lull of night has already given way to the morning rush, there is a line at the register and tempers are growing short.
A middle-aged man in a windbreaker orders a cup of tea and a Daily News. The cashier pulls a paper off the stack and slaps it down on the counter. Page one is frayed along the bottom.
"I don't want that raggedy one," the customer says.
The cashier pretends not to hear and rings up the next customer.
The man in the windbreaker does not budge.
"I don't want that raggedy one," he repeats.
The cashier shakes his head at the man even as he replaces the damaged merchandise. "Come on, whaddya want?" he says. "It's a newspaper."

Deep Roots, Broad Changes

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: CALVERTON

 BODY:
THE rooster just outside the door greets every morning with a song of joy. But its small-brained enthusiasm is not shared by Connie Farr, Long Island Railroad commuter, and her husband, Rex Farr, Long Island farmer. Consciousness resurrects thoughts of work.
If the weekday routine whirs along without interruption, Ms. Farr will be in nearby Riverhead an hour later, stepping aboard the 6:07, a mostly empty diesel train bound for Ronkonkoma. There she catches an electrically powered train for Manhattan, where she works as a knit-fabric designer. Her 77-mile morning commute takes 2 hours and 12 minutes. Theoretically. 
 When not reading, or sharing in the fatalistic humor that comes easily to commuters, Connie Farr gazes through Plexiglas windows at the passing Long Island landscape. Since she began commuting from this farm town eight years ago, there have been constants: the remnants of pine barrens, the sadly beautiful headstones of Pinelawn Cemetery. And there have been changes: because of the huge layoffs at the once-mighty Grumman Corporation, fewer people get off now at the Bethpage stop.
By the time Ms. Farr reaches Manhattan, her husband has already fed the couple's eclectic menagerie: a pony, two dogs, three goats, 20 sheep, some chickens, various ducks and about 30 cats. To keep track of their pride of felines, the Farrs have tacked a cat roster to the kitchen wall; thin pencil lines have been drawn through the names of Kitty and Spike.
Then, for the rest of the day, on 55 acres that once produced the famous but low-profit Long Island potato, he now grows organic produce, from gourmet lettuce to yellow zucchini, from heirloom tomatoes to leeks. While his wife toils amid millions of people, Mr. Farr, a former entertainment producer, has days when he wonders how he got here -- standing alone on rich, eastern Island loam, talking to vegetables.
In many ways, the Farrs of Calverton are Long Island today; they represent where the region has been, and where it is headed. And, in more intangible ways, they typify the region's 2.6 million residents: they work hard to realize their dreams while living on a 118-mile stretch of land that juts into the Atlantic Ocean like a snagged bluefish.
The year 1996 finds Long Island the same as ever -- it keeps changing. Just as the various moods of the Atlantic continue to redefine the southern belly of the island, so too do demographics and economics continue to redefine who we are and how we live. Popular culture would have it that we live in one big Levittown; that our sons are Howard Sterns, our daughters Amy Fishers and our parents the Buttafuocos.
In truth, we are the farmers in Southold and Southampton, who trace our Long Island roots back three centuries, and we are the Dominican and Guatemalan emigres in Hempstead, who trace our Long Island roots in terms of months, not years. And we are American Indiansof the Shinnecock and Poospatuck tribes, whose ancestors were here well before 1524, when Giovanni da Verrazano first laid eyes on Suffolk's sandy coast.
We are the commuters, rocked and swayed inexorably toward Manhattan, and we are the engineers and bankers, clerks and laborers, fighting traffic to get from one part of the island to another. We are the affluent of Sands Point to the north, the poor of Patchogue to the south, and the middle class in between, whose heritage of tenement life in Depression-era New York City has spawned pride for the simplest of ranch-style homes.
 
The Mad Dash Down L.I.E. and Onto L.I.R.R.
We are Connie and Rex Farr.
Connie Farr is 48, a macrobiotic vegetarian, and a veteran of many a commuter war. She knows to bring a small blanket to ward off the winds that whip about the feet of L.I.R.R. passengers. She knows that if she misses the 6:07 in the morning, she can race her Geo down the Long Island Expressway to catch the connection at Yaphank. And she knows that if the 5:41, the last train to Far East destinations like Riverhead, leaves without her in the evening, itmeans a $50 cab ride from Ronkonkoma back to Calverton.
Commuting five hours a day, five days a week, can do strange things to a person. Ms. Farr and her buddies have imagined who might play them in a television sitcom about the largest commuter railroad in the nation. They have placed bets on the number of eggs beneath that swan they see every day, the one nesting in the shallow waters of the Peconic River. And, on more than one occasion, Ms. Farr has nodded off, only to wake with her body sprawled across the seat and her head jutting into the aisle. This is one reason why she tries to remain alert, she says: "I try to find a clean window."
However tedious, Ms. Farr's daily commuting carries historical resonance. In the mid-1830's, teams of laborers in Brooklyn and in Greenport began laying track for what became the Long Island Railroad. They carved through the woods and pine barrens that once covered Farmingdale, Deer Park and Brentwood to lay down the original line, the Ronkonkoma line now traveled by Ms. Farr.
 
Working People And Middle-Class Life
From her window, she bears witness to Long Island's continuing development. Many of the houses she sees in Suffolk, the subdivisions of raised ranches, were carved out of potato fields and woods to accommodate the tens of thousands who moved eastward in the last 30 years. Since 1960, Suffolk's population has ballooned by more than a million, to 1.33 million people.
As she continues west into Nassau County, Ms. Farr sees older homes, colonials and Cape Cods set on smaller lots. Some were built before World War II, but many more were built for returning soldiers and military workers who used low-interest government loans to trade city asphalt for suburban grass. In one two-year span, William Levitt, the developer, built 10,101 houses in what became Levittown. No wonder, then, that between 1950 and 1960, Nassau County's population doubled to 1.3 million.
"It became possible," said Barbara Kelly, curator of Hofstra University's Institute of Long Island Studies, "for the working people to have what the middle class had taken for granted. A house. A front yard. A backyard."
Ms. Farr is one of 110,000 people on Long Island who take trains to jobs amid Manhattan skyscrapers. It has been this way for most of the 20th century, ever since train tunnels under the East River connected the two islands in 1910. But time still moves slowly inside those railroad cars; Ms. Farr sees more of her fellow commuters during the week than she does of her husband.
Thousands more commute to Manhattan by car and truck, along the latticework of pavement laid over the island by, among others, uber-planner Robert Moses. Just as experienced L.I.R.R. passengers know every lurch in the approach to Jamaica station, so, too, do Long Island Expressway veterans know every exit. Such knowledge comes not from mnemonic devices, but from hours spent in traffic, staring at green signs in the distance.
But there are dramatic changes taking place in Long Island's work force, as well as within the many homes that Ms. Farr passes every day.
The region's economy continues to reel from the leveling blow it received in the late 1980's, when the recession and Government cutbacks hit Long Island square in its breadbasket: the military and aerospace industries. According to Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the region's military-related businesses lost more than 43,000 jobs between 1986 and 1994, a loss roughly equivalent to the population of Hicksville. Thousands more lost jobs in related fields.
Today the collapse of those industries are reflected in sobering ways. Grumman Corporation in Bethpage was once the island's largest private employer; now that claim is held by Waldbaum's supermarkets, and Grumman's old headquarters is for sale. And on the grounds of the old Fairchild Republic aircraft factory in East Farmingdale, a "multiplex" movie theater is under construction.
There are some positive signs. "Long Island is reinventing itself," said Gary Huth, a labor market analyst for the New York State Department of Labor. "You see some of the traditional businesses losing jobs -- banking, aerospace and defense -- but you are finding some of those companies related to defense reinventing themselves in some way. Some are going into electronic products, and some will benefit from the upturn in the civilian air market."
Mr. Huth and other economists say the jobs lost at places like Grumman are being replaced piecemeal: 10 jobs in a plant in Hauppauge, 20 jobs in a factory in Plainview. "That's not nearly as visible to people," Mr. Huth said. "But is it encouraging? No question about it."
Dr. Kamer was less sanguine. She said that most of the 44,000 jobs created in the last three years were low-paying positions in health and social services, with few new opportunities in manufacturing and construction.
"The loss of high-paying defense jobs, being replaced by lower-wage retail and service jobs, certainly poses a threat to our living standard if we do nothing about it," she said. "Instead of relying on the one engine of the defense industry, we're going to need several engines of growth. And that's going to help us in the long run."
Dr. Kamer and Mr. Huth belong to a chorus of economists and planners calling for Long Island to improve and match the region's work skills with the needs of emerging businesses. The Long Island Association and the State University at Stony Brook, among others, are working on projects to identify industries, like biotechnology and graphics communications, that should create better-paying jobs for the region.
All this has affected how people spend their money on Long Island. National retailers salivate over the region's general affluence and spending habits. The Wall Street Journal recently ranked the country's metropolitan areas by median household income: Long Island was first, with $70,091, and San Jose, Calif., was a distant second.
It is an island of consumerism, where community pride often blends with retail needs. The mall in Huntington bears the name of the island's most celebrated poet, Walt Whitman, and the mall at Roosevelt Field, the gem in the region's crown of malls, sits on the approximate site where Charles A. Lindbergh took flight for Paris in 1927.
 
The Changing Face Of Consumerism
The success of Long Island's nine regional malls and its sprawling shopping centers has wounded the downtown businesses of Bay Shore, Patchogue, and even Garden City's Franklin Avenue. Once the self-proclaimed Fifth Avenue of Long Island, the avenue now has several empty storefronts; a "for rent" sign hangs in the window of a closed furrier shop.
The reason is Darwinian, said Barry Berman, a business professor at Hofstra University. "I have 250-odd stores at Roosevelt Field," he said. "Why the heck do I want to go to Franklin Avenue to have Lord & Taylor's and Saks Fifth Avenue?"
But 50 miles east of Roosevelt Field, where shoppers can have their cars parked by a valet while they browse the aisles of Bloomingdale's, Wal-Mart has opened two stores in the Town of Brookhaven. Meanwhile, other discount stores, like Caldor and Kmart, have proliferated throughout Long Island.
"One has to bear in mind that the mass market has basically divided itself," Professor Berman said. "You have less than affluent and more than affluent. Kmart wasn't here 25 years ago. Caldor wasn't here 25 years ago. There are plenty of people who are single parents, who have been downsized, who haven't done well for one reason or another."
Economics have wrought other changes as well. Long Island's postwar pioneers are retiring and moving to places like Florida, North Carolina -- and eastern Suffolk. Some of their sons and daughters have been able to buy homes on the island, even in the neighborhoods where they grew up. But many others have been priced out of the market, thanks to the high cost of houses -- averaging close to $180,000 -- and tax and utility bills that are among the highest in the country.
The Levittown dream of yesteryear has proved elusive today. Young adults are having difficulty trying to replicate an experience their parents may have taken for granted: owning a house. And there is some indication that people are moving away. According to the American Movers' Conference, a moving-industry association, Long Island was not among the country's top 10 areas from which people were moving in 1994; in the first nine months of 1995, it ranked first.
But the Farrs have decided to stay. And their attempt to carve a diverse niche in Long Island's competitive farming world represents what economists say is needed throughout the island's business world.
Rex Farr is 49, with dark-blond hair that sticks out like straw from under his John Deere cap. His rural look of today contradicts the more urbane look of his past. In another life, he was an entertainment producer, known among the avant-garde of Greenwich Village and by the waiters at Elaine's.
But his family goes back three generations in Southampton. And in 1984, after several years of living in Huntington, Mr. Farr and his wife decided to move east, with vague plans to buy a plot big enough to rehearse Busby Berkeley-like productions around the swimming pool. They bought a 60-acre farm, built a log cabin on the foundation of an old shed, and soon learned that the water in their well was laced with pesticides.
Perhaps it was the fresh air, or maybe the re-evaluation that comes in midlife. But in 1989, Mr. Farr decided to try his hand at farming organically, using the marketing know-how the couple had acquired in the fashion and entertainment industries. They started slowly, taking classes, growing "high-end crops" like yellow pear tomatoes and zucchini flowers on four acres. Mr. Farr would sometimes truck the produce into Manhattan himself, selling it to restaurants and shops he once frequented.
Today, the Farrs have 55 acres in production, with the choice of vegetables changing with their reading of what is in demand. "Farming is not like having a hit record," Mr. Farr said. "If you have a hit crop, you have to go back."
There have been setbacks. They are still paying debt on problems they had during the 1991 season, and their irrigation pump -- as important as the loam -- broke down last year. And they are aware that some Suffolk farmers, whose families go back generations, first considered the Farrs to be hopeless neophytes (a reputation enhanced in 1991, when two valuable heifers fled the Farr farm and wandered about the area for two months -- including an occasional jaunt down the streets of Riverhead).
Now, Ms. Farr said, "They don't laugh as much."
Joseph Gergela 3d, executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau, is among those applauding rather than laughing. The region's farmers, once known almost entirely for their potato and cauliflower crops, have been forced by production costs and the market to diversify or hang up their coveralls. Indeed, more than 1,000 acres of farmland are lost every year, mostly to make way for subdivisions.
 
Agricultural Sales Lead the State
But the farming community's ability to shift focus has paid off, Mr. Gergela said. Twenty-five years ago there were no vineyards on Long Island; now there are 16 wineries producing 3 million bottles of wine a year. Where potatoes once grew, there are now sod farms, nurseries, specialty produce -- all of which have made Long Island the state's leader in agricultural sales.
Each weeknight, Connie Farr races to Pennsylvania Station to catch the 5:41 back home. There have been times when she reached the platform just as the train's doors closed, and the urge to scream had to be stifled. Once, and only once, her desperate pleas persuaded an engineer to open the door for her.
She looks forward to the return home, especially on Friday evenings. She and her East End buddies used to be so excited that they'd have Friday-night mixers on board -- one person would bring pretzels, another some beer -- until complaints from other passengers ended the reverie. Still, those nights heading east remain sweet.
With the sun setting, the evening light can set the drabbest of suburban homes aglow, and the possibilities of Long Island seem good and many. The beaches. The parks. The crops. Heck, even the Mets.
"It's a quality of life that you can take for granted, that you only begin to realize when you go to other parts of the country," Dr. Kamer said. "We tend to focus on the negatives, I guess because New Yorkers like to gripe."
Back home in Calverton, Connie and Rex Farr might go to a restaurant, where they have been known to barter for a meal with produce. On Sunday, their only day off, they might go to the beach. Or Connie Farr might just sit at her kitchen table with a cup of herbal tea by her elbow, peering through binoculars to make sure that their animals don't stray from the homestead.
"Duck on the road," she might say.

HEADLINE: L.I. Over 25 Years: Realizing a Dream;
Crossing the Island, A Slice of America

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
TO drive the 120 miles from Brooklyn to Montauk, the length of Long Island, is in a strange sort of way like crossing the continent. It is a journey that begins in the great city, moves on and on through what can seem like endless stretches of different landscapes, then culminates in a place of great beauty where the land runs out at the edge of the sea.
Now it is not exactly like crossing the country, of course. There is no Continental Divide, since it is something of a stretch to conceive of the pine barrens as being nature's break between East and West, and obviously it takes somewhat less time to traverse Long Island than the American continent, although on certain Friday afternoons in the summer it is reasonable to think otherwise. 
 But this metaphor is more a matter of state of mind than of any tangible facts about the landscape. After all, the Hamptons really do feel more and more like California all the time, and the Island, like the country at large, is forever being crossed by people who have business at either end, and pay scant attention to what is in between.
Yet what is in between is what truly validates the metaphor, for it is the American postwar world, more fully realized here than anywhere else. Long Island between the city and the East End is the archetypical American landscape, the quintessential expression of all its banal madness, all its boredom, liveliness and strange, humming kind of energy.
Road after road, strip mall after strip mall, a land governed by automobiles and the kind of buildings that are made to accommodate to them. The Island has never been as industrialized as New Jersey, and with the exception of certain parts of the North Shore it has never been as genteel as Connecticut. Until the 1950's, Long Island was mostly small towns and farmland, ready and waiting for sprawl. Sprawl is what it got: from Queens to the middle of Suffolk County, a place that looks like most American places, only more so.
Here is where we see, as clearly as anywhere in the country, precisely what the American landscape will turn into if it is allowed to develop more or less by itself. Some of it is vulgar, some of it is beautiful, and nearly all of it is compelling.
It is a kind of badly compromised version of Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City, that design from the 1930's in which Wright, perhaps the only great modern architect who understood the profound effect the automobile would have on the landscape, tried to pre-empt chaos by prescribing an ordered mix of housing, roads, commercial buildings and farmland.
Long Island is not the Broadacre City of Wright's imagination but the real one, twisted and contorted by the realities of the marketplace and dozens of different municipal jurisdictions so that it seems, to the casual observer, to be less a vision of suburban order than one of anarchy.
Yet there is an order to the Island, and if it is not easy to see, it is very much there, and its effect is vast. Cityscapes do not take their form for no reason at all, and that of Long Island is no exception.
 
A Raw, Blunt Sense To the Sunrise
There is not much beauty to the Sunrise Highway, but there is a certain raw, blunt sense to it: low, sprawling buildings with big signs that can be read instantly from a moving car; lots of arrows telling you where to go, where to turn, when to get onto the service road and when to get off, everything designed to keep the traffic flowing and to ease the movement out of cars and into Waldbaum's or McDonald's or whatever. The green arrow indicating a protected left turn may not be one of the noblest inventions of man, but it is all part of the system that, until it was burdened by a volume of traffic it simply could not take, actually made a certain sense.
That is all a kind of hidden order, a rational underbelly that makes the insipid sprawl, if not easier to take, at least easier to understand. There is another kind of order to the physical form of Long Island, a more visible one. The Island has two great systems of transportation infrastructure: the Long Island Railroad, built gradually starting in the 1830's, and the parkway and expressway system, built largely by Robert Moses from the late 1920's to the 1950's.
Its form is affected by its two great natural resources as well: the waterfronts of the Atlantic Ocean on the South Shore and Long Island Sound on the north, and then by the remarkable system of public parks, also virtually all the product of Robert Moses' career, built from the late 1920's through the 1930's.
The story of Long Island's physical form over the last 75 years is very much the story of Robert Moses, who treated the Island as something of a private fief in which to experiment with public works on a grand scale. Taken together, Moses' projects gave Long Island a set of resources that few areas anywhere have ever had, and they made it a kind of laboratory of American mid-20th-century suburban development.
Long Island is where, thanks to Moses, the metropolitan region did the most to accommodate itself to the automobile, and did it the soonest. And Long Island is where, thanks to Moses, the metropolitan region began to understand the notion that the public realm had to extend beyond urban parks and boulevards, and had to include great rural parks, parkways and public beaches as well.
The Northern State Parkway, the Southern State Parkway, Jones Beach, Heckscher State Park, Caumsett State Park, these are but the beginning; the list goes on and on, an extraordinary system of public works for a relatively condensed geographical area, and all of them built by Robert Moses to make Long Island a prototype for suburban development.
 
On the Road To Utopia?
Why, then, is Long Island not more perfect? There is almost no one who does not admire Jones Beach as one of the great American public works of the 20th century, and Moses' parkways were models for a whole generation of road builders to follow. A place with all this, not to mention the resources nature gave it to start with, ought by any rights to have become utopia. How is it that we identify Long Island today more by the jumbled commercial mess of the now woefully misnamed Old Country Road in Westbury or by the shrill splatter of strip malls on the Sunrise Highway than by the soft, landscaped curves of the Northern State Parkway?
Long Island planned itself more or less the way the hare ran its race against the tortoise: Moses' infrastructure made it seem so far ahead of other places in accommodating to the new, automobile-oriented suburban landscape that by the late 1950's it was ready to sit down and take a rest, unaware that the world was rapidly gaining on it. By then the first parkways were already a generation old, and the Long Island Expressway was being built (at Moses' insistence) without a rapid-transit capacity or much ease of expansion.
Far worse, the Moses infrastructure lulled local officials into thinking that their towns and villages could handle more growth than they really could. Long Island in the postwar years threw its doors open to development. More and more houses and more and more strip malls seemed only to mean more and more tax dollars, and not a lot of people were thinking of the long-term implications.
One who did was Lee E. Koppelman, the longtime head of the Nassau-Suffolk Regional Planning Board, who argued consistently for tighter zoning regulations and for the preservation of more open space, not to mention for a view of Long Island as a whole. No small part of the problem of planning in the post-Moses era was the way it was rapidly becoming Babylon against Hempstead, Oyster Bay against Smithtown, the whole Island a series of competing duchies.
Though his sensibilities were quite different from Moses', Mr. Koppelman was the first public official since Moses to try to see the Island in a unified way, and thanks largely to his efforts, effective programs were established to save thousands of acres of agricultural land from real-estate development, and additional public land was set aside for parks. But compared with the land being turned into tract houses and shopping malls and parking lots, it was a pittance.
 
Growth of Levittown Redefined Landscape
The place it all began for Long Island, and in a sense symbolically for postwar suburban America in general, was Levittown. Over four years, from 1947 to 1951, William Levitt built more than 17,000 houses on 4,700 acres of former potato fields north of the Hempstead Turnpike near Bethpage, and the American landscape was never quite the same again.
Levitt's little houses, Cape Cod-style cottages set on concrete slabs, sold originally for $7,990, making suburban living affordable to vast numbers of city dwellers who yearned for their own backyards. Here, truly, did the American dream open up to the working class. Levitt's suburban boxes were to houses what Henry Ford's Model T was to cars.
Today Levittown remains, not only the seed of Long Island's explosive postwar growth but also a place in which, as firmly as in any city, one can view the passage of time. Levittown has mellowed, mutated, adapted, proving wrong both its critics, who denounced it as hopelessly monotonous, and its creators, who viewed it as a panacea. For the very thing that William Levitt created with such pride, and his critics attacked with such vehemence, is no more: the sameness, the monotony, the dreary repetition of a single house type over block after block after block.
Now it is a struggle to find a house that looks even remotely like the original. (One that has survived virtually unaltered has even been proposed for landmark status, a startling but not unreasonable icon.) The Levittown houses have been embellished with new windows, shutters, porticos, verandas, bay windows, brick fronts, carports or extra rooms tacked onto the sides.
In some cases the whole shape is gone, with the roof raised to create a two-story house, or raised in the rear to turn it into a pseudo-saltbox. There is every which color. There is even one house with its original Cape Cod shape but a facade sheathed in stone and new, diamond-paned windows: Levittown goes Tudor.
Paradoxically, this place that was once dismissed as the ultimate in suburban conformity has now metamorphosed into the most eclectic of suburbs, a place in which personal expression seems an essential part of the experience of home ownership. Yet Levittown, if it has grown into a celebration of personal taste, is hardly a triumph of planning.
Levitt's original design, which included local shopping areas scattered through the development, has mostly given way to the vast machine of strip mall retailing on Hempstead Turnpike. The only thing that makes the streets inside the development attractive is what nearly 50 years of growth has done to the small saplings planted when Levittown was new, for now the streets are protected by a canopy of large trees.
Levittown is the Long Island of the first generation of sprawl. The areas around where the Long Island Expressway intersects with Route 110 in Melville and with the Veterans Highway in Islandia both represent the Long Island of a later generation. It features the new corporate park of low office buildings in funny shapes with fancy curves and mirror-glass fronts, with the strange mix of corporate dullness and glitzy architectural form that you associate with buildings around Houston or Dallas.
Virtually none of these boxes is of any architectural interest (save for Richard Meier's headquarters for Swissair off Route 110, a building of far too much finesse for its surroundings). This is the city without a center, the new downtown for an age that spurns downtowns and streets and prefers to take its office buildings in the middle of acres of parking lots. This new city is anchored by nothing, save for the expressway, which flows by it night and day, the river that, like the rivers of old, gives this city its reason for being where it is.
Long Island over the last 50 years has moved away from urbanity, not toward it. It is not only less connected with New York than it once was (save for those Manhattanites who drive through it to the East End, never seeing the middle), it has become more chaotic in its sprawl, less attuned to any kind of center at all.
 
Too Many People, Too Many Automobiles
Areas like Islandia or the Route 110 corridor could have represented opportunities to develop new kinds of centers, the kinds of agglomerations of office buildings and housing and shopping and entertainment that are increasingly bringing a new, organized kind of density oriented toward the automobile to other suburban areas around the country. But such coordinated development has yet to happen here. There is too much determination to develop each town, each village, each piece of land, by itself to think regionally, and rationally.
The real sadness of Long Island is that it is built around an idea that only works at light densities: taking beautiful agricultural land and chopping it up for houses, shopping malls and an office park or two. Frank Lloyd Wright in his modesty envisioned Broadacre City as covering much of the country, so he could afford to assume that there would be an acre per person, spread thin enough to leave lots of land free.
But the pseudo-Broadacre City we have on Long Island has now become as dense as many cities, with too many people who have too many automobiles which take up too many roads and fill too many parking lots. As cars beget more cars, roads beget more roads, and it is an unending spiral, never enough.
Now, the saddest thing of all is to see small towns disappearing into the overall megasprawl. Where are streets in Long Island? There are a handful: the centers of Roslyn, and Huntington, for example, still possess the qualities of true towns, and a sense of distinct identity. But by and large the landscape of Long Island, once so different from place to place, is increasingly becoming one thing, from Valley Stream to Sayville, from Garden City to Smithtown.
Once, Levittown represented a far eastward leap of development. Now, it almost disappears in the vast march of suburbanization. It is even knocking on the door of the Hamptons now, with megastores and malls pushing their way into what had once been an extraordinary rural stretch of land, those great potato fields running to the sea: the last remnants of the Long Island that was.
But even if the East End towns manage to hold the line on foolish and destructive development, it is too late for most of the Island, which feels ever more like it has sunk into an amorphous sea of cars. Who can tell the difference between the Sunrise Highway and the Hempstead Turnpike, between Old Country Road in Westbury and Route 106 in Hicksville? Every part of the Island becoming all the more like every other: in this sense, Long Island really does prove itself to be all too much like America.
Never mind fish, or sailboats, or Long Island ducks. The only fitting symbol of the Island now is the green left-turn arrow.

HEADLINE: ON THE MAP;
In Englewood, Restoring a Symbol of the Past, and Future

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
For decades, Englewood has seemed to have two downtowns, roughly divided by the old Erie Railroad. Mansions on the East Hill overlook run-down row houses across the tracks to the west. Palisade Avenue jumps from tony shops to vacant storefronts. And then there's Dwight Morrow High School's famous racial imbalance.
But there is a plan to bring the two Englewoods closer. Civic-minded residents are raising $150,000 to make over the traffic circle at West Palisade Avenue and Tenafly Road, site of the Liberty Pole, first erected in 1766 to celebrate Britain's repeal of the tyrannical Stamp Act. A block away, the city will invest $800,000 to fix up half a dozen houses on Armory Street, one of the most troubled neighborhoods in the city of 24,000 residents. Other money will go for new ball fields and tennis courts. 
 "Politics, that's all it is," said Manuel Ocampo, 29, a mechanic being forced to move off Armory Street under a zoning crackdown. But remarks like that don't faze Mayor Donald Aronson, who spoke recently as he toured the city in his BMW.
Q. Why does the west side need help?
A. We have the most expensive housing stock in Bergen County here. We have one house, I know for sure, that runs in excess of $10 million. Without mentioning them by name, we have 3 of the 10 wealthiest families in the State of New Jersey. And we also have the greatest poverty in Bergen County. So we have this mixture of the very rich and the very poor, and the concern is, of course, that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.
The east side of town has become the shopping district for not only Englewood. The folks who live in Tenafly and Cresskill and Dumont, Demarest, Fort Lee have used the boutique-type shopping that we have. There's a certain affluent type of clientele. And the rents are high and the stores are doing well.
And the question became, what do you do with the west side of town? We are one city, we want to live together and not separated. We don't want to be two Englewoods.
Q. Do both sides of the tracks really care what some colonists did when the Stamp Act was repealed?
A. Not at all. But you do need a sense of character. Are both sides of the tracks going to use the soccer field? Are both sides concerned about Armory Street? It's an overall community situation. You don't live by bread alone. And that's maybe what we're in the business of, creating some feeling of community pride. You have to look to the past to understand the future. I'm more concerned about the future and this is a symbol for the future, that there are people who care. I cared enough to give $1,000. If I were not Mayor, would I have given $1,000? Not too sure. Is this the most important thing to happen in Englewood? No. Is it the best publicity we've gotten in a long time? Yes.
Q. But do symbols generate economic activity?
A. What we're trying to do is bring the folks with the bucks in their pocket to this part of town. All you can do is pump up a particular section of town by making certain that the community is kept as clean as it possibly can be and by upgrading the problem areas. Armory Street is the worst street in Englewood.
Q. What are the relations between the two parts of town?
A. There's always an undercurrent of problems with people isolating themselves. It's a constant job of the Mayor to see that there are events in the community for everyone.
Q. And you think the west side projects will alter perceptions?
A. I'm in the perception business. STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Swing Low, Sweet Corporation, and All That Jazz

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
"FIRST you play jazz; then you betray your country," goes an old Soviet slogan, a bygone warning so familiar to Russians that it was easily satirized when the daily newspaper Izvestia reported Bill Clinton's election victory in 1992. ("First You Play Saxophone . . . ," read the front-page headline, atop a photo of America's new President.)
So if jazz is bad for Communism, is it good for capitalism? 
 John Kao thinks so.
Mr. Kao, who teaches a course in creativity at Harvard Business School, is the author of "Jamming: The Art and Discipline of Business Creativity" (HarperBusiness, $23), due at bookstores in about a month.
Once a classical piano student, Mr. Kao woke up to jazz at boarding school when some fellow students introduced him to the music of John Coltrane and Charlie Parker and taught him about be-bop.
He never got over it. These days, the professor plays jazz on his piano. He has taken the idea of the jam session to the corporate world, where, he says, it can be a great tool for creativity.
"Jazz, like business, implies a series of balancing acts," he writes. That is, a successful run happens only when the players are disciplined, but not driven, by formulas.
The metaphor aside, the overarching message of "Jamming," that creativity is a crucial asset, is one we've heard before. The author, however, turns up the volume in this book.
Mr. Kao, who has written variations on this theme in earlier books about entrepreneurship and managing, announces that we have now entered the Creative Age, the fourth and latest "era" of global economic activity. (The first three activities were agriculture, industry and information.)
Information technology has swooped us into this creative era, he says, because it has changed the way ideas flow. Today, a keystroke can bring fresh data and a prism of perspectives to a problem. Think of the Internet, the author suggests, where "a good idea provokes an uninhibited cascade of reactions."
But the digital push is just one reason we've warped into the creativity zone, Mr. Kao says. There are pressures from workers, who increasingly feel entitled to creative jobs (a premise I wish the author had developed more fully). And there are pressures from the economy. With much of corporate America in industries wrestling with turmoil, he says, businesses must reinvent themselves or wither.
So what's the way to creativity if you are a manager who likes employees to stick to the sheet music? First, to borrow a metaphor from the dull old world of accounting, conduct an audit.
Find out where "creativity initiatives" usually come from in your company, and what their usual fate is. (The author defines an "initiative" as any proposal for change that gets a serious hearing from at least one person, not counting the originator's "spouse, friend or office mate.") Figure out what chunk of revenue comes from products that are less than a few years old. And perhaps most important, take a look at the office itself, its architecture and design.
Open spaces foster what is needed in Mr. Kao's universe: polite confrontation and cross-pollination. He points to companies like Oticon in Denmark, an innovator in hearing aids whose employees' offices are just credenzas-on-wheels that even move between floors. Each floor has a coffee bar for schmoozing (another one-word management-book title, if I ever saw one, though it will have to wait for an author who was electrified during his formative years by klezmer music at a stay in a Catskills resort.)
And because Charlie Parker talked about going to "the woodshed" when he needed to perfect a musical concept, companies should have "woodshed" rooms, Mr. Kao says, spaces that give employees a place to refresh their minds.
As for what action to take, the idea is for managers to help find the "sweet spot" between the systematic way of doing things and the free flow of creativity.
To make his point, Mr. Kao offers this hip case study: When Minton's Playhouse, a Harlem jazz club, was wilting in 1940, the manager hired a house band based around the drummer Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk on piano. Then he declared "celebrity nights," laid out free food for visiting musicians and watched the big names arrive: Coleman Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie. When Charlie Parker was added to the mix on alto sax, be-bop was born and the club was saved.
The lessons for corporate managers: Look for a mix of stars and unknowns when matching people with a project. Keep the working space, physical and conceptual, open. Let creative competition flourish. Don't think of mistakes as fatal. Make sure someone is still minding the store. The key is in mixing the fixed and the free.
All this is hard to disagree with, given Mr. Kao's humane impulse to make work an entertaining place, and "Jamming" is more fun to read than most management books. But much of this is familiar: the open spaces, the flexible hierarchies. And some of it may be hopeless. Entrepreneurial creativity almost always sputters out when a company gets established. Employees who are asked to come up with the magic will soon figure out that it's still the higher-ups who reap the biggest rewards. As those jazz musicians knew.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
If You Fly With Vultures, Fasten Your Seat Belts

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
EVEN though Fidelity Investments threw in the towel in January on investing in weak and insolvent companies, Prudential Mutual Fund Management is pushing ahead.
This week, Prudential introduced a mutual fund to invest in the equity and debt of companies that appear on the brink of financial collapse or that are coming out of such a situation, perhaps from bankruptcy protection. Such investments are lumped together under the name "distressed securities," and the people who ply this risky market are often called "vultures" because they pick apart the remains of failed or faltering companies. 
 While Fidelity cited numerous logistical and regulatory problems in trying to run a mutual fund as a vulture fund, the investment opportunities remain tantalizing. Annualized returns for private limited partnerships that buy these securities have ranged from more than 20 percent to more than 30 percent over the last five years, according to Steven P. Galante, editor of the Private Equity Analyst in Wellesley, Mass.
Moreover, the climate seems favorable for such investors, according to Mr. Galante, who cited the surge in both bank lending and junk-bond issuance in the last few years. Junk bonds, with ratings just below corporate grade, are one step above distressed securities. Once a company is in default on its debt or is widely perceived to be near default, its securities are deemed distressed. The perception among vulture investors is that defaults will be back with a vengeance in the next recession, Mr. Galante said.
Contributing mightily to the inventory of distressed securities is the retailing industry, where plenty of companies are struggling under weak sales and increased competition, said Martin Whitman, a well-known vulture investor and manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund.
Bearing all this in mind, the Prudential Distressed Securities fund began accepting money on Wednesday, after garnering nearly $14 million in initial expressions of interest. Prudential pulls no punches about the risk. The fund's prospectus says that investing in securities of financially troubled companies can be speculative and that investors may experience a "substantial loss."
In an economic downturn, for example, teetering companies can be pushed to collapse, rendering their securities worthless.
But that is not the only obstacle for the new Prudential fund. When leaving the business, Fidelity explained that taking big positions in companies and becoming involved in company management -- as is common in distressed investing -- were inconsistent with its approach to money management.
As Mr. Whitman of Third Avenue said, "Mutual fund managers are supposed to be passive." The difficulty most funds face is highlighted by the fact that few fund managers other than Mr. Whitman and Michael Price, manager of the Mutual Series funds, do much in this area. Mr. Whitman invests heavily in distressed securities for his private accounts, and puts about 15 percent of the assets in his Third Avenue Value fund there. Mr. Price has about 5 to 10 percent of his funds' assets in distressed securities, according to Jeffrey Altman, vice president of the Mutual Series funds.
Managing large amounts of distressed securities in a mutual fund raises a panoply of legal, regulatory and operational problems. Investing in distressed companies often means tying up money for some time and becoming involved in management, perhaps by taking a seat on the company's board or on the creditors' committee.
When a company is reorganizing, its shareholders and creditors get together to strike an agreement on how to divide assets. "It is a negotiated process," explained Mark Durbiano, senior portfolio manager for Federated Investors' high-yield, or junk, bond funds. "If you're not at the table, no one is looking out for your fair share."
That can put a mutual fund in a difficult position. If a fund company agrees to sit on such a creditors' committee, the fund manager becomes privy to material, nonpublic information. He may also gain access to inside information on potential acquirers. Once saddled with such inside information, he has severe restrictions on his trading.
The manager may find himself in a jam, limited in his ability to sell securities to meet shareholder redemptions and restrained from fulfilling his duty to act in shareholders' best interests, said Burton Leibert, a partner at the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York.
Even if the fund manager does not sit on the creditors' committee, owning a big stake in a company in distress leads to other restrictions. Once a mutual fund accumulates a 5 percent interest in a company, it becomes an "affiliate" under mutual fund law. Transactions between affiliated companies are deemed ripe for abuse, and are thus limited. In practical terms, a fund company may not be able to sit down at the negotiating table without an exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Thomas R. Smith, a partner at the law firm of Brown & Wood in New York.
Finally, becoming involved in a reorganization often requires a fund manager to take an aggressive and confrontational approach, Mr. Whitman said. A manager must be prepared to file lawsuits and fight for his interests. Most managers and their companies simply are not prepared to take such a high-profile position, he said.
The bottom line, said Mr. Durbiano of Federated, is that a mutual fund is not the ideal vehicle for such investing. "You're restricted, you're illiquid, and there is a natural time process that can run from six months to five years to work through," he said.
Fidelity ran into a variety of problems, including bad publicity, and wound up with disappointing investments in several struggling companies, including the Harrah's Jazz Company, Merry-Go-Round Enterprises and the El Paso Electric Company. Since leaving Fidelity, Dan Harmetz, who managed three private investment partnerships there, has begun a new venture called DDJ Capital Management, in Wellesley, Mass., to continue doing this type of work. Fidelity Capital and Income, which invested as much as 40 percent in distressed securities under David J. Breazzano, has reduced its stake to about 5 percent, said its new manager, David L. Glancy.
Prudential acknowledges that its new fund may have to take an unusually active role in the affairs of companies. "This may subject the fund to litigation risks or prevent the fund from disposing of securities," the prospectus states.
But Charles Perkins, a spokesman for Prudential funds, said the company would try to sidestep potential problems by avoiding large, controlling positions and by declining to sit on reorganization committees. "We want to remain free to buy and sell securities without restrictions," he said.
Companies in bankruptcies make up only a third of the fund's investment universe, he said. The remaining investments will be in companies in turnaround situations and companies coming out of bankruptcy.
Staying away from an activist position could backfire, said some of the players in this close-knit market. "I think it's a tough area if you're not prepared to be an activist," Mr. Whitman said.
Prudential conceded as much in its prospectus: "Because other investors may buy securities in order to exercise control or management, the fund may be at a disadvantage."
For investors who want to get a taste of the vulture's life, the minimum investment in the Prudential fund is $10,000. If the fund reaches its goal of $50 million under management, annual expenses are expected to run 1.5 percent to 2.25 percent of assets. The maximum sales charge is 5 percent.
Or if you want a fund with an established record, Third Avenue Value and the Mutual Series of funds offer limited exposure. And for any individual, distressed securities are best kept a small part of the portfolio.

HEADLINE: AT THE SHORE;
Assembling a Season Piece by Piece, From Cape May On Up

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
Lawn chairs are being dusted off. Grills are coming out of storage. Beach badges are being bought. Even though you may not have believed that it would ever get here, another summer season at the Jersey Shore begins on Memorial Day. While students are scrambling for summer jobs and their parents are thinking about vacations on the beach, beachfront towns and merchants are bracing for the onslaught of visitors. Here is a sampling of how the season is shaping up.
 
EARNING: WHERE THE JOBS ARE
In some communities, the season starts with a job fair. In Wildwood, for instance, the city and the public schools are sponsoring their first job fair ever at Wildwood High School next Saturday; job seekers can talk to representatives of the local water park, the amusement piers and the Boardwalk Association, not to mention the municipal government and the Junior Lifeguards Association.
If the local job fair has already come and gone, job listings can be found at offices of the State Employment Service in Wildwood, Toms River, Atlantic City and Ocean City. And the State Department of Labor reports 13,200 openings in the federally subsidized Summer Youth Employment Program, down from 15,000 last summer.
If all else fails, the best bet is to select an area and then "start pounding the pavement," said Jeffrey Watson, manager of the Mad Batter, a popular Cape May restaurant that increases its staff from about 20 to 75 in season. The restaurant never advertises for help but still gets 500 applicants a year. Most of the jobs are filled, he went on, but there is always some turnover, and a few jobs open up when the truly busy season starts at the end of June.
The Lobster House, in Lower Township on the border of Cape May, more than doubles its staff, to nearly 500, says the owner, Keith Laudeman, adding that he also hires dock workers to help market the fish from private boats that dock at Cape May.
Up the shore in Seaside Heights, employers -- 75 to 100 boardwalk businesses, plus the borough -- hire 2,000 to 3,000 young people as waitresses, waiters, arcade attendants, clerks, maintenance workers and lifeguards. Michael Redpath, the borough's director of public affairs, says this year could top the record-setting summer of 1995, depending on weather and water quality.
Municipalities, counties and Island Beach State Park all hire lifeguards, who must pass physical and swimming tests and be able to earn a Red Cross lifesaving certificate.
Getting a job may be easier than finding a place to live for three months. In Wildwood, summer housing for seasonal employees is relatively plentiful; in Seaside Heights, many employers provide housing for their workers, or groups of young people join to rent a house at $4,000 to $8,500 for the season; but in other places, apartments for summer help are scarce.
"It's always been rough," said Connie Kosten, director of the Welcome Center in Cape May. "The price is going to be steep. They have to gang up or get places on the outskirts of the city."
 
RENTING: GET IN LINE
If you don't have a place lined up, you may be out of luck. At Schlosser Real Estate in Lavallette, for instance, only about 10 percent of the rental properties are still available. (For future reference, the time to look is in January and February, with Presidents' Day weekend the peak hunting time.)
A three-bedroom house on the beach in Lavallette goes for $1,500 to $3,100 a week, while an equivalent house a few blocks from the beach might cost $850 a week. The market was good last year and even better this year, said Trudy Slowineski, an agent with Schlosser, perhaps because the economy is still slow and people are not taking longer trips. Carolee Wolfkamp, an agent with Lackey Realty in Ship Bottom, agreed, noting that the recent trend to cleaner water and beaches had drawn more renters to the shore.
 
PUMPING: BIGGER BEACHES
The Army Corps of Engineers' $1.7 billion beach-restoration project has been criticized by environmentalists, who say nature will only wash away the sand the corps pumps there. But it is welcome in towns like Monmouth Beach (two miles of beach) and Sea Bright (3.4 miles), where the first phase of restoration was completed late last year and held up well during the winter storms.
Bids for the next section of work on the beach, in Long Branch, are to be submitted this summer, with work to begin in August or September. Next on the schedule are Deal and Asbury Park. Other potential beach restoration projects in Ocean County are being studied, but financing depends on whether Congress restores money that President Clinton did not include in his 1997 budget.
 
SELLING: USE YOUR NOODLE
These days, Linda Costa, owner of the House of Naomi on Ocean Avenue in Belmar, is busy unpacking beach chairs for sale. During the winter, Ms. Costa, who is about to begin her 17th year as a beachfront merchant, mainly sells lottery tickets and newspapers to a small contingent of year-round residents. But from Memorial Day to Labor Day, her small store opens at 8 every morning and stays open as late as 2 A.M. on weekends, selling everything from shorts to swimsuits to sunglasses to suntan oil.
This year's hot new item, she hopes, is the Noodle, a long, colorful plastic-foam cylinder that can be wrapped around the waist to keep the swimmer afloat ($3.95).
Grueling as the hours can be, Ms. Costa still looks forward to the summer season. "I look at it as the best of both worlds," she said. "I have my quiet time and then I have a few months of lots of people having fun."

Thanking a College a Million

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
For a fee of $35 per semester, Donald Kramer earned a diploma from Brooklyn College. The year was 1958, and a degree in economics was his ticket from Bensonhurst to the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Gone are the days when students like Mr. Kramer, now the chief executive of a Bermuda-based insurance company, or the lawyer Alan Dershowitz or the writer Gloria Naylor enjoyed a virtually free education at Brooklyn College. Today, squeezed by state budget cuts, the 15,000 students at the college, part of the City University system, pay tuition of more than $1,600 a semester, compared with $1,225 last year. Faculty and staff levels have fallen by more than a third over the last 10 years, and enrollment is dropping. 
 So it was no surprise that Mr. Kramer's contribution to his alma mater was greeted with much pomp at a glittering celebration at the Plaza hotel last week. His $1 million gift to the Brooklyn College Foundation -- while a drop in the bucket compared with, say, Harvard University's $8 billion endowment -- is the largest individual gift that Brooklyn College, with an endowment of about $15 million, has ever received.
Public colleges in the city have always sought private contributions to attract coveted professors, for instance, or endow scholarship funds. But with the fiscal pinch over the last several years, Brooklyn College has had to turn to private dollars to support basic instruction, said Vernon Lattin, the college's president. "I think we got into fund raising late, as many public institutions have," he said. "We are just now, I hope, turning the corner."
Brooklyn College is not alone. "Public institutions all over the country, for a variety of reasons, are going after private money with increasing intensity year by year," said Eric Wentworth, a spokesman for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, a national group that monitors trends in higher education.
But among the problems that smaller colleges encounter in fund raising, Mr. Wentworth said, is that lists of alumni, often a valuable donor pool, are not as well maintained as they are at larger universities. That problem was intensified at Brooklyn College when Senator Joseph McCarthy targeted it in the 1950's as a haven for radicals, leading administrators to destroy alumni lists to protect their graduates, said Mr. Kramer, who is a trustee of the college.
Mr. Kramer, 58, sees his gift as a payback of sorts: "I owe just about everything that I am now to the fact that I went to Brooklyn College. The public school system that I grew up in worked. We really got a great education and I hate to see it thrown away or compromised or reduced by neglect on the part of our legislators." SOMINI SENGUPTA

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
The Spice Route's New York Extension

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
IN 1964, G.L. Soni was an engineering graduate student, newly arrived in Fargo, N.D., from southern India's Kerala state and shocked to find two feet of snow on the ground and no tandoori anywhere on the horizon. It would be years before the Beatles embraced Ravi Shankar, and mainstream America was clueless when it came to Indian cuisine. "Nobody even knew about yogurt," Mr. Soni recalls.
And like most Indian men, he was clueless himself. Meals had always just appeared before him, cooked unseen by female or servant hands. "I never knew a coriander from a cumin seed," he says. "I didn't know a spice from a lentil." 
 Somehow, he and a couple of fellow expatriates mastered ingredients sold in Fargo stores, like yellow split peas, well enough to survive till graduation. A civil engineering job brought Mr. Soni to New York, but it was his continuing hunger for the taste of home that drove him to create House of Spices, one of the city's first stores devoted to Indian food products, with his wife and brother in 1970.
Demographic and cultural revolutions have propelled the store into success, so much so that it was hailed in a recent New York University study as a prime example of how immigrant businesses can help revive the city's manufacturing sector. But the same growth has also encouraged competition, and Mr. Soni says he is fighting to keep his position at the top of a virtual pinnacle of seasonings and comestibles.
"This market is going to go through a tremendous change in the next two to three years," Mr. Soni said. "Some people are going to have to quit. We are going to have to cut some of these things that we do."
What they do is plenty. The business rode the early waves of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigration, burgeoning from a single store into an empire of importing, exporting, manufacturing, retail shops, restaurants, warehouses and a distribution network that stretches from New York to Los Angeles.
From fresh mangoes to dried fenugreek, powdered coriander to packaged tamarind, the company either has it or can get it. (Its unofficial motto is "If we don't have a product, you don't need it.") The latest marketing target is the non-immigrant American consumer.
Mr. Soni refused to divulge precise figures for the privately-held company, where he is president, his wife, Sobhana, is secretary, and his brother Kumar is vice president, but allowed that its operations exceed $10 million a year. The Soni family lives in Douglaston, the Park Avenue of Queens, and the 55-year-old Mr. Soni drives a Jaguar, although he says he otherwise has simple habits -- like lounging in front of the Discovery Channel to relax.
Headquarters for the Sonis' company is a sprawling warehouse at 127-40 Willets Point Boulevard in the Flushing section, perched at the edge of a strange land of automobile parts and repair places, a kind of casbah junkyard covered with shattered glass where the dealers and their signs bespeak the borough polyglot -- Spanish, Dari, Tagalog, Korean -- in the shadow of Shea Stadium.
Inside the House of Spices, however, all is cool and orderly. There are pallets piled high with cartons of chickpea flour bound for Houston, and 68-pound boxes of American butter, soon to be transmuted into ghee. There are sacks of the bestselling basmati rice, 817 Elephant, which, like wine, must be properly aged, Mr. Soni insists, and blue barrels of pickled vegetables, awaiting the final secret touches that induce brand loyalty. A thick aroma of spices canopies the air, and imports from India, like the muslin-wrapped, bell-shaped cakes of brown sugar known as jaggery, add to the exotic feel of the place.
Workers clean, mill and package everything from white flour to black lentils. There is a factory where Indian women, their hair tucked inside shower-style caps, churn out Joy brand ice cream in flavors like saffron, rose, banana and fig, and a frying division that turns out snack foods. Last year, the company added a candy kitchen, where more women mix and mold delicacies from condensed milk, cashews and edible sheets of silver.
It's hardly the same field the Sonis entered. "The whole scene has changed completely since 1970," says Madhulika Kandelwal, a historian at Queens College's Asian American Center. With more than 100,000 officially recorded Indians in the city, compared with a few thousand then, many people are electing to go into the food business to supply a distinct ethnic market with a very intense demand.
One major rival is Patel Brothers, another mammoth that started in Chicago in 1974 and landed in New York 10 years later. "We have the lowest prices always," said Harshad Patel, one of the owners. "Their quality is good, and they are expensive."
The American overlay on Indian culture has also shaped the market. Mr. Soni's experience -- perhaps horror -- in discovering just how complicated and labor-intensive Indian cooking can be has created something he says would not sell in the subcontinent: packaged and prepared food, aimed at the busy two-career couples who prevail here.
Take the three-pound plastic jug of Laxmi brand fried onions. "If you don't want to stand there at the stove and brown onions for fifteen minutes, you can use this," Mr. Soni said, adding that browned onions are the base for many curries. "In India, no one uses this. The ladies are home, or if you are wealthy, you have servants. Here most of the women are working. Everyone is too busy making the mortgage payments, the car payments. So that is why we made the prepared foods. You open up a bottle, and everything is prepared."
Mrs. Soni, an accountant's daughter who grew up in Mombasa, Kenya, long a spice portal, remembers women thanking her for such products. With three children to raise and the business to run, she came to rely on them, too.
The prepared foods range from spicy carrots to sweet chutneys and saltytandoori paste. There are ready-made papadom wafers and flat disks of nan bread. The latest twist is Indian meals for the freezer section: microwaveable dishes like palak paneer (cheese cubes in spinach sauce) and beef vindaloo.
Many of the company's foods appear under the Laxmi label, named for the Hindu goddess of wealth. They also market under the names House of Spices, Joy and Shamiana. For a while, the company profited from Chinese, Iranian and other cross-cultural demands for products like rice, star anise and cinnamon.
Now it has another set of consumers in mind. For at the same time the Indian population has grown, so has American interest in Indian food. "The growth is in the main American market, and that is where we are poised," Mr. Soni said. "We are in supermarkets now, like Key Food, A & P, Pathmark, Shoprite and Western Beef."
He still seems a little surprised by all this, considering those early days in Fargo. "We wanted to get a degree, make some money and go back home," Mr. Soni says. "We didn't come here to do business."

Chart: "Shelf Life: BEST SELLERS"
Here are the five top sellers in the House of Spices realm. All prices are retail.

1. Laxmi brand chapathi flour, $7.29 for a 22-pound bag. "It is the exact duplicate of the kind of wheat flour Indians are used to back home," Mr. Soni says. "It is white flour, unbleached, made from durum wheat grown in Canada."
 
2. Laxmi brand premium-grade gram flour, made from chickpeas, $3.29 for a 4 1/2-pound bag. "It is used by every Indian, north, south, east, west," Mr. Soni says. "Everybody uses gram flour for sweets and fritters and other things."
 
3. 817 Elephant brand aged basmati rice, imported from India, $36 for a 44-pound sack. "Lots of cultures like it, and it is the top basmati rice in stores now," Mr. Soni says. Only became available in 1989, when India lifted a longtime ban on rice exports.
 
4. Laxmi brand chunda mango chutney, $4.49 for a two-pound jar. "It is freshly made in America," in the warehouse in Queens, Mr. Soni says.
 
5. Laxmi brand jasmine rice, imported from Thailand, $9 for a 25-pound sack. "We have a lot of Bangladeshi and South Indian population here, and they are all rice eaters," Mr. Soni says. "In Kerala, we had a different kind, but this comes very close to it."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
As Moonlighting Spreads, It Loses Its Blue-Collar Hue

BYLINE: By EVA POMICE 

 BODY:
FOR Liliana Pumpido, no time is free time. From 8:30 A.M. to 2:45 P.M., Ms. Pumpido, a licensed social worker, is at her job with the West New York, N.J., public schools. In the late afternoons and evenings, she counsels private clients in her Weehawken home.
On weekends, she performs as a singer with a karaoke machine at weddings and birthday parties. And she occasionally travels to New York to record jingles for commercials. All told, she expects to earn more than $45,000 this year from her three jobs. 
 "I started karaoke singing after I was separated from my husband," she said. "But I would do it even if I didn't need the money. It takes a lot of stress out of my life. It's like primal scream therapy."
Moonlighters like Ms. Pumpido are becoming more numerous as companies restructure and the job market becomes more fragmented. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, some eight million Americans, or about 6.4 percent of the employed, reported that they worked a second job in 1995, up from 4.7 percent, or 3.9 million people, in 1975.
"Unlike employees laid off in the shutdown of smokestack America in the 1980's, many of today's workers are not waiting for people to give them a new job," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. "White-collar and pink-collar workers are making their own jobs. They hustle two or three different situations together to approximate the kind of money they used to bring home."
The trend is particularly pronounced for women. They accounted for 46.9 percent of the multiple job-holders in 1995, up from 24.4 percent in 1975 and 38.3 percent in 1985.
John Stinson, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says that as more women enter the labor force, "they've taken on the characteristics of men in terms of job-holding."
One difference among the moonlighters: Women who are trying to balance family and work life are much more likely to work multiple part-time jobs, as opposed to men, who often work one full-time and one part-time job.
Decades ago, moonlighting was most common among blue-collar workers. But the data show that the rates are now high among people with primary jobs in public administration and the service industry.
In terms of specific occupations, "doctors, nurses, protective workers like firemen and policemen and teachers all have a higher-than-average rate of moonlighting," Mr. Stinson says. "A lot of policemen work after hours as security guards, and teachers hold second jobs as coaches or camp counselors. It may just be the structure of the work."
College teachers have the highest moonlighting rate, at 13.7 percent.
While some people moonlight to expand their skills or to balance a well-paying but boring job with another that is more creative, many people do it for the money. When surveyed in 1991, the last year the question was asked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 16.3 percent of moonlighters reported doing it because they enjoyed the work. But 37.1 percent of the men who moonlight, 44.2 percent of the women and 63 percent of the divorced, widowed or separated women said they worked multiple jobs to meet regular household expenses and to pay off debt.
"The textbook reason people take second jobs is because they can't work as many hours as they would like to in their main job," says Christina Paxson, an associate professor in economics and public affairs at Princeton University.
Ms. Paxson found that people with multiple jobs tended to take on low-level, easy-to-find work in the service sector, outside their main field. And with the second jobs, their total hours increased dramatically, by 300 hours a year on average.
While the need to moonlight has increased, so have the opportunities.
"Much of the data on moonlighting is interpreted negatively, but you have to look at it positively," says Audrey Freedman, an economist in New York. "People will work for money, and the work is available. We have longer store hours, more personal service work. People can keep their skills up in all kinds of ways that fit their life styles, not just in 9-to-5 steady jobs, five days a week."
Alan Irgang of Chicago works three jobs in an effort to match the $70,000 he earned as head of human resource systems for a hospital before he decided to change careers. He now works 24 hours a week as a therapist for Columbus Hospital in Chicago, an additional 10 hours at a community group practice and 15 hours as a self-employed computer consultant.
"While money is a big part of it, the biggest advantage for me is the variety," he said. "Therapy is very gray; there are no easy solutions. Computers are very logical. I like operating on both sides of the fence."

THE ECONOMY
Heads You Win, Heads You Lose
 
In an election year, of course, economic news has one overriding role: helping or hurting one candidate or the other. The millions of lives touched by the economy are distant, secondary -- a trifle. But how does this horse-race mentality work in Wall Street's upside-down world, where good news is, by definition, bad because it stirs up demon inflation? Take last week. Great news! The economy, after grumbling to a halt late last year, roared back in the first quarter, growing at a 2.8 percent annual rate. That surely helps the "It's the economy, stupid" President, right? But wait. That "good" news sent stocks reeling -- the Dow industrials plunged 77 points. If this bubbling market collapses, you'd have to call that "bad" news -- and it would have to help Bob Dole. You want logic? Play chess.
 
SUBSIDIZED LIVES
Rugged Capitalists
 
Montana's Freemen, those ultimate rugged individualists, would never accept weaselly capitalist handouts like farm subsidies, would they? Actually, yes -- by the bushel. After drought, hail and fickle prices conspired against the debt-laden rancher Ralph Clark, the Agriculture Department opened its wallet to make it all better. Over a decade, a new study shows, Mr. Clark and his partners got $676,082 in checks from a Government he labels a "corporate prostitute." Even in Garfield County (pop.: 1,300), which received $63 million in subsidies from 1985 to 1994, that raises eyebrows. It seems that Mr. Clark -- described by his brother-in-law as a "natural con man" -- turned his farm into a complex subsidy machine, even arranging for some payments to be made to a trust he had set up to avoid taxes.
 
WHAT'S UP?
 
Cheap Gas? Sound the Alarm!
In 1980, gasoline cost (in 1995 dollars) $2.20 a gallon; last week it cost a little over half that. Clearly, such a crisis demands the full attention of our best and brightest politicians. Because, you see, those voters who in the late 70's were proudly scrapping their gas-guzzlers have in the 90's discovered rugged sport-utility bliss -- and, having bought these New Age guzzlers, have to keep feeding them. So last week, fearing a horde of off-roaders voting with their gas tanks, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton fell all over each other to try to ease their pain. First Mr. Clinton said he'd sell 12 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserve, and Republicans, calling the sale "shameless pandering," quickly vowed relief from a Clinton gas tax. One can only imagine the histrionics if, say, gas cost what it did in 1980.
 
UNABOMBER QUICKIES
 
Fastest Book in the West
Imagine Flaubert writing a book on the Unabomber suspect. He scratches about for agonizing hours for "le mot juste," even as his editors clamor for 50 pages a day. A sorry sight. Now, in one corner of today's publishing world, words aren't pondered, they're processed, like so many widgets or chicken wings. Theodore Kaczynski had barely been led away from his Montana shack when "quickie" publishers were distributing book covers, the words to be crammed in later. The fastest crammer? Warner Books, which last week shipped the first copies of "Mad Genius." It edged out Pocket Books, which has been churning out quickies ever since publishing a book on Franklin D. Roosevelt six days after he died. To be fair, the co-author of Pocket's Unabomber quickie was an ex-F.B.I. agent, so the book got mired in a bureaucratic review. Farewell, haste.
 
NEWSPAPERS
Read All About It!
 
Yes, the nation keeps putting down its newspapers to get its information elsewhere -- on line, over the air, surgically implanted in the brain, wherever. And it doesn't help that the population is aging and newspaper prices are up. But the glass is half full, too: last week came word that circulation at the top dailies is falling a bit more slowly, and there were even gains at The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The Daily News. Maybe, just maybe, Americans haven't forgotten how to read after all.
 
TOBACCO WARS
Smoke-Free Billboards
 
Free speech. It has a pure, simple ring to it, but it's really a minefield. Bob Grant got a new radio job, and his fans rejoiced at freedom regained -- but the point was never his freedom to speak, it was his employer's freedom not to pay him to do it. And tobacco companies insist it's free speech to advertise on billboards -- even though smoking foes say such ads lure children to light up. But last week 3M Media, the nation's No. 3 billboard company, exercised a freedom of its own -- it said it would stop advertising tobacco products. To be sure, 3M, with over 1,000 billboards in 36 states, acted under pressure from a religious group. But President Clinton applauded the move, saying children were "barraged by messages that glamour and grit can be found in a pack of cigarettes." R.J. Reynolds, saying it was disappointed, raised the free-speech banner, while Philip Morris voiced a familiar industry refrain: that cigarette ads are aimed at "helping adults to make choices."
 
LAWSUITS
Do Gun Makers Kill?
 
Guns don't kill people, people do -- that's the gun lobby's mantra. But is there a third possible culprit -- gun makers? They've been sued successfully for selling defective weapons or selling to illegal buyers. But now a Federal judge has ruled that, for the first time, gun makers can be sued purely for their marketing. A lawyer for the families of two shooting victims said she wanted to prove the industry was "aware of a booming illegal market for guns but did not take adequate steps to prevent illegal sales" -- an assertion the gun makers deny.
 
HEALTH CARE
A.A.R.P., Super-Agent
 
One might logically assume that the American Association of Retired Persons is a selfless advocate for the elderly. But in a very real sense it is also a giant insurance broker. In 1994, it received $146 million in royalties and other fees for endorsing certain auto and homeowner policies -- fully 38 percent of its budget. But what of health care? H.M.O.'s, after all, at times limit or even refuse care -- not something a champion of the elderly would want to condone. But now the A.A.R.P. -- no doubt realizing that if it can't fight the prevailing winds in health care, it had better go along -- will license its weighty name to some managed-care plans. It would, it vowed, constantly monitor the H.M.O.'s it picks -- and it will certainly be in its interest to do so, for it's putting its mighty national brand name on the line. This is "high-risk stuff," said one health researcher.
 
WORKPLACE GRIPES
Stale M&M's? An Outrage!
 
Downsizing. Takeovers. Gloom. Do such thoughts really preoccupy America's workers? Perhaps, but they've also got some far-humbler concerns, says Bloomberg Business News, which last week offered its first "Sound Off" poll. A sampling: do workers pine for the simple pleasure of opening a window? Yes, 21 percent do. Also, 26 percent complain of dirty offices, 43 percent rebel at the idea of giving up frequent-flier miles, 40 percent chafe at having to be politically correct, but just 6 percent mind offices being smoke-free. But to get to a truly pressing matter: 13 percent have had it with stale M&M's in vending machines.

HEADLINE: Tobacco on Trial;
Making a Case for Death

BYLINE: LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
SO far, it's Taxpayers v. Merchants of Death. Eight states have sued tobacco companies, and more are getting in line, with a new legal theory: since the states incur Medicaid expenses for smoking-related illness, they should be reimbursed by the industry that causes it.
There's a snag, though. The states are probably not losing all the money they are asking for. The inconvenient truth, at least as many economists see it, is that smokers cover their own medical costs, not only by paying cigarette taxes -- now more than 50 cents a pack -- but also by dying before collecting their full share of health and retirement benefits. 
 The tobacco companies aren't sure how to cast what is often called "the death benefit argument," or if they should even raise it. And it may be rejected by judges. But the litigation raises questions for a society obsessed with toting up misery in dollars: How do we calculate what smokers cost everybody else? Should we acknowledge that sometimes death is helpful to the public treasury? And if that's so, where might such an argument end?
"Killing yourself by smoking incurs costs, which for yourself are horrendous and miserable, and for everyone else include higher insurance costs," said Peter W. Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, who has written on product liability. "But there are offsets. It's quite possible that smokers are doing us all a small favor. It's a ghoulish argument -- it's horrible -- but if you're going to have an economic case, you've got to use economics. You can't use sentiment."
Last week Maryland became the latest state to file suit, following Mississippi, Florida, Minnesota, West Virginia, Massachusetts, Texas and Louisiana; more states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, are preparing suits. The states are suing not on behalf of smokers who became ill -- a claim that has been a loser in court -- but for their own expenses. So they must establish that losses have occurred, and then, if they win, establish the amounts due them.
The tobacco companies want an accounting of offsets, which means estimating what the states would have spent treating smokers, had they lived longer.
 
 
 
Economists at Work
 Economists have already done a larger accounting, testing assertions that smoking imposes a big economic burden on society. Their answer, usually, is that it doesn't. A widely cited study conducted for the Rand Corporation by Willard Manning, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, found that smokers had more medical expenses than nonsmokers and died about four years earlier; after they paid cigarette taxes, society came out ahead -- in dollars, anyway.
In a 1994 study based in part on the Manning data, W. Kip Viscusi, a Duke University economist, found that smokers subsidize nonsmokers even without taxes. He put the medical costs attributable to smoking at 55 cents a pack sold, and added much smaller amounts for sick leave, higher insurance premiums and damage from fires caused by cigarettes. Smokers' early deaths cost the public another 40 cents a pack in forgone taxes on earnings. Later, Mr. Viscusi figured health and insurance costs attributable to secondhand smoke, cautioning that his estimate of 25 cents a pack was drawn from highly uncertain data. At the same time, smokers saved taxpayers nursing-home care (23 cents a pack) and pension and Social Security costs ($1.19). The net gain to society: 5 cents for every pack sold. Smokers also contributed 53 cents a pack in excise taxes, 29 cents of that going to the states.
The big savings come from retirement benefits, especially since smoking-related disease usually kicks in as one's working years end. Mr. Viscusi calculates total yearly pension savings nearing $30 billion -- most of which is realized not by the states but by private pension plans and the Social Security system. (Since about 30 percent of Medicare dollars go to nursing home care, the states save money there.) And if no one smoked? "Social Security would go bankrupt," he said. "We'd all have to work to age 80."
The Manning and Viscusi studies have their critics, including the plaintiffs. They prefer the estimates of smoking-related medical costs issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are several times higher than the Manning-Viscusi estimates. Still other research has found that smokers have lower lifetime medical costs than nonsmokers.
The whole discussion disturbs many people. Jeffrey Harris, an economist at M.I.T. who believes most economists underestimate smokers' medical costs, said the real danger is to suggest that government weigh the savings from early deaths in making public policy decisions. Dr. Harris, who is also a physician, said an analysis like Mr. Viscusi's "is not including a key benefit to our society: We value life."
The plaintiffs lawyers working for the states say tobacco companies are exactly the last people who should share in any death benefit. P. Tim Howard, retained by Florida's Attorney General, said: "I don't know that a court is going to say, 'Wow, you need an offset because you killed people.' "
To economists, though, the states' claims of losses fail to make sense without offsets. As Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman, economists at the Congressional Research Service, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article: "The alternative to death from a smoking-related illness is not immortality and perfect health -- it is later death, and perhaps from a more costly illness."
 
 
 
Addicted to Taxes
 So far, the defendants are not pushing the argument. "We didn't create this analysis, and we didn't go to court to assert it," said Murray R. Garnick, a Washington lawyer representing Philip Morris in several states, including Mississippi, where the issue has come up in court. There, Mr. Garnick explained, the state had asked the court to prohibit requests by the tobacco companies for documents relating to the state's net Medicaid expenditures for smokers.
The states also want to exclude income from excise taxes, which Mr. Huber of the Manhattan Institute says points up "the biggest paradox of all."
"If the state thought it was being injured by tobacco, it could have banned tobacco," he said. "The state can prohibit four-wheel vehicles, hang-gliding, all sorts of things." But, he continued, "you might say the state is addicted to tobacco revenues."
Legal scholars are loath to see the courts used as arbiters in such tortured political and economic debates. "To leave it to the fantastically uncertain and chaotic process of litigation is a very, very bad way to make public policy," said Jeffrey O'Connell, a law professor at the University of Virginia.
But lawsuits make sense as a means of forcing a better solution, says Mr. O'Connell, who favors workers compensation-like legislation protecting the tobacco companies from liability suits in return for payments into a fund for victims. "So maybe we can use the threat of litigation to accomplish something like this," he said, "instead of having these voraciously competitive people pummel each other, and us in the process."

HEADLINE: The Public Housing That Succeeds

BYLINE: By Nicholas Lemann; Nicholas Lemann is the national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly.

DATELINE: PELHAM, N.Y.

 BODY:
One of the endearing things about Senator Bob Dole is that he is so quintessentially the consensus-oriented legislator that his forays into the realm of wedge issues always have a tinny, false feeling, as if he isn't emotionally connected to the words coming out of his own mouth. His statement last week that American public housing "is one of the last bastions of socialism in the world" is a good example. It's hard to believe that Mr. Dole was candidly revealing his most deeply held views.
Still, the idea that public housing has failed and should be abolished is something many Americans believe. High-rise public housing projects such as the notoriously dangerous and bleak Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago are the leading visual symbol of the idea that liberal Government programs, especially antipoverty programs, don't work and may actually cause poverty to increase. 
 If public housing were in fact a bankrupt and doomed idea, it would be a very sad end to the oldest and most visible strategy in the struggle against poverty. Jacob Riis's "How the Other Half Lives," published in 1890 and arguably the first American book to propose a plan for improving conditions in urban slums, ended with a call for the construction of "model tenements." If Mr. Dole is right, the whole antipoverty cause would be powerfully undermined.
The truth, however, is that housing for the poor stands out among antipoverty strategies as the area where the most progress has been made over the past generation and where there is the most cause for optimism. Senator Dole's comments were so completely wrong that they could help bring a halt to genuine progress rather than pull the plug on something unworkable.
Before the World War II, public housing in America was considered a great success. It "worked" in the sense of being clean, safe and, for most residents, a huge improvement over the slums where they had been living. There were long waiting lists for apartments.
One reason for the projects' good reputation was that their constituency was not the very poor but people with jobs one notch higher on the economic ladder. (Probably the most famous product of the public housing of that era is Elvis Presley.) Most projects wouldn't admit single parents, and many wouldn't admit welfare recipients. Virtually all maintained strict rules about keeping apartments and hallways neat and about who was allowed to be where when. Those who broke the rules or committed crimes were swiftly kicked out.
Then in the late 1940's, the nation embarked on the course that led to the perception that public housing doesn't work: the construction of enormous high-rise projects. It wasn't just the architecture, or the mere presence of Government subsidies, that caused these places to go so horribly awry. There was also a big change in the tenant population, from carefully screened working people to the very poor. Because of changes in Federal rules, people who got jobs actually had to leave the building, and it became nearly impossible to kick out tenants who were criminals.
Even so, it's not all public housing that doesn't work. It's just the large-scale, all-poor, severely isolated projects that invariably fail. Just a few blocks from the Robert Taylor Homes are pleasant high-rise projects for senior citizens.
"Imagine, the United States Government owns the housing where an entire class of citizens permanently lives," Mr. Dole said, as if this were fantastically improbable. Yet in most industrial countries a much larger portion of the population lives in Government housing. Three percent of Americans live in public housing, as opposed to more than a fifth of the population in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands. What's unusual about American public housing is that it serves primarily the very poor.
It is paradoxical that Mr. Dole chose to stage his attack on public housing at a realtors' convention, because the real estate industry, by and large, supported the construction of the worst projects. In the 1950's and 60's, African-American migrants from the South were streaming into the big cities, and part of reason for the building of the projects was to contain them within the existing ghettos so as to avoid residential integration.
In any case, the mistake of the high-rise, all-poor projects was fairly quickly realized; in 1968, Congress banned the construction of any more of them. These projects have no defenders except for unaccountably loyal groups of residents. To set high-rise projects up as being the fruits of a real political position, as some critics of public housing have, is to create a straw man.
Under Secretary Henry Cisneros, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has begun demolishing about 30,000 of the worst high-rises. The agency is also trying to reinstate policies of giving preferences to people with jobs and swiftly kicking out criminals.
In his speech to the realtors, Senator Dole called for replacing public housing with a voucher system. But we already have a voucher system, called Section 8, which is perpetually underfinanced (partly because the real estate industry is so effective in lobbying against its expansion) and thus has very long waiting lists. Mr. Dole has repeatedly voted against increasing financing for the program, and he failed to support Mr. Cisneros's proposal last year for a major new housing voucher program.
There is an alternative to old-style public housing. In the decades since we stopped building new projects, hundreds of thousands of units for the poor have been created by local community development corporations, private groups that have sprung up around the country since the 70's. On the whole, this is housing that works. Those who haven't visited the South Bronx lately would be amazed to see how vastly areas thought of as desolate have been improved by the new and renovated housing that community groups have put up.
These groups do exactly what Mr. Cisneros is trying to do in public housing: Screen tenants, create a mix of working and very poor people, oust criminals, maintain security forces big enough for residents to feel safe and keep the overall scale of developments manageably small. It's not an exotic, recondite, high-risk formula.
 Often people point to the success of the community development corporations as proving that the private sector can succeed where the Government has failed. The implication is that any involvement by the Government is fatally corrupting. But the community groups are heavily financed by the Government. More than three-quarters receive Federal dollars (Washington gives them more than $300 million each year) and more than half receive state money. The experiments in tenant management pushed strongly by Jack Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George Bush, were also federally financed.
It should be kept in mind, too, that the disastrous large-scale urban public housing projects were constructed and operated not by Washington but by local housing authorities. In recent years, HUD has begun taking over the management of projects from the most incompetent of the local authorities.
The view that Federal is always bad and state and local are always good just doesn't apply in public housing. The Federal Government pays for virtually all public housing and contracts with local organizations to run it. The key variables are whether the project's rules are sound and whether the local group in charge is competent.
The conditions in the worst public housing projects are horrifyingly bad and constitute a real moral crisis. It is outrageous that week after week children continue to lose their lives to the violence of the projects and we don't do anything about it. It doesn't do public housing residents who live in fear and misery any good to be told that what they're going through is attributable to "socialism" and therefore can't be helped.

HEADLINE: Don't Limit Welfare Without Job Investment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As co-conveners of a coalition of African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish leaders, we applaud Bob Herbert's objections to proposals in the New York State Legislature to set time limits on welfare benefits (column, April 26).
Time limits are intended as a way to move people off welfare and into the work force. But where are the jobs? Since 1990 New York City has lost more than 300,000 jobs. Moreover, the Labor Department says 75 percent of the city's major employers require skills for entry-level positions beyond those afforded by a high school education. Compounding these difficulties is the unavailability of affordable, high-quality child care. 
 The Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki should take the steps needed to help individuals and families move into the mainstream of economic life by investing in programs and supports that make self-sufficiency possible.

HEADLINE: Cities Enlisting Private Companies for Sewage Treatment

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
Garbage pickup was one of the first to go, along with paper recycling, jail operations and, in a few cases, firefighting. Now, in the latest nationwide move toward privatizing public services, scores of municipalities are starting to turn over waste-water-treatment plants to private contractors.
Wilmington, Delaware's largest city, is about to sign a 20-year lease with Wheelabrator Technologies. And a string of cities -- Jersey City; Hoboken, N.J.; Toledo, Ohio; Freeport, Tex., and others -- have indicated an interest in turning over some or all of their water operations to private companies. 
 In Wilmington, as in other towns and cities that are opting out of the waste-water-treatment business, the potential benefits are economic: faced with pinched budgets and increasingly stiff environmental regulations governing water quality, local policy makers are looking to the private sector for operating expertise and capital to invest in aging treatment plants.
But the course is politically risky, fraught with the loss of jobs and employee benefits -- which is why most towns and cities are leasing rather than selling their operations and are trying to insure that job reduction comes through attrition rather than dismissal.
Acknowledging the potential problems, Mayor James H. Sills Jr. of Wilmington said, "It is clear that costs will go down, and that is a story that most people can understand and accept."
Indeed, although privatization will mean the loss of 12 jobs through attrition, there has been little public comment on the shift, which has been under discussion for 18 months, Mr. Sills said. "The public does not have the same emotional attraction to waste-water plants that it does to garbage pickup, public works and safety," he said.
Water and sewer services, according to the United States Conference of Mayors, are the single largest expenditure local governments face, totaling $43.5 billion a year nationally.
And the costs are likely to increase as treatment plants built or improved 20 or more years ago with $53 billion in Federal grants are rendered obsolete in the face of more stringent water pollution rules.
The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that at least $100 billion will be needed to meet the new standards in the next decade, but Congress has greatly scaled back the grants available. Some $1.35 billion will be available to the states in 1997, not nearly enough to complete improvements to the 6,000 waste-water-treatment plants around the nation.
And the plants must be revamped, E.P.A. officials said. "E.P.A. has been supportive of privatization," said Michael J. Quigley, director of the municipal support division of the agency's water office, "but we enforce the regulations regardless of whether the plants are publicly owned or privately managed."
Mayor Patrick J. McManus of Lynn, Mass., a spokesman for a mayoral group on the privatization issue, noted: "Clean water and clean harbors are mandated; they must be done. The question is how to pay for it. In Lynn, we have service contracts to operate our water and sewage plants now, and we are looking into the advantages of a long-term lease."
As they consider turning waste-water treatment over to the private sector, many cities are looking at the handling of solid waste as a model. During the 1980's, many cities and towns hired companies to build waste-to-energy plants to burn municipal garbage as old-fashioned dumps that did not meet environmental standards were closed. Waste-to-energy plants, most of them privately owned, now generate $20 billion in business each year.
Although a handful of city water plants have been operated by contractors for years, the current surge of interest in privatization was helped along by the success of Indianapolis, which in 1994 turned over its two waste-water plants to a private group led by the big French utility Lyonnaise des Eaux. In the first year of operation, the company slashed a proposed budget of $30.1 million to $17.6 million, with further savings forecast for later years. Over the five-year term of the contract, the city expects to save $65 million.
Private contractors reduce expenses through typical corporate strategies: shrinking the work force, subcontracting nonessential services like plant security, and cutting inventories. The Indianapolis contractor reduced the work force to 176 from 328, through retirements and job placement, while improving the plants' compliance with environmental regulations, a report issued by the city last year said.
The small city of Franklin, Ohio, located between Dayton and Cincinnati, went even further last year, selling its waste-water-treatment plant to Wheelabrator Technologies for $6.8 million. Franklin, with a population of 12,500, is using the money to expand its drinking-water plant to meet the needs of new industries and housing developments.
"There are four major benefits of privatization," said John T. Dowd, a senior vice president of Wheelabrator, a subsidiary of the nation's largest trash hauler, Waste Management. "It is an opportunity to turn a fixed asset into cash. There can be significant savings on an operating basis, and it often solves an environmental problem, like odors. The fourth is that it can encourage economic development. Companies like knowing that their rates will be fixed for 20 years."
But the path to privatization is not always smooth. In March, a judge blocked Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani's plan to raise $2.3 billion by selling the New York City water and sewer system to the Water Board, a quasi-independent agency controlled by the state. City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, an opponent of the plan, used his powers last year to block the sale of the bonds that would have financed the project.
Wilmington, a city of about 71,500 people, had originally planned to sell its plant to Wheelabrator for $41.9 million, but the deal went awry because of a clash between the city and the adjacent, and larger, New Castle County. That conflict may point to leasing as a more popular privatization option, particularly where more than one political jurisdiction is involved.
The city built the treatment plant within its borders, but city residents account for only about 30 percent of its use.
When it appeared that Wilmington would get a windfall of more than $17.3 million after paying off obligations, county officials objected. They said they feared that the city's bonanza would come at the expense of county residents, who pay the bulk of the sewerage fees.
So the city backed away from an outright sale in favor of a 20-year lease requiring Wheelabrator to invest in the plant to meet new environmental standards and to limit rate increases using a formula based on the Consumer Price Index and an electric-rate index. City and county officials are negotiating an agreement allowing the county to continue using the plant.
Mr. Sills, the Mayor of Wilmington, said the lease would cut the plant's operating costs to $16 million a year from $19 million, while the city would retain the power to set rates. Officials of Wheelabrator, which already operates the plant's sludge-disposal section, said they had identified ways to operate more efficiently, including reducing the number of workers to 43 from 55 through attrition.
Still, many plant workers remain concerned about how their lives will be affected when control passes from the city to the company. "We worry about how our people are going to be treated by a company that is driven by profits," said Perry Davis, a local official of the union that represents the workers.
But Tom Liddle, who already works for Wheelabrator in the sludge-disposal section, said he saw increased opportunity. "I do maintenance in this building right now," Mr. Liddle said, "but if we get the rest, I expect to be in charge of maintenance for the whole plant."

HEADLINE: New School Seeks Students Who Are Music to Its Ears

BYLINE: By MARY B.W. TABOR 

 BODY:
In a stark rehearsal studio just steps from Lincoln Center, four adults with clipboards and evaluation forms tested a clump of 5-year-olds, asking them to march, sing and slap their knees. Occasionally, one evaluator stood hawklike over the group, her head tilted to hear a child's barely audible voice.
Outside the room, parents sat holding shoes and toys and anxiously awaiting the verdicts. Those children who did well would be invited back for further testing, and ultimately perhaps be admitted to the Special Music School of America, a new public school, an only-in-New York kind of place in a city known for its "Fame" school, millionaire child actors and musical prodigies. 
 The idea came in part from the vision of the pianist Vladimir Feltsman, who was trained in Soviet-style institutions that identified and harnessed gifted children from tender ages. The new school will start in the fall with 30 children split between kindergarten and first grade, and will add one grade each year. It is the first public school in the nation to offer intensive musical training from kindergarten through 12th grade in the course of the school day. Since January, more than 300 children have auditioned.
On this morning, when the testing ended for Kareema Nunes's group and the children spilled out of the studio, her father, Kenneth, smiled and hugged her. "I've been very nervous," he said. "This could be very important for her career."
Nearby, awaiting a later session, were Teresa Gomez, her 5-year-old son and her daughter, who at 4 already studies singing, piano and xylophone. Both were being tested. "I'm trying to make sure they get the best education possible," she said.
Such are the ambitions of parents. Earlier this year, one mother tried to qualify her second grader for the test by saying he was not so smart and could easily repeat first grade. Another sent in a printed resume of her child's schooling and activities.
Mr. Feltsman has criticized the way American children learn music: lessons after school or on weekends, an approach he sees as hindering the gifted and minimizing the importance of music. In Soviet Russia, he says, young children were guided from the start into special schools where academic work was mixed with intense training in one field of study.
"If you don't get the basics of the discipline between the ages of 7 and 12," said Mr. Feltsman, "you might be as gifted as five Horowitzes but you will never make it. The beginning of a musical education, the very first musical steps, are crucial. You have to suck it in the way a baby sucks in a mother's milk." He spoke in a telephone interview from Germany, where he was touring.
Although critics suggest that such intense musical training can stunt children in other fields, the Soviet-style academy dovetailed neatly with the expectations of parents who drill their 3-year-olds for admission interviews at the more selective nursery schools.
But compared with their ardent tactics, Mr. Feltsman's sound relatively benign. "We will not cage our children and make them practice five hours a day until their fingers bleed," he said. "That's total nonsense and it won't do any good anyway." He began at a special music school at age 6.
At the new school, children can expect private lessons on piano, then another instrument, in addition to their regular schoolwork. They will also be given group lessons in singing and music theory, and be required to give recitals regularly.
The inspiration for the school came from a newspaper column that Mr. Feltsman wrote six years ago, criticizing the nation's casual approach to music education. Lydia Kontos, who runs a West Side cultural center, read the article and decided to act. She and Mr. Feltsman engineered a public-private partnership, with city money paying for the academic program and with private gifts, from the Annenberg Foundation and other sources, paying for the music. The cost per student is estimated at $10,000 to $13,000 a year, Ms. Kontos said. So raising money remains a concern. The school is based, along with her cultural center, on West 67th Street at the Abraham Goodman House, home of the Merkin Concert Hall.
So far, 21 children have been accepted, and 19 of them have enrolled. The other morning, with the remaining 11 spots at stake, 37 children and their jittery parents arrived -- parents wrestling to get coats unzipped and tights up, dresses straight and socks off. Some mothers whispered warnings to whiners. Others hummed in ears, as if to get in one last rehearsal.
In the audition room, Ms. Kontos and Eteri Andjaparidze (pronounced an jah pah REED zeh), a Russian pianist and the school's music director, debated whether to call back the "maybes" for further testing.
"The ability to sing on pitch and clap correctly is not enough," Ms. Andjaparidze said later. "We are looking for those with a certain possession of music, those for whom music is a native language, those for whom music lives a full life in their brains before they ever touch the keyboard."
Finding a diverse pool of talented children, and picking those with potential, not just training, has proved the school's most daunting task. It is based in Community School District 3, a largely black and Hispanic district whose ethnic and economic makeup the school's administrators wanted to reflect. When most early applications came from middle-class white families, Ms. Kontos dispatched scouts to day-care centers and kindergartens in poorer areas, telling the parents of musically inclined children that the school was public and that the academic and music lessons were free.
"We want the criteria for admission to be musical gift," she said, "not ability to pay."
To avoid bias, instead of asking children to audition on an instrument -- a practice common in Europe's music schools -- researchers and music teachers designed a three-part test. The children repeat rhythms and melodies, move to different styles of music and improvise songs and rhythms. They are given paper and asked to illustrate melodies. And they are asked to identify and sing back the various notes in a chord.
On a recent morning, some applicants were able to identify selections from "The Nutcracker." Others fumbled with the words of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." Some performed with bravado but couldn't hold their pitch. Others cowered, but copied rhythms easily with claps. And two boys spent most of their time running back and forth to the bathroom.
"We're looking for a set of aptitudes -- those things the child will use as his musical equipment," said Anne Farber, one of the school's music teachers. "But we are also looking for, well, I don't have a word for it, but 'delight' -- that flash in the eyes, that sign that this child and the adult he becomes will find music necessary in his life."
It is the discernment of such "delight" that often leaves the testers debating long after the children have gone.
Could it lie in the child who sang like a little Maria Callas, raising her arm and warbling, "Will you please stand up? Will you please sit down?"
Or in the boy who could not take his eyes -- or hands -- off a nearby xylophone, inching his way toward it again and again?
Or in the little girl, known to be musical, who balked at the door and wouldn't enter?
Ms. Farber, who conducts much of the testing, says there is a moment in its second phase when musical genius sometimes flickers up. She plays the piano and asks the children to close their eyes and paint the music with their hands and arms.
"Every now and then," she said, "you'll see one child tilt his head, because he hears something in the music that speaks to him. Or a facial expression will suddenly change. We've had some quite moving moments."
One of those who moved the testers was a 4-year-old named Arielle. Her mother, Elise Dixon-Harris, said she was grateful Arielle had been accepted. The child loves music, her mother said; she claps through hourlong country music programs and dances to Weather Channel music. But private lessons would have been beyond the budget.
"I just want Arielle to be able to do what she wants to do," Ms. Dixon-Harris said.
But, with practice, practice, practice, she may become a little Leonskaya. "Not all the children will make it to Carnegie Hall," Mr. Feltsman said. "But for the few who have that special gift, we will give them a chance to grow. Isn't it all about giving, anyway?"

HEADLINE: Community Of Muslims Finds Desert Fertile Land

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: ABIQUIU, N.M.

 BODY:
An hour's drive northwest of Santa Fe, a gravel road breaks away from the blacktop and swings north across the Chama River, into a landscape that seems to bespeak the transcendent. Red rock cliffs rise above the river, hawks wheel overhead and the bone-dry air imparts a special clarity to everything in sight. The artist Georgia O'Keeffe found inspiration here, setting up her easel in a rocky gulch called the "white city."
Farther up the road, the sense of spirituality takes a tangible form. Atop a hill sits a stucco mosque, focal point of a tiny Islamic community that has struggled to take root, and to make itself known nationally. 
 The community, Dar al Islam, wants to encourage a "moderate, tolerant, articulate and very American" brand of the faith, said Hakim Archuletta, an earnest, California-born convert who serves as its spokesman. "I feel that's the emerging Islam," he said.
Next month, for the fourth time in as many years, Dar al Islam will host believers from across the country at a three-day "Muslim Powwow," an event combining communal prayer, shared meals, discussions and hiking. Last year, about 300 people attended.
Later this summer, the community, organized around a nonprofit educational center, plans two, two-week programs for social studies teachers to learn about Islamic history.
Given that Islam was first proclaimed in the desert, by the prophet Muhammad in seventh century Arabia, the faith's appearance in the dusty uplands of northern New Mexico should not seem so strange.
Yet it is striking to find an Islamic community where the surroundings are so closely tied to Roman Catholicism. The wooden door of the mosque opens outward onto a panoramic view of mountain peaks named by Spanish explorers the Sangre de Cristo, or Blood of Christ. Place names like Santa Fe and San Juan testify to the area's dominant faith.
Dar al Islam was begun in 1979 by a handful of Muslim converts who had a vision of a model religious community and a grant from an American-educated Saudi businessman. Pioneering families put up a community building, a 30,000-square-foot space with classrooms, dormitories and ample space to pray. Once, 25 families lived near the site.
But by the late 1980's the project had faltered, in part because of a weak rural economy. Today, only eight families remain.
"We discovered," said Walter 'Abdur Ra'uf Declerk, a tall, Belgian-born covert, "that you cannot engineer a community, like on a conveyer belt you engineer a car."
"It was a disappointment and a relief," said Mr. Declerk, Dar al Islam's director of finance and administration. "It was a relief because for years we had struggled with something that was impossible."
Rather than try to build an autonomous community, the group now focuses largely on the annual gatherings and teachers courses, which have attracted the attention of academic experts. The sale of about three-quarters of the group's original 8,000-acre property has also let it begin building an endowment.
"It's absolutely fascinating what they're doing," said Yvonne Haddad, a professor of Islamic history at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She spent a week at Dar al Islam in 1994, helping teach the social studies teachers.
The United States is home to 3 million to 4 million Muslims, most of them immigrants, she said. Mosques can be found in cities great and small, but rural communities like the one here are rare.
Dar al Islam is also unusual on two other counts, Professor Haddad said.
Its residents are largely white, while the vast majority of American converts are black. (The latter are mostly Sunni Muslims, belonging to Islam's major branch, not to be confused with the black nationalist sect, the Nation of Islam.)
Moreover, Professor Haddad said, some of Dar al Islam's residents are Sufis, followers of a mystical tradition in Islam that emphasizes direct knowledge of the divine. Most Muslims, she said, "have distanced themselves" from Sufism, considering it too other-worldly.
But Mr. Archuletta said the group hews to the Muslim mainstream. "And in terms of our programs," he said, "it's definitely not Sufi."
Some prominent Muslims are intrigued by the community's work. "I'm watching it very closely, because it's unusual," said Aslam Abdullah, editor of The Minaret, a magazine published in Los Angeles. "They are more spiritually oriented people."
Mr. Archuletta said that a goal of the annual gatherings is to introduce younger Muslims to American-born converts who can be role models, men and women who have distinguished themselves intellectually or professionally. As an example, he described one convert who was a deep-sea fisherman and made himself an expert on a branch of Islamic law.
Mr. Archuletta, 55, grew up in Manhattan Beach, Calif., his mother a Presbyterian and his father a Roman Catholic of Basque heritage. He became a Muslim while studying at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960's, inspired by another convert, a Scotsman.
In an interview in the Abiquiu Inn, a motel and restaurant that the community owns, Mr. Archuletta lamented negative portrayals of Islam in the media, where the faith is often linked with reports of violence in the Middle East. And he spoke with feeling of wanting to convey to other New Mexicans the power he finds in his faith.
He said he has found signs of interest among some Navajo Indians, whose vast reservation lies a few hours' drive to the west. "I've distributed almost 1,000 Korans to the Navajos," he said, referring to Islam's holy book.
"Islam's revolution is inner revolution," Mr. Archuletta said. "It's light, it's knowledge. It's not overthrowing governments."

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Bosnia Cannot Wait

 BODY:
Three and a half years of merciless war have left Bosnia's economy and society shattered. Two-thirds of the country's housing lies damaged or destroyed. Half the prewar hospital beds are gone, along with half the doctors and nurses. Roads and bridges are impassable and some four million hidden mines await potential victims. Gas, electricity and telephone lines are ruptured and three out of four adults have lost their livelihoods.
So far too little has been done to address these crushing problems. The large reconstruction effort promised as part of the Dayton peace agreement has fallen badly behind schedule. 
 The delay has potentially severe consequences for sustaining peace in Bosnia. Improvements in the lives of ordinary Bosnians are the most effective way to reinforce the Dayton settlement. If the rebuilding of Bosnia's civil society does not begin in earnest immediately, the peace could start to crumble by the time NATO forces are to depart at the end of this year, creating pressure for the troops to extend their stay. The nearly $2 billion so far pledged in aid must be put to quick and effective use.
To that end, President Clinton and European leaders should shift their focus from military to civilian aspects of the peace settlement and bring a new sense of urgency to bear on such needs as putting people back to work, assuring free and fair conditions for this summer's elections and making it possible for people to cross ethnic boundaries without fear. They must see to it that the international coordinators of civil reconstruction, chiefly Carl Bildt of Sweden and Robert Frowick of the United States, have the determination and resources they need to get the job done.
The best insurance against renewed warfare in Bosnia would be finding jobs for some 300,000 former soldiers now demobilized. Tens of thousands of women who lost husbands in the war also must find ways to provide for their families. International reconstruction aid should be channeled as quickly as possible into job-creating projects rebuilding housing, roads and bridges.
Meanwhile, Bosnia is preparing for elections. For these to be conducted fairly, giving moderates a chance to displace the extremists responsible for the war, independent candidates will need access to print and broadcast media now dominated by ethnic parties and governments. Mr. Frowick, who has chief responsibility for supervising the elections, has been trying to expand election coverage and set up new broadcast outlets, but his efforts have not yet produced acceptable results.
The Dayton agreement also assures refugees, a large proportion of Bosnia's population, the right to vote. But some European countries warn that those who exercise this right could forfeit their refugee status. Mr. Frowick and Mr. Bildt must make sure this threat is withdrawn.
For civilians to move freely throughout the country, they must get past roadblocks manned by armed ethnic militias and survive attack from hostile mobs uncontrolled by local police. Mr. Bildt's civilian monitors should insist that local police secure safe passage for civilians. NATO forces, which have begun accompanying refugee convoys, should prod local military units to respect Dayton's guarantees of free movement.
There is still time to save the civil side of the peace effort if Mr. Bildt and his team move more swiftly in the next eight months than they have in the last four. The unacceptable price of further delay is likely to be new warfare or the long-term commitment of American and European forces

HEADLINE: Colombia's Economy Unsettled by Crisis Involving President

BYLINE: By PAMELA MERCER 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, May 4

 BODY:
Years of guerrilla warfare, the terrorism of the drug trade and a string of political assassinations have made Colombia one of the world's most violent countries. Through it all, the economy has thrived.
Now, as investigations into allegations that drug money helped finance the President's election campaign in 1994 are threatening to topple the Government, the crisis is unsettling the economy. 
 In recent months, the country's economic growth has slowed as businesses, uncertain about the future, postpone investment decisions.
Banks, in turn, are suffering the consequences of decreased borrowing. Speculation by investors has led the peso to lose ground against the dollar.
Many in the private sector say the criminal investigations facing President Ernesto Samper and his closest aides in connection with the 1994 campaign are to blame for much of the decline. And as the political crisis draws on, business figures are becoming a focal point of opposition to the Government.
"The political crisis has affected the economy," said Javier Fernandez, president of the National Association of Financial Institutions, a private group. "We fear that the Government's lack of legitimacy may affect economic decisions. But we are mainly dissatisfied with the President for moral reasons."
He said there was strong pressure from business for the President to step down.
Discontent among business leaders became evident in late January, when Fernando Botero, Mr. Samper's former campaign manager, accused him of receiving millions of dollars in campaign contributions from members of the Cali drug cartel. As the country grappled with these charges and entered its worst period of political instability in decades, the National Business Council, an association of powerful business groups, asked the President to consider resignation.
In March, economic prospects were further dimmed when, in a punitive measure aimed at countries that are considered to be making insufficient progress in the fight against drugs, the United States withdrew some assistance to Colombia and four other countries.
The opposition became more vocal in the weeks that followed. At the same time, the National Federation of Merchants and the National Association of Industrialists, two powerful business groups, and Fedesarrollo, an influential economic research institute, released reports that cited the political crisis as a key factor in declining profits, low investment and slow growth.
The figure that raised the most concern was Fedesarrollo's forecast of a 3.8 percent increase in the gross domestic product for 1996, far lower than official projections of 4.9 percent and the annual growth rates of more than 5 percent that Colombia has had in the last three years.
Not all of the economic troubles are linked to the scandal. Construction, for example, is suffering the normal effects of a trade prone to cyclical downturns. And part of the central bank's initiative in raising interest rates has come from efforts to control inflation and counter high Government spending.
But analysts warn that the economic consequences of the crisis, which have so far been moderate, will deepen if Mr. Samper remains in power indefinitely. In a recent poll conducted by Dinero, a monthly magazine, 87 percent of business people questioned favored a change in the country's leadership.

HEADLINE: Environment Yielding to Other Worries, U.N. Talks Suggest

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 3

 BODY:
Four years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro propelled the environment to the top of the world agenda, the movement seems to have reached an impasse here at the United Nations, where a commission set up to monitor progress since Rio ended two weeks of talks today.
The Commission on Sustainable Development -- dedicated to the notion that nations can continue expanding their economies without destroying their environment -- heard success stories as it prepared for a major review next year of how far the world has come since the 1992 Earth Summit, formally called the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. 
 A number of national governments, including that of the United States, have prepared plans for environmental protection in the next century. Hundreds of municipalities have also written plans of action, bringing the concept of environmental protection to urban neighborhoods and the grass roots.
Britain's Secretary of the Environment, John Gummer, said at a news conference today that this week's meetings had also taken an important step in bringing the world's oceans and their resources under the scrutiny of United Nations environmental bodies. "We are accepting as a world community that there are to be world rules," he said. "Until this conference, the oceans were untouched by the Rio process."
But hovering over the meeting was the sense that other issues have begun crowding out the environment, as rich and poor countries alike worry about unemployment and economic decline. And in many countries, environment ministries and private organizations say they are frustrated by their inability to make environmental impact a major factor in economic policy-making.
As recent negotiations over a Federal budget agreement in Washington demonstrated, environmental platforms are often subject to compromise, even in an Administration in which the Vice President, Al Gore, has an international reputation as a leader in the movement.
"To a certain extent, after Rio other issues took over," said Nitin Desai, the United Nations' Under Secretary General for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development. "I sometimes argue that Rio took place in a particular window of opportunity, when, in a way, the world didn't have anything else to worry about."
Mr. Desai said in an interview on Thursday that the next step for the environmental movement must be to broaden its scope to get its issues on others' agendas.
"When we focus only on environmental problems we won't get very far unless we move backward and focus on agriculture policy, energy policy, transport policy -- all the economic policies that affect the environment," he said.
Several speakers called attention to rapidly changing patterns of transportation and the problems these are creating: the explosion in car ownership in some regions of the world, unmanageable traffic and increased pollution in many cities already choked by industrial waste.
Austria's Environment Minister, Martin Bartenstein, devoted a large part of his speech to the growth of vehicular traffic and shortages in public transportation and energy supplies. Several delegates said afterward that they found it ironic that in Washington at the same time, the two major political parties were competing for ways to lower gasoline prices in the United States, thereby effectively adding to the glut of cars burning a finite supply of fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: Pataki to Seek A Sales Tax For Some Items On Tribal Land

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALLEGANY INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y.

 BODY:
By the hundreds, outsiders flock here each day to load up on the rare goods sold in the small Indian shops of this remote reservation: tax-free cigarettes and gasoline.
"You just can't find this kind of bargain anywhere else," Chuck Fuerst said the other day, after paying $40 for five cartons of cigarettes at the Seneca One Stop on the outskirts of the reservation. "I've been coming here for years." 
 But the days of discount prices and tidy profits for the state's Indian entrepreneurs may soon end, because Gov. George E. Pataki vows to close this loophole. He plans to begin collecting taxes this summer on reservation sales of cigarettes and gas to non-Indians -- despite the tribes' contention that doing so would violate their sovereignty and threaten the stores that form the backbone of many tribal economies.
Indeed, the three stores owned by the Seneca nation alone generate $25 million a year, largely from sales of gasoline and cigarettes to non-Indians like Mr. Fuerst.
The Pataki administration says the state will begin imposing the taxes on July 5, amid growing pressure from non-Indian merchants who have long complained that Indian competitors have been crippling their businesses because of an unfair price advantage, particularly as state sales taxes on cigarettes and gas have risen sharply. Today, Indian businesses routinely sell gasoline for 20 to 25 cents a gallon less and cigarettes for $8 a carton less than stores just outside their reservations.
The taxation issue elicits strong feeling here, where the Senecas fought a similar effort four years ago by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo by shutting down state highways throughout their reservation in a standoff with the police that lasted several days. Mr. Cuomo was using a plan that enabled the state to tax reservation sales of gasoline and cigarettes to non-Indians. Mr. Pataki is now dusting off the same plan, which has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court.
"I think the Governor needs to back off his threat," said J. C. Seneca, the owner of two convenience stores that thrive largely because of sales to non-Indians, "because he's creating problems for the open dialogue that's needed to resolve this situation. We have a right to defend our interests as a people."
About 50 members of the Seneca, Mohawk, Tuscarora and Onondaga nations gathered yesterday in downtown Buffalo, calling New York's tax plan a violation of their sovereignty, The Associated Press reported. The protesters demonstrated for about an hour in a steady downpour, listening to speakers and carrying signs that read "Honor Our Treaties."
Seeking to work out a compromise, the Pataki administration has asked for Federal intervention. This week, an official from the Office of Tribal Justice in Washington scheduled a meeting with Indian leaders in an attempt to avoid confrontations like the one in 1992.
New York is not the only state grappling with the problem of how to tax businesses on reservations without violating the sovereignty of Indian nations. Thirteen states have struck deals with Indian tribes allowing state officials to collect taxes on certain goods sold on reservations.
For New York, the taxation issue has taken on added importance this year because legislative leaders say they can collect about $90 million to $120 million from such taxes annually to help balance the state budget.
Indian tribes have long enjoyed tax-exempt status because treaties that established them as independent nations bar states from enforcing taxation and other laws on Indians. But in 1994 the United States Supreme Court upheld a plan devised by New York State that sought to collect taxes on reservation sales to non-Indian customers without violating Indian sovereignty.
State officials have been under growing pressure to enact the tax-collection plan, as the convenience-store and gas-station lobbies complain that Indian shops have siphoned away millions of dollars in business from non-Indian retailers.
Consider the case of Mark W. Sidebottom, a non-Indian who owns a chain of convenience stores scattered outside the Seneca reservation here in western New York near the Pennsylvania border. In the last two years alone, he said, he has had to close three of his stores as competition from the Indians stiffened.
"We're closing more stores than we're opening," Mr. Sidebottom said. "There's absolutely no way to compete with Indians. I've found that my own employees shop on the reservations. Enough is enough already."
Customers, not surprisingly, oppose the closing of the tax loophole.
James Fisher, a retired trucker who lives about 50 miles from the Seneca people, fumed about the Governor's plan the other day as he made a pit stop at one of the eight convenience stores dotting a busy strip on the edges of the reservation.
He derided the plan as meddling in the affairs of a sovereign nation. "They have treaties, you know," Mr. Fisher said. But in the end he was mostly upset about the prospect of having to pay state taxes, a sentiment expressed by most people living near the reservation. "The Government wants to tax everything," he said as he filled his tank.
The Pataki administration, for its part, is willing to talk with tribal leaders and extend the July deadline if they come up with their own plan for regulating and taxing the sales of cigarette and gas on the reservations by July 5.
But many Indian leaders across the state say they refuse to be strong-armed into compromising with state officials. "We're not going to negotiate with guns to our head," said Raymond Halbritter, leader of the Oneida Indians near Utica.
In the end, tax experts say, it will be difficult to avoid the taxes because of the clever way that New York's tax-collection plan gets around the question of sovereignty.
The plan would compel state officials to collect sales and excise taxes from non-Indian wholesalers of gasoline and cigarettes before they sold their goods to Indian retailers. The cost of the taxes would then be passed along to the retailers and their customers.
But before imposing the tax on the non-Indian wholesaler, the state would estimate the amount of cigarettes and gasoline that would be consumed by the Indians themselves. The tax would be imposed on gas and cigarettes beyond the predetermined limit, on the assumption that non-Indian customers would be buying them.
The Pataki administration's hard line has begun to send waves of anxiety throughout many reservations.
The Senecas, perhaps more than the others, are concerned because the roughly 30 convenience stores scattered along the fringes of their three reservations have helped revitalize the tribe's economy after decades of depression.
The businesses employ about 150 people and have even turned a handful of Seneca entrepreneurs into millionaires. The $25 million a year taken in by the three stores the Seneca nation itself owns helps pay the salaries of 700 workers employed by the tribal government.
The shops are so essential to tribal life that Seneca leaders are hammering out a compromise proposal that would establish the tribe as the only wholesaler allowed to supply reservation stores.
Seneca leaders say the plan would bring money into tribal coffers and enable them to raise gas and cigarette prices closer to those off the reservation while still maintaining part of the current pricing advantage. But some non-Indian merchants worry that the proposal is a ploy to get around the state's tax-collection plan.
Sovereignty-minded, the Senecas are taking a tough stance, some of them even threatening to set up tolls along state highways on the reservation if no mutually acceptable agreement is reached. The Pataki administration has said it would consider any plan that the Indians submit.
"We need to work this out," said Rosemary Patterson, who is on the 16-member Seneca Council, the tribe's legislature. "This is a matter of survival for our people."
Yvonne Cooper's situation typifies the trouble that many Indian merchants face. Just about all her customers are non-Indians and they mob her smoke shop each day in search of bargains. Ms. Cooper is certain they would stop coming if she began charging state taxes.
"Yeah, I'm worried," Ms. Cooper said the other day as she sat in a spare room of her store on Broad Street. "Some people travel 50 miles just to save money. Why would they travel that distance if they could buy cigarettes at the same price in their local convenience store?"
Just down the block at the Seneca One Stop, Kim Hennings spends most afternoons at the register ringing up sales of gas and cigarettes to truckers and other outsiders who have made the store a prime destination.
She says it is about the best job she could find in this economically depressed region of the state.
"There are a lot of people like me who will be out of jobs if these stores go under," she said. "And then what do we do? Go on welfare? I wish the Governor would just leave us alone."

HEADLINE: 2 Governors Back $130 Million Plan To Deepen Harbor

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
With rising shoals of silt threatening the future of New York Harbor and thousands of jobs, the Governors of New York and New Jersey have endorsed a plan earmarking up to $130 million this year for deepening shipping channels.
But the commitment to spend the money, which is available from capital accounts of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, does not mean the Governors have solved the problem that has dogged this issue for two years: where to put millions of tons of dredged mud that is contaminated with toxic chemicals. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey remains firmly opposed to dumping any of it in the ocean, and the other possibilities -- putting it in covered pits in the harbor, on artificial islands, or on the shore -- are costly, controversial, or too untested to offer an immediate solution. 
 Even so, the plan represents a significant down payment by the two states on a problem that experts say is already costing the area trade and jobs and may soon end New York Harbor's 150-year-old status as the dominant East Coast seaport.
Outlined in a one-page resolution released yesterday by Governor Whitman and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, the plan would allocate four times as much money for dredging as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey normally spends each year to maintain its channels and berths. Port Authority commissioners are scheduled to vote on the resolution next Thursday.
The resolution calls the deepening of channels to 50 feet a "top priority" of the states, saying that 166,500 jobs in New York and New Jersey are generated by port commerce, along with $20 billion in annual sales of goods. Calling for a plan stretching to 2025, the resolution says it is vital for New York Harbor to be able to accommodate a new generation of deep-draft ships that is expected to begin carrying cargo from Asia to the East Coast.
If shippers shift operations to existing deep-water ports like Halifax, Nova Scotia, or Norfolk, Va., port experts say, the effects here would include higher costs for consumers and more air pollution and traffic from the trucks that would carry goods here instead of ships.
The prospect of money for dredging cheered a variety of harbor constituencies, but they lamented the lack of specifics in the resolution. Private environmental groups, for example, want some of the Port Authority funds to be used to clean up harbor pollution.
Many of those whose jobs or businesses depend on the port say all they want is action.
"We've gotten a lot of plans over the years, and none have become reality," said Albert Cernadas, president of Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association. "In the meantime, we're losing cargo every day to other ports. And silt accumulates every day." Until mud is scooped and barged somewhere, doubts will remain, he said, adding that the union still intended to hold a demonstration in Trenton on May 30 to press for action.
He criticized Governor Whitman for continuing to refuse to consider the dumping of mud containing even the slightest trace of contamination at the traditional ocean-disposal site, six miles east of Sandy Hook. "In the short term, there's no other place," Mr. Cernadas said.
But representatives of Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Pataki insisted that their unified stance would create the momentum needed to break the deadlock over how to handle the harbor's mud. "This is an absolute commitment to solving the problem," said Peter Verniero, Governor Whitman's chief of staff. The goal is to have a fleshed-out dredging plan by Aug. 1, said Michael C. Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's counsel.
Mr. Finnegan said that the Army Corps of Engineers and Federal environmental officials -- who together regulate channel dredging -- were working with state officials to untangle rules and testing methods for harbor mud, and that the states had commitments from the Clinton Administration for Federal funding to spur solutions.
Mr. Verniero said the 12 Port Authority commissioners were likely to follow the lead of the Governors who appointed them and approve using the money -- which would be taken from the Port Authority's existing capital budget -- for dredging.
The resolution was the product of four weeks of meetings of state, Federal and New York City officials organized by Mr. Verniero and Mr. Finnegan.
Several people participating in the meetings said the states were closing in on a menu of ways to share the burden of handling the tainted mud, but were constrained from providing details. One state official, who declined to be identified, said that it was likely that some of the dormant, weed-strewn piers of Brooklyn -- which lie along a naturally deep channel -- would play a role in reducing the need for dredging altogether by offering a spot for deeper-draft ships to unload their goods.
Lillian C. Borrone, the port director, hailed the move by the two executives, saying, "This is the first time we have both states, the city, and the Federal agencies all saying the same thing: 'We have a crisis.' " She added that the $130 million figure should reassure port businesses that, this time, the commitment is not just another paper plan.
For 80 years, all of the dredged harbor mud was routinely dumped at sea east of Sandy Hook. But when a new set of more sensitive Federal toxicity tests was introduced two years ago, much of the harbor mud was found to contain sufficient traces of certain toxic chemicals to pose a theoretical threat to marine life. According to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, since the change in tests, about 60 percent of mud dredged from channels in New York Harbor fails and cannot go into the open ocean.
Although some disposal options have been proposed, years of testing and study will be required before these methods can be expanded, port officials say.
Private groups pressing to prevent marine and beach pollution are urging the states to find ways to dispose of the mud on land or to decontaminate it using new technology, but these options are even further down the line, dredging experts say.
If the resolution is approved, the Port Authority's commissioners will then target funds for the most pressing dredging projects, Port Authority officials said. The money would be allocated, but not necessarily all spent, this year, they said.
Representatives of some environmental groups said that it was important that some of the money also flow to related environmental projects, including cleaning up the sources of the pollution that tainted the harbor bottom in the first place. "It looks like most of this money is going to the economic-development side," said James T. B. Tripp, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund and longtime participant in the dredging debate.
Mr. Tripp and some New Jersey and Federal officials would like some of the money to spur the development of a project in which sand-mining companies create pits near the existing offshore dump site. Most of the sand would be sold for construction projects, the pits would provide a secure repository for harbor mud, and some of the mined sand would be used to seal both the new pits and cover broad areas of contamination created by past dumping.
But many shore communities and New Jersey politicians, including Governor Whitman, refuse to consider such a plan. One official at the Port Authority, who declined to be identified, said that the states must realize that, without the ocean-dumping option, the tainted mud will have to be dealt with where it is produced, in New Jersey and New York. The Governors will have to have the political will to overcome local resistance to dealing with traces of toxic chemicals, he said.
"Every day, this material is coming down the Hudson, Passaic, and Raritan Rivers," the official said. "You can't put it in the ocean and you can't shoot it to the Moon, so that means you've got to put it in the states somewhere."

HEADLINE: Business Schemes Change Dynamics of the Drug War

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
Business was so brisk at S & F Check Cashers, a modest check-cashing concern in West New York, N.J., across the Hudson River from Manhattan, that the dollars it collected were reportedly sometimes hauled to the bank by an armored-car company.
But as Marion Percell, an assistant United States attorney in Newark, observed, "A check-cashing service should be getting money from the bank, not sending it in." 
 The service was part of what law enforcement officials say was a larger conspiracy that sent as much as $60 million in drug profits back to the Cali cartel in Colombia under the cover of such mundane services as selling telephone debit cards and money orders, renting beepers and cashing checks.
"The major problem the cocaine traffickers have is not getting drugs into the country," Ms. Percell said. "It's getting the money out."
She is prosecutor in the trial of 13 defendants in Newark on Sept. 10, the largest money-laundering case brought by the Federal Government in New Jersey.
The New York region offers a prime arena for money laundering -- disguising illegal profits to make them look legitimate. The city itself is a crossroads for heroin and cocaine smuggled into the country as well as a world financial center where $2 trillion can change hands in a single business day.
At least $10 billion in laundered money flows annually through the New York City metropolitan area, according to Kenneth C. Klug, a special agent for the United States Customs Service. Mr. Klug is assigned to Operation El Dorado, a Customs and Internal Revenue Service task force based in Manhattan's financial district that combats money laundering. Drugs generate up to 90 percent of this money, Mr. Klug estimated, with the rest traceable to tax evasion, extortion or illegal gambling.
The intricacies of money laundering have changed the dynamics of the war against illegal drugs in New York. New laws, computerization and growing vigilance over large cash transactions have made it harder for traffickers to move their money in what is predominantly a credit-card economy. As a result, said the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, some traffickers have gone back to "bulking out" drug profits by hiding the cash inside objects like wire spools and bowling balls.
Syndicates like the Cali cartel in Colombia have a harder time sending back the money because of United States Government regulations requiring the reporting of most financial transactions larger than $10,000. Law enforcement agencies have also learned to track money movements by computer. And for the traffickers, it is still a chore to consolidate and convert small-denomination cash accumulated in street sales into a currency that can be moved inconspicuously.
"They've basically set up two organizations now," Mr. Morgenthau said, "one that brings the drugs in and another that takes the money out."
The methods used by traffickers in New York and elsewhere include such diverse schemes as simply hiding the loot and transferring money through a succession of financial institutions and front companies, a process called "layering," to mask its origins. Couriers booked on outgoing flights have swallowed $100 bills rolled in condoms.
Robert H. Silbering, New York City's special narcotics prosecutor, recalled how Drug Enforcement Administration agents in the mid-1980's found a van crammed with $19 million in bills. "There wasn't a bill larger than a $20," he said.
Since then, smugglers have become more inventive. In 1990, Customs Service agents found $6.5 million in 26 Colombia-bound canisters labeled as containing bull semen. Inspectors have also found $7 million in a 40-foot-long refrigerated container.
The case in Newark illustrates how one discovery leads to another. Law officers were alerted by a Customs inspector at Newark International Airport who had found more than $1 million stuffed in stereo systems being shipped to Colombia.
The ensuing investigation led agents to S & F Check Cashers and two other companies: International Services, a travel agency and money transmitter in Jersey City, and Latelco Inc., which offered telephone debit cards and had offices in Miami, Cali and West New York.
According to the indictment, the companies deposited "substantial amounts of money" from drug sales in local bank accounts, then wrote checks to other accounts in Panama's free trade zone, where, investigators believe, the money was remitted in pesos back to Colombia or used to benefit the cartel's other worldwide interests.
Prosecutors say S & F Check Cashers received a commission on money that it laundered. Until recently, the going rate was as low as 3 percent. But with laundering becoming riskier, drug traffickers in New York are now paying up to 8 percent. That was the rate charged by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a sting operation that it ran out of a store in Queens from November 1993 until last March.
Money launderers use telephone and remittance shops catering to immigrants here to wire cash back to Colombia and elsewhere in South America. So the agency set up such a store in Bayside, Queens, with Spanish-speaking undercover operatives and wiretapped telephones.
"We put out word that if anyone was interested in moving large amounts of money, to call a number," said Carlo A. Boccia, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York field office.
After almost two and a half years, the operation, which was financed by the commission paid by drug traffickers, located 20 money-laundering accounts at banks in the United States and elsewhere and made 18 arrests.
To prevent the transfers of large amounts of tainted money, the Bank Secrecy Act requires banks and other financial institutions to report to the Internal Revenue Service any individual transaction of more than $10,000, though this does not include transfers between banks. Travelers carrying more than $10,000 in or out of the United States must file a report with the Customs Service. Anyone paying more than $10,000 in cash for a house or a car must also be reported to the Government.
To evade the $10,000 ceiling, traffickers wire smaller amounts more often, an illegal technique called "smurfing."
Investigators say they are tipped by banks in New York that notice an influx of funds they cannot explain.
Operation El Dorado, which works out of the Customs Service's headquarters in the World Trade Center, uses computers like radar to scan for a pattern of financial transactions consistent with laundering. "Money is allowed to move," Mr. Klug said. "We identify the source or go to the application. And that's a paper trail."
In Operation Polar Cap, which began in California and spread to New York, the El Dorado computers detected more money than usual circulating through Manhattan's jewelry industry a few years ago, and homed in on a half-dozen jewelers who accounted for more than $300 million of the turnover.
"What they saw was a cornucopia of businesses out there that were putting money into the banking system," Mr. Klug said. Closer investigation found that the extra cash was coming from drug traffickers, who had promised the jewelers a commission on what they laundered.
Drug traffickers are also contracting out laundering to shady money managers, who buy or sell drug proceeds like a commodity.
Operation El Dorado is monitoring the activities of an undisclosed number of banks or brokerage firms in New York for evidence of money laundering, though investigators would not give details.

HEADLINE: My Journey Among the Blind

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LEDUFF 

 BODY:
Spring. Somewhere near Union Square Park.
The air is warm and calm now; the rain has moved along. Women daubed with perfume rustle by. The cement is wet, and the sound of afternoon traffic echoes flatly like radio static from an old wireless. Standing at the corner, I wait to cross. The crowd walks and I walk with it. But, being New Yorkers, everyone has jumped the crossing light. This realization comes as I find myself bumbling in the middle of Fourth Avenue while what sounds like a bus barrels down on me like a buffalo. I run, unsure of the curb. A hand reaches out from the darkness and pulls me to safety. He never says a word and I cannot thank him, or her. I cannot because I cannot see. I am blind -- my eyes completely covered by two dark patches covered by dark glasses, only a retractable white cane to guide me. 
 There is a skid, then a crash. "What are you? Freaking stupid?" one man yells. A door slams. Is he yelling at me? Another door opens. "Where do you think you're driving?" the other man snaps. I imagine his wild, indecent gestures. "This is New York for Christ's sake!" This escalates. Horns start to scream. People go on about their ways. Heels go click-clack, click-clack.
New York, indeed. Big. Beautiful, and mean. I wondered what it is like for the blind in the world's fastest city? I asked this of a blind man once as we walked across a street. "It's tough," he said dismissively and walked on.
I stood there stupidly, thinking, "Dumb question, maybe even rude." That was it. Somewhere I had learned to ignore the blind; they were different and lived in another world. If they wanted something, they would ask. That's what that blind man meant: how could I ever understand?
I decided I would try, thinking that actually depriving myself of sight might be a bridge to understanding. So I began with mobility training at Helen Keller Services for the Blind in Brooklyn. They gave me the eye patches and the cane, and Corinne Kuri, a mobility instructor, gave me a cram course on how to get around. Left foot, tap the cane to your right. Right foot, tap cane to your left. Walk slowly. Feel through your feet. Count the blocks. Remember your direction. And most important, ignore all sounds except those you need for navigation. Listen for traffic. Good luck.
I was to stay for a week with a young blind musician named Orlando Fiol, who lives uptown. He would try to show me what it was like to live without sight in an ocular world, he promised, but he would not baby-sit me. No problem I said, I would practice over the weekend.
An instructor of the blind, John Byfield, told me that even though New York is a cramped, suffocating tunnel, it is a sanctuary of sorts for the blind.
"Outside of the mania, Manhattan is laid out in blocks and for that reason it is probably one of the easiest geographical places to live," he said.
But on that first practice run I began to realize that the fine things I've come to love about the city can be grotesque and frightening. I did circles around my block. Over and over I went, certain of nothing. I heard children laughing. Are they laughing at me? I wondered. I could picture their big gaping mouths the size of squashes. Behind every argument, every game, was a lurking, willowy figure ready to harm. It felt dizzy, like vertigo, and I began talking to myself.
 
 
 
The Old Man
 Monday came, an iron church bell tolled 12, and I sat in my apartment, panic stricken, wondering what to do. I had to head uptown to see Orlando. I knew I couldn't make it to the subway alone so I called a friend.
As we walked, my friend described how people stared and then darted their eyes away as if I might see them. Mothers shooed their children. At the subway, people let us cut into the line. I gave my friend a $5 bill that I had folded into quarters and placed in my right pocket. He bought a token for me and gave me my change. I folded the singles in half and placed them in my left pocket.
I made it to the 110th Street station. Disembarking, I stopped to listen, letting the crowd clear. Navigating is mostly a matter of reading signposts of sounds. The flow of shoes and rustling newspapers went off to my right. I figured the exit must be there. Left foot, tap right. Right foot, tap left. Going slowly, I sensed that I was on a two-sided platform. I felt the air flow and heard echoes wafting from the tunnels. It's hard to know if you are walking a straight line. By listening for the turnstiles and traffic, I found my way out.
Now what? I did not remember Orlando's address, or his telephone number, and I had no idea where I was. Vertigo. I stood on that corner for 15 minutes, maybe it was an hour. Eventually, a man asked if I needed help. I said I didn't know where I was going.
It's odd to trust a stranger to root through your bag to find an address. We walked and the man was kind. "How long you been this way," the stranger asked. His voice was old. His name was Sam. "Not long," I told him.
Sam talked about his grandson. He had just been to visit him. The boy has terminal brain cancer.
It must be God's will for a boy that young to have brain cancer, Sam said. His voice was strained.
Sam walked me all the way to the apartment building, and placed my hand on the railing. The old man just needed to talk, I think. A sightless stranger offered him just the right amount of anonymity.
"God bless you, son," Sam said as he walked off.
The doorman said, "You must be here to see Orlando," and put me in the elevator. When the door opened a voice from a distance told me to turn right. I walked toward the sound, and a long, thin hand greeted me.
 
 
 
Orlando
 Orlando Fiol has been completely blind since birth. He was born three months premature and when the doctor administered too much oxygen, it damaged his retinas for life. The medical term for this is retinopathy. Orlando describes it as fried eyeballs. He speaks with a slurred New York Latin accent, like a Puerto Rican Ray Charles. His voice is large and from its direction I would guess he is about six feet tall. Orlando's shoulders are wide, and his hair thinning and cut short. He says it is brown, like his eye. The other eye is a blue colored prosthesis.
The apartment is large, with wooden, uncarpeted floors. There is a leather couch and a grand piano in the living room and a soundproof studio in the back. It is open and uncluttered, and Orlando, 24, whisks around like a chimney sweep.
But Orlando has never seen a chimney, or a lake or trees. He knows how tall trees are because he's climbed to their tops. He knows how wide a lake is because he's swum across them. The darkness isn't black, he says, although what black means exactly, he does not know. Blind friends who once had sight describe the void as shale gray. Still, these things are all abstractions for Orlando. He takes solace in the auditory pleasures. He is a pianist who has played with Stevie Wonder and toured the world with his father's salsa band. He speaks six languages.
"Have you eaten today?" he asks me.
"No, I haven't had time," I say.
"Bull. You were just too afraid to walk into a restaurant and stumble around."
He has seen right through me. If you're going to be blind, you have to re-learn the basics, such as preparing your own hot food, he tells me. We sit down at the kitchen table for juice and sauteed mushrooms that he has quickly and easily prepared. We eat with our fingers. I tell him of my trip over, how New Yorkers were actually helpful.
"You see how much you have to rely on people?" he asks. "I need people but I'm not about to stand on the street corner whining like, 'Somebody please help me!' I won't do it. I'd rather just sit home."
He tries to live a "normal" life but realizes there is nothing normal about it. "When you're defective, when your eyes are broken, you can't be sent back," he says. "You have to learn to tolerate yourself."
Learning to like himself was a slow, painful education. He grew up in Queens Village and attended high school at The Fiorello H. La Guardia School for Music and Art and the Performing Arts, in Manhattan. He dreamed of seeing the lights, but the closest he could get was pretending to see the lights. He dressed up in the finest clothes, got expensive hair cuts and wore designer sunglasses. He ate with a fork and knife. He even had people write notes on his hands so when he walked around he could make it appear as if he could read.
But children still laughed and adults still avoided him. He had few friends in high school. No one wanted to go out with a "crip"; it was a hassle. The girls didn't want him, either. He never had a date and he didn't go to the prom.
Things weren't much better in college. Once, while chatting with a group of women at a bar, he was interrupted by one who said she preferred men who looked her in the eye. Apologizing, he explained his blindness. The women got up and left, leaving him sitting alone. "It was humiliating and I still feel it," he says. "People only see what's in front of their faces. They don't care about the inside."
He quit going to the bars. His days are now spent listening to Wordsworth from an electronic scanner that digests the text and brings it to life in a male voice that sounds as if it is speaking through an electric fan. He gives conga lessons and plays with 20 different bands. Music is his life. It is the way he'll make his name, he said.
"The blind man has to accommodate to a sighted world," Orlando says. "And that's our fault. Most of us are so busy trying to mainstream ourselves that we don't demand that there be simple things like recorded messages announcing street numbers in the subways and buses. We're too busy trying to get sighted girlfriends."
 
 
 
Love
 Orlando has a sighted fiancee, Rachel. She drives us to a gig in Connecticut. We leave early in the morning. I don't think the sun is up because I can't hear rush-hour traffic yet. A blind car ride is like watching black paint dry. The highlight came when I heard a dog bark.
We get to the gig and the band sets up. Rachel helps Orlando, and I sit in the corner. She looks out for me, too, arranging an escort to the toilets. We listen to the band warm up; the tenor sax sounds like an old man blowing his nose. Rachel tells me how good she feels with Orlando. "He's taught me how to hear the canon and a fugue in operas," she says. "He's taught me to listen, and I've taught him to trust."
When we return home from the concert, she lets me feel her face. Rachel Grossman is a 30-year-old with a tall, imperious voice. She has vision and wears moon-shaped glasses on her round face. Her hair lopes down to her big shoulders. When I first heard her voice, I thought she was Latina, but she is white. Orlando knows because she told him. They met through a telephone dating service.
Meeting through the phone became a habit of Orlando's. He's met many women in his time -- "they were all the wrong kind." A very popular musician and student at Columbia, he always had a coterie of admirers, but never lovers.
"It's like, who wants half a man?" Orlando says acidly. Through the telephone he could engage women and reveal the fact of his blindness at his own pace.
He found companionship and depravity but never love. Once he arranged to rendezvous at a woman's apartment. When he arrived, she reeked of alcohol and was 10 years older than she had implied. "She was psychotic," Orlando recalls. Regardless, he stayed the night. He removed his false eye when it began to irritate him. Later, he found it gnarled on the floor. Her dog had made an afternoon snack of it.
That's the way it is, he says: when you're blind you're vulnerable. Rachel paces when Orlando goes out alone. Once he was late coming back from a party and she ran outside in a panic. She found him wandering around across the street, frightened. He didn't know where he was. "The cabbie dropped him off on the wrong side of the street," she says.
Even the routine can be dangerous. The worst places in New York are 72d Street where Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue intersect, Union Square and Times Square. All very Byzantine and congested streets. Then there are muggers. And punks.
Orlando reminds me of my status. "You always have a way out. When it comes down to it, you're going to defend yourself." He is right, I know. I have a way out.
 
 
 
Wendy
 They are a nice couple, Orlando and Rachel. But sitting around with nothing to do but eavesdrop wears thin. I'm no voyeur and I had to go.
I'm on my way to visit Wendy Miller, a blind woman who is training with her new guide dog. She lives in midtown and I sweep the subway station, not sure where my train is. A young man helps me. His arm is damp and hot. I say so. "Yeah, I just been playing. I'm Larry, the dude who plays buckets in the Levi's commercial." Yeah, I know him. He puts me on the train. Cool guy. It's nice to meet decent, well-meaning people.
The conductor announces my stop and the door opens. From the darkness an unsolicited hand tugs on my wrist, intended to help me out. Caught off guard, I tumble to the platform. I hear a crowd gather. "Oh my God! Are you alright?" a woman screams as if I'm deaf. Yes, I say, picking myself up. I'm embarrassed. The indignities of a moment like this makes it all the more difficult to be blind, I'm understanding. Angry, I find my way to the stairs swinging my cane like a weed whacker. I do not want company. I do not want help. I am capable.
I buy some cigarettes at a newsstand. The man helps me with the change. I cannot tell my nickels from quarters. Trying to calm down, I smoke one until it burns to my fingertips. Then I slowly feel my way toward Ms. Miller's apartment.
When I arrive, she is with her new dog, her sixth. The first died of old age, the last developed epilepsy and the one before that had a nervous breakdown from living in the city. He lives in the suburbs now.
A dog is important for Ms. Miller: the cane is a sign of helplessness, the dog a sign of power.
"It's untrue that New Yorkers are indifferent," she says. "In fact, they try to help too much. That's why I have the dog."
Ms. Miller, a social worker, moved here six months ago when her brother died. There were too many memories in Kansas City. She was married back there, to a sighted man. They divorced five years ago. They were never in love. "I always wanted to have a sighted husband," she said.
Growing up, she wanted to appear normal. She wore makeup, and nodded her head in appreciation of art she could not see. Her sister taught her that nod, and the latest dance steps.
She was married for five years, and there were good parts: the sex was nice and he bought the groceries. "I like being told I look beautiful," she says. "I like taking car rides. But I wasn't considered part of his world. He was the nice guy and I was the poor little blind girl. When we ate out, they asked him what I was eating like I was retarded. I hate that."
Wendy Miller is ornery about her independence. She has to be. When you're blind, people grab your arms and cane. They pull at you like the Boy Scout did the reluctant old lady. I think about the person in the subway who pulled me to the ground. Ms. Miller tells me about the guy who dragged her around a sleeping wino, like she was a piece of luggage.
"Damn it -- just leave me alone," she says.
She is not in New York to conquer it. It's the hum, the flow, that she loves. To her, New York is a square dance, one arm to the next, a dos-a-dos. It occurs to me that maybe it's not the lights that attract the moth, but the buzz.
 
 
 
The Party
 I've gone home to live alone. I've learned to find the door to my apartment building: it is the spot with the rubbled sidewalk. I can feel it through my shoes. It is a quiet space where house martins chatter outside the window. Besides listening to the birds, there's not much for me to do except practice the flute. I play the whole afternoon.
A friend calls and invites me to a party. It is supposed to have all that buzz. The Glamour. The Style. The Hip Set. Very New York, she says. And plenty of cocktails.
It is in SoHo and I wait for a long time as a string of cabs blow by. I hear other people get in and out, but I stand there. Someone flags one down for me. The driver is fair, and doesn't rip me off. I pay him and get out of the cab. A dog barks from an alleyway. It is windy, and I realized he's left me somewhere far away.
I wait until a stranger offers to help me to the address. Arriving, I walk up some linoleum steps and I hear the party. It is smoky and reeks of stale body odor. The scene is unemployed models and European hepsters. My friend is there. When I walk by, people fall silent. I think my friend is smiling.
I am placed in the corner, among the coats. A tonic and something is stuck in my hand. I smoke, ashing on the floor and I listen to empty conversation about the latest night clubs and the droop of someone's buttocks. "She's never going to make it without surgery," a woman says.
Periodically, a woman comes to fill my glass. She is sweet and smells nice. "I see you're ready for another," she stammers, embarrassed that she's reminded me that she can see and I cannot. She never returns. I was half-right: she was sweet, but sweet like saccharine.
Coats come and go, but no one says hello. I cannot see, and somehow I am also invisible. I don't ask for chips and I don't go to the bathroom. I don't want to be a spectacle. So I sit and think about Orlando. He doesn't go to parties anymore. Why suffer the indignity?
Without someone to initiate the conversation, you're considered for about as long as a cheap painting. As for myself, I've seen dogs get more attention.
It goes this way for many cigarettes. People get drunk. I get bored. These are the beautiful people, but for me, there is no attraction, no eye contact.
One man, a German, grows increasingly sloppy. The blowhard knocks something over. "Glasses, ashtrays, china! Ha! Who cares about these things. Let's go somewhere and do things men do." I think people find him handsome. He sounds ugly.
I take my cane and go home, taking care to spank a few ankles on my way out.
 
 
 
Dusk
 Near my apartment is Stuyvesant Square Park, where I go to practice my flute. I like it there. I feel safe.
Sitting on a bench the next afternoon. A man comes up beside me. He starts a conversation. His voice is nasal and grizzled. He is drinking sour-smelling malt liquor.
He seems alright. We talk and I put the flute in my bag. A few minutes pass when there is a twitch, a rustle of my bag. Strange. The old gentleman is sitting too far away. Again, a tug.
I leap up, tearing off the blinders. There is another old tramp with his nasty hands on my bag. He knows he is done for and his eyes go wide. I whip him hard with the cane and he bolts like a spooked nag. I stand and glare at the man with the beer. He sits there with his rotten mouth hanging open, his bottle half-empty. We say nothing. I fold my cane away and walk home through the bitter odor of the ailanthus trees.
As my eyes refocus, after five days in the dark, the city comes back. The long solid lines, the molded cornices. Dusk. The artificial lights are coming on now, reflecting off the glass like a flock of burning birds, and I walk in the shadows of buildings. I see myself in a window, and I look a little different than I remember. Maybe a little taller. When you see through your eyes, you sense things as they appear, and in the glass I'm feeling confident, looking self-assured.
When you see through your ears, in some ways you sense things as they really are and that is both the most wonderful and horrible thing in the world. Perceptions change. In my mind's eye I know that we are all vulnerable in some way. That is the horrible part.
But it is good to remember the beauty. I hear the heels of my boots go click-clack.
 
Using Your Head When Offering a Hand
BLIND people are usually grateful for gestures of goodwill. Here are some suggestions to remember when helping a blind person.
 
AT THE CROSSWALK -- If you see a blind person waiting to cross the street, ask if you may provide assistance. If the answer is yes, do not grab him. Instead let him take your elbow. Be sure to walk him all the way across the street.

HOW TO GET THERE -- When giving directions, be specific as to length and where to turn left or right. Be sure he knows whose left and right you are talking about. Remember pointing does not help.

ON THE STAIRS -- When climbing stairs, guide the blind person's hand to the banister. It is not necessary to count all the steps for her. On an escalator, put her hand in front of her on the rail, before she steps on. In a revolving door, let her go ahead of you, guiding her hand to the rubber flange.

AT THE CAR -- When helping a blind person into a car, guide her hand to the roof just over the door. If the door is closed, guide her hand to the handle. Check to see if she is in before you close the door.

IN A NEW PLACE -- When accompanying a blind person into a room, do not leave him standing there. Try to orient him, leading him to a chair and placing his hand at a point of reference like the wall.

WHO YOU ARE -- Speak when you enter a blind person's room. Identify yourself. Only take her hand if she offers it to you. Let her know if you are leaving.

SEATING ARRANGEMENTS -- When showing a blind person to a chair, place his hand on the back. He will seat himself.

CASH TRANSACTIONS -- When changing a blind person's money, let her know what each bill is.

GUIDE DOG ETIQUETTE -- A guide dog walks to the blind person's left. You should walk to his right. Do not pet the dog.

WHAT TO SAY -- Most blind people are not hard of hearing. You do not need to shout. It is O.K. to use the words "see" and "blind." You do not need to censor your speech. CHARLIE LEDUFF

HEADLINE: Route 6: About Manny And an 11.5-Mile Query

 BODY:
The article was an admirable effort of capsulating a portion of the Route 6 issue and presenting it in a clear, concise and coherent manner.
One major aspect of the article that was less than clear, however, was the fact that the 11.5-mile stretch of highway under consideration is not blazing a new road in a "Westward Ho!" fashion through northeast Connecticut, but merely connecting two existing four-lane limited access highways. 
 The 11.5-mile connector highway would complete a major highway system connecting the deteriorating city of Willimantic with the state capital of Hartford.
Willimantic officials, the Willimantic Chamber of Commerce and the Windham Regional Planning Agency all support and eagerly await its completion.
In 1963 the Willimantic Chamber of Commerce led an ox-cart parade to Hartford to plead with the General Assembly for a highway between the two cities.
Today the issue being debated and discussed by the regulatory agencies is not whether or not to build a highway but rather which highway route would be the least environmentally damaging, practicable route.
The construction of any highway requires that many rules and regulations be satisfied and permits be obtained at all levels. To assist the regulatory agencies during the selection process, hundreds of reports and studies have been compiled and issued.
The Route 6 corridor has been looked at, poked at, analyzed and scrutinized by agencies, committees, groups and sub-groups, environmentalists, activists, economists, lawyers, engineers and doctors of science.
If the solution to the Route 6 dilemma was simple or easy, it would have been applied years ago.

HEADLINE: Citizens, Start Your Pumps;
How America Perpetuates Its Gas Crisis

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DRIVING may be a little more expensive these days, but the main reason is not the price of gasoline. It's because of changes in the drivers and their cars.
Or rather, it is the changes in their vehicles, because what pulls up to the pump these days is often not a car. This year an estimated 4 in 10 new "light duty vehicles" sold will be vans, sport utility vehicles or pickup trucks. This is up from 1 in 10 in 1973, when the Arab oil embargo caused the first gas crisis, in an era when pickup trucks "actually saw hay, instead of worsted suits," as Daniel F. Becker, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, put it. 
 And car or not, they all cover more miles. In 1973 the vehicles traveled 5,350 miles per person; by 1994 they did 7,900, according to Dr. Lee Schipper, an energy researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., who is currently on leave at the International Energy Agency in Paris.
 
 
 
Feed Me, Seymour
 Working with data from the Transportation and Energy Departments, and Lawrence, Mr. Shipper calculated that the actual miles per gallon were 13.11 in 1973. The rate rose to 20.22 in 1985, under pressure from rising prices and the Federal law, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard. But by 1994, with the changing mix of vehicles, it dropped to 19.31 -- drivers were trading in their early 1980's compacts for mid-1990's behemoths. And where they used to drive 59 miles an hour, a hair above the speed limit, at 69 miles an hour, a hair above the new limit on some roads, those miles per gallon will continue to decline.
For a long time the two other important trends tended to cancel each other out: Fuel economy rose in the early 1980's, canceling out the increase in prices. Gasoline prices fell in the late 1990's, more than canceling out the decline in fuel economy. As a result, the cost of driving a mile peaked in 1979, at 51 percent higher than it was in 1973, but then it started to fall. By 1994, it was one third less than it was in 1973.
Now, fuel economy is falling and the price per gallon increasing, so the cost per mile is climbing steeply, although it is no way near what the cost per mile was in 1973, Mr. Schipper said. "In terms of the cost curve, we're back to 1987," he said, referring to the recent fuel price increases. "And the world wasn't falling apart when we were paying that much."
 
 
 
Careful What You Ask For
 People today work and shop farther from home, and have grown used to static gas prices even as the cost of everything else has risen.
The price of a kilowatt-hour of electricity, which is the second most common form of energy purchased by consumers, has risen 105 percent since 1978; gas is up 87 percent. But gas prices are always visible at the pump. How many people figure their energy costs by the kilowatt-hour?
Taking inflation into account, the price of gasoline is startlingly low; gas in 1995 was at its lowest in 77 years, said the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association.
Americans reacted to that price predictably. They bought 7.79 million barrels of gasoline a day last year, up from 6.54 million in 1974.
As far as the pinch created by driving big cars for more miles and at higher speeds, Mr. Schipper said, "My sense is, we asked for this."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 12, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Charts last Sunday with an article about gasoline prices misstated the average number of miles driven per person in 1960 and 1965 and the average number of gallons of gasoline used per person in 1960. Miles per person were 3,357 in 1960 and 3,833 in 1965. Gasoline consumption in 1960 was 237 gallons per person.

HEADLINE: KEEPING TO THE CENTER LANE

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the Magazine. Her last article, "Showdown at Yazoo Industries," about labor organizers, appeared in January.

 BODY:
TWO DAYS AFTER she told Bob Dole absolutely not, thank you very much, the attention is flattering, but I'm very happy right here in New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman was on her way to North Dakota. It was a messy exercise, starting with a freaky spring storm at home, where the crocuses were buried in slush, and ending with an even freakier storm in Bismarck. Visibility was a half mile, a foot of ice and snow threatened to close the airport's one main runway and Whitman was scheduled to give the keynote speech at the state Republican convention.
A less-determined person might have turned back, but Christie Whitman didn't become the country's only female governor without determination, and she was particularly set on making this trip. She had given her word to the state's Governor, Edward T. Schafer, a friend and a like-minded moderate in a party where, to her horror, candidates are falling over themselves trying to prove that they are conservative. When you have a goal, it makes sense to keep your promises to people who see things the way you do. And Whitman, who less than three years ago had held no elective office other than local freeholder and who today is one of the most visible politicians in the country, clearly has a goal. 
 Her aim is not, in spite of all the ink and gossip, to be Bob Dole's running mate. If you spend enough time with her, you come to believe that her very public phone call to the presumptive nominee, asking to be taken off the "short list," was not a tactic but a statement of fact. Whitman does not want to be Vice President, and she has long known what she wants. From the time she was married, 22 years ago, she made it clear to her husband that being Governor "was out there as a kind of goal." Five years ago, she rejected advice that she run for the House of Representatives, in a race that she could have won easily, because, she says, "I just didn't want to be a Congressman." Instead, she ran for a Senate seat she had little chance of winning, figuring, "Why not run for a seat I would at least like to have?" She lost that race, but proving nearly everyone wrong, she came spectacularly close to victory.
Her trip to North Dakota, in a less obvious way, was also about showing the doubters. On the charts political pundits carry in their heads, North Dakota is a conservative state. Its Republicans are not supposed to elect social moderates like Schafer. And they are not supposed to welcome an Eastern Governor who, though an emblem of fiscal conservatism, also supports abortion rights, proclaimed a Lesbian and Gay Pride Month and does not support school prayer, instead favoring a moment of silence. In what Dole and Patrick Buchanan are calling "the fight for the heart and soul of the Republican Party," her social views are not supposed to play in North Dakota, or elsewhere in the country for that matter.
Whitman bristles at talk like that. In fact, it is one of the only subjects that can crack the calm, polished air -- envision a Talbots catalogue with a sense of humor -- that she has perfected since she took office in 1994. "I think I am reflective of the true nature of the Republican Party," she says. "Where I am on issues is where so many of the voters want to be." She is mainstream, she says, and the others -- the Christian Coalition, the anti-abortion movement, Buchanan -- have their place under the umbrella but have been getting too much attention.
At times, she seems ready for direct combat with the right. "As the party of Lincoln, the Republican Party ought to respect the personal as well as economic liberty of all people, regardless of race, religion, ethnic background or sexual orientation," she has said. "Intolerance of any group has no place. Discussions on issues of conscience do have a place -- at the family dinner table, in churches and synagogues and between doctor and patient. There is always something a little strange, to put it kindly, when politicians preach morality. I am not so sure we, or anyone else for that matter, have the standing to be the arbiter of values for everyone."
But more often, her prodding of the party is quiet, subtle, patient. Moderate in temperament as well as ideology, she even talks middle-of-the-road. "The bottom line for me is I, as a Republican, have lots of room in my party for people who don't agree with me" on the issue of abortion rights, as well as other social issues, she says, returning to her charming, can't-we-all-be-reasonable tone. "I would hope that those people who don't agree with me have room for me in their party."
To make sure that they do, to persuade them to, is why Whitman makes trips like the one to North Dakota to support like-minded Republicans like Schafer and to drive home the point, with her presence more than her words, that the pendulum is ready to swing away from the right and to stop more or less where she is standing.
In 1996, where the pendulum stops could mean success or failure for the Republican Party. For Dole to win, says Roger Stone, a Dole campaign adviser and a veteran of all three of Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaigns, his party has to be seen as a compassionate party that cares about people. "You've got to demonstrate that there's a diversity of opinion in the party and that we tolerate diverse views," he says. Whitman "is conservative where the country is conservative," adds Stone, who, not incidentally, is making a case with others in the campaign for her selection as the Vice-Presidential nominee, despite her telephone call. "It is where the party should be, too."
After 1996, the track of the pendulum could mean success or failure of a more personal kind. Only if she is right, and her party is what she is betting it is, will she get a chance at another job, one that is not available at the moment but will probably be open in 2000. If you ask her if she plans to run for President, she shrugs, smiles and says: "I don't have the fire in my belly right now to be anything other than what I am. I honestly have not thought about it." But ask those who are close to her, those who are watching her closely, those who have a front-row perspective because they are closer to home, and the answer is yes, that certainly looks like what Christie Whitman wants.
"I honestly believe that she is most interested in being President," says Stephen A. Salmore, a New Jersey consultant to Republican candidates. "That's her real goal."
State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a former head of the New Jersey State Democratic Party, agrees. "Her long-range plan," he says, "is to be the savior of the Republicans, after they've seen the error of their ways."
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN MIGHT NEVER have been born were it not for the Republican Party. Her parents, Eleanor Schley Todd and Webster Bray Todd Sr., met after all four of her grandparents got together during a Republican National Convention and speculated that their children might be a good match.
There is probably not a family in the country with Republican roots deeper than Whitman's. Her maternal grandfather, a banker and Mayor of Far Hills, was a chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Finance Committee. Her paternal grandfather, a builder who oversaw construction of Colonial Williamsburg and Rockefeller Center, was also a chairman of the Republican State Finance Committee. Her maternal grandmother was a New Jersey National Committeewoman for nearly 20 years and the chairwoman of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.
Her parents were even more involved in politics than their parents had been. Her father, who was the chairman of the Republican State Committee for 11 years, knew personally every Republican President since Dwight Eisenhower. Her mother, who attended every Republican convention between 1940 and 1976, was the chairwoman of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women and was a Republican National Committeewoman for 10 years. During the 1950's, The Star-Ledger of Newark ran an article speculating on who might be qualified to run if New Jersey were to elect a female governor. Whitman's mother made the list.
Politics, not surprisingly, was one of two central themes of Whitman's childhood. The other was horses. Born on Sept. 26, 1946, Whitman grew up at Pontefract, a 232-acre working farm with woodlands and a swimming pool, in a neighborhood of farms and estates. Young Christie -- no one ever seems to have called her Christine -- learned to hunt and fish there and to milk a cow, mow a field, bale hay. Today it is still her home, where she raised her own children, Kate, now 19 and a college freshman, and Taylor, 17, a prep-school junior.
When she was 6, her parents were among those who persuaded Eisenhower to run for President, and when Richard Nixon, Eisenhower's Vice-Presidential nominee, made a campaign stop in New Jersey, young Christie and her even-younger friend and neighbor, Steve Forbes, presented Pat Nixon with dolls for Julie and Tricia. When she was 9, she attended her first Republican National Convention, where her mother was active on the organizing committee. While Eisenhower gave his acceptance speech, Christie stood under the podium and clutched a leather golf-tee holder, which she had sewn, and she handed it to the President as he left.
In 1960, a political veteran at the age of 13, she had a philosophical crisis. Going door-to-door with her mother, collecting signatures for Nixon, she began to worry that she was a Republican only because her parents were. "It wasn't a popular thing to be a Republican," she remembers of the time, when young people were supposed to be drawn to John F. Kennedy. "But I decided, after looking at it, that yeah, I believed in the approach of solving problems closer to home."
She did rebel a little. In 1964, as a junior in high school, she threw her support not to Barry Goldwater but to Nelson Rockefeller, over the objections of her father, who felt Rockefeller was too liberal. "We had some heated discussions at the dining-room table," she says. It is a choice she still finds herself defending. At one point during this year's primaries, when Whitman's name was being widely mentioned as a potential Vice-Presidential candidate, Buchanan sneered that he would walk away from a convention that would give that nomination to an abortion-rights supporter and "Rockefeller Republican." Her reaction to that attack is mostly amused, but also defensive.
"I don't regret it for an instant," she says. "My image of Nelson Rockefeller is as someone with whom people identified. He came through town in an open car, and men ran out of a barbershop with lather still on their faces just to wave at this guy. And he really cared about people and you could see it. That's what I mean when I say 'Rockefeller Republican.' I hope I stand for that same connection with people."
After graduating from Wheaton College in 1968 with a degree in government, Whitman spent several months working for Rockefeller's second bid for the Presidential nomination. This time around, her father was supporting him, too. When the nomination went to Nixon, she found a job in Washington, and one day, when her father was in town, he invited her to tag along to a state party luncheon with Rogers Morton, the new head of the Republican National Committee.
Somewhere between salad and dessert, Whitman, not yet a year out of college, told Morton that the Republican Party was not listening closely enough to the needs of the elderly, the newly enfranchised youth and minority groups. As she remembers it, she told Morton, "I'd like to go around and find out from people in these groups what the party can do to attract them."
At the party's expense, she spent three months traveling to 16 cities in seven states and talking with 350 people. The report she helped to put together in 1970 is striking in its conclusions. Twenty-six years ago, Whitman was telling her party much the same thing she is telling it today -- become more diverse and include more points of view "if we want to continue as a viable party."
It is almost too perfect that Whitman's own marriage came about because of the Republican Party. For a few years after she wrote her report -- which, she says, was put in a drawer somewhere and never acted upon -- she worked for the Republican National Committee and then for the Nixon re-election campaign. She needed a date for Nixon's inaugural ball in 1973, and she asked John Whitman, an acquaintance from New York. A young banker at the time, Whitman was the son of a Republican New York City judge, Charles Whitman Jr., and the grandson of a former Republican New York Governor, Charles Whitman Sr. The couple were married a year later.
Sometime before they were married, they discussed their future. "Our marriage vows," her husband has joked, "should have said 'in sickness and in health and in politics.' "
Whitman is careful to say that she and John did not sit down in 1974 and sketch a path to the state house. "It wasn't 'I'll run for this, and then I'll be appointed to that, and then I'll be Governor,' " she says. "You just can't do that in politics. You've got to take advantage of the opportunities when they open up for you."
But though it might not have been a plan, it was always a possibility. "I always knew I was going to be involved in politics," she says, weighing her words, seeming not to want this anecdote to make her look calculating and ambitious. "John always wants to 'go for the gold,' as he says. And we talked about it in just kind of a general way that the ultimate thing would be Governor if that were ever possible. Did I always in the back of my mind think being Governor would be the greatest job in the world? Yes. I thought it would be wonderful."
Her friends, however, are not quite as guarded. "She did want to be Governor from the beginning," says one of her oldest friends, Nancy Risque Rohrbach. "She won't say it that way, but she always knew what she wanted to be."
IN THE HOURS BEFORE WHITMAN'S PLANE landed in Bismarck, the main hall of the Civic Center filled slowly as delegates trickled in. Speakers came and went on the podium, where they stood before the huge, bobbing elephant constructed of red, white and blue balloons and took care of party business. Some delegates paid attention, while others wandered among the dozens of folding tables set along the back walls of the room, staffed with believers and stacked with pamphlets: "Buchanan for President." "Dole in '96." "Dina Butcher for Ag Commissioner."
At the table for the North Dakota Christian Coalition, the central piece of literature read: "Governor Whitman is a tall, elegant woman with style who claims to be a Rockefeller Republican. Newsweek calls her the purest example of a Volvo Republican -- trendy and on the road. In the mid-1960's she joined a demonstration . . . to protest the arrest of birth-control activist Bil Baird. The 'old line feminist' now calls on the G.O.P. to remove the anti-abortion plank from the party platform."
The party Whitman's grandparents helped shape has grown decidedly more conservative. In 1976, 48 percent of delegates to the Republican National Convention identified themselves as "conservative," and in 1992, 63 percent chose that description. In exit polls so far this year, 21 percent of Republican primary voters described themselves as "very conservative" and 37 percent as "somewhat conservative."
The conservative base is what gave the Republicans the majority in the House and Senate in 1994, for the first time in 40 years. But polls show that voters -- particularly women -- are becoming alarmed by some of the actions of those they sent to Congress two years ago. A New York Times/CBS poll last month found that if Congressional elections were held today, women would favor Democrats by a 16-point margin, compared with a 3-point margin in 1994. Similarly, while Clinton and Dole are favored equally among men, Clinton leads Dole by nearly 20 points among women. Because of his weakness with female voters, Dole lags behind Clinton by 10 percent overall.
The need to win back the moderates, and the women, creates an opportunity and a dilemma for Whitman. The single issue that has come to stand for the cluster of issues on which the gender gap is based is abortion. "The abortion issue has become symbolic of the power of the religious political right over the Republican Party," says Tanya Melich, a longtime Republican who writes of her disillusionment with the party's move toward the right in her book, "The Republican War Against Women."
Whitman says the Republican platform would be more inviting to all voters without an anti-abortion plank. In 1992, that plank stated that "the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed" and called for "a human-life amendment to the Constitution" and the "appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life." Such language, Whitman says, must be changed. It need not be replaced by an abortion-rights statement, she says, realistically, but "something that recognizes that you can be pro-choice and still be a good Republican."
"Because of the last convention," she says, "where women really felt that there wasn't a place for them, and where you had Pat Buchanan on prime time saying some things that were pretty divisive, if there isn't some change to the language, it's going to make the job of the candidate so much more difficult going into the fall elections."
But from where she sits, her next move is not as simple as forcing a platform fight at the Republican Convention in San Diego in August and becoming a hero, as many party members who support abortion rights say they expect her to do. It's not that she has doubts on the issue itself. She believes, unequivocally, in a woman's right to choose, a belief so longstanding that the only protest she ever attended was the one in the 1960's, when Bil Baird was arrested for tossing packets of birth-control pills to an audience on a college campus.
As telling as that story is, what's equally important is the fact that she spent most of that protest trying to stay out of the newspaper pictures. "I was like, 'Please, don't let Dad see me. Hold the sign here,' " she recalls, putting her hand in front of her face.
The grown-up Whitman will face the cameras head on and say she supports abortion rights. "I believe it's a very personal decision between a woman and her doctor," she says. "I don't think the Government has any business telling me what to do with my body. It's actually a very conservative position."'
But at the same time, she tries not to say it all the time, for fear of becoming a one-issue candidate. She declined an invitation to serve on the advisory board of the Republican Coalition for Choice, said the group's chairwoman, Susan R. Cullman. When the subject of abortion comes up with members of Whitman's press staff, they are all careful to say, "Remember, abortion is not her central thing." Ask her about it directly and she says: "While it's an issue of importance to me, it's not my major issue. It's not the definition of who I am."
That hesitancy is magnified by the fact that while the majority of American voters are supporters of a woman's right to abortion -- as even the majority of Republican primary voters are -- Bob Dole is not. He has said, through a spokesman, that he "supports a constitutional ban on abortion with exceptions for rape or incest or when the life of the mother is in danger" and that "he will fight for a pro-life plank in the 1996 Republican platform that will reflect the Republican Party's historic commitment to protecting the rights of the unborn."
But the last thing he wants is a brawl over the issue at the convention, which is supposed to be a televised demonstration of party unity. "I don't think Bob Dole wants abortion discussed at the convention," Salmore, the consultant, says. "And I don't think she wants to be the person who defeated Bob Dole because she waged an ugly floor fight in prime time."
So what will she do? Whitman, who can be very precise when she wants to be, is currently being quite vague. "I intend to be part of the discussion," she says. "There are a lot of different ways to skin this cat, and you can do it very quietly." She has not yet spoken to Dole about her views, she says, although she intends to. She is still deciding when the best time would be and whether to do so "by phone or in a letter."
"There are a lot of discussions going on behind the scenes," she says, declining to be more specific. "I don't think it serves anybody's best interests to get into a shouting match if we really want to make a difference."
It is hard to imagine, however, that the shouting can be avoided. If the "behind the scenes" discussions somehow result in an agreement to eliminate the plank, then Buchanan has pledged to make a lot of noise. "I'm going to San Diego," he told a cheering audience last month, "and if you think you're going to take that plank out of there, I'll tell some of those liberals up in Washington, 'You're going to have to come over me and my people.' "
And if, as is more likely, the discussions fail and the language remains, there will be another kind of fight. Groups like Cullman's have sworn not to go quietly in the name of unity, and a few politicians, most recently George Pataki, the New York Governor, who also has close ties to Dole, say they will push the issue, too. They assume Whitman will join them. She probably will.
"If there comes a point where there's going to be a floor fight, I'll be there," she says. But the statement clearly troubles her. As strongly as she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes just as strongly in the Republican Party, and the trick here, as in everything else she does lately, is to find a way of supporting one without jeopardizing or abandoning the other.
THE PLANNERS OF THIS YEAR'S ST. Patrick's Day parade in Somerville, N.J., decided -- poorly, as it turned out -- to place Whitman behind the float of the parade's main sponsor. As a result, the crowd's view of the Governor was blocked by a huge, tethered, hot-air balloon that urged, "Reach High With Summit Bank." Most onlookers could not see her until she had all but walked past, at which point they yelled, "Hi, Christie!" and "Come back here, Christie!" So she detoured to the curb and shook countless hands, slowing the parade to her pace.
She was having a wonderful time. She has long had a soft spot for Somerville; it was where she first held elective office, in 1982. In the years before that, she had become a trustee of a local community college and a member of the Upper Raritan Watershed Association, and with time, she let the local party leaders know that she would be interested in bigger things.
Then the county chairman asked her to run for the Board of Freeholders of Somerset County, of which Somerville is the seat. Even she credits her family's name for her nomination. Whitman served one three-year term, was re-elected and served two years of that second term. She left in 1988, when Gov. Tom Kean appointed her to the three-member Board of Public Utilities, where she stayed until 1989, when she decided to run for the United States Senate.
She planned that next step much the way she does everything else -- methodically, analytically and with an eye on the long-term goal. "I'd really come to the conclusion that I wanted to get back to elected office," she says, adding that the "presumption" was she would run for a vacant Congressional seat in her district.
"I knew that I could win that," she says, but adds: "I didn't have the patience for that kind of legislative process on the House side. I didn't want to have to get into office and immediately have to start to run again, with an election in two years.
"So I looked at it and said, 'O.K., if I want to be taken seriously, if I want people to know that I do want to be in this ball game, I've got to run for something.' I said, 'Look, why not run for the seat that I'd at least like to have, which is the Senate?' "
The race was hers without a primary because no other Republicans thought they had a chance. The two-term incumbent was Bill Bradley -- Princeton all-America, Rhodes scholar, former star forward of the New York Knicks, a formidable fund raiser who had won his previous race with 64 percent of the vote, even while Reagan won the state.
"I knew it was a long shot," Whitman says. "But I looked at it as a golden opportunity. It would give me statewide exposure. It would be a lie to say I didn't realize this was a good way to prepare" for a gubernatorial race. What no one knew, however, was that Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, would incur the voters' wrath by increasing taxes by $2.8 billion and that Bradley's refusal to condemn, or even comment on, that increase (a decision he now describes as a mistake) would become the dominant issue of the Bradley-Whitman campaign. "Get Florio. Dump Bradley," pro-Whitman bumper stickers read, and the voters almost did, giving Bradley a third term by only 50 percent of the vote.
Nearly all analysts believe Whitman would have won had she received enough support from her own party. It is a subject that still rankles her. Bradley outspent Whitman $12 million to $1 million, and the Republican National Senatorial Committee gave her $420,000 for her race, $180,000 less than it had promised. The state Republican Party, which her father and both grandfathers had run, donated $5,000. George Bush, whom her mother considered a friend and for whom her mother had given fund raisers at Pontefract when he ran in '80 and in '88, would not go to New Jersey to campaign for her.
GOVERNOR SCHAFER AND HIS WIFE MET THE Whitmans' plane (on loan from the Republican National Committee) at the airport and rarely left their side after that. Bringing such a big name to such a small state was a coup for the Schafers, and they escorted the Whitmans to Bismarck's Civic Center, where 200 people had paid $250 apiece to support Schafer's re-election bid and to shake Whitman's hand. An hour later, the hosts guided the guests of honor into a room where 900 people had paid $96 each to support the state's Republican Party, to eat three kinds of starch donated by Dakota Growers Pasta and to shake Whitman's hand.
The next morning, Schafer introduced Whitman to the 1,250 delegates in the convention hall. He said that in 1993, "Christie Whitman made a campaign promise to lower New Jersey's income tax by 30 percent. Two years later she fulfilled that promise." As he shook her hand himself, the crowd cheered with an enthusiasm that Whitman is getting used to.
Whitman is a star in the Republican Party because she kept a campaign promise. Wherever she goes, she is introduced as she was in North Dakota, as the Governor who kept her word. What is forgotten in all the applause is that she was a last-minute convert to the tax-cut cause, unveiling her plan only weeks before Election Day, in a desperate attempt to save her campaign.
While everything seemed to go her way during her race against Bradley, nothing did in her fight with Florio. She was criticized for everything. Some of the attacks were over things she did: she had hired two illegal aliens to care for her home and her children. (She was spared on that issue only because her primary opponent had committed the same offense, as had one of Florio's top aides.) Other criticism was caused by what she said: while defending a homestead rebate program that gave a maximum of $500 to property owners, she noted that "as funny as it seems, $500 is a lot."
So, six weeks before Election Day, when the most favorable polls showed the race to be dead even and the least favorable said she was 9 points behind, she proposed a 30 percent tax cut -- 10 percent a year for three years -- for taxpayers with total taxable income of not more than $80,000. Developed in part by Steve Forbes, it was supposed to be the single stroke to turn the voters around, but one week after she announced it, polls showed she was losing by 21 points. Florio dubbed the plan a "voodoo redo," economists said it was vague and ill advised and even members of her own party described the tax cut as unlikely to happen. Now pollsters were finding that voters saw her not only as rich and removed but also as dishonest.
Indirectly, however, the proposal did have a revivifying effect. It brought the focus back to Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, where it had been during the Bradley race, and because Whitman had nothing to lose, it made her more relaxed when she campaigned. Slowly her numbers began to improve. On the Sunday before Election Day, Dole campaigned with her from morning to night. That Tuesday, she beat Florio by one percentage point.
Whitman saw the election as a tax-cut mandate, and minutes after she was sworn in as the 13th female governor in the history of the country and the first female Governor of New Jersey, she started to keep her promise. She announced that she would ask the Legislature to make the first stage of the tax cut retroactive to Jan. 1, which was 17 days before her inauguration. In effect, it was a numbers game -- instead of a 10 percent cut effective in July, she was asking for a 5 percent cut effective all year. "I said I would put $1.4 billion of your tax dollars back in your pocket," she said, in the quiet, understated tone that she uses in speeches as well as in conversation. "Why wait until the next fiscal year starts in July? . . . Let's not keep economic growth waiting another minute."
When Whitman unveiled her first budget in March, there were more surprises. In spite of a drop in revenues because of the tax cut, there were few corresponding drops in spending. The proposed budget was about 1 percent smaller than the final budget of the Florio administration, and most of the nearly $2 billion gap she inherited was to be closed by fiscal maneuvering, particularly by changing the funding formulas and reducing the amount the state contributed to the pension and benefit funds of state workers. The latter device, she argues, is not as risky as it can be made to sound, because, she says, the pension funds were overfi-nanced.
Groups like the New Jersey Education Association and the Communications Workers of America, the state's two largest public-employee unions, disagree. The Whitman changes are a time bomb set to detonate more than a decade from now, they say, when there will not be enough money to pay promised benefits. "What the Governor calls pension reform jeopardizes the security of hundreds of thousands of workers," says Lynn Maher, a spokeswoman for the education association. "And when it crashes, she won't be here."
Whitman responds that she is confident of the analysis of her actuaries, that the pension system is adequately financed, and she is unconcerned by the analysis of other actuaries that it is not. "Sure, you can say 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, maybe the world is going to come to an end, and something bad might happen," she says. "But you know, everything might not come to an end and it might be good."
Most of the state's voters, as well as most of the Legislature, seemed equally unconcerned. The budget passed easily and attention followed. Dole told Mirabella magazine, "Christine Whitman is a rising star in the party, with virtually unlimited potential." People magazine listed her as one of the 25 Most Intriguing People of 1994.
A good soldier during the 1994 midyear elections, she campaigned for 22 candidates all over the country -- many of whom had views she disagreed with -- and raised $3.5 million. Eighteen of those candidates won. In January 1995 she delivered her second budget address to the Legislature, saying she would schedule the last third of her tax cut a year ahead of schedule. The next day, she delivered the Republicans' response to President Clinton's State of the Union message, the first woman and the first governor to do so. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had selected Whitman, said "she is clearly just a very articulate and attractive advocate of our cause." Everyone politely ignored the fact that when she is asked if she would have signed the Contract With America had she been running for Congress, she says: "I don't usually sign things like that. I don't get into that kind of stuff."
ON A RECENT Saturday morning, Whitman awoke early, dressed in hunting camouflage and waded through thigh-deep snow near the Delaware Water Gap, looking for bears. For the third time since she took office, she was joining the state's park rangers to place ear tags on the bear cubs born during the winter. There were no paths on this trip; even so, she easily kept pace with the rangers as they located a still-hibernating mother bear who was wearing a radio collar, approached her silently from behind and immobilized her with a syringe attached to a long metal pole.
Then, as the rangers weighed, measured and poked at the grown-up bear, Whitman did what she had come to do. She swaddled the pink-nosed cub inside her jacket so only the cub's head peered out. "It's fun being Governor," she would say later in the day. "The bennies," as in benefits, "of this job are great. I've gone up in an F-16. I've driven a Humvee, a Cobra helicopter." And when the New Jersey Devils won the Stanley Cup, "we went down on the ice."
The cub stayed in her coat for quite a while but at one point reached up and cut her on the lip with a tiny but impressive claw. "Bear mauls Governor," she joked, unfazed, making no move to wipe at the slight stream of blood. "Are you a Democrat?" she asked the cub.
In the year and a half since her State of the Union response, Christie Whitman has suffered a few political scratches. Her tax cut, while still hailed as a promise kept, has not solved the state's financial problems. When she introduced the plan during the campaign, she said it was designed to bring 450,000 jobs to New Jersey, the number of jobs she estimates were lost to Florio's policies. So far, however, the state has seen an increase of 116,000 jobs, one-fourth of which, critics say, are in the retail trade category that economists label "eating and drinking," meaning fast-food workers and table waiters.
"Those are hardly the kinds of jobs you would want to create to underpin a strong economy," said Neil Upmeyer, president of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Analysis of Public Issues. Whitman agrees, to a point. "As far as the mix is concerned, you always want higher-paying jobs," she says. "But I do believe you also need entry-level jobs, because you're not going to move people off of welfare and into middle-level management."
She has also been the object of sharp criticism for her environmental policies. Whitman identifies herself as an environmentalist. She clearly glories in the outdoors, and shortly before she started her hike to find the bears, she stood in the snow with the park rangers and talked about the laws of nature and the fact that the coyotes around Pontefract are trying to kill her sheep.
She does not believe, however, that love of nature and respect for the environment are incompatible with easing toxic-cleanup restrictions and cutting the budget of the Department of Environmental Protection. Those actions, among others, led a coalition of 18 environmental lobbying groups to give her some failing grades on a "Midterm Report Card on the Whitman Administration and the Environment," released early this year.
She is angry at the slap from a group she claims to feel kinship with, on an issue that New Jersey voters feel particularly strongly about. But the environmental lobby, she says, will have to accept the fact that the rules of engagement have changed. "Environmental protection doesn't have to be confrontational with business," she says. "Confrontation is the way they carved out their niche in life. But it is not the only way."
Lately, as she gets closer to the end of this first term, there are also signs that the Legislature, which in 1994 was willing to pass her tax cut before she had even unveiled her budget, is not as eager to grant whatever Whitman might ask. Last year, for instance, neither the State Senate nor the Assembly, both with Republican majorities, even voted on her proposal to rescue the failing charity health-care system by increasing the tax the state collects on cigarettes.
The Legislature's new willingness to take on the Governor is either a reflection or a cause of a dip in her job-approval ratings that is beginning to show up in opinion polls. It is possible to make too much of the change. She still has favorable ratings that would thrill most politicians. But whereas in February 1995, the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University found that 56 percent of voters thought she was doing an "excellent" or "good" job, by this Febuary, the figure had dropped to 49 percent.
Shortly after this last poll was being taken, Cliff Zukin, an Eagleton professor of political science who conducts focus groups for The Record, a Hackensack newspaper, was listening to a group of voters, who were supposed to be talking about the Presidential election. They started discussing Christie Whitman instead. They were not pleased with her, nor was a second group that Zukin gathered a week later.
"The tax cut is starting to turn against her," Zukin said. "They feel there's no follow-up to the tax cut. The rest of the country is wowed by it, but here there was a feeling that there was no second act."
Or maybe the fact that the rest of the country is "wowed" is the problem. During the session, Zukin asked, "Does she have an agenda?" meaning, he says, "Does she have a clear idea of what she wants to do for New Jersey?" The group reacted with sarcastic chuckles. "Yeah, she has an agenda," Zukin says they answered. "She has her own agenda."
WHITMAN DID NOT SPEAK long in North Dakota. Shorter, she has learned, gets you invited back. Through much of her 20-minute speech, George Schubert, a professor from Grand Forks, nodded energetically, causing his Uncle Sam stovepipe hat to bounce on his head.
"She's young, mature, vibrant, a go-getter," he said. "She's going places."
Around the audience, the reaction was generally the same. "When they say, 'What kind of Republican are you?' I say, 'I'm a Christie Whitman Republican,' " said Ellie Schafer, the Governor's 28-year-old-daughter, not at all apologetic about slighting her own father with that declaration.
"She's the future of the party," gushed Sandi Tabor, executive director of the State Bar Association of North Dakota. "I was disappointed when she took herself out of consideration for Vice President."
Whitman says she carefully thought about how she would phrase things when she placed her phone call to Bob Dole: "I didn't want to sound like a conceited, pushy broad, saying, 'I know you have a list and I'm sure I'm at the top of it, but no thanks.' Nor did I want it to seem personal, like a decision against him."
The words she says she decided on were: "I know there's probably no list at all, but I just wanted you to know that I absolutely mean what I have been saying about wanting to remain here doing the job I'm doing. This is not a reflection on you, or on your campaign, and I wish you every success, but I love being Governor."
Dole's response, she says, was: "No, I don't have a list. They're telling me I ought to have one. I appreciate your call."
The reason she decided to make the call, her aides say, was that the speculation about her place in the Vice-Presidential sweepstakes was getting in the way of everything else she was trying to do. "Everywhere she went," says her chief of staff, Peter Verniero, "every press conference she held, all people asked was the question."
But as with every high-profile political decision, there is talk that it was more complicated than that. First, there is the question of whether she really meant it. Forbes, whose aides hint he is still annoyed at Whitman for telling the press he should drop out of the Presidential race before she told him, says she took herself out of the running only "theoretically," adding, "I'm sure if Senator Dole calls, she wouldn't turn him down."
Which leads to the question of whether she would have been offered the job at all. Roger Stone, the Dole adviser, says she not only did have a chance but still does. Others disagree.
"Given Dole's age, the person who becomes the Vice-Presidential nominee really is the representative of the Republican Party in the 21st century," says Tanya Melich. The religious right, she says, is "not going to let an independent-minded woman who is pro-choice become the leader."
Lyn Nofziger, a former Reagan aide and a friend of Whitman's who helped her with her gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns, says, "I don't think that anyone's going to ask her to be the Vice President, because I don't think the party is moving in her direction."
If no one was going to ask her to be Vice President, the theory goes, Whitman acted to turn down the nomination before Dole could turn her down, a political move with its own benefits. "Look at the league she puts herself in," Stone says. "Look at the only two people in the country who are issuing statements taking themselves out of the running" he adds, referring to Colin Powell.
Then there's the argument that even if the nomination were offered, accepting it would be a political misstep. "With only two years in office, she is vulnerable to questions of experience," says Zukin. "If she completes a term or two, that's less of an issue."
If that is the plan -- to wait until her experience catches up with her ambitions -- it requires a faith in her policies, a belief that they will help her rather than blow up in her face in four years. And Whitman has no shortage of faith in herself. "I don't second-guess myself," she says. "I make a decision carefully, and I am comfortable with it."
It also requires a belief that given four more years to wrestle with its identity, her party will have nudged itself a little farther toward the middle. Whitman seems to have that belief, too. "Margaret Thatcher once told me: 'Political parties are like a bird. They have a right wing and a left wing, but the heart and the brains are in the center.' "
Finally, such a plan also requires forethought and patience, and the same woman who decided 20 years ago that the Governor's mansion was a reasonable goal doesn't seem to lack those qualities, either.
Does she think she would be a good Vice President?
"Yes," she says. "I could do that job."
"President?"
"I think I need more experience before I step up to that."
What does she plan to do when she's finished being Governor?
 "There are times I think, 'Gee, I'd love to just go off with the kids. I think of all the places I'd love to travel.' "
Travel? Not run for President? She leans forward in her chair, as if to tell a secret. And she almost does.
"There are times, there's a twinge, when people say, 'Don't you get mad that the only time they mention you is for Vice President, while all the guys are talked about as President?' And I'll think, 'Yeah.' I'll think, 'Why not?' "

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 5 about Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, which discussed her support of abortion rights, referred incorrectly to the 1967 arrest of a birth control advocate in Massachusetts, and misspelled his given name. He is Bill Baird, not Bil. He was arrested on charges of providing a college student with birth control devices -- it was illegal in Massachusetts to distribute such devices to unmarried people -- not for tossing packets of birth control pills to an audience on a college campus.

HEADLINE: Patents;
Backyard summer heat got you down? Feeling as if you're in a daze? Hey, get into a fog instead.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
IF the backyard is too sweltering for a barbecue this summer or the state fair offers no respite from the sun, never fear -- two California inventors have patented a device that can cool a hot day.
Mark Hensley and Michael Jones invented a system that reduces the heat outside with fog made from water that is sprayed along with forced air into outdoor areas. They say the mercury will dive as much as 25 degrees, even in humid areas, and without getting people wet. 
 When the system is working, it looks as if spray nozzles are directing streams of fog into outdoor space. The temperature is lowered because an exchange of heat takes place between the evaporating fog and the outside air. The fog evaporates even in humid areas because forced air coming from the system increases the volume of dry air outside.
"The use of fog or mist for evaporative cooling has been around for 50 years," said Jim Nagourney, president of Cool Zone Products and Promotions Inc., the California company that holds the patent. "But it never worked outside desert areas. If you have 70 percent humidity, there's not a lot of room left for that air to absorb water. If you add water to the air where there is already water in the air from humidity, it can't evaporate."
The Cool Zone system eliminates that problem by adding dry air to the atmosphere.
"That does three things," Mr. Nagourney said. "It increases the total volume of air in a given space, it helps spread the fog so one area is not just saturated with water, and it causes more rapid evaporation."
"So it cools without dampness," he added.
The invention uses a high-pressure pump to force water through a hose and out a series of nozzles placed at intervals along the hose. The water can be ordinary tap water. The nozzles reduce the water to a fog so fine that the unit goes through only a gallon and a half of water an hour. Encircling each nozzle are air holes. Forced air is pumped from those holes as fog is sprayed from the nozzle.
"After the combination of fog and air travels about six to eight feet, all the fog evaporates and the air is cooled," Mr. Nagourney said. That means the nozzles must be placed at least six feet away from people. The system can cool a radius of about 10 to 20 feet, he added, and operates with about one-fifth the energy required for a conventional air-conditioner. It cools only as long as it is running -- there is no cumulative effect.
The company has designed a 7-foot tall backyard model with a pump in its base and a tube that inflates to 19 inches in diameter. The tower-like unit has fog nozzles and air holes around its circumference.
"In about a year we'll get to the point where we can economically produce these towers for backyard use," Mr. Nagourney predicted. "If you put that unit on your patio, within 15 feet in any direction the temperature would drop 25 degrees using an ordinary garden hose and a 110 outlet."
For now, however, the company is focusing on selling its system to factories where workers need spot cooling. One pump can generate cooling fog for several hose-and-nozzle units. Cool Zone has also licensed the system to the Coca-Cola Bottling Company for exclusive use at Coke operations in amusement parks, festivals and zoos. Mr. Hensley and Mr. Jones received patent 5,497,633.

The Look of Neon Without the Cost
The bright, colorful sign on the pastry department at the supermarket may not be neon, but dry gel on a panel. A Canadian company has patented a sign-making system using a luminous gel that it says glows as brightly as neon at a fraction of the cost.
"It's an acrylic gel, a liquid plastic that is fluorescent," said Michael Ivezic, chairman and chief executive of Luminart Inc. The gel, called Luminite, comes in three forms, each with 10 colors -- a fluorescent designed for use with black lights and indoor- and outdoor-quality versions.
"It has the consistency of toothpaste and is an ultraviolet-curable material," Mr. Ivezic said. "You have the ability to create intricate graphics and patterns with the gel. It will stay in its soft state until exposed to ultraviolet light and then it cures to a hard, durable plastic."
When light is shined from behind the hardened gel, it glows like neon.
"The light passes through the Luminite and gives it that unique glow," Mr. Ivezic said. "The material doesn't have its own glow or light-retaining characteristics. It needs a light source to work."
Mr. Ivezic said Wal-Mart reported a 30 percent increase in sales in departments where Luminite signs were used.
Luminart has already sold Luminite sign-making equipment around the world. The company received patent 5,512,122.
Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

HEADLINE: An After-School Job That's Not Kids' Stuff;
Wanted: Web Designers and Programmers; $25/hr.; Need Parents' Consent

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: BROOKLINE, Mass.

 BODY:
When the school day ends at 2:15 P.M., Jascha Franklin-Hodge ambles out of the red-brick edifice of Brookline High School and makes the uphill trek on Tappan Street, heading for work. In another time, his after-school job probably would have been delivering newspapers or pumping gas.
But the 17-year-old junior in high school works at a local Internet access company, Software Tool and Die Inc., doing programming and maintenance for $8 an hour and unlimited Internet time. At school, Mr. Franklin-Hodge has learned French, but he has taught himself the vernaculars of computing like Basic, C, Perl and Java. He speaks of computer languages with the familiarity of a carpenter discussing his hammer and saw. "They're like a box of tools," he said, "and you have to choose the tool that is most effective for the job at hand." 
 Mr. Franklin-Hodge also runs a popular site on the World Wide Web, called Laughweb, a smorgasbord of jokes plucked off the Internet. That's for fun, but besides working for the local Internet company he has done contract jobs, for $15 to $25 an hour, that range from computer repairs to sophisticated programming assignments. His tax return for 1995 listed income of $6,000.
As computing has been transformed in the last generation, from the microprocessor to the World Wide Web, the youngest segment of the industry's work force has undergone a transformation as well. Young people with impressive computer skills are no longer simply prodigies, pushed, like young musicians or gymnasts, to excel at an early age. They have moved into the mainstream and their numbers are rising steadily. Mr. Franklin-Hodge is one of many teen-agers who labor on the entrepreneurial fringes of the information age.
Since the 1970's, there have been precocious young computer enthusiasts looking to make money from their skills. And the handful of teen-age success stories, like William H. Gates of the Microsoft Corporation and Michael Dell of the Dell Computer Corporation, both college dropouts at 19, are part of the industry's folklore.
Yet today's high-tech youth movement, by all accounts, is a broader phenomenon, as more young people become computer literate and as the reach of personal computers and the Internet grows. "There are lots of kids doing this kind of part-time work now," said Dennis Allison, a programmer who teaches software engineering at Stanford University. "The level of skill and comfort that young people have with computers today is much greater."
For the young people, the jobs are more fun and generally pay better than working at McDonald's or the corner gas station. For companies, especially small ones, teen-agers offer a bargain-basement work force to experiment with new but unproven high-tech forays like putting up a company Web site.
"Sure, these young people come cheaper," Mr. Allison said. "But this is also a new medium and these young people are the ones who really understand this medium. It's a generational thing."
Advances in technology like multimedia, which includes graphics, music and artwork, have also made computing more appealing and accessible to more young people. Traditionally, computer software has attracted people skilled in "minute precision thinking," noted Seymour Papert, the Lego professor of learning research at the M.I.T. Media Lab. "But it's becoming more flexible and suiting people with different cognitive styles."
Rachael Cannara, an 18-year-old senior at Menlo School, a private high school in Atherton, Calif., developed a taste for computing only recently, even though her mother is an executive at a computer software company. Yet an interest in astrophysics forced her to become familiar with computing, because her senior project has been to make a multimedia textbook about the search for habitable planets.
For the project, Ms. Cannara has had to master the rudiments of multimedia software and hypertext, which links pages of related text and graphics. She says she has enjoyed her labors, and they have paid off. She has landed a summer job making an educational CD-ROM for NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.
As computing has become more diverse, its image has been altered among teen-agers. The stereotypical notions of "nerds" and "geeks" are passe to the Nintendo generation. Today, students immersed in computers are called "techies" and they may well dress in black, or wear Doc Marten boots and sport ponytails as Mr. Franklin-Hodge does. It is a far cry from the days of the plastic pocket protector.
"When I was younger, people who were really into computers were considered weird," Mr. Franklin-Hodge said. "But that's not true anymore. The Internet has made all this cool."
The explosive growth of the Internet has also opened up the industry to teen-agers in a way not seen for more than a decade, when the personal computer business was starting to take off. The demand for Web sites and other Internet software is enormous, and fulfilling that demand is often best done by skilled individuals instead of large companies.
"Whenever there is a huge shift in the industry, it creates opportunities for new people, and age isn't a barrier," said Will Harvey, who was once a precocious techie.
To Mr. Harvey, who is now 29, the situation today has a familiar look. He got into computing as a teen-ager in the early 1980's, taking money from his paper route to buy an Apple II and writing his first program, a grade-tracking data base for teachers, when he was 15.
Those were the scrappy "zip-lock" days of the software business, he recalled, before shrink-wrap packaging, when many applications programs were published on shoestring budgets. Mr. Harvey sold his first program, a simple music notation product called Music Construction Set, to a big company, Electronic Arts Inc., when he was 16.
For years afterward, Mr. Harvey was a contract game designer mainly for Electronic Arts, earning a six-figure annual income since he was 18. He continued his education, and recently received his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University. Today, he has a two-bedroom condominium in Palo Alto, a Mercedes in the garage and a small Internet software start-up company, called Sandcastle.
Now an industry veteran, Mr. Harvey recalls his entrepreneurial teen-age years with fondness. For him, as for today's teen-agers, the appeal of computing was in the satisfactions of craftsmanship, building something that is logical and controllable. His parents, both professionals, were aware of his interest, he said, but never prodded him. "I think you'll find that most kids push themselves," he said. "Computing isn't like baseball or figure skating, where the parents think they know a lot about it."
Indeed, there is a digital generation gap in many such families. Parental reaction ranges from amusement to amazement, but there is often scant comprehension. Dustin Rodriguez is a 17-year-old high school junior who lives in Moundsville, W. Va. He programs in Basic, Assembly and is working with C.
Mr. Rodriguez earns about $60 a week, working after school for a local mail service company. He has written a program to automate the company's billing, accounting and data base ledgers, and he has also fashioned Web pages for businesses.
Mr. Rodriguez lives in what was traditionally a coal-mining region, which suffers from high unemployment as it struggles to find new industries. His father, Larry, works in a chemical factory, and his mother, Susan, works in a greenhouse. Their son's interest was stimulated by a computer literacy program at the Moundsville Junior High School. "We didn't encourage Dustin at all," Mrs. Rodriguez said. "My husband and I don't know much about computers. What he does just amazes us."
The business side of being a teen-age computer consultant can be daunting. Age may not be a barrier to getting into the business, but it can limit the compensation. "People take one look at me, and they figure they're not going to pay this kid $50 an hour," said Benjamin Kallos, a 15-year-old at the Bronx High School of Science, an elite public school in New York City.
So the high school sophomore, whose home page on the Web proclaims "Kallos Consulting" in bold red letters, charges $15 or $20 an hour.
Some businesses in New York seem to regard the high school as a job shop for Web site work. Steve Kalin, an assistant principal, says small companies occasionally call the school looking for a student to make Web pages, and more are calling all the time.
"Even the kind of kids who would have worked on the school newspaper in the past are often more interested in electronic publishing now," Mr. Kalin said. "They're making Web sites."
In Phoenix, Laurence Hartje, a 15-year-old sophomore at Thunderbird High School, has taken on a partner to help with price negotiations -- his father, Will. "I think businesses feel more comfortable with an adult there," the teen-ager explained.
At 13, Mr. Hartje became a certified product specialist for Windows, the popular Microsoft operating system, by passing a standard test given by the company. The certification amounts to corporate approval that Mr. Hartje is a Windows expert.
Recently, he has begun making Web pages, including a site for a local travel company to advertise tour packages. And at 15, Mr. Hartje is concerned about upgrading his skills to stay in step with market demand. So he is learning Java, a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems that can add animation to Web sites.
"If I continue to develop Web sites, Java will be very important for me," Mr. Hartje said.
In this fast-changing field, it is perhaps only natural that today's skilled teen-agers must worry not only about new technologies but also about competition from an aspiring crop of younger newcomers. Like Jeremy Liebs, a 12-year-old sixth grader from San Mateo, Calif. He has done some programming, and says he has thought about making money from it but hasn't yet.
His father, David, is a software programmer and recognizes the early flair that his son has displayed. "I'm certainly not pushing him to be a programmer," Mr. Liebs said. "But I suppose the thing we've got to guard against is him quitting school at 16 or 17 to go off and make money in the industry."

HEADLINE: MAJOR CRIMES FELL IN '95, EARLY DATA BY F.B.I. INDICATE

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Serious crimes dropped across the nation in 1995 for the fourth consecutive year, led by an 8 percent decrease in homicides, according to preliminary figures released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
President Clinton was quick to issue a statement taking some credit for the decline. "Because of our tough and smart decisions to put more cops on the street and get kids, guns and drugs off the street, we are now beginning to reverse the trend in violent crime," Mr. Clinton said. 
 But some experts cautioned that the reasons for the drop are unclear and that it is still too early to conclude whether the country has finally broken out of a pattern of consistently high crime rates since an explosion of violence in the late 1960's.
Among the possible explanations for the recent decline are more aggressive police tactics, an increase in the number of criminals in prison and a stabilization of turf battles between drug dealers that began with the epidemic of crack cocaine.
The experts also warned that the new figures, while heartening, mask a continued rapid rise in violent crime among young people that could soon lead to an increase in crime rates because the number of teen-agers in the population is expected to grow 20 percent in the next decade.
"I think we can now say a trend has been established," said James Q. Wilson, a leading criminologist and professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles. "But I'm not sure we know why, and I don't think this pattern will last," Mr. Wilson added, because of the coming growth in the number of teen-agers.
In fact, Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, noted that the report included an ominous hint of the projected increase in crime that may accompany the rising teen-age population. Of the eight crimes measured by the F.B.I., only one, larceny, showed an increase in 1995, up 1 percent. Larceny includes minor thefts like shoplifting and bicycle stealing, which are typical first crimes committed by teen-agers.
"This is the first visible sign of the anticipated new wave of crime by the future generation of kids," Professor Blumstein said.
The report showed that crime was down in all regions of the country, with the largest declines in the Northeast, which had a 4 percent overall decrease and a 15 percent drop in homicides.
Among cities, those with a population of more than a million showed the largest decline in overall crime, averaging 6 percent. Overall crime in New York City dropped by 14.5 percent, according to the F.B.I. figures, and the city had one of the largest declines in homicides, to 1,170 in 1995 from 1,561 in 1994. In Los Angeles, overall crime fell by 4 percent, in Detroit by 2 percent and in Dallas also by 2 percent, according to the figures.
In the past, some experts expressed skepticism that police figures sometimes undercounted crimes, but in recent years the specialists say there have been serious efforts by the F.B.I. to make the data as accurate as possible.
Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, said the most significant statistic in the report was the 8 percent decrease nationwide in the number of homicides last year, the third year in a row murders have fallen.
Murder figures are important because homicide is by far the best measured crime, given the difficulty of hiding bodies, Professor Zimring pointed out, and also because homicide is the crime that most alarms the public.
"The good news is that this decline in murders for three years is a trend," Professor Zimring said. But he added that homicides have followed a cyclical pattern for the last 20 years, and that every time the rate drops for a few years, it then rises again.
In fact, after a long period of decline, the national homicide rate doubled from 1965 to 1974, to about 10 per 100,000. It then dropped in the mid-1970's only to rise again to a peak of 10 per 100,000 in 1980. The early 1980's was another period of decline before the crack cocaine epidemic helped trigger another increase in the late 1980's. The F.B.I. said last year that the murder rate in 1994 was about 9 per 100,000.
A question many criminologists are asking is whether the current decline will prove as ephemeral as that in the early 1980's.
"When push comes to shove, nobody has an ability to explain the increases any better than the decreases," Professor Zimring said. "Criminologists are like weathermen without a satellite. We can only tell you about yesterday's crime rates."
The new report is based on crimes reported to the police and forms part of the F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Reporting Program. It measures eight serious crimes, including the violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and assault, along with the property crimes of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft and arson.
Over all, these serious crimes decreased 2 percent nationwide in 1995 compared with 1994, the F.B.I. found. Besides the 8 percent drop in homicides, robberies were down 7 percent, rapes declined 6 percent, and assaults dropped 3 percent. Among property crimes, in addition to the 1 percent increase in larcenies, automobile theft was down 6 percent, and burglary and arson fell 5 percent.
The number of homicides declined in other cities besides New York. Murders in Houston dropped to 316 in 1995 from 375 in 1994, while in Detroit they fell to 475 in 1995 from 541 the previous year.
In these two cities as well as New York, the police have carried out active new strategies. But overall crime also declined in Los Angeles, where the police have been making fewer arrests, Professor Wilson said, perhaps as a result of demoralization after widely publicized cases including the beating of the motorist Rodney G. King and the O. J. Simpson murder trial.
If crime is down in Los Angeles, as well as in New York, with such different police programs, Professor Wilson said, "something broad is happening."
James Alan Fox, the dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University, said the figures for 1995 "are certainly encouraging, but no reason for celebration."
The reason, Professor Fox said, is that the statistics obscure the fact that "there are two different crime trends in America, one for the young and one for adults, and they are moving in opposite directions." From 1990 to 1994, he said, the homicide rate among adults above 25 years of age declined 18 percent but the rate of killing by 14- to 17-year-olds rose 22 percent.
One reason for the decline among adults may be that more adult criminals have been incarcerated as the number of prisoners has tripled in the last two decades, Professor Fox said. But there is no evidence that the threat of prison deters young people, he added.
Lawrence M. Friedman, a professor of law at Stanford University and an authority on the history of crime in America, said that "the historical records suggest that fluctuations in crime rates are largely independent of changes in the criminal justice system" and may have as much to do with large social, economic and cultural trends.
He noted that although some people credit the tripling of the prison population with the recent decrease in crime, the United States had much lower crime rates in the 1940's and 1950's when many fewer people were sent to jail.
"The honest answer," Professor Friedman said, "is that no one knows why crime rates go up and down."

HEADLINE: Rights Panel For Europe Stirs Anger In Britain

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: STRASBOURG, France

 BODY:
Seven years ago, the British Board of Film Classification banned Nigel Wingrove's video "Visions of Ecstasy," saying its graphic scenes of Jesus having sex with a Carmelite nun violated Britain's centuries-old law against blasphemy.
What could Mr. Wingrove do? Having exhausted his legal remedies in Britain, he did what more and more of his aggrieved countrymen are doing when they find themselves on the wrong side of a British law. He took his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, where his lawyers argued in February that Britain's blasphemy statute was arbitrary, anachronistic and illegal under the broader laws of Europe. 
 "This film's banning by Britain constitutes a direct infringement of the protections in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights," Mr. Wingrove's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, told a panel of judges from 12 countries, including Iceland, Malta and Estonia. "Is the law any different in principle from the laws against blasphemy in Iran?"
If history is any indication, Mr. Wingrove may well prevail when the court makes its ruling in the next several months. Eighty cases have been heard against Britain in the court's 36-year history, more than against any other country except for Italy. And, in what many Britons see as yet another example of Europe confounding Britain's efforts to rule itself, the court has found Britain guilty of human rights violations 41 times.
"In the United States, people have protection under the Constitution, which enshrines many of the basic human rights in law," said Duncan Lustig-Prean, deputy director of Liberty, a British civil rights group. "With the U.K., there is no constitution and no bill of rights. There isn't anything."
What in Britain is referred to as the constitution exists not as a written document, but as the accumulation of common law and precedents.
The cases that come before the European Court are brought under provisions of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, which Britain signed, and involve speech, privacy, the press, religion, sexuality, corporal punishment and the rights of suspects, immigrants, prisoners and the mentally ill.
Because countries risk expulsion from the 38-member Council of Europe if they ignore its rulings, many of the cases have required the British Government to revise the country's laws, fueling anti-Europe sentiment and often embarrassing Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Government.
Rulings in Strasbourg have, among other things, forced Britain to outlaw corporal punishment in state-run schools, to pay damages to women fired from the armed services after becoming pregnant and to provide terrorism suspects with speedier access to lawyers.
The court has also limited the ability of the Government to wiretap telephones, expanded journalists' rights to use confidential sources, declared that the Home Secretary could no longer set jail sentences for juvenile offenders, and increased protection for homosexuals.
"From the point of view of human rights lawyers, there are very few of the decisions with which one could take issue," said Sir William Goodhart, a member of the executive committee of the International Commission of Jurists, a human rights group. "What this says is that we're not nearly as good at human rights as we think we are."
Mr. Wingrove's 18-minute "Visions of Ecstasy" video, which portrays in explicitly erotic terms the mystical rhapsodies of the 16th-century Carmelite nun, St. Theresa of Avila, was denied a rating by the film board in 1989, making it illegal for Mr. Wingrove to sell or rent it.
In refusing to rate the film, the board said that it was not pornographic but that it violated Britain's blasphemy law, which forbids ridiculing symbols of Christianity.
The law, which dates back to medieval ecclesiastical courts, does not apply to other religions and has been applied only twice before in this century.
By taking his case to Strasbourg, Mr. Wingrove, now a distributor of horror and B-movies, hopes the court will find that Britain violated his right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. He also wants the court to strike down the blasphemy law.
"Either you extend it to cover all faiths," Mr. Wingrove said, "or you abolish it altogether."
But even as Mr. Wingrove hopes for relief, many Britons are profoundly unhappy with the court at a time when European institutions are seen as meddling more and more in Britain's internal affairs.
The human rights court is regularly ridiculed by Conservative politicians and newspapers, who like to point out, for instance, that one of its judges, a Canadian-born lawyer who represents Liechtenstein, is named Ronald MacDonald.
To the conservative Daily Mail, the court is an "unrepresentative and unaccountable body" whose rulings "veer crankily from the tragic to the farcical, giving comfort here to terrorists, drug barons, gypsy squatters and transsexuals."
Last fall, the court provoked a furor when it ruled that the killing in 1988 of three unarmed Irish Republican Army members by British security forces in Gibraltar who suspected that they were on a bombing mission had violated the suspects' right to life.
In a follow-up order that Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, called "ludicrous and incomprehensible," the court also ordered the British Government to pay $60,000 in legal costs to the suspects' families.
"This really is the last straw," said Patrick Nicholls, a member of Parliament and the chairman of the Conservative backbench legal committee. "It's yet another example of countries, many of whom have a deplorable record on human rights, presuming to lecture our Home Secretary and our courts. The British people are fed up with our courts being overruled by a bunch of academic civil servants in Strasbourg who do not understand our legal system."
Perhaps as a way to appease the anti-European wing of his own party, known as the Euroskeptics, Mr. Major recently dispatched Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, to Strasbourg to ask the court to reform its system of selecting judges and to consider each country's legal traditions.
"Account should be taken of the fact that democratic institutions and tribunals in member states are best placed to determine moral and social issues in accordance with regional and national perceptions," Mr. Rifkind said in a memo to the court.
Meanwhile, despite some Euroskeptics' demands that Britain drop out altogether, Mr. Major in January renewed Britain's membership in the convention for five more years, saying that while Britain was "profoundly dissatisfied with some of their judgments," pulling out would set a bad example to other countries.
The judgments against Britain have given rise to a radical suggestion from the Labor Party, human rights lawyers and many members of the judiciary: why not incorporate the European human rights convention into British law, they ask -- as every other member of the Council of Europe, except Ireland, has already done.
"A British bill of rights would make redress easier and cheaper," the Economist said in October, "and thus restore at least some popular respect for Britain's own system of justice." Some conservatives agree, but for different reasons. Incorporating the convention into national law, they say, would restore British affairs to British control and offer a chance for more Government-friendly judgments.
Then, Sir Ivan Lawrence, a member of Parliament, said recently, Britons could "wash our dirty linen here, rather than in Europe."

The New Casey

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Whom the political gods would destroy, they first make power-grabbing Directors of Central Intelligence.
I saw it happen with my friend Bill Casey, a patriot of intellect and energy who thought he could dominate the Reagan Administration as an activist policy maker, and whose hubris hurt him and his country. 
 It's happening again with John Deutch, the former M.I.T. provost who now bestrides the National Security Council like a Colossus.
Like only Casey before him, Deutch demanded a place at the President's Cabinet table. Whether as host at elegant black-tie dinner parties at Blair House for foreign ambassadors, or leading an entourage of 37 on a tour of Africa, Mr. Clinton's Director of Central Intelligence makes clear that he is the man of greatest influence in the Clinton Administration.
Time magazine's Douglas Waller, in a devastating expose last week, wrote that Deutch was "becoming the most powerful spymaster Washington has ever seen" who "ostensibly refrains from advocating policy with the President."
That qualifier "ostensibly" is on target: Deutch's colleagues have heard him boast, on more than one occasion, "I am a policy maker."
You ask -- what's wrong with that? Why shouldn't Clinton get advice on what to do from a brilliant, take-charge D.C.I.?
Here's what is wrong: When the nation's top intelligence officer goes beyond providing impartial facts and starts offering policy judgments, he abuses his office. Career-conscious analysts, evaluators and even agents then provide facts and estimates backing-up what become known as the boss's views. Necessary dissent is chilled, and the books become cooked.
Deutch concealed from Congressional oversight for a year his knowledge of a secret White House Intelligence Oversight Committee investigation into Clinton's personal, tacit cooperation with Iran to arm the Bosnians. (As Casey would say, "You never asked me"; now, belatedly, Deutch is handing over material the White House wishes he would not.) And yet Congress rewarded him with control of all intelligence budgets, a vast expansion of one man's power.
He maintained the "right" of the spy agency to endanger all journalists by using some as spies; insisted that officials outside the community submit to the discredited polygraph for access to data; talked big and delivered little on declassification. And yet Deutch gets a great press.
He sits at the Cabinet table, absorbing face time from the President, while often replacing his deputy at deputies' meetings, thereby keeping personal control of the sub-Cabinet bureaucracy. And yet -- because Clinton had to beg him to take the job -- nobody dares to tell the President his cosseted D.C.I. is building an empire.
That empire, should Clinton win a second term, would probably see Deutch returned to the Defense Department as Secretary; his subservient C.I.A. top staff running the agency but still beholden to him; and with Strobe Talbott of State, his squash partner, guaranteeing Oval Office access as national security adviser.
To bring off that political coup, Deutch needs a dramatic success. Speculation is rife in Washington that a Presidential "finding" has been signed authorizing a covert action, duly reported secretly to Congress, to support an indigenous Iraqi uprising to topple Saddam Hussein. If true, it may be Clinton's "October surprise"; if untrue, and if Saddam is secretly building mass-destruction weapons, what has the C.I.A. been waiting for?
Deutch is savvy enough to employ tactical retreats. When Republicans saw politics in 'Deutchland' -- seeing red in his agency's airy brushoff of a need for missile defense -- he agreed to a re-evaluation to head off an investigation. When the F.B.I. wanted to treat economic espionage as criminal, thus compromising C.I.A. sources, Deutch caved in, knowing his agency is vulnerable to an aggressive F.B.I. mole hunt to find the Russian spy who protected Aldrich Ames.
Nobody doubts his smarts. Is he smart enough to anticipate, like a professional intelligence officer, the fall he is riding for?
Much depends on his reaction to the unflattering Time article, today's gentle pop, and others likely to follow. His remaining well-wishers hope the criticism will help him restrain his ego and discipline his desire to dominate.
But if past is sadly prelude, Director Deutch will seethe, and blow his stack, and hunt for leakers, and vow to get even -- and, like Casey, come a cropper.

HEADLINE: House Republican Leaders Return D'Amato's Salvo on Strategies

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his loyal No. 2, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, returned fire today at criticism leveled against the policies and practices of the House Republicans they lead. They were not, however, responding to some partisan salvo from Democrats but to the rather blunt criticism last week from Alfonse M. D'Amato, New York's Republican Senator.
On Friday, Mr. D'Amato complained that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, was being hurt by his association with Mr. Gingrich. Today, Mr. Gingrich said Mr. D'Amato was "just wrong." 
 "I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things," Mr. Gingrich said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
On another talk show, Mr. Armey, the House Republican leader, was far harsher, suggesting a motive for Mr. D'Amato: that the Senator was trying to shore up his political standing in New York, where he faces re-election in two years.
Mr. Gingrich, returning to the talk-show circuit after an absence of several months, used the occasion to attack President Clinton as well. On the balanced budget, he said Mr. Clinton "postures, says things that are false and has zero interest in a real agreement."
And in vetoing a bill that would ban certain late-term abortions, Mr. Gingrich said, "Bill Clinton has taken an extraordinarily extreme position, that it is O.K. to kill children in ways in which no American could tolerate if they knew about them."
David Eichenbaum, communications director of the Democratic National Committee, said: "Nasty Newt is back, and he's nastier than ever. The better the economic news, the nastier Newt gets."
With polls showing Mr. Dole trailing President Clinton by wide margins, it has been a season of discontent for Republicans with the sprouting of intraparty feuds.
But unlike the disagreements among Republicans over issues like the minimum wage and the gas tax, the D'Amato-Gingrich argument is over how Mr. Dole should shape his case to be President and how closely he should be identified with Mr. Gingrich's aggressive approach.
Mr. D'Amato is a leading figure in the Dole campaign, and his criticism reverberated throughout Republican circles. His complaints that Mr. Gingrich misread his mandate from the 1994 elections were explicit and frequent in New York on Friday.
Mr. Gingrich said: "I would simply say to Al D'Amato that we favor balancing the Federal budget so that our children aren't crushed by debt. I think 80 percent of the American people favor that." He said most people also endorsed the House Republican efforts to enact death penalty laws and tax cuts.
Mr. Armey, speaking on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," said Mr. D'Amato's "mama apparently didn't teach him not to bite the hand that feeds him." He said the Contract With America, the House Republicans' campaign manifesto from 1994, gave the Republicans majorities in both the House and the Senate, making Mr. D'Amato chairman of the banking committee.
"I'm sorry he doesn't recognize that," Mr. Armey said. "But he's behind in the polls, and you know when politicians get behind in the polls they get desperate, and Al obviously wanted to endear himself to big labor. They're spending a ton of money in New York."

 BODY:
ON the eve of the big playoff series here, Michael Jordan's back, Scottie Pippen's ankle and Phil Jackson's brains played second fiddle to Dennis Rodman's cosmetics and Dennis Rodman's frocks.
On the eve of the second round of the National Basketball Association playoffs between the Bulls and the Knicks, the front page of the Sunday Chicago Sun-Times ran this headline: "The Rebounder Wore Rouge." The Sunday Chicago Tribune's lead headline was: "Rodman Rings This City's Bell/Eccentric Bull Transcends Even Jordan's Popularity." 
 Elsewhere on those front pages, you might find stories about the economy or trouble in China, but the photographs of the Bulls forward in his eyebrow-raising coming-out garb at a book-signing for his more-or-less autobiography, "Bad As I Wanna Be," relegated possible injuries to Jordan and Pippen, and strategy by Jackson, to, well, the sports pages.
Perhaps it is an indication of the man that when he showed up for Saturday's event on a Harley-Davidson -- as a crowd of 1,500 waved and screamed -- he came roaring down the one-way Pearson Street the wrong way. He was heavily made up, with silver hair, silver eyeshadow, silver lipstick, silver nail polish. He wore a silver tank top that showed off a goodly portion of his 11 tattoos, tight black-leather pants and silver motorcycle boots and topped it all with a fuchsia boa scattered with black feathers. He was arrayed like Grace Jones, or Little Richard on a bad day.
Whether he might catch a cold flying through the Chicago streets in a tank top on a chopper in 45-degree weather, or whether he might fall off the cycle and break something, like a head, and render himself less able for his team's run for the championship, seemed of little concern. After all, it's all part of being bad.
But if "bad" can be "good," as some parlance has it, then the league's leading rebounder was his nasty self last night against the Knicks, pulling down 12 boards, even hitting 3 of 4 free throws in the waning minutes of the game, and then diving headlong to save a loose ball on virtually the last play of the game as the Bulls won, 91-84.
Dennis Rodman, however, has become as brilliant at gathering attention as he is at getting rebounds. It is a phenomenon. But Dennis Rodman learned long ago that doing something outrageous makes people look at you and talk about you and, eventually, earns you money. Doesn't matter if it makes sense or not. If it is rebelliousness for rebelliousness' sake. If it's making funny faces behind the teacher's back just to make your classmates giggle.
In his book, Rodman says he met his best friend at a camp where Rodman walked around with quarters in his ears. "Made people think I was crazy," he wrote, with what seems an air of satisfaction.
In his book, every page has phrases in bold type, just to let the reader know how important this passage is. One wonders about the reader he believes this will attract. The book seems an insight into the thought process of Dennis Rodman. He says: "Fifty percent of life in the N.B.A. is sex. The other 50 percent is money." That leaves precious little time for basketball. He says, "When you talk about race in basketball, the whole thing is simple: A black player knows he can go out on the court and," paraphrasing from here, kick a white player around. That wraps up the race issue, all right.
But there are deeper things that he touches on. Like the fact that his father left his mother when he was 3, and he still yearns for a father figure. And when Chuck Daly, his coach with the Pistons, left, he was so distraught at this and some other matters, he sat with a rifle in his lap in a parking lot and contemplated suicide. He recalls stealing watches when he was employed as an airport janitor after high school, and giving them to friends because he was "looking for acceptance."
He talks about wanting to be "normal," and that he might like to go back to that $6.50 an hour job. On the other hand, he has stated recently that he will demand $7 million a year from the Bulls next season.
He discusses being a lost, funny-looking young man with big ears -- who grew nine inches the summer after high school, from 5 feet 11 inches to 6-8 -- and finally at age 20 beginning to develop some confidence through basketball, though he hadn't played on the team in high school.
His two younger sisters had been outstanding basketball players, and he bridled at the attention they received. He talks about being sent twice to psychiatrists who told him, "There's nothing wrong with you."
But throughout the book, he says he just wants to be "normal." He talks still about ending his life with suicide. Those psychiatrists should be investigated.
For all his "badness," Rodman rarely seems comfortable with himself. He seems to be always trying to be someone else. But he's performed a magic trick that even Michael Jordan might envy. He has learned to make quarters from his ears become piles of cash.

National Holidays Curb Trading And Dollar Ends Little Changed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesteday in light trading caused by national holidays in Britain and Japan.
Most trading was between the German mark or the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, rather than the dollar, traders said. Traders were using these cross-rates to bet on lower interest rates in Europe and an eventual increase in Japanese rates. 
 "There seems to be more interest than usual in the cross-rates, particularly against the yen," said Michael Faust, portfolio manager at Bailard Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif.
The effect of traders selling marks and francs for yen was to give the dollar an indirect increase against the European currencies, and a nudge lower against the yen.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5254 marks, up from 1.5245 marks on Friday. The dollar slipped to 104.88 yen from 105.05 yen. The British pound edged up to $1.5087 from $1.5070.
Japanese markets were closed yesterday in observance of Children's Day, while London -- normally the busiest center of foreign-exchange trading -- was quiet because of a national holiday.
Speculation that a rebounding United States economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year is likely to bolster the dollar against European currencies in the days ahead, traders said, particularly after the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, suggested this weekend that the German central bank might lower interest rates.
Speaking at the opening of a new Bundesbank branch in Leipzig, Mr. Tietmeyer suggested that there was room for a German rate reduction.
And yesterday, a council member of the Bundesbank, Wendelin Hartmann, welcomed the dollar's recent gains against the mark in remarks in Leipzig.
The latest Bundesbank comments backed views already held in the market, rather than giving any new impetus to prices, traders said. Still, some traders expect the dollar to rise as high as 1.55 marks.
"The dollar's in a little bit of a consolidation mode," said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange at Republic National Bank of New York. "But this market's turned heavily bullish."
In other currency dealings, the Mexican peso slipped against the dollar in active trading yesterday. The peso fell to 7.505 pesos to the dollar from 7.475.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
On Slow Day, Bond Prices Rebound a Bit

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, lifted by covering of short positions and by bargain hunting after the sharp selloff on Friday that was prompted by the April employment report. But trading was light, exaggerating the gains, as the market braced for a flood of new securities this week.
The Treasury is selling $73 billion of securities in auctions that will be conducted nearly every day this week. As a result, traders and investors are moving cautiously and large buyers have become scarce. 
 The concerns over supply come amid signs that an economic rebound is picking up speed, raising worries that inflation could accelerate soon and that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates to try to control price pressures.
The bond market has already begun to price in a move by the Fed to tighten credit, traders and analysts say. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Fed, which determines monetary policy, meets on May 21.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32 yesterday, to 86 30/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.05 percent, from 7.11 percent on Friday. Some traders covered short positions, profiting by buying back, at a lower price, shares that they had borrowed and sold earlier.
At the regular weekly auction of Treasury bills yesterday, the rates were higher than they were last week. The average rate at auction for a three-month bill was 5.02 percent, up from 5 percent, while the rate on a bill with a six-month maturity was 5.14 percent, up from 5.08 percent.
The auction served as a prelude to the Treasury's quarterly refunding of debt this week. Today the Treasury will auction $19 billion of 3-year notes, and tomorrow it will sell $14 billion of 10-year notes. On Thursday, 36-day cash management bills will be sold to take care of short-term borrowing needs not covered by the regular schedule. In when-issued trading yesterday, the 3-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.34 percent and the 10-year at a price to yield 6.88 percent.
Dealers and sellers were positioning themselves yesterday for quick distribution of the new securities into the hands of investors so that they would not end up holding too many of the securities and being exposed to losses if prices continued to drop.
The report on employment for April continued to nag at market participants yesterday. While it showed that only 2,000 jobs were added to payrolls last month, far fewer than the 117,000 that had been expected, the data also showed wage pressures and were in line with other reports pointing to faster-than-expected economic growth.
Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist of the DKB Securities (USA) Corporation, said that if not for the confusion over the significance of recent economic reports, bond yields would have topped out long ago. He said that the sale of 3-year and 10-year notes this week would only fuel the market's anxiety.
Some additional data on prices will be reported this week. The Federal Reserve will release a survey of regional business activity tomorrow, and the Labor Department will report on producer prices for April on Friday.
In the futures market, Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said that "a test toward a price of 108 on the June bond futures contract looks likely."
"But given the overall bearish structure of the market and this week's quarterly refunding," she said, "the level is a selling opportunity. You can't have a bullish bias in this market until we see a recovery above a price of 109 11/32."
Yesterday the 30-year bond contract for June reached a high price of 1079/32 and closed at 107 5/32 .
Following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)M03,35,20,20> 3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo.

HEADLINE: Criminals of the Balkan War

 BODY:
Dusan Tadic goes on trial today in The Hague for war crimes in Bosnia, the first defendant to face the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Mr. Tadic, a Bosnian Serb, is accused of specific acts of murder and torture, but not of masterminding the brutal human rights abuses that were the signature of the Balkan war. That distinction belongs to other men, and the work of the tribunal should be measured by whether it is given the support necessary to pursue and prosecute them.
Political and practical obstacles make it unlikely that many of those who engineered the ethnic slaughter in Bosnia will be captured and brought to trial. The unspoken price of the Dayton peace agreement seems to be indifference about the atrocities committed by all parties during the war. But while the United States and other nations may be defeated in the end by these impediments, they should be stubborn in the pursuit of justice. 
 The individuals who carried out the Bosnian war's worst crimes -- like "ethnic cleansing," torture, rape and mass execution -- should be held accountable for their actions. Otherwise, surviving victims will be tempted to retaliate indiscriminately against innocent members of the ethnic groups these criminals claimed to serve. Such vendettas would decrease the chances that Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs can once again learn to live together.
To date only 3 of the 57 indicted war crimes defendants -- one Serb and two Croats -- are in custody in The Hague. None of them were arrested by Serbian or Croatian authorities, despite their obligation under the Dayton agreement to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes. In contrast, the Bosnian Muslim authorities promptly arrested two of the three recently indicted Muslim defendants, and the third is in custody in Germany.
Almost all the other defendants remain at large, including Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander.
The West has considerable diplomatic leverage with Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President, who is eager to see his country accepted by Washington and integrated into European institutions at the earliest possible date. Serbia is subject to the automatic reimposition of costly economic sanctions if President Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply with the war crimes requirements of the Dayton accord.
Western governments have so far preferred not to use their leverage. Carl Bildt, the chief international civilian representative in Bosnia, has not made war crimes a high priority. The NATO peacekeeping forces, while rightly hoping to avoid reckless manhunts, have gone too far in the other direction, leaving the impression that they have no interest in supporting the investigation of war crimes or the pursuit of war criminals.
This behavior is shortsighted. Credible war crimes prosecutions are not only important to the prospects for long-term peace in Bosnia, but also bear on the country's civil tranquillity in the coming months. That may affect the climate at the time of NATO's scheduled withdrawal at year's end.
Of all the aspects of the Bosnian peace, the prosecution of war criminals may be the most sensitive and politically charged. Presidents Milosevic and Tudjman would no doubt like to avoid trials of defendants that might expose suspected links between their own military forces and Bosnian ethnic militias.
But the difficulty inherent in holding people accountable for the terrible crimes of the Balkan war is no reason to brush off the job. Western governments must insist that the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian Governments live up to the commitments they made to bring war criminals to justice.

HEADLINE: A Better Senate Bill on Immigration

 BODY:
The Senate passed a sensible immigration bill last week, providing for strengthened enforcement of immigration laws at the nation's borders and workplaces, tighter requirements for immigrants to receive certain public benefits and the development of a new national database for verifying the immigration status of prospective employees.
The Senate's version is superior to the harshly punitive bill the House passed in March, which would deny due process to asylum applicants and permit states to deny public education to the children of illegal immigrants. House conferees should follow the Senate's lead on both issues. The House bill's public education provision, which ignores a contrary Supreme Court ruling, has rightly drawn a veto threat from President Clinton. 
 The original Senate immigration bill, submitted last year by Alan Simpson of Wyoming, would have done more harm than good. Responding to a perceived popular anger against foreigners at a time of economic uncertainty in America, it sought to cut legal as well as illegal immigration. The bill would have needlessly hurt employers' ability to recruit workers with special training and skills and imposed gratuitous hardships on immigrant families. Senators Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, and Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, led a successful effort in the Judiciary Committee to remove most legal immigration restrictions from this bill.
Then Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, amended provisions that would have unrealistically required refugees to arrive with a full set of valid travel documents and denied them any appeal from unfavorable rulings by immigration officers at the point of entry. The House bill still contains these denials of due process. The Senate bill contains regrettable restrictions on other kinds of immigration appeals, but keeps asylum accessible.
The Senate reasonably required, as did the House, that immigrants count the incomes of their sponsors as well as their own when applying for means-tested benefits. That is less generous than the current standard, but America's underfinanced welfare system should not have to bear the burden of those not genuinely in need. Public education is different, as the Supreme Court has ruled and the Senate recognized. Children here because their parents came to this country illegally should not be barred from public schools.
The Senate bill also requires the government to establish a national database so that employers can verify the status of job applicants. The American Civil Liberties Union and the new libertarians of the Republican right oppose this provision as an expansion of Big Brother government. But excluding illegal aliens from employment requires an identification less open to fraud than current paper documentation systems. The Senate made its pilot programs for the database mandatory. The House made them voluntary. Either is acceptable, provided that Congress insists that the final program protect immigration data from abuse.
Both the Senate and House bills usefully provide for nearly doubling the number of Immigration Service enforcement agents.
Immigrants have historically enriched America and still do so today, especially when they bring entrepreneurial energies and valuable technical skills. The United States is also a better country for admitting those who flee persecution abroad. Still, those people whom immigration law excludes should be kept out as effectively as possible. The Senate has come up with a bill that can help do that. The House should drop its unacceptable education and asylum provisions and go along.

HEADLINE: Dole '96 Button Not Necessarily Business Attire

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
As a longtime supporter of President Clinton, John H. Bryan, the chairman of the Sara Lee Corporation, is used to having his politics questioned by other chief executives, most of whom are staunch Republicans. "Every now and then, someone will check in and ask if I still back him," Mr. Bryan said last week. "I always profess my loyalty."
Lately -- and surprisingly -- Mr. Bryan has been getting less ribbing. 
 The political mood in the nation's executive suites is showing signs of subtle change. Mr. Clinton, despite irritating business leaders with what they perceive as broken promises and policy flip-flops, appears to have put himself back in the race. Many executives, lacking enthusiasm for Senator Bob Dole, are giving Mr. Clinton a second look, or at least remaining uncommitted.
That, in itself, is quite a turnaround. A few months ago, Republicans did not know whom their Presidential nominee would be, but they figured they could count on support from the leaders of big business, almost regardless of whom the party nominated. Now, Mr. Dole is the all-but-certain candidate, but -- based on more than a score of interviews with top executives who frequently talk politics with their colleagues and with political analysts -- his hold on the nation's executive suites is no sure thing.
Mr. Dole's support among top executives is wobbly for several reasons, including what some of them see as his fumbling on economic issues. Some are upset by the just-resolved, highly partisan fight over the 1996 budget, which they believe made the Republicans look extremist. And others have been put off by the sway the party's right wing often exerts on social issues like abortion.
"Right now, I'm worrying," said David R. Goode, chief executive of the Norfolk Southern Corporation. "Five or six months ago, I would have been stronger for Dole. If I had to vote today -- well, I'll take the Fifth on that."
For both parties, corporate chieftains like Mr. Goode are much bigger quarry than their numbers would suggest. They are trophies -- important because they are symbols and because they give money, raise yet more funds and often wield influence in their communities and industries.
For the Clinton campaign, they represent even more. By wooing chief executives in 1992 -- winning more business support than any Democratic nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 -- Mr. Clinton bolstered his credentials as a "New Democrat" who would not tax and spend the way that Republicans contend traditional liberals do. Silicon Valley executives in particular came out in force. Republicans like Lawrence J. Ellison of the Oracle Systems Corporation and Edward R. McCracken of Silicon Graphics Inc. endorsed Mr. Clinton because he offered policies to aid high-technology companies.
By last fall, though, many chief executives had returned to the Republican fold. Mr. Clinton's veto in December of a bill limiting shareholder lawsuits was the coup de grace for many. Mr. Ellison even wrote a check to Mr. Dole's campaign.
Now Mr. Clinton may again be living up to his reputation as "the comeback kid," thanks to yet another reversal by executives like Mr. Ellison, whose anger has subsided. "I intend to wholeheartedly support the President this year for the same reasons I supported him in 1992 -- his commitment to education and technology," Mr. Ellison said.
Neither candidate seems to have an edge when it comes to money. Each party is expected to raise $120 million this year, mostly from business interests, according to Josh Goldstein, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks contributions. "Business always gives to both sides," Mr. Goldstein said. "Their giving is not ideological but pragmatic."
And as of now, six months before Election Day, support from top executives for Mr. Clinton is by no means as widespread as it was in 1992. Indeed, "there may not be as many as the last time, when a lot were voting against Bush," cautioned Paul A. Allaire, the chief executive of the Xerox Corporation and a Clinton backer. Then, with the economy stagnating, business leaders were frustrated by what some saw as President George Bush's lack of vision and inability to work with the Democratic Congress.
Some of Mr. Clinton's executive backers, of course, will come from traditional Democratic bastions like Hollywood, where Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of Seagram, is a supporter, and Wall Street, where Robert E. Denham, the chief executive of Salomon Inc., has stepped forward.
But, as in 1992, a share of Mr. Clinton's executive support is likely to come from Republican turf, where some backers and analysts say Mr. Dole's troubles are compounded by his uninspiring performance on the hustings. Indeed, some executives who would normally be expected to voice public support for Mr. Dole are reluctant to do so publicly, which is read as a sign of his weakness.
"Most chief executives will probably vote for Dole, but I don't see any enthusiasm for him," said the head of one large company, who insisted on anonymity. "I wish I did, because I'm a Dole supporter."
Donald B. Marron, the chief executive of Paine Webber Group Inc. and a fund-raiser for Mr. Dole, said he had not heard such complaints. "When I talk to business people," he said, "they see in Bob Dole a very experienced person who has strong feelings about having less government and more economic growth" -- which, Mr. Marron said, is exactly what big business wants.
Even if Mr. Dole gets executives' votes, he will have to contend with a subtler issue. "People don't feel that if Clinton gets re-elected it's the end of the world," the anonymous Dole backer said of the business community.
Based on the soundings he has taken, Tony Coelho, an informal adviser to Mr. Clinton and chief executive of a financial services firm that bears his name, agreed. "Executives are not out to defeat him," Mr. Coelho said. "They think Republicans will lose and it's not worth it for them to try to make a difference."
Executives like to back a winner, and the most recent national opinion polls show Mr. Dole trailing Mr. Clinton by some 20 percentage points. "Everyone said it was the Republicans' to lose," Mr. Allaire said, "and my colleagues now feel that they will."
These are, of course, early days in what could be a volatile campaign. Springtime polls often prove wrong by fall. "This time in 1992, President Bush was ahead by 12 points, and in 1988 at this time he was trailing by 30 points," noted Lodwrick M. Cook, the chairman emeritus of ARCO. Mr. Cook is a deputy chairman of Mr. Dole's national finance committee, along with Mr. Marron and Henry R. Kravis, the leveraged-buyout investor. "I think the support is there," Mr. Cook said.
Pendleton E. James, an executive recruiter who is on the finance committee for the Republican Eagles, a group of top contributors, said that chief executives "are waiting for Dole to give some leadership, which he hasn't."
"I'm optimistic," he added, "and I think that will change."
Yet some Republicans worry because on balance, they admit, Mr. Clinton has not been bad for business. The economy is growing. The President has not been tagged with responsibility for any foreign policy fiascos. In trade, he pushed for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement despite labor union opposition, and he personally helped win foreign contracts for companies like the Raytheon Corporation, which landed a big electronics contract in Brazil.
Executives are also quick to acknowledge their debt to Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary who died in a plane crash on April 3 while leading one of his many trade missions. Others praise Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary.
On the minus side, big business faults the Administration for failing to ease the burdens of regulation and litigation. And they recoil at the criticism that Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has heaped on companies that have cut their work forces.
But even in the worst of times -- during the debate on health care, for instance -- many acknowledge that Mr. Clinton kept channels open, playing host at lunches for chief executives, among other things. "Clinton has never given up on the business community," Mr. Bryan, the Sara Lee chairman, said.
In one typical example, the President met stony faces last October when he gave the dinner speech at a meeting of the Business Council, a prestigious group of chief executives. But afterward, he went from table to table, listening to the concerns of each chief executive.
Lately, he has picked up the pace of his business courtship, especially in Silicon Valley. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have been busy trying to rebuild bridges throughout California, a key state.
Mr. Ellison aside, they have not been completely successful. Mr. McCracken of Silicon Graphics, who is considered a key swing vote in the computer industry, is remaining mum for the moment. Even if Mr. Clinton wins more support, it is unclear if he can turn it all public. "C.E.O.'s are not comfortable supporting a Democrat publicly, and that's a fact," Mr. Bryan said.
Meanwhile, a few Dole supporters are complaining about Republican efforts. "No one in the Dole campaign is reaching out to the business community," one supporter said, adding that the campaign seems only to ask for money. "It's a failing of the Dole campaign."
The Dole campaign did not respond to several requests for comments.
At this point, there is no telling whether an issue will arise to push executives in one direction or the other, the way the North American trade accord sealed a lot of business backing for Mr. Clinton. In the end, the split will probably depend on Mr. Clinton's moves before November.
"There's no question President Clinton is an outstanding campaigner," said Mr. Cook, the Dole backer. "It'll be an interesting race."

HEADLINE: David Lasser, 94, a Space and a Social Visionary

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
David Lasser, an immigrant's son whose vision of the future inspired men to build and fly rockets to the heavens and whose concern for life on earth impelled him to champion and organize the unemployed during the Great Depression, died on Sunday at the Remington Senior Care Facility in Rancho Bernardo, Calif., a San Diego suburb. Mr. Lasser, who lived in Rancho Bernardo, was 94.
Mr. Lasser's pioneering sense of the potential of rocketry was expressed in a 1931 book "The Conquest of Space," and it led him to form the organization now known as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. But his vision grew from an unlikely source: Mr. Lasser, as managing editor of a magazine called Science Wonder Stories, grew dissatisfied with the propulsion imagined by his authors for their space ships. Drawing upon his background in engineering, he conducted his own research and realized that the rocket -- the very same instrument used against the British in the War of 1812 and embodied in the lyrics of the national anthem -- would make space travel possible. 
 As the Depression deepened, Mr. Lasser's socialist sympathies prompted him to turn to labor organizing, a campaign that rallied hundreds of thousands to his Workers Alliance of America, later the American Security Union. After earning the respect of statesmen like President Franklin D. Roosevelt and W. Averell Harriman, Mr. Lasser fell victim to the Red hunts after World War II, when he was smeared with a baseless charge of Communism that barred him from Federal service.
In 1980, President Jimmy Carter expunged the canard with a letter that said: "This nation has a deep and abiding commitment to human rights. When lapses occur, it is important that they be corrected. I am glad that my Administration has had the opportunity to correct the record in your case."
Mr. Lasser, a son of Russian immigrants, was born in Baltimore and grew up in Newark, where his father, Leonard, cleaned and repaired clothes in a small shop.
A high school dropout who went to work to help his family, David was almost 16 when he lied about his age to enlist in the Army in World War I.
After returning to the United States, he was accepted by the Newark College of Engineering with the proviso that he attend high school and earn a diploma. But within a year, he decided that his electrical engineering course was too narrow to pave his way into management, so he presented himself at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and asked for a chance. In 1924, he was awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering. For a few years, he worked in small factories, and then, in 1927, impulsively, he answered an advertisement for managing editor of Science Wonder Stories.
Arthur C. Clarke, now the dean of science-fiction visionaries, described "The Conquest of Space" as "the first book in the English language to explain that space travel wasn't just fiction." He credited his encounter with the book as being "one of the turning points in my life -- and I suspect not only of mine."
Indeed, not.
One night in 1929, Mr. Lasser convened a group of writers in his Greenwich Village apartment. The organization they formed to promote space travel by means of rocketry called itself the American Interplanetary Society. Mr. Lasser was its first president. In the 1930's, the organization became the American Rocket Society, and in 1963, after merging with the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, it became the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, now a 41,000-member organization based in Washington.
When World War II brought an end to joblessness, Mr. Lasser resigned his union post, worked for the War Production Board, and briefly served Mr. Harriman as a consultant for the Marshall Plan until he was effectively blacklisted. From 1950 until his retirement in 1969, Mr. Lasser was the economics and research director of the International Union of Electrical Radio and Machine Workers.
Mr. Lasser was also the author of the 1945 book "Private Monopoly: The Enemy at Home," in which he argued that economic policies motivated by greed were the source of nearly all modern distress.
Mr. Lasser, who was married three times, is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Amelia Tolbert, of Rancho Bernardo; and Daniel Lasser of Rockville, Md., a son by his first marriage, to Florence Glassberg.

HEADLINE: Trenton May Pay Health Cost Of Uninsured by Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 6

 BODY:
In the latest attempt to end a five-month standoff over how to pay for hospital care for the uninsured, the State Assembly approved legislation today that would cover the costs by continuing to rely on unemployment payroll taxes.
The bill was approved by the Assembly on a vote of 55 to 17, with 6 abstentions, with some Democratic support. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco support the new two-year plan, but the measure still faces uncertainty in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
 Several Republican senators oppose using payroll taxes designated for the unemployment insurance fund. Senate Democrats support another bill that would use more state budget dollars to finance the plan. Without Democratic support, said Mr. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains, the legislation is not likely to win approval when it comes up for a vote next week.
New Jersey's hospitals have continued to provide more than $100 million in medical treatment for the uninsured since the first of the year. Without state reimbursement, several hospitals have delayed payments to suppliers and warned that they would lay off workers and shut down clinics unless state reimbursements resumed.
"We're pleased that a bill has finally been heard," said Peter J. Lillo, vice president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, which has filed a lawsuit against the state seeking reimbursement. "We would have liked to have seen more money."
Under the proposal, the bill would distribute $310 million to hospitals this year and $300 million next year. The bill directs the State Department of Health to set up a managed care network so that fewer people would rely on emergency rooms for routine medical care, but lawmakers said today that it was unclear how managed care would work.
"That is still evolving," said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County.
Since 1992, the state paid for charity care by diverting $1.6 billion in payroll taxes earmarked for the unemployment fund. The authority to continue using the fund expired on Dec. 31, and both organized labor and the business community objected to the state's continuing to rely on unemployment payroll taxes to cover the cost of charity care.
To win support from labor, the Assembly agreed and voted today to extend unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 39 weeks through the end of the year. The Assembly also voted to eliminate unemployment payroll taxes for employees for the next two years and reduce unemployment taxes to employers by $300 million.
But the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents 14,000 businesses around the state, remains adamantly opposed to the measure and is working to defeat it in the Senate because it is concerned that the pressure on the fund will mean that employers will pay higher unemployment taxes.
The Assembly also voted only $10 million to be appropriated for the state's subsidized health insurance program, Health Access New Jersey, which covers the cost of the 22,000 people now in the program but provides no funds for new applicants.

HEADLINE: It's See No Evil, Have No Harassment in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 6

 BODY:
Kiyomi Kikuchi, a new saleswoman for Central Finance, was visiting clients with a male deputy branch manager, when the man suddenly turned their car into the parking lot of a "love hotel," an establishment, common in Japan, that rents rooms to couples by the hour.
"I said, 'You must be joking,' " Miss Kikuchi recalled. Her strong protests got the man to turn back that day, but his advances continued for months. The branch manager ignored her complaints, she said, but finally realized they were true and gave her a new sales partner. 
 But not long after that, the branch manager came to her again. "He said the deputy had been discredited," Miss Kikuchi, now 29, recalled last week. "And in order to restore his reputation I had to help him" by becoming his partner again.
What happened to Miss Kikuchi, experts say, is not unusual in Japan, where women play subservient roles in the workplace and where men openly read pornographic comic books on the subways. In a survey two years ago by the Tokyo city government, 26.5 percent of women workers reported having had some unpleasant sex-related experience on the job, mainly being told lewd jokes or being touched.
What is unusual is that Miss Kikuchi, who quit her job, sued the Nagoya-based company and the deputy branch manager for sexual harassment. Lawyers for both denied the charges; the case is pending.
Unlike in the United States, where sexual harassment lawsuits against an American subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation have captured headlines, few women in Japan even complain to their companies, perhaps because of a tradition in society of persevering through problems or because they feel that it would do no good. And in this generally nonlitigious society, only a handful of women file sexual harassment lawsuits each year.
Hence sexual harassment has not pervaded the social consciousness of Japan. The term used here, "sekuhara," is derived from English, suggesting that Japan did not have much of concept of it before.
Companies in Japan think of it as a problem involving individual women, said Masaomi Kaneko, deputy director of the Tokyo labor economic bureau. "They do not consider it a moral issue or think about why it happpens or of improving the work environment."
Plaintiffs in the case against Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America think such attitudes might have contributed to a tolerance of sexual harassment by the top Japanese executives at the factory in Normal, Ill., which is now being sued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and by some current and former female employees. The workers who are actually accused of having scribbled lewd graffiti on walls, groped their female co-workers or shown them pornographic photos are American, however.
Mitsubishi's managers have said they do not tolerate sexual harassment and that the Japanese executives sent to the United States are trained in American values.
Certainly, Japanese companies have run into conflicts when they have tried to impose their traditional business practices on American subsidiaries. There have been many lawsuits accusing the Japanese companies of discriminating against women, minorities or Americans in general. But some executives of other Japanese companies say that by now any Japanese company setting up shop in the United States should be aware of these problems.
Experts say the root cause of sexual harassment in Japan is that women have a secondary status in society over all. Behavior that would be considered politically incorrect in America is accepted here.
At computer trade shows, the latest components are demonstrated by legions of models in miniskirts. Late-night TV often features shapely young women in bikinis who engage in mud wrestling or other mindless contests that seem designed mainly to make their tops fall off.
Entertaining clients and associates is an important part of doing business here, and it can involve women. Japanese executives talk business in "hostess bars," where women pour their Scotch and water and flatter them with idle chatter.
One Japanese businessman who has been stationed in New York and Asia said it was not unusual to arrange prostitutes for a client or a visiting big shot from headquarters, though the guest would be expected to pay for himself.
In Japan, clients might be taken to a "soapland," an establishment in which a naked woman bathes a male customer. In New York, the Japanese businessman belonged to a members-only club, 30 to 40 percent of whose members were Japanese, that featured a sauna, swimming pool and prostitutes. "I would take my guests there and let them do as they liked," he said.
Mitsubishi Motors trainees from America were taken to striptease bars when they visited Japan, and Japanese visiting Illinois were taken to parties involving prostitutes.
In Japanese companies, women often work as "office ladies," serving tea and doing low-level clerical work. They usually are not eligible for promotions and are expected to retire after being married.
With women often being considered "workplace flowers," perhaps it is not surprising that one bank a few years ago told women coming to its welcoming party for new employees to wear swimsuits, according to Mizuho Fukushima, an lawyer handling sexual harassment cases. Kyoko Ode, a secretary at a law firm, said her boss at a previous company had drawn pictures of an outfit he wanted her to wear -- one containing transparent parts.
Men in particular work long hours in Japan, so often the chance for socializing is in after-hours drinking with co-workers or on company trips.
Yuko Yamada, who once worked for a small design firm, recalled one company trip at which everyone played a drinking game requiring them to chug alcohol or sing a song when they made a mistake. After she made three consecutive mistakes, the company president, a grandfather in his 60's, chirped, "Those who make three mistakes in a row have to kiss me."
"The other people, mostly middle-aged women, started yelling I should kiss him," Miss Yamada, who was only 18 at the time, recalled. "I couldn't really get away so I kissed the president on his cheek.
"Then he sat next to me and began to touch me all over," she recalled. "He started putting his hand inside my robe and proclaiming, 'Yamada is my girl.' I felt really nauseated."
Miss Yamada, now 27 and an employee of a software company, said the president's behavior continued after the trip. "But I tolerated it because I was quite broke at the time and I couldn't quit my job," she said.
Since the first sekuhara lawsuit was filed in Japan in 1989, awareness of the problem, especially among young men and women, has grown, said Ms. Fukushima, the lawyer. "There were problems before that but there was no word to describe it, so it was difficult to raise social consciousness," she said.
Still many men, and even women, think it is not much of a problem.
"We hear about the lawsuits in the States and that makes us feel like people there are too sensitive," said Kenji Fukuda, a 49-year-old trading company employee. Mr. Fukuda said that mentioning a woman's looks or even patting her gently on the behind was no problem and that some women even liked it. "The Japanese don't get so disgusted by that kind of behavior," he said.
Nikkei Woman, a magazine for working women, has never done a story on sexual harassment, one male editor said. "The issues we deal with are promotions and the glass ceiling, or how to get along with female co-workers," he said. "In other words, issues and problems that are more closely related to their daily lives."
Keiko Takei, a 27-year-old office lady at a big trading firm, said that for many of her co-workers "marriage is the goal of their lives." She added:"They sweat to decide what to wear to the office because they know their appearance will be commented on. They would be distressed if no one makes a remark."
But some comments, she said, go too far. "I've been told I have big breasts, and I really hate it," she said.
There is no specific law against sexual harassment, so those suing must use general civil law. Suits can take years in the courts, and awards are typically only a few thousand dollars. And victory can be difficult.
"Many of the recent cases regard harassment that happened behind closed doors," said Reiko Nakamura, a lawyer who handles such cases. "In such cases, the assaulters all deny the accusation. The judges question why the woman did not escape from the room, why she did not cry out."
Rather than suing, women complain to a local labor commission, which typically arranges an apology and a payment of a few thousand dollars.
One recent "victor" is a 55-year-old elementary school teacher in Hachioji, a western suburb of Tokyo, who sued her principal. Like most women who file sexual harassment suits in Japan, she declined to make her name public because it would bring unwanted attention and shame to her family.
One night in 1991, when she and the principal were returning from a late-night function that involved dinner and drinking, he suddenly unzipped his pants, grabbed her hand and rubbed it against his penis. When she resisted that and subsequent approaches, she said, the principal removed her from her classroom and gave her a minor job.
Last month, the court ruled the principal had wronged her by exposing himself but rejected her claim that her job change constituted harassment. The principal, who is appealing, was ordered to pay $5,000, a quarter of what she had sought.
"What I really wanted was to have him fired," said the woman, who now teaches at another school. "But he's still there."

HEADLINE: Study Details CUNY Successes From Open-Admissions Policy

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The open-admissions policy that 25 years ago transformed the City University of New York by guaranteeing entry to almost all New York City high school graduates was far more successful in educating needy students than earlier research suggested, according to a new long-term study of thousands of students.
The study, which surveyed students who entered the City University under the open-admissions policy, found that more than half received bachelor's degrees, sometimes more than a decade later, and they went on to better-paying jobs as a result. These students would have been denied entrance to CUNY under the selective admissions policy in force until 1970. 
 Earlier studies had suggested that only about one-third of students who began college under open admissions, and less than 25 percent of minority students, actually received degrees.
While a multitude of critics have contended that open admissions had lowered standards and failed to educate its students, the researchers, David E. Lavin and David Hyllegard, concluded that the ambitious effort to promote educational opportunity paid big dividends.
"Our data indicate that it provided opportunities that students used well, and that translated into direct benefits in the job market and clearly augmented the economic base," said Professor Lavin, who teaches sociology at the university's Graduate School and at Lehman College and who has been studying the effects of open admissions since the policy began. "These people would be in significantly worse shape if it weren't for open admissions."
The new research, which was reviewed by an independent academic panel, will be published by Yale University Press this month in a book, "Changing the Odds: Open Admissions and the Life Chances of the Disadvantaged."
The open-admissions program, adopted after politically charged debate in 1970, allowed any student with a high school average of 80 or more or a rank in the top half of a graduating class to enter one of the university's four-year colleges. Students with an average of 70 were allowed into the two-year community colleges. In September 1970, as open admissions went into effect, 35,000 freshmen poured into CUNY, up from about 20,000 a year earlier.
Out of a sample of roughly 35,000 students that they had originally studied in depth, Professor Lavin and Mr. Hyllegard followed up on about 5,000 students 12 to 14 years after they first entered the university as members of the first three open-admissions classes. Of the 100,000 students who entered CUNY's two- and four-year colleges from 1970 to 1972, about 48,000 would not have qualified had it not been for the open-admissions program.
Where earlier studies found high dropout rates among open-admissions students, the researchers found that given time, many of them did eventually graduate. And they estimated that more than 5,000 eventually went on to receive master's degrees or doctorates.
Some social scientists see the findings as important evidence in the debate over assistance to poor students, which until now has centered on whether CUNY has watered down the curriculum.
While this study addressed the issue of quality, finding that both employers and graduate school admissions committees still regarded the university and its graduates highly, it looked in greater depth at the long-term achievement of open-admissions students and the impact on the local economy.
"Public perceptions since the Reagan era are that we have been too loose and have let in too many unqualified people and should tighten our standards," said Gary Orfield, a professor of education and social policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "But the costs and the benefits have not been debated carefully enough."
Some critics of open admissions, like Herman Badillo, a City University trustee, are skeptical of the findings.
"On the face of it, these data are just not believable," he said. "What is the evidence that the students who drop out go on to another college? You can have all kinds of charts, but if you think about it, it is just not rational. The students don't have the money to transfer. That is why they are going to CUNY."
Other critics of open admissions say the new book may add useful information but should not be taken as the final word on the policy.
"I take Lavin very seriously," said James Traub, author of "City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College" (Addison-Wesley), which chronicled the struggles of some open-admissions students at City College to master basic English and mathematics skills and stay in school. "He is a very good scholar. But Lavin looks at the numbers, not at the texture of what's going on, and he misses something very important.
"What I found is that an enormous number of kids going through got a substandard education because their preparation was so poor that the college was forced to stoop to their level."
Professor Lavin and Mr. Hyllegard, who is director of institutional research at Manhattan Community College, acknowledge that some students are held back by poor preparation and that there are now sizable parts of the university dedicated to remedial classes.
But what is more important, they said, is that the basic education being offered is still sound and that a large number of students do succeed.
But Mr. Badillo, a former Congressman, said CUNY has inordinate numbers of unprepared students.
"As of now, 83 percent of all students coming into CUNY's community college require remediation," he said. "I don't know of any other college that takes in that many. You're not doing them a favor if you admit them to college and they're not ready. The reality is that they drop out."
The Lavin-Hyllegard research found that since open-admissions students -- and particularly minority students -- were typically poorer than other students, they often worked full time while they went to college and took much longer than four years to graduate.
"It was not unusual for black and Latino students to take up to 8 to 10 years to graduate," Professor Lavin said. "It is a monument to their persistence, but almost a lethal factor to their getting a postgraduate degree."
Among other important findings about open admissions were these:
*Minority students entered the university's freshman class in the same proportions that they had graduated from high school; they went from 9 percent of the entering class in 1969 to 24 percent from 1970 through 1972.
*The number of minority graduates rose. Of the 23,381 black and Hispanic students who entered CUNY in those years, more than 13,000 received degrees, including almost 2,300 who got graduate degrees.
*While the number of minority freshmen jumped to more than 8,000 in 1970, from fewer than 1,700 in 1969, the number of whites also mushroomed, from fewer than 16,000 in 1969 to an average of almost 26,000 from 1970 to 1972.
*The study estimated that during one year in the 1980's, graduates admitted under open admissions earned a total of almost $67 million more than they would have if the university's program had not been instituted. Their additional lifetime earnings were estimated at about $2 billion.
"The benefits of the policy flowed to a broad cross section of New York City's ethnic communities, both minority and white," the authors wrote.
They contend that the benefits are so clear that decisions by New York and other states to cut support for public universities are bad public policy. Over the years, various budget crises have led CUNY to tighten its admissions, making it harder for poorly prepared students to get into the four-year colleges. Typical of the changes are new requirements that students admitted to senior colleges master remedial work in one year, not more.
"What's going on now makes our findings even more relevant," Professor Lavin said. "Any policy that makes it more difficult for students to stay in college diminishes their earning power and detracts from the taxes they will pay and the tone of New York City and New York State."
While open admissions helped deliver higher education to disadvantaged students, the university did not collapse its own standards or lose its standing in the process, Professor Lavin said.
"There's no way you could say that CUNY turned into a diploma mill when more than 40 percent of the open-admissions students never earned bachelor's degrees, and two-thirds of the minority students never earned more than an associate's degree," he said.
At the same time, he added, the university remained one of the largest sources of undergraduate students who went on to earn doctorates in the United States.
He pointed to a National Research Council study of doctorates, which showed that from 1983 to 1992, 3,877 City University graduates -- about 15 percent of the total for all of New York State -- went on to earn Ph.D's. City College alone provided 860 and Brooklyn College, 947, while Columbia, less than half the size of those two colleges, turned out 798 and New York University, nearly 50 percent larger than Brooklyn College and more than 25 percent larger than City College, produced 934.
"It's clear that the CUNY system is still doing what higher education is supposed to do," Professor Lavin said. "You can't just laugh these numbers off."

HEADLINE: William E. Colby, 76, Head of C.I.A. in a Time of Upheaval

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
William E. Colby, who as Director of Central Intelligence chose to disclose some of the nation's darkest secrets to save the spy service he loved, drowned on April 27 in a tributary of the Potomac River in Maryland. He was 76 and lived in the Georgetown section of Washington.
The Charles County Sheriff's office said Mr. Colby's body was found today, nine days after he set out for a solo canoe trip from his weekend home in Rock Point, Md., not far from where his canoe washed up on the shore of the Wicomico River about a quarter-mile from his house. 
 Mr. Colby spent most of his adult life as a cold warrior in his country's clandestine service, "a soldier-priest," as a colleague called him, on a covert crusade. He perfected the look of an invisible man: gray suits, graying hair, glasses with translucent frames the color of pale white skin. More than one interlocutor noted that when asked a question he did not care to answer, he would tilt back his head so light reflected off the lenses of his glasses, turning his eyes into blank white disks.
But as the nation's chief spy, he helped reveal the Central Intelligence Agency's hidden history and confessed to its sins. In his eyes and in the eyes of many historians, he kept the agency from destroying itself or being destroyed by outsiders. And when the cold war was over, he proposed beating swords into plowshares, arguing that half of the billions for the Pentagon should go to education, economic competitiveness and programs for the poor.
This transformation began on April 27, 1973, 12 days before Mr. Colby learned that President Richard M. Nixon, then deeply enmeshed in the Watergate scandal, was about to nominate him as Director of Central Intelligence.
That day, the Federal judge at the trial of Daniel Ellsberg, a former Defense Department official charged with espionage after the Pentagon Papers, a secret history of the Vietnam War, were provided to The New York Times, disclosed that the office of Mr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist had been burglarized by White House operatives -- with technical assistance from the C.I.A.
"This was a shocker," Mr. Colby recounted in his 1978 memoir, "Honorable Men" (Simon & Schuster). His immediate predecessor, James R. Schlesinger, had vowed to tear the agency apart if necessary to "find out if there were questionable or illegal activities hidden in the secret recesses of our clandestine past that we didn't know about and that might explode at any time under our feet."
Many such land mines existed, but no one knew how many, or how explosive they were. Mr. Schlesinger ordered all agency employees and veterans who knew about such activities to report them -- and then departed to become Defense Secretary.
Mr. Colby, the agency's director of covert operations, was left with a task that violated every precept of a secret agency: compiling a list of the deepest secrets. And the list went on and on, growing to 693 single-spaced pages. The agency had violated its charter by spying on Americans, tapping their telephones, reading their tax returns and opening their mail. It had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro and other foreign leaders. It had conducted LSD experiments on unwitting human guinea pigs.
The agency's clandestine officers called the list "the family jewels," or "the skeletons." It stayed secret -- for a while.
Mr. Colby's confirmation hearings that summer were excruciating, in part because of his past in Vietnam. From 1968 to 1971, under the aegis of the Agency for International Development, Mr. Colby had run programs that included Operation Phoenix. Conceived by the White House and supported by the C.I.A., that program sought to expose Vietcong agents working in South Vietnam.
Phoenix killed 20,587 Vietnamese. Mr. Colby told Congress in 1971 that these deaths included "illegal killing." As the confirmation hearings convened in July 1973, antiwar protesters plastered Washington with wanted posters emblazoned with Mr. Colby's face, a skull and crossbones and the ace of spades, a symbol of death, his home telephone, which he insisted remain listed, rang with angry calls throughout the night.
After the hearings, conducted largely in private sessions, Mr. Colby was confirmed as the nation's 10th Director of Central Intelligence. Before the vote, he decided to share the family jewels with a few select members of Congress. That was how the C.I.A. did business with the legislative branch in those days.
The secrets did not keep. In December 1974, The New York Times reported that the agency had spied on Americans, and Mr. Colby was a source for the article. Now the pressure for a full Congressional investigation grew irresistible. Mr. Colby cooperated, and the skeletons began tumbling out of the closet.
Senior agency officers called him a traitor. Some hinted that he was a Soviet agent. Those hints grew darker in January 1975, after Mr. Colby dismissed James J. Angleton, for 20 years the agency's chief of counterintelligence. Obsessed with a search for a Soviet spy inside the agency, Mr. Angleton had developed ornate theories of Soviet plots to subvert the United States. Few outsiders understood them -- "possibly because Angleton's explanations were impossible to follow, or possibly because the evidence just didn't add up," Mr. Colby wrote in his memoir.
Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence from 1991 to 1993, recalled that 1975 was the worst year in the agency's history. Mr. Colby spent the year testifying before Congressional committees, and the essence of his testimony became public: the assassination plots, the coups and the spying on Americans. Mr. Colby "had no choice in 1975 but to cooperate," but the agency's pride, "however based on a fiction, took a blow from which we never recovered," Mr. Gates recounts in his just-published memoir, "From the Shadows," (Simon and Schuster).
To save the agency, Mr. Colby believed, he had to confess to its sins. He felt it crucial to educate Congress, the press and the public about the agency. "The agency's survival," he wrote in his memoirs, "could only come from understanding, not hostility, built on knowledge, not faith."
Even after his dismissal as Director of Central Intelligence in November 1975 by President Gerald R. Ford, who believed that Mr. Colby had been too forthcoming, Mr. Colby insisted that he had done the right thing by throwing the cloak off the cloak-and-dagger business.
The end result of his decision was a permanent system of Congressional oversight of the agency -- and a public understanding that the C.I.A. was a tool of Presidential power, not a rogue elephant. When it trampled people, the blame was on the elephant rider: the President of the United States.
By demanding that understanding, Mr. Colby was "playing a very heavy card, trumping the White House by bringing the American people into the secret world," John Ranelagh wrote in his history of the intelligence service, "The Agency" (Simon & Schuster, 1986). But Mr. Colby "got what he wanted: no President could put the C.I.A. in a bottle and throw it away."
His calm in this crisis -- his enemies called it cold-bloodedness -- was composed in equal parts of his grounding in espionage, the military and the Roman Catholic Church. He thought spying for one's country an honorable task, he followed legitimate orders to the hilt and his public confessions took the form of atonement and redemption.
William Egan Colby was born on Jan. 4, 1920, in St. Paul, the son of Elbridge and Margaret Egan Colby. His father, a sensitive nonconformist who wrote and taught literature, became a career Army officer. His family moved constantly, living everywhere from Tientsin, China, to Burlington, Vt.
He enrolled in Princeton University in 1937 and graduated in 1940 with a liberal education and outlook, a Phi Beta Kappa key, R.O.T.C. experience and a deep antipathy to Fascism and Communism. He entered Columbia Law School, but left to join the Army and serve in World War II. He cheated on an eye examination to become a paratrooper, unwittingly taking a path that would lead him into the clandestine world.
In 1943, answering a call for officers who could speak fluent French, he became a member of the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime American espionage agency.
In 1944, he parachuted behind German lines to link up with a French resistance group. In 1945, he commanded a squad of saboteurs who blew up German rail lines in the snows of northern Norway. For these missions, he earned the Silver Star and the French Croix de Guerre.
After the war, he returned to Columbia and received a law degree in 1947. He then joined the Manhattan law firm then known as Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Lombard, run by the founder of the Office of Strategic Services, William J. Donovan. But the law, frankly, bored him, and he joined the fledgling C.I.A. in 1950.
Posing as a diplomat, Mr. Colby served in Stockholm from 1951 to 1953; in Rome from 1953 to 1958; and, fatefully, as the C.I.A.'s station chief in Saigon from 1959 to 1962. He was responsible for all the agency's covert operations in Asia from 1962 to 1967, as the United States went to war in Vietnam. He returned for some of the worst years of the war there, in the doomed cause of winning the hearts and minds of the people.
Mr. Colby left Saigon and returned to Washington in 1971, in part to care for his eldest daughter, Catherine, who was slowly dying of anorexia nervosa. At headquarters, he took on desk jobs that led two years later to the directorship.
In retirement, Mr. Colby lectured, practiced law and worked as a risk consultant to clients that included New York investment banks. In the 1980's, he began speaking out against the nuclear arms race. He argued, along with old hawks like former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, for deep cuts in nuclear weapons stockpiles. Those cuts are slowly becoming a reality in the 1990's. And he founded the American Commitee for a Free Vietnam, which sought to strengthen human rights and democracy in Vietnam.
In recent months, Mr. Colby became senior editor of Strategic Weekly Briefings, a faxed newsletter, and embarked on a quintessential post-cold-war endeavor: marketing a computer CD-ROM game about espionage and counter-terrorism he created with Oleg Kalugin, a former top Soviet intelligence officer.
Mr. Colby's marriage to the former Barbara Heinzen ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Sally Shelton-Colby, an assistant administrator for global programs at the Agency for International Development and a former Ambassador to Grenada, Barbados and eight other eastern Caribbean countries; his children from his first marriage, Jonathan, Carl, Paul and Christine, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Mexican Border: A Shifting Line in the Mud

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: LOS ALGODONES, Mexico

 BODY:
Some people in Washington want to seal the border completely, while some in Mexico City want to use it as a pretext for condemning imperialistic brutality. Alton L. Goff and Alfredo Martinez Orantes only want to know exactly where that emotionally charged line between the United States and Mexico really is.
"I think it's right here, the center of the normal flow channel," said Mr. Goff, chief of the Yuma, Ariz., office of the International Boundary and Water Commission, a quiet warren of engineers and surveyors who for more than a century have watched over the line. He was standing on the western end of the Morelos Dam, where the Colorado River forms 24 miles of the 1,952-mile border between the two countries. 
 "The line? It's over there, above gate number 19," said Mr. Martinez, who runs the dam for Mexico. He pointed across the dam to a spot about 100 yards away where the 19th of 20 floodgates in the international dam is stuck deep in river mud.
That kind of imprecision is not uncommon along this bit of border, where the meanderings of the Colorado and an awesome 1993 flood instantly made obsolete the careful markings of the frontier. In some spots, the raging flood waters moved the channel hundreds of yards into American or Mexican territory.
The waters have long since returned to their former levels, but not to their former channel. That has left most of this area an international question mark, with no real definition. The situation has not yet caused serious problems, and it is unlikely to do so in the future.
But with a covey of Cabinet members from Mexico and the United States gathering in Mexico on May 6 to discuss a range of sensitive issues, the difficulty in precisely defining the line is a small symbol of the many conflicts raging over the border, especially illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
By treaty, the boundary here at the western end of the old Gadsden Purchase is the point where the east-west boundary line separating Arizona from Sonora meets the normal flow channel of the Colorado. Problem is, the river has been dammed at several places, and so much water is diverted into reservoirs, canals and irrigation ditches in both the United States and Mexico that the mighty Colorado is bone dry miles before it gets to this point. With no normal flow, defining a normal flow channel becomes tricky.
"If we say the Border Patrol fence comes out along this line to here, and this is more or less where the normal flow channel used to be, you could say the border is somewhere around here," Mr. Goff said, mustering as much precision as he could.
The forerunner of the International Boundary and Water Commission was established with the signing of the 1848 treaty that ended the Mexican-American War and gave the United States control over a third of what had been Mexican territory from New Mexico to California.
"We really are engineer diplomats," said Rene A. Valenzuela, spokesman for the American side of the binational commission. "The problems we deal with are engineering problems and the solutions usually are very clear."
But some solutions take incredible patience. In 1967, the commission finally resolved a 100-year dispute that arose when a flood sent the Rio Grande on a new course, adding about 600 acres to El Paso at the expense of its Mexican neighbor, Ciudad Juarez.
By the time the Mexicans complained loudly, Anglo settlement had spread to the tract of land, known as Chamizal.
The negotiations between the two sides dragged on for years. "The Mexican Revolution was going on with shots being fired right across the river, but the Chamizal dispute negotiations continued in a courtroom here and were not affected at all," Manuel R. Ybarra, secretary of the American side of the commission, said in his office in El Paso.
Finally, Mexico agreed that it did not make sense to demand that El Paso surrender the Chamizal. The United States in exchange gave up an equivalent amount of land downriver. And to make sure such problems did not arise again, the commission decided to straighten 4.4 miles of the recalcitrant river and line the bed with concrete so the Rio Grande, and the border, would not move.
The commission may end up doing something similar along the Colorado. Mexican surveyors are now studying the flooded areas and preparing a swap proposal that would divvy up the disputed lands.
But even though heated words from Washington and Mexico City often make it appear that the two neighbors want to build a good, sturdy 2,000-mile fence between them, most of the line exists only on paper.
For instance, in San Luis Rio Colorado, the steel fence put up by the Border Patrol a few years ago ends abruptly not far from the official border crossing and is replaced by three-foot high sand dunes.
Mexicans cross the border at San Luis, Ariz., regularly to shop at a new K-Mart or work in the irrigated alfalfa fields on the American side. Americans cross at Los Algodones to visit dentists and cut-rate drug stores including Farmacia Uno, which invites passers-by to "Check Ours Prices."
The pressure of course comes not from the people who live at the border but from the desperate farm workers and unemployed young people in Mexico's poor south, whose perception of the border is of a magical gateway to a place they have only imagined.
But that place often turns out to be as imaginary as the line itself. Even the steel walls can deceive. One scorching afternoon in San Luis, Alfredo Camacho, a local art teacher, was out with five children from the local community center painting scenes on the wall.
"At least this way the wall will have some purpose," said Mr. Camacho as he helped one young boy paint a dove. "Otherwise, why have it here to separate us?"

Claim Rejected on Dismissal At Metallgesellschaft Unit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 6

 BODY:
Metallgesellschaft A.G. said today that a panel of arbitrators in New York had rejected a claim by the company's former chief oil trader that he was unfairly dismissed after more than $1 billion in trading losses that brought the German company to the brink of bankruptcy.
The arbitrators concluded in a 34-page opinion that W. Arthur Benson, the former president of MG Refining and Marketing, an American unit of Metallgesellschaft, had significantly damaged the company through reckless trading. The panel rejected Mr. Benson's argument that Metallgesellschaft and its banks had caused the losses by scuttling his trading strategy. 
 After being dismissed in February 1994, Mr. Benson sued the MG Corporation, the company's main United States subsidiary, in Federal District Court in Baltimore. The case went to arbitrators after a court ruled that Mr. Benson's contract required arbitration.
In an opinion filed on Friday, the arbitrators said that Mr. Benson had exposed the company to heavy cash losses by selling long-term oil contracts at fixed prices, then securing the contracts by buying short-term futures. The arbitrators criticized his refusal to waver from the strategy even as oil prices fell.
Metallgesellschaft, a conglomerate whose largest businesses are mining and engineering, was criticized in 1994 after it liquidated its oil futures positions. Articles written by Merton H. Miller, a professor at the University of Chicago who is a Nobel laureate in economics, and others contended that Metallgesellschaft had bailed out of Mr. Benson's strategy too soon.
"MG's position has been vindicated," the president and chief executive of MG, Thomas A. McKeever, said in a statement today.
Metallgesellschaft has said it had no choice but to pull the plug on an operation that had become unauthorized speculation.
Mr. Benson said he was shocked by the ruling. "I hope that the panel's ruling will not impede innovation by other individuals who see a way to market products in a manner that is not traditional within the industry," he said in a prepared statement.
Mr. Benson declined to comment on whether he would seek to appeal the ruling. Arbitration decisions usually can be appealed only under limited circumstances.
The arbitration panel has yet to rule on a defamation claim that Mr. Benson has filed against Metallgesellschaft.
Mr. Benson was hired by the company in November 1991 to run the oil marketing business of MG.

HEADLINE: U.N. Extends Iraq Oil Sanctions As a Prod in New Round of Talks

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 6

 BODY:
A fourth round of negotiations on a deal that would allow Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to pay for urgent civilian needs opened here tonight, hours after the Security Council extended for 60 days the blanket sanctions that have severely damaged the Iraqi economy.
Although the two issues are not directly linked, diplomats said that the unanimity with which the sanctions were renewed should dissuade the Iraqis from letting the oil-for-food talks fail, since it is unlikely that the unrestricted sale of Iraqi oil will be possible any time soon. 
 Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, said after the sanctions renewal vote this morning that President Saddam Hussein should realize that the restricted oil-sale plan was "the best route for the people of Iraq to get what they need."
Under the plan, proposed by the Security Council last year to counter criticism that sanctions were hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Iraqis, Iraq would be permitted to sell $1 billion in oil in renewable 90-day periods. The sanctions have prevented Iraq from selling oil on the world market in any significant way since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Under present restrictions, Iraq is allowed to export some oil for medicines and food. American officials say that the new oil plan would merely enhance the existing arrangement substantially. But they charge that President Hussein seemed to think he could rewrite the arrangements to give the Iraqi Government greater power over the money raised by larger sales and over the methods of distribution of food and other supplies bought with the income.
Iraq is very closely monitored now by American and other forces in the Persian Gulf area. American and United Nations officials say that while some oil is smuggled to markets with the help of Iran, the amount does not come close to undermining the 1990 sanctions.
Over the weekend President Clinton sent Congress a report on the clandestine sales, saying that ships carrying $1.1 million in petroleum products and $1.4 million in dates had been intercepted in recent months. The Presidential report was one of a series routinely submitted to Congress to keep legislators up to date on Iraqi compliance with sanctions.
After three rounds of talks here on the new oil offer, negotiations broke down last month over an Iraqi demand that Baghdad could choose the bank to handle the money raised and over what the United States and Britain regarded as loopholes that President Hussein had written into a memorandum of understanding that would allow his Government to restrict delivery of emergency supplies in northern territories inhabited by the Kurds or set political conditions for the receipt of goods.
The last-minute intervention by the British and Americans led to charges in Baghdad that the Security Council was rewriting the rules illegally. Americans say that while the Secretary General or his negotiators are not required to seek Security Council approval as they conduct talks with Iraq, the Council will not allow the intent of its oil plan to be subverted in any way.
Broader sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted by the Council until Baghdad has eliminated or otherwise accounted for all its weapons of mass destruction. Disclosures last year that Iraq had consistently lied in its accounting, and several incidents of noncooperation with United Nations arms inspectors this year, have cost Iraq what limited sympathy and support it was beginning to find in the Security Council.

HEADLINE: Russia's Communists Have New, Mixed Manifesto

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 6

 BODY:
Yuri D. Maslyukov took another puff from his cigarette and smiled about his recent meeting with a senior official from the International Monetary Fund.
"It was like people from the Hawaiian Islands trying to talk to Eskimos," chuckled Mr. Maslyukov, who is a top adviser to the Communist candidate for President of Russia, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, and is also the chairman of Parliament's Committee for Economic Policy. 
 With the election just a month away, Mr. Zyuganov has painted his economic program in generalities and platitudes to avoid unsettling non-Communist voters.
But a Communist brain trust is beginning to assemble. And while Communist economists have yet to produce a master plan, they have deep-seated assumptions about how to redirect the economy away from President Boris N. Yeltsin's reform path and toward greater state control.
They disdain the International Monetary Fund and its tough demands that Russia limit the printing of money and lower barriers to free trade.
In a reflection of their Marxist training, they see stimulating industrial and agricultural production as a cure for Russia's economic problems, even though Western economists warn that this would mean propping up inefficient enterprises.
They argue that Russia's history, its blend of European and Asian cultures -- and even its climate -- make it an exception to the normal laws of economics.
The specialists are an unusual group. Mr. Maslyukov, the former head of the Soviet Union's state planning agency, Gosplan, and a military industrial planning committee, is a key player.
The team also includes a former economics professor from the Rostov Railroad Transport Engineers Institute, and an ethnologist who argues that Russia should follow India's 1969 plan to nationalize leading banks. Another prominent Communist in the group is a nightclub owner and banker who aspires to be Russia's next Economics Minister.
The Communists have also begun to draw on Gorbachev-era economic advisers and academicians who have been languishing in Moscow's research institutes.
Seeking to reassure Russian and Western business executives, the Communists insist that they will support a mixed economy of private and Government-controlled enterprises if they win the election.
"Everyone expects us to wave sabers left and right," said Igor M. Bratishchev, the former Rostov professor and a member of Parliament who is running a policy planning team for Mr. Zyuganov. "We will not make impulsive moves."
But critics assert that the Communists do not speak the language of modern economics and that their inexperience, as much as their ideological commitments, will lead them down the path to an inefficient and rigidly administered command economy.
"None of them knows how the modern economy works," said Vladimir Mau, an economist with an economic institute headed by former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, a supporter of President Boris N. Yeltsin. "They want to make the economy old-style so that they will know how to deal with it."
 
I.M.F. a Target Of Communist Ire
In trying to hammer out an economic plan, the Communists are more clear about what they are against than what they are for. For many, the International Monetary Fund has become a symbol of heavy-handed Western intervention that has made life harder.
With the strong encouragement of the fund, the Yeltsin Government has restricted the money supply, lowered tariffs and carried out free-market reforms.
The monthly rate of inflation has fallen from 18 percent in January 1995 to less than 3 percent. And the monetary fund recently approved a $10.1 billion loan, which will help Russia pay back wages and finance much of its budget deficit.
But the Russian election is also taking place before the spurt of economic growth projected by the fund. Unemployment has increased. Privatization of Government-owned enterprises has been tainted by reports of favoritism and corruption.
While Mr. Yeltsin has boasted of his ability to obtain loans from the fund, the Communists have sought to convert the President's close association with the fund and its Western leaders into a political liability.
Peering over the piles of papers in his office in Parliament, Mr. Bratishchev said that Russia might need the fund's money in the short term, but that the fund's long-term reforms were incompatible with Russia's unique economic and political culture.
Russia, he argues, is not receptive to major land reform and other extensive free-market measures because it is a mixture of European and Asian cultures and has a collective heritage and a harsh climate.
"Russia is the most northern civilization, and we have to act quite cautiously in our conditions," he said. "This is not being taken into consideration by the I.M.F. We should not be evaluated by commonly accepted measures."
 
Old-School Marxists Accorded Respect
Dislike for the monetary fund among the Communist rank and file has been reinforced by old-school academicians at the Russian Academy of Sciences like Leonid Abalkin.
A former top aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Abalkin insists that he is not taking sides in the election. But the academicians are spoken of in almost almost reverential terms by the Communists.
In an interview, Mr. Abalkin complained that "Russia is losing its independence to carry out its internal economic policy."
"Its policy is not being decided by Parliament, but by the I.M.F.," he said.
By way of example, Mr. Abalkin said that one important move supported by the fund, the elimination of tariffs on oil and gas exports, was wrongheaded.
The fund has put the Communists on notice that the new $10.1 billion loan will be revoked if a new Communist government does not stay the course and follow the fund's three-year program of capitalist reforms.
But Mr. Abalkin has written that Russia needs to undertake free market reforms incrementally over a period of decades. And he says that by improving tax collection, Russia could make do without the fund's loans.
Mr. Maslyukov took a more politic line, suggesting that the need to funnel Government funds to needy enterprises might require a new Communist government to seek a new accommodation with the fund to loosen the money supply.
The Communists' complaints have drawn fire from Western specialists, who say the fund's blessing is critical to maintain the confidence of foreign governments and investors.
Instead of stressing the need to press ahead with reforms, the Communists underscore the importance of using subsidies and tariffs to stimulate industrial and agricultural production.
By increasing production, they often argue, Russia can boost employment, revive ailing factories, generate tax revenue and increase the supply of goods, thus driving down inflation.
The Communists have also coupled their promises of aid to ailing industries with populist pledges of guaranteed employment, free education, free health care and cheap housing that far exceed Mr. Yeltsin's campaign largesse, adding to their burden if they come to office.
"What really irks them is, it is true a lot of factories are empty, and it seems illogical to them that a country that once produced 160 million metric tons of steel now produces closer to 80 and 90," said Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economics professor at Harvard University and a former adviser to the Yeltsin Government. "They can't see that the reason is nobody wanted all that steel."
 
Looking East, To India's Example
Citing the need to increase production, the Communist policy team is turning to the East, specifically to India.
Oleg V. Malyarov, a member of the policy team working under Mr. Bratishchev and an ethnologist by training, cited India's experience in nationalizing major banks in 1969 and introducing high tariffs.
By following the Indian example and establishing new Government banks, Mr. Bratishchev and Mr. Malyarov argued, Russia could dispense credits in economically depressed areas.
Western economists consider these Indian policies to be major blunders and say the Indian economy began to take off when they were changed. Western economists also insist that increasing the supply of goods will not lower inflation unless Russian factories succeed in making high-quality consumer items that people want.
Private property is also a sensitive issue for businessmen worried about renationalization, and one that the Communists have not addressed in detail.
The Communists say they will allow the privatization of some state-owned property. But they say they will renationalize those enterprises whose privatization, in their view, was not lawful or socially useful.
Vladimir V. Semago, a Communist member of Parliament, banker and nightclub owner, said in an interview that a Communist victory "does not mean at all that we will switch to a 100 percent controlled economy."
 
Compensation Promised to Owners
The owners of any enterprises that are nationalized will receive compensation, said Mr. Semago, who added that he hoped to become the Economics Minister in a new Communist government.
Sergei Glazyev, a left-leaning Parliament member and a member of the party known as the Congress of Russian Communities, said he expected the Communists to "intervene in the so-called basic industries" -- energy, transportation, telecommunications, military production and foreign trade -- and put them under strict state control.
But Anatoly B. Chubais, a former Deputy Prime Minister who headed the Government's privatization program and who is backing Mr. Yeltsin's election team, said there was not enough money in the Russian budget to buy back privatized enterprises at fair market prices.
Mr. Chubais warned that the Communists would essentially resort to confiscation, which could lead to unrest. And he charged that Mr. Maslyukov and other Communist specialists had failed to master the economic facts.
"When I was in the Government I had 20 to 25 high-level people I could trust," Mr. Chubais said. "They were super-skilled macroeconomists. But not one of them will work under the Communists. There is no one of such type within the economic team of the Communists."
But those sort of statements are dismissed as elitism by the Communist rank and file.
Mr. Malyarov, the policy team member, noted proudly that he had recently completed a book on Mr. Chubais's privatization program entitled "The Crime of the Century Will Be Stopped by the People."
"The bad thing about economists ruling the country is that they consider that only they know the right way," he added.

HEADLINE: Behind the Cloak of Office, Clinton's War Room Hums

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The settings are tailor-made for Bill Clinton's shadow campaign.
Beginning Friday, Mr. Clinton will don academic robes for a flying series of commencement addresses that put Mr. Clinton the President, not the candidate, on display, trying for a tone high above the charge and countercharge of political combat. 
 Yet even as Mr. Clinton takes care to give no hint of the consuming re-election drive under way, his White House is already humming like a well-oiled political machine. Clinton-Gore headquarters on M Street is filling up, and the President's political strategists are planning to have at least 40 state Democratic campaign coordinators in place by Memorial Day.
The White House has become relentless in its opposition research, answering Senator Bob Dole's call for a repeal of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline with a list of gasoline tax increases that Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican nominee for President, has supported in his Capitol Hill career. And the Democratic National Committee has become so quick that within 24 hours of Mr. Dole's recent attack on judges appointed by Mr. Clinton as soft on crime, it had a 30-second commercial on the air boosting the President's crime-fighting credentials.
This combination of outward incumbent serenity and an internal staff war footing is the key to Mr. Clinton's re-election strategy.
Mr. Clinton is in a personal drive to push his positive ratings ever higher before the Democratic National Convention in August by using all of the rhetorical, ceremonial and majestic possibilities of incumbency. The goal is to appear Presidential, not merely political. To this end, Mr. Clinton has even forsaken the traditional formal announcement of his candidacy.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton's aides are waging an ever-more public campaign designed to insure that the President's approval ratings translate into victory in November.
So far the linked strategies -- along with Republican disarray -- appear to be producing the desired result. Mr. Clinton, so soundly repudiated in the 1994 Congressional elections, is showing some of the highest approval ratings of his Presidency and maintaining a lead of 15 to 20 points over Mr. Dole in national polls.
Congressional Democrats, who once fled joint appearances with the weakened President, now clamor to stand by his side, and Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances of winning back control of the House. Around the nation, Mr. Clinton is running better than expected in Republican-leaning states like Arizona, Florida, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Virginia, states that Mr. Dole cannot afford to lose.
All this could prove evanescent, particularly with a volatile electorate increasingly disconnected from party allegiances. "The good news is we're doing a lot better," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "The bad news is the election isn't tonight.
Republicans insist that the race will tighten and that traditional Republican voters and states will come home to the party. At this time four years ago, they note, President George Bush was 16 points ahead of Mr. Clinton.
But Mr. Clinton's current margins, Democrats counter, mean that the Republicans could be forced to divert money and resources from the major battleground states to those they had expected to win easily. "Your base usually does come back," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. "But if you start out without your base intact, it's an indication of how far you have to go."
For months the President's political advisers have assumed that Mr. Clinton's drive for re-election would be divided into two distinct periods: a "referendum" period in which the public judges whether it approves of Mr. Clinton, followed by the head-to-head contest after the party nominating conventions this summer.
In this first period, the goal is to pull Mr. Clinton's approval ratings up so high before the conventions that he will have the aura of invincibility that President Ronald Reagan had in his 1984 re-election campaign. "You don't win the campaign for votes in the fall," said Ann F. Lewis, the President's deputy campaign manager, "if you don't win the campaign for public opinion first in the spring."
This effort began a year ago when Mr. Clinton moved to the political center and embraced the Republicans' goal of a balanced budget.
The next step was to paint the Republicans as "extremists" out of sync with the nation in their efforts to scale back spending on Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. The President's budget vetoes and his decision to send American troops to Bosnia also helped combat the earlier impression of Mr. Clinton as reluctant to stand up for his principles.
This year, the President moved to take over some of the Republicans' cultural issues, advocating school uniforms and school competency tests, fighting tobacco use by teen-agers and supporting use of a television chip that would allow parents to screen out programming they find unacceptable for their children.
Now, Mr. Clinton's aides say, the President will use a series of commencement speeches on foreign policy, economic policy and social values to define his views sharply, hoping to answer critics who say he still has not painted a full vision for a second term.
Since last fall, a steady $1 million-a-week television advertising campaign has been amplifying the President's themes in the third of the country that the Clinton campaign considers to be the true battleground for November. Paid for by the Democratic National Committee, the campaign has largely sidestepped the Northeast and stayed out of big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, where Mr. Clinton is considered safely ahead and television time is expensive.
Instead, the commercials have been running in other parts of California, across the Pacific Northwest, in Colorado and New Mexico, which both voted for Mr. Clinton in 1992, and even Arizona, which last voted Democratic in a Presidential election in 1948.
In the South, the campaign has focused on Florida, which Mr. Clinton narrowly lost in 1992, North Carolina and Tennessee, Vice President Al Gore's home state. And they are running all across the states of the industrial Midwest as well as in Iowa and Pennsylvania.
Recently, the tone of the commercials has changed, painting a negative portrait of Mr. Dole. In a commercial on crime, color pictures of Mr. Clinton signing bills were contrasted with black-and-white shots of Mr. Dole, always side by side with Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose popularity ratings plummeted last year. The message was, "Their old ways don't work." Mr. Clinton's crime plan was called, "The new way."
The Democratic National Committee has now spent nearly $25 million on this campaign, none of which is charged against Federal spending limits on the Presidential campaign, since it revolves around legislative issues. With the Clinton-Gore campaign still hoarding more than $20 million in unspent primary-season money, a multimillion-dollar onslaught of new Clinton spots is scheduled before the August party conventions.
While Republicans agree that current polling makes the picture look bad for Mr. Dole, they say voting trends show that the Republicans have a natural advantage on the electoral map and predict that states will ultimately stay true to their voting histories. They also believe that some economic issues will work to their benefit.
Eddie Mahe Jr., a Republican political strategist and former deputy party chairman, mocked the idea that Republicans would have to use any resources to win in Arizona.
"If we have to spend 7 cents to save Arizona," Mr. Mahe said, "then let's cancel the election and just have an inauguration." Democratic contentions that such a state was up for grabs, he said are "pure mind games."
Several Democratic stratetgists admit privately that they are worried, for instance, about the potency of a Republican appeal based on tax cuts. Significantly, in the recent sparring with Mr. Dole the White House has not closed the door on a repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax.
As Clinton aides prepare to send out a fleet of political veterans to coordinate the state-by-state campaigns, they say they are casting a broad net.
"We don't want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where everybody says that you can't win a certain state," said Douglas Sosnick, the President's director of political affairs. "We want to make sure that if in September we might very well be able to win Arizona, we've done the things needed to enhance our ability to win."

Study Backs CUNY Admissions
The open-admissions policy that 25 years ago transformed the City University of New York by guaranteeing entry to almost all New York City high school graduates was far more successful in educating needy students than earlier research suggested, according to a new long-term study of thousands of students. The study, which surveyed students who entered the City University under the open-admissions policy, found that more than half received bachelor's degrees. [Page A1.]
 
Helmsleys Are Sued by Partners
Two of Harry Helmsley's longtime partners in the Helmsley-Spear realty firm have sued the Helmsleys, alleging that Leona Helmsley was stripping the company of its assets and essentially rendering it insolvent to avoid paying the partners millions of dollars. But the dispute is not just about money. The quarrel is more about control and ego and bonds of loyalty being unwound. [A1.]
 
Joycean Saga of an Exhibition
The rare book dealer Glenn Horowitz is holding an opening night party in his East Side shop to celebrate a $2.4 million exhibition of first edition works by Joyce, including two copies of "Ulysses" signed by the author. Mr. Horowitz acquired the bulk of the collection from his longtime client, Dennis M. Silverman, the former president of Local 810, who was ousted by the Teamsters for misappropriation of funds. [B1.]
 
Church Worker Is Accused
An employee in the accounting and pension operations of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn was accused by the head of the diocese of stealing more than $1 million in church money. Since 1990, the employee managed the diocesan pension office and its system of benefits to 3,600 retired lay employees. [B1.]
 
Transit, the Good and the Bad
Subway lines on Manhattan's West Side took a bath, literally, when a geezer of a water main became a geyser, yet the Transit Authority resumed normal runs within 16 hours. Not bad. But that fine performance does not diminish rider dissatisfaction with overall service. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Labor Chief in Political Spat
A meeting between New York City's labor leaders and Congressional Democrats was shaping up as a lovefest, but then Stanley Hill, executive director of the city's largest municipal employees union, stunned everyone by lauding Mayor Giuliani and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, while criticizing Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. [B3.]
 
Pataki on School Spending
Governor Pataki called on the agency that builds public schools in New York City to stop spending money to buy art for schools, contending that the nearly $12 million that the agency has spent over five years should have been used for repairs. [B5.]
 
Budget Stalemate Intensifies

HEADLINE: Looted of Art, German Town Now Feels Economically Plundered

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: QUEDLINBURG, Germany

 BODY:
Six years ago, word reached this medieval town in eastern Germany that its fabled stolen treasures, lost since World War II, had been found in Texas. But people were preoccupied then: their land was about to be reunified.
Now, the trial of the people accused of selling the stolen treasure back to Germany is to open in Texas later this year. But this news finds people still preoccupied, not with the excitements of German reunification, but with its legacy: this town may boast royal treasure, but it does not have too many jobs. 
 "Unemployment -- that's what people talk about," said Friedemann Gosslau, a former Protestant minister here who was one of three people to bring the treasure back to Germany from Whitewright, Tex., in 1992.
In 1945, when American troops briefly occupied the town, Lieut. Joe Tom Meador mailed parts of the Quedlinburg treasure -- golden reliquaries, Fatimid crystal, gospel texts bound in gold, even King Henry's ivory comb -- back to Texas.
Lieutenant Meador died in 1980, and his brother and sister -- Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook -- tried to sell the treasures in the medieval art market.
In negotiations from 1990 to 1992, the new German state paid $2.75 million to get the treasures back, but now the brother and sister, and their lawyer, John S. Torigian, face trial in Sherman, Tex., for dealing in stolen goods.
"If you look at it from the legal standpoint, it's right to do it," said Werner Bley, the custodian of the Quedlinburg treasures. "But what will it achieve?"
Mr. Gosslau, the former pastor, said: "Those people hurt us. They could have returned the treasure without payment. But, in German, we say: this is snow from yesterday."
The more immediate preoccupations are evident.
Across this part of Germany, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, unemployment runs at more than 20 percent, more than twice a national average that is itself the highest in postwar German history.
But while for some in the western part of the country there is still a prospect of the economic pendulum swinging back in their favor, here in the former East Germany, permanent joblessness has become the grim legacy of reunification.
Take, for instance, the town of Eisleben, 30 miles from here, where the copper mines that drew Martin Luther's father to settle more than 500 years ago still provided work for some 22,000 miners until reunification in 1990.
Even though they had long been economically unviable, the Communist authorities put greater stress on jobs than efficiency.
With the western capitalist system that has since taken root, most of the mines have been closed; only 2,000 of the miners now have steady work.
Here the story is the same. With reunification in 1990, economic principles from the west forced the closing of most of the town's inefficient industries, including a steelworks, and the notion of guaranteed work, a pillar of Communist society, died with them.
Some in this town have come to question whether, treasure or not, the process of reunification has been to their advantage.
"Everything is so expensive," said Mr. Bley, the custodian of the Quedlinburg treasures. "The party used to rule. Now money rules."
"It's the system," he added. "It's as bad as Communism. It exploits the poor. It's unsocial."
Referring to the year the Berlin wall fell, he added, "We should have thought more deeply in 1989."

The Real Bosnia Debate

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
For the past few months U.S. and NATO officials have been saying how pleased they are at how well the cease-fire and separation of forces in Bosnia has been implemented, but how upset they are that the political clauses of the Dayton peace agreement -- such as the return of refugees and the holding of elections -- have not been carried out. This is not an accident. This is a structural contradiction at the heart of Dayton. And it may soon become the foreign policy issue in the U.S. election.
The very reason the Bosnia cease-fire holds so well is the very reason the political clauses are not being implemented. The cease-fire holds because each of the Bosnian factions is led by authoritarian-nationalist figures, who can give an order to halt the fighting and it will be obeyed right down the line. The reason the political clauses are not being implemented is because they threaten the power bases of many of these same leaders, who have an interest in keeping Bosnia divided and the conflict defined in nationalist terms to insure their hold on power. When it comes to implementing the cease-fire, says Lieut. Gen. Michael Walker, commander of NATO ground forces in Bosnia, the Serbian, Muslim and Croatian leaders give all the right orders. But when it comes to the political clauses, "What we are getting is not only a failure to instruct" but rather "instructions in the opposite direction." General Walker said the actions of Serbian, Croatian and Muslim leaders "indicate a preference for partition." 
 NATO can live with partition. It just wants a quiet Bosnia until it leaves. But the diplomats believe that the West must try to achieve the unification of Bosnia that Dayton promised. That's only possible if NATO removes Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the two indicted Serbian war criminals who remain in charge in the separatist Bosnian Serb Republic. Because if elections were held now Mr. Karadzic would be re-elected as president, giving him a democratic mandate sanctioned by the international community -- the last thing the West wants to promote. The NATO allies had been hoping that the Serbs themselves would eliminate Messrs. Mladic and Karadzic. But that's not happening. So the pressure is rising on NATO to capture them to promote unity, and NATO doesn't want to do that for fear of upsetting stability -- and for fear of making NATO a party to the conflict.
What to do? That depends on what you believe is really possible in Bosnia. I believe that the best that is possible, for the next few years, is a stable but loose partition into Serbian, Croatian and Muslim cantons. In this scenario, Bosnia does not need elections right now, but just an ongoing NATO presence to keep the peace, as the parties themselves figure out how, and how much, they want to live and trade together. Any faction that doesn't turn over war criminals should be diplomatically and economically isolated.
But the Clinton Administration's view is that, if possible, Bosnia should be unified into a single federal state, beginning with elections by September for a revolving presidency. But you cannot realize that vision for Bosnia without removing Messrs. Karadzic and Mladic. Ejup Ganic, Bosnia's Muslim Vice President, told me that after NATO recently tracked down an Iranian terrorist center in Bosnia and seized it with helicopters and tanks he told NATO "that was a perfect dry run for how you should go in and get Mladic and Karadzic." Added Mr. Ganic: "Could you have succeeded in developing democracy in Germany if Hitler were allowed to stay around? You Americans told us Bosnia is a single state and we stick to that sentence."
But in the Bosnian Serb capital of Pale, Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the Serb Republic's parliament, told me: "The people here really do not believe Mladic and Karadzic are war criminals. NATO is a great force, which only a foolish leadership would ignore. But if I could give any advice, I would advise NATO never to try taking Mladic and Karadzic by force. Some things have to remain taboo."
This is the real issue that President Clinton and Bob Dole are going to have to debate this fall -- not the phony issue of Iranian arms transfers. If the U.S. is committed to elections in Bosnia and to its unification, then it must remove the Serb war criminals still in charge. If it is ready to accept de facto partition as the least bad option then it will have to forgo elections. Mr. President, Mr. Dole, which will it be?

HEADLINE: Fleet Agrees to Settle Accusation of Loan Discrimination

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 7

 BODY:
The Fleet Financial Group Inc. agreed today to pay about $4 million to hundreds of black and Hispanic customers to settle United States Justice Department allegations that minority borrowers were charged more for loans than whites.
The Fleet Mortgage Group unit of the bank agreed to pay 600 minority borrowers in Westbury, L.I., and Woodbridge, N.J., up to $15,000 each to compensate for higher interest rates and fees on mortgages they received in 1993 and 1994. Fleet Mortgage, the third-largest mortgage company in the country, also agreed to develop a uniform mortgage pricing and monitoring system to prevent discriminatory lending practices. 
 "Loans should be based on risk, not race," said Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights. "By changing their practices, Fleet has stepped forward and done the right thing."
The settlement ends a Justice Department investigation that began last year, after the Federal Reserve expressed concern that Fleet Mortgage charged more to minority borrowers than to whites at its Westbury and Woodbridge offices from August 1993 to June 1994.
Fleet Mortgage, in settling charges that it violated fair-lending and anti-discrimination laws, denied engaging in any discriminatory practices.
"We want to make sure that discriminatory lending practices are not occurring," said Gerald L. Baker, chief executive and chairman of Fleet Mortgage, which is based in Columbia, S.C.
The investigation centered on the practice by Fleet Mortgage of paying bonuses to employees who charged customers rates or fees above the company's base lending rate. Although bonuses tied to higher rates, known as overages, are legal and used by many banks, Federal officials said the practice encouraged bankers at the two Fleet Mortgage offices to charge minority customers more than others.
The settlement is the first of its kind to set a standard that banks can use to avoid allowing their bonus programs to lead to discrimination, Mr. Baker said. Fleet has now set up a system to monitor rates and fees charged to customers based on their race. The company plans to use it to identify cases in which lending officers might be charging black or Hispanic borrowers more than whites who are of equal credit risk, he said.
Fleet agreed to pay $3.8 million, or an average of $6,000 to the 600 affected customers, plus $200,000 for a community education program on home mortgages.
Fleet halted the bonuses at all mortgage offices when the Federal Reserve first expressed concern. With the new monitoring system in place, Fleet Mortgage plans to resume the bonus system, Mr. Baker said.
The Government has gone after other banks suspected of using overages to charge minority borrowers more for loans. Last fall, Huntington Bancshares Inc., a Columbus, Ohio, bank, agreed to pay $420,000 to black customers who were charged more than white borrowers for their mortgages. The Justice Department blamed overages for the problem.
Fleet Financial, the nation's ninth-largest bank, faced charges of discriminatory lending practices in its lending units before. In 1992, the bank's Atlanta-based consumer finance unit, Fleet Finance Inc., settled claims by Georgia's Attorney General and a class-action lawsuit that it overcharged minority borrowers. Fleet Finance set up a $38 million fund to restructure such loans nationwide.
Fleet Financial is hoping to sell Fleet Finance in the next few months.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
3-Year Note Fares Poorly At Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower yesterday, hurt by a weak sale of new three-year notes.
The sale was the first part of the Treasury's $33 billion quarterly refunding this week, and the results raised concerns over how well today's auction of new 10-year notes would fare. Still, bond prices came off their lows yesterday, and some analysts were impressed that the market did as well as it did, given the worries over absorbing new supply.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended down 4/32, to 86 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7.07 percent, from 7.05 percent on Monday.
The Treasury sold $19 billion in three-year notes yesterday, with an average yield of 6.39 percent -- the highest since Feb. 7, 1995, when it was 7.34 percent. Wall Street had been expecting yields that high, said Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company.
But "the bid-to-cover ratio was not good," he said, referring to the ratio that compares the dollar amount of bids with the securities sold. The ratio yesterday was a weak 2.03, down from 2.67 at the last auction.
"I think what saved the auction from disaster was the fact that the yield on a three-year note is up 130 basis points since the last auction," he added. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, noted that there was interest in the notes from foreign investors, but "for the most part, domestic investors did not have a whole lot of reason to jump into it."
Yet while the results of the auction were far from stellar, he said that "the Street did a great job by backing up yields to make them attractive."
"The spot where the Street bought the auction turned out to be a reasonable place to buy them, at least temporarily," he said.
Matthew Alexy, chief market strategist for CS First Boston, said that what helped the market yesterday was that prices had cheapened over the last couple of days. "The Street managed to back yields up nicely," he said yesterday, adding about today's sale of 10-year notes, "but where the 10's are cheap enough will be determined by the results of tomorrow's Fed beige book report."
The Federal Reserve is to release today its survey of regional business activity, known as the beige book.
Regardless of whether a Fed report comes out on the auction day, the 10-year notes are often more difficult to sell than shorter-term notes.
The market shrugged off several economic reports, including weak weekly retail sales data from Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi Schroder Wertheim and Johnson Redbook. Market participants are waiting for clearer indications on the pace of inflation, possibly in Friday's report on producer prices in April.
Investors are also keeping close tabs on possible shifts in asset allocations by portfolio managers. In the last few days, Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney announced that they were maintaining current levels in bonds, but had reduced the stock portions of their recommended portfolios.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.960
Average Yield . . . 6.390%
Low Price . . . 99.933

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Fidelity is developing an office complex in Rhode Island as the state rolls out the red carpet.

BYLINE: By Susan Diesenhouse 

DATELINE: SMITHFIELD, R.I.

 BODY:
THE FMR Corporation, the parent of Fidelity Investments, is developing a new office complex here as the mutual fund giant continues to expand outside its home state of Massachusetts.
The move has coincided with efforts by Massachusetts to give tax breaks to certain businesses to keep them operating and growing in the state. 
 In March, Fidelity received the zoning variances it needed from this town to start construction in the Island Woods Commerce Center, about 55 miles southwest of Boston. The first phase consists of a 200,000-square-foot office building, with a 1,000-car garage, and a second building with a garage is also being considered. The complex will at first house 1,000 employees.
Last year, a package of real estate development and tax incentives prompted Fidelity to move its growing institutional services business to Smithfield. In exchange, the state expects to get about 300 new jobs.
With similar tax incentives being planned for other financial service sectors, Rhode Island hopes to attract new industries and jobs.
"We're in a better position than Massachusetts because we're more interested in jobs than corporate revenues and we didn't have to give up anything," Gov. Lincoln C. Almond said in a telephone interview.
Since 1994, Rhode Island has enacted laws that permit the state to exempt Fidelity from sales tax on building materials, equipment, computer hardware and software for the 30 years of the lease, said Marcel A. Valois, director of the state Economic Development Office. Under a new law, mutual fund companies pay corporate income tax only on in-state sales. For Fidelity, that should be less than 5 percent of the business it handles through the new office complex, Mr. Valois said.
The state will award the company a credit against its rent of $2,000 a year for each Rhode Islander hired above the initial 1,000 workers. Fidelity will relocate at least 400 workers from Massachusetts and hire an undetermined amount of Rhode Islanders. The state may also pay 50 percent of the cost to train those workers up to $5,000 each.
In addition, Smithfield signed a 30-year tax agreement that fixes Fidelity's property assessment at $100 a square foot for the first 300,000 square feet, with values to rise 15 percent every five years, the Town Manager, Jeffrey Minor, said.
The state owns the 130-acre Island Woods center. It bought the land in 1992 for $3.3 million from a private developer who tried to lure biotechnology companies from Massachusetts. The state has invested $2 million in roads and utilities and will issue about $25 million in taxable bonds to purchase and improve 200 adjacent acres.
Fidelity will lease about 325 acres and its rent will equal the debt service on the bonds, about $1.5 million a year.
In Massachusetts, where land and operating costs are higher, the administration of Gov. William F. Weld has also made an effort to keep and attract jobs.
Still, the move by Fidelity shows how some of the state's companies have chosen to expand in other states. In 1990, about 65 percent of Fidelity's 7,000 jobs were in Massachusetts; now only 50 percent of the company's 19,138 jobs are there. Much of the company's growth has been in Kentucky, Ohio, Utah, Texas and New Hampshire.
Last year, Massachusetts agreed to give its largest private employer, Raytheon, a tax break and is now considering one for Fidelity.
But the use of costly tax-break incentives has its critics.
Herman Leonard, professor of public management at Harvard University, said that he worried that even with tax breaks, New England might still lose jobs. "I don't think Rhode Island will be Fidelity's last stop," he said.

HEADLINE: A Top Economist Switches His View on Productivity

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In the endless debate over whether companies in the huge service sector are becoming more efficient and productive, Stephen S. Roach is famous as the economist who says, flatly, they are. No skeptic can challenge that proposition without facing down Mr. Roach. He has preached his case on talk shows, before Congress, in academia and on Wall Street. But now he is changing his mind.
"I must confess that I am having second thoughts as to whether we have reached the promised land," Mr. Roach said, in the opening paragraph of a circular that will be faxed tomorrow to the media and to hundreds of clients of Morgan Stanley & Company, where he is chief economist. "These doubts have caused me to rethink many of the glorious conclusions that I have long argued would be part of the sacred productivity-led recovery." 
 The conversion of Mr. Roach, who is 50, reflects a growing national debate over the downsizings and revampings that have characterized corporate behavior for 15 years. Most economists now say that the process has fallen short of its goal of greater productivity and thus an economy that can grow ever more vigorously. Mr. Roach had been one of the few prominent holdouts from this view. "And now I am not a holdout," he said.
What Mr. Roach thought had happened, in his revised view has not. He had thought that big investments in computers and other technology at the array of stores, banks, railroads, airlines, law firms and the like that make up the service sector had allowed employees to do more work. This coupled with wave after wave of mergers and layoffs left fewer workers doing the same amount of work. That showed up as more output for each hour worked by the surviving employees, which is the definition of improved productivity.
What made Mr. Roach so famous was that he had maintained this view with energy and logic -- and all the authority that being the chief economist at Morgan Stanley gave to his pronouncements -- even though the rising productivity that he envisioned did not show up in the Labor Department's statistics. Investors took his views as encouragement to buy. After all, rising productivity in the service sector, which generates so much national wealth, should mean a strong economy and strong profits. An airline clerk who, with a computer, doubles her output to 10 ticket sales an hour raises the airline's revenues and profits.
It is true that the economy has grown and profits have indeed been strong. But for Mr. Roach this is no longer a proper measure. A higher level of productivity must be a permanent improvement, he says, and what has been happening is only temporary. The airline, instead of selling more tickets, has simply kept cutting back the number of clerks selling them.
"If it turns out that all we have done is squeeze out labor," Mr. Roach said in an interview, "then I have to reverse what I have built a reputation on. And it is increasingly clear to me that the improvements in operating performance and profits have been built on a steady stream of downsizings and cost cutting that is just not sustainable. If all you do is cut, then you will eventually be left with nothing, with no market share."
He still thinks, however, that the Labor Department's productivity numbers are "screwy," the result of mismeasurement. The Government says that while productivity among manufacturers rose by 3.2 percent a year in the 1990's -- suggesting considerable gains in efficiency in that area -- for the economy as a whole the annual rise has been only 1.1 percent, which means that the service sector has really been a drag on the data.
Mr. Roach had argued that productivity for the economy as a whole had risen in the 1990's at a 2.25 percent annual rate, but now he is scaling this estimate back to between 1.5 percent and 2 percent. Very probably, he says, no one is counting all the extra hours that people on fixed salaries work, including his own 15-hour days traveling constantly, with a computer on his lap as his office.
Mr. Roach, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from New York University and served as a chief forecaster at the Federal Reserve before going to Wall Street in 1979, drew attention to his productivity views in a 1991 article in the Harvard Business Review.
He argued there, and in subsequent writings, that the service sector had invested heavily in computer technology in the 1980's, and then in the 1990's made increasingly efficient use of this investment through mergers and downsizings. A year ago, he began to sense that workers were restive, and as that awareness grew, Mr. Roach began to talk of a "worker backlash," a perception that gradually brought him to his latest view.
The steady economic growth, the low inflation and the strong profits have been real, he says, but they do not reflect a sustainable rise in productivity, as he once thought. "The fatal flaw," Mr. Roach said, "is that they are built on the back of hollowing out labor."

HEADLINE: U.S. Signs Pact on Telling Mexico About Certain Migrant Cases

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 7

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher signed an agreement here today pledging that American officials will notify Mexican diplomats in the United States whenever pregnant Mexican women or Mexican children are detained as illegal immigrants.
The agreement, signed at the close of an annual Mexico-United States meeting, also spells out more explicitly than previously the rights of Mexican consular officials to interview Mexicans detained in the United States and to attend their trials if they are prosecuted for crimes. 
 The agreement, titled the "Memorandum of Understanding on Consular Protection," largely reaffirms rights recognized by both countries in earlier treaties. But an official of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service said the agreement would nonetheless oblige Border Patrol officials to be more consistent in communicating with Mexican diplomats about the detention of illegal Mexican migrants, and would most likely mean a significant increase in the Border Patrol's work load in some border areas.
The meeting came at a time of rising Mexican concerns over the treatment of migrant workers in the United States, with fears aroused by the videotaped beating of undocumented Mexicans on April 1 by two California sheriff's deputies and more recently by the passage in Congress of an immigration law that will double the size of the Border Patrol.
As a result, the Mexican Government was under considerable pressure from its domestic critics to negotiate forcefully with the Clinton Administration over immigration issues. Foreign Minister Angel Gurria said today that he considered the migration agreement to be a considerable triumph for Mexico.
Taking part in the 24-hour meeting, one in a series of annual encounters dating to 1981, were Mr. Christopher, Attorney General Janet Reno, Interior Minister Bruce Babbitt, four other members of President Clinton's Cabinet and a combined total of 300 other American and Mexican officials. The Governments discussed hundreds of issues, in 16 working groups, everything from trade disputes over tuna to pollution along the 2,000-mile border to ways of counting each nation's unemployed.
Mr. Christopher said the talks had brought special progress in combating money-laundering. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who spoke for the United States in one of two working groups that discussed the topic, said the United States had agreed to help Mexico set up a computerized system for mandatory reporting by banks of suspicious transactions.
The tone of this year's meeting was almost celebratory, with a great deal of back-slapping and well-wishing. Outlining a series of nettling disputes, however, Mr. Gurria spoke with special vehemence against the Helms-Burton Act, the law signed on March 12 that tightens the United States's 34-year-old embargo against Cuba by trying to restrict non-American investment there.
The uncertainty that the law has aroused has already hurt a Mexican company that last year bought 49 percent of Cuba's national telephone system and had hoped to find an American partner. And many other Mexican entrepreneurs are worried about how the measure may affect them. Mr. Gurria told Mr. Christopher on Monday that Mexico "firmly rejects" Helms-Burton.
Mr. Christopher sought to smooth those ruffled feathers this morning. Clinton Administration lawyers who are currently writing the regulations that will give teeth to the law, he said, are seeking to "maximize the pressure on the Cuban Government to change, and to minimize the effect on business in friendly countries."

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Raoul Peck;
Exporting Haitian Culture to the World

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
RAOUL PECK'S big, bright, brown eyes draw you toward him and grip you as you listen to his soft English, accented by a Parisian lilt. It is through those eyes that Mr. Peck, 43, a Haitian-born film maker, shows the world his world. Haiti. Zaire. France. Germany and the United States.
But for a few hours on a recent afternoon, Mr. Peck's world was reduced to a small Italian bistro in Greenwich Village, where he discussed his dual roles as independent artist and Haiti's new Minister of Culture. 
 "This is not my favorite hangout," Mr. Peck said, sipping a glass of the house white at Ennio & Michael. "It's the closest one to my apartment."
As one of Haiti's few film makers, Mr. Peck is a primary exporter of Haitian films to the rest of the world. Since he was appointed Minister of Culture in February, he has also had the challenge of improving the cultural image of a country that has been tarnished by decades of political turmoil.
Mr. Peck's most recent film, "The Man by the Shore," is a dark movie set in a seemingly sleepy, run-down fictional town during the middle of the dictatorship of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. It is told through the struggle of Sarah, an 8-year-old who has to remain in Haiti with her grandmother after her father, a discredited army captain, flees the country. Sarah's recurring nightmare of a family friend's torture vividly captures the personal impact of tyranny and brutality that thousands of Haitians faced during the 30 years of the Duvalier regime.
"It was not until after I finished the film that I realized how much of it came from my own memories," Mr. Peck said.
Raising his voice above the cacophony of the lunch-hour crowd, Mr. Peck, dressed in a navy blue sports jacket and a gray shirt, clasped his hands and explained that the music, colors and atmosphere in his films provide audiences with snapshots of his life.
The Haiti of Mr. Peck's childhood was a place where henchmen would storm into government offices and remove workers simply for not being vocal supporters of Mr. Duvalier. And Mr. Peck's father, Hebert, like the father of the movie's heroine, was arrested and spent some time in prison. Mr. Peck's crime was trying to unionize farmers.
That incident set in motion a life in exile for young Mr. Peck and his two younger brothers. Mr. Peck moved with his family to Zaire at age 8. His father, an agronomist, worked for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and Unesco. His mother, Giselle, who died about 10 years ago, was an aide to several mayors in Kinshasa, the capital. His family was one of a coterie of highly educated Haitians who went to francophone Africa during the early 1960's to help build the newly independent nations.
By his own account, Mr. Peck lived a privileged existence, having attended boarding school in Paris. He was set for a life in international affairs after he graduated with degrees in economics and engineering from the Technical University of Berlin.
But he said he never clung to the ideals of the young Haitian elite of espousing an unhealthy dose of disdain for the majority of the Haitian people who are wretchedly poor.
"I was lucky enough to be exposed to other influences abroad," Mr. Peck said. "I had friends that were involved in a lot of solidarity movements for different struggles around the world."
He admitted, though, that the temptation was difficult to escape. He came to New York in 1980, awaiting a job with the United Nations, but the agency was facing a severe budget crisis and was not hiring. Meantime, he took up driving a cab and began to realize that his true calling was in film making, not in settling international disputes. He returned to Germany in early 1981 and enrolled at the competitive German Film and Television Academy.
"My father is a camera buff," said Mr. Peck, explaining that his choice of career was not at all that unusual. "He always had a camera with him, and I grew up with it."
"The Man by the Shore" received respectable reviews from the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, but it failed to attract a distributor in the United States. Mr. Peck thought distributors would have lined up to bid for his movie, particularly since it was shown at a time when diplomats shuttled between New York, Washington and Port-au-Prince, trying to restore to power the ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and Haiti commanded the front pages of daily newspapers across the country.
But it took about two years before Mr. Peck found a small New York entertainment group, KJM3, to distribute the film. Its premiere is set for Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum, about a week before the film opens at the Quad Cinema in Manhattan, on May 17. The premiere is being organized as a benefit event by a community group, the Haitian-American Alliance of New York.
"I think my film is powerful and very difficult," Mr. Peck said. "Distributors are not particularly looking for films that are important. They're looking for films that can make money. You are not seeing the best films the world has to offer in this country, and I think that's a shame."
Mr. Peck, who was a visiting professor at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for two years, until 1995, has received several awards for "The Man by the Shore," including best film at the Milan African Film Festival in 1994.
His other movies include "Haitian Corner," which chronicled the life of Haitian immigrants in New York, and "Lumumba: Death of a Prophet," about Zaire's first Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba, who was assassinated in 1961.
While many of his films are about Haiti and Haitians, Mr. Peck said that the stories transcend his sun-drenched island nation and that a person who has lived through Franco's Spain, Tito's Yugoslavia or Castro's Cuba can relate to the story. Haiti, he said, provides the backdrop for a story about humanity.
"I try to portray characters that are people we know," he said. "We know a grandmother like this, a little girl like this."
Part of his struggle to promote Haiti's almost nonexistent cultural institutions, he says, stems from an elite whose members would rather fly to Miami or New York to attend the theater.
"We have inherited a very decadent bourgeoisie, incapable of defending its own rights," said Mr. Peck, who is single and has a 22-year-old daughter, Fiona, a senior at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
"It's important for me to show Haitians as human beings and not just as objects," he continued. "We have a very heavy legacy in that we are seen as either voodoo followers or AIDS carriers. The least I can do is show people as people and not as marionettes or exotic bodies."
His future projects include expanding the accessibility of films in Haiti and raising Americans' awareness of daily Haitian life.
Mr. Peck recently bought the Eldorado Cine, an old colonial movie theater in Port-au-Prince, and has fanned across Europe and the United States, raising $500,000 to create a center where artists can meet and discuss and create. And he has purchased the rights to the Russell Banks novel "Continental Drift," which traces the path of a Haitian family and an American family as they pursue the American dream.
"I see too many Haitians living in the expectative mood of 'when we go back,' " Mr. Peck said of his countrymen who often muse about the day when they will permanently return to their island nation. "It is paralyzing because you don't do anything. You just wait. And knowing the situation in Haiti, there is no guarantee that you will ever go back."

HEADLINE: Bennington College Sued by Professors

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: RUTLAND, Vt., May 7

 BODY:
Nineteen former and current members of the Bennington College faculty have taken the college to court, seeking reinstatement and back pay two years after the college, facing financial trouble, made wide cuts in the faculty and curriculum.
In a suit filed today in Superior Court here, the faculty members contended that Bennington and its president, Elizabeth Coleman, violated their contracts and wrongfully dismissed them in 1994 after the trustees ordered the restructuring. 
 A spokeswoman for Bennington, Debra Townsend, said: "We were anticipating this. Bennington College believes it acted openly and legally."
As part of the restructuring, the faculty was cut by one-third and full-time jobs in some disciplines, like foreign languages, literature, politics, economics, sociology and art history, were eliminated. The trustees also did away with Bennington's academic job security -- an unusual form of tenure called "presumptive," in which faculty members received five-year contracts that guaranteed future employment unless "the contribution to college life" by the faculty member deteriorated or the college declared financial hardship, which it did in 1994.
One plaintiff regained his job. Most others are still unemployed. One of their lawyers, Richard Cassidy, said the layoffs were a contract violation because the trustees had improperly declared hardship.

Loving Las Vegas

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
If anyone is still wondering whatever happened to the 60's, the answer may be here, in a pristine patch of desert a short drive from the Liberace Museum. The Hard Rock Casino has an autographed Bob Dylan guitar above the window where you cash in your chips, a handwritten Jim Morrison lyric sheet along the corridor where you weave your way to the bathroom, and four slot machines whose profits (a flashing sign announces) are proudly dedicated to saving the rain forest. You hear John Lennon sing "Imagine" while you lose your shirt at craps.
Peter Morton, owner of the Hard Rock empire, reports that his first venture into gambling, now a year old, is "out of the ball park," exceeding revenue projections by 50 percent; the adjoining Hard Rock Hotel, which turned away 10,000 customers last month, is already planning to expand. You might ask: Who would have guessed that the Woodstock generation would trade in peace and love for video poker and Keno? But a more realistic question might be: Why should the boomers be different from anyone else? 
 America is punch-drunk with gambling. At $40 billion a year, the self-described "gaming" industry is rapidly catching up to our most profitable addiction, tobacco ($45 billion). In 1994, more Americans gambled than went to movies, theater, opera and concerts combined -- and spent six times as much money on gambling as on all spectator sports combined. Casinos, limited to Nevada and New Jersey only eight years ago, are now legal in 24 states; lotteries are now ubiquitous in 37.
With such growing competition, you might expect Las Vegas to suffer. Far from it. It's the fastest-growing city in America. Hotel occupancy is at a staggering 90 percent, and new resorts can't be built fast enough on the Strip. One of them, the half-complete New York-New York, is in the shape of a Crayola-colored Manhattan skyline. Its marketing executive, Martin Moore, explains: "What we're seeing is a more relaxed attitude about gambling. People who'd never think about Las Vegas come out now because they've tried it locally and say, 'Let's try the real thing.' "
What does this mean for American civilization as we know it? No one is sure. Already such gambling-saturated towns as Biloxi, Miss., are looking like Jimmy Stewart's nightmare vision of Bedford Falls in "It's a Wonderful Life." The stench of influence-peddling suffuses some state governments where gambling rules. In the Midwest, riverboat casinos can be an economic boon but sometimes suck local retail businesses dry. Statistics suggest that crime, domestic abuse and alcoholism rise in gambling's wake -- while the poor get most conspicuously poorer.
No wonder the House, with a bipartisan unity stretching from religious conservatives to secular liberals, unanimously passed a bill creating a commission to weigh gambling's national impact. But the bill now languishes in the Senate, where Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, and G.O.P. allies have worked to weaken the commission and could yet kill it.
Surely, you'd think, Bob Dole, our foremost scourge of cultural depravity, would help speed and toughen this legislation. To do so, however, he'll have to buck the No. 1 casino potentate, Stephen Wynn of Mirage Resorts, who raised $477,000 for Mr. Dole at a luncheon here last year, the very day after the Senator's famous speech excoriating Hollywood. Gambling may also have an ally in Newt Gingrich, who had his own, private dinner with Mr. Wynn here last week and promptly declared himself sympathetic to an emasculated commission, shorn of subpoena powers.
My libertarian side says that if Americans want to throw their money away, that's certainly their right. But taking in the "new," corporate Vegas, which swallows up one new generation at the Hard Rock and befriends still younger ones with wan theme-park attractions, I wonder where the national addiction will lead. Even Don Rickles, the hilariously misanthropic comic who's outlasted Elvis and Sinatra as a headliner here, laments the dehumanization of a town where the hotel lounges once synonymous with live entertainment have been razed to meet the insatiable demand for more gambling acreage. The onetime capital of sin is now a prototype for the mall of the future, destined to be replicated on a strip of highway near you.

HEADLINE: Lauded Holyoke Must Work to Lure Students

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

DATELINE: SOUTH HADLEY, Mass.

 BODY:
Since its founding 159 years ago, Mount Holyoke College has attracted idealistic young women seeking a rigorous education on the way to public service or academic careers. Its officials point with pride to alumnae like Frances Perkins, the nation's first female Cabinet member, appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright.
But while Mount Holyoke shows up regularly in national rankings as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the United States, it is caught in a paradox: despite its reputation, it has to stretch for students. It generally accepts 65 percent of applicants -- better than the 76 percent it took in 1992, but less selective than it used to be and than its closest competitors, Wellesley, which took only 39 percent of applicants last year, and Smith, which took 53 percent. And by next year, what the college pays in student financial aid is expected to exceed what it pays for instruction. 
 As Holyoke's new president, Joanne V. Creighton, told a student forum on April 30, a few days before her inauguration: "We have significant challenges. But I have confidence that we can face them if we don't get paralyzed."
Ms. Creighton, an English scholar who served as provost and acting president of Wesleyan University in Connecticut, arrived on campus in January and created a long-term planning committee of faculty, students and staff.
Holyoke's problems are not unique, of course. Many liberal arts colleges have had to contend with a growing skepticism about the value of a liberal arts education in an increasingly job-oriented society. And over the last decade, most colleges have had to grapple with the decline in high school graduates.
For women's colleges, that shrinkage is even tougher since they draw from only half the population. Only 84 women's colleges remain, down from 228 in 1969, when the Ivy League and other prestigious men's colleges started going coed. Those that remain fight strong preferences for coeducation as well as perceptions that they are either convents or largely lesbian.
But they have seen renewed interest in recent years since Hillary Rodham Clinton -- a Wellesley graduate -- moved into the White House and a study by the American Association of University Women in 1992 showed that boys were favored over girls in many American classrooms. The number of full-time undergraduates at women's colleges is now 7 percent higher than it was in 1970, said Jadwiga S. Sebrechts, executive director of the Women's College Coalition.
For Holyoke, two selling points are its beautiful 800-acre campus in southern Massachusetts and its participation in a five-college consortium that includes Amherst, Smith, Hampshire College and the University of Massachusetts. And with fewer than 2,000 undergraduates, Holyoke tries to nurture its students in tutorials and small classes. More than 60 percent of its graduates go on to advanced degrees, many in areas like science or economics where women are underrepresented.
Still, many Holyoke students say they were sold on the college only after visiting it and seeing its friendliness. It is a closeness cultivated through traditions like milk and cookies every night (known as M and C), an annual procession to the campus grave of Holyoke's founder, Mary Lyons, followed by an ice cream social, and gifts from older students to first-year students.
"I was a little apprehensive about a woman's college," recalled Julie Poore, a Russian major from Woburn, Mass. "But when I came to look at the college, I really fell in love with it."
Like many other Holyoke students, Elizabeth Cook, a history major from Des Moines who is the former editor in chief of the student newspaper, recalled that her friends felt threatened by her choice. "They were convinced I was going to become a lesbian," Ms. Cook said. "A colleague of my father's told me she wouldn't have wanted to go to a women's college because college is where she met her husband."
But despite the student good will, Holyoke does less well in selling itself beyond the campus. As Ms. Creighton put it at the student forum: "Once you get here you love it. But what can we do to tell more students about us?"
Applications have climbed above 2,000 again -- from a low of 1,782 in 1992 -- but they are still lower than administrators would like. The improvement has come in part through a renewed emphasis on recruiting in traditional strongholds like the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States, areas it neglected in the late 1980's when declining numbers of high school graduates led it to focus on the faster-growing West and South.
"We've moved away from the edge, but not enough to make us feel secure," said Richard Johnson, a professor of English and a member of the new Educational Priorities Committee.
Yet another problem is the spiraling burden of financial aid. Like other colleges that accept students without regard to their ability to pay, Holyoke guarantees that once admitted, no one will then be turned away because of a lack of tuition money. As a result, Holyoke is paying out more and more, giving aid to 70 percent of its students. Financial aid is the college's fastest-growing expense -- more than 8 percent a year.
For now, its financial aid policy will remain unchanged, and the college will use gifts and income from its $272 million endowment to cover it, running a small deficit as a result. Ms. Creighton has assured students that their aid will not change, but she will not promise that there will be no change. She believes that Holyoke ought to be putting more of its investment income into endowment -- which at $147,000 per student is below that of competitors like Wellesley -- and less into current operations.
Many observers believe Holyoke has the strengths to remain a top college and even to build.
"I think they can turn it around," said Morton Schapiro, dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California who has consulted for Holyoke and other colleges. "They are small, and they have a lot of money in the bank. If they emphasize their career connections, they will draw even more students."
And the faculty at Holyoke seem willing to work with Ms. Creighton.
"We've just finished 10 faculty teas and dinners at the president's house," said Harriet Pollatsek, a mathematics professor who is on the priorities committee, "and everyone seemed pleased, excited and encouraged. Joanne is very plain-spoken and down to earth, and the faculty value her candor."
The one group that seems most uneasy is students. The student newspaper, The Mount Holyoke News, recently called Ms. Creighton too corporate in her approach, and a survey of 360 students by the newspaper last month found many fears that Ms. Creighton might turn the college coed, cut financial aid or seek out a wealthier student body that might be less diverse.
Others have rallied to her defense. "Having an Educational Priorities Committee re-examine the college puts us all on edge," said Stephanie Jones, an English major from Maine and the new editor in chief of the Holyoke News. "But it's exactly what we should be doing."

HEADLINE: Impasse on Wage Issue Stalls Effort to Lower Gasoline Tax

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Republicans in the Senate tried briefly today to roll back the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax that Congress enacted in 1993, but Democrats once again ensnarled them in a debate over raising the minimum wage. So the tax repeal -- and the Senate -- ground to a halt again.
Democrats said they would keep tying up the Senate until Republicans granted them an up-or-down vote on raising the base wage. Republicans tried to link such a vote to a measure that Democrats oppose, a labor-relations bill criticized by unions, but Democrats did not take the bait. 
 The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, scolded the Democrats, saying, "Your leader is telling us the only way we can move the Senate on anything is to vote on your version of the minimum wage. We have the majority in this body."
A few minutes later, the Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, concluded, "We're obviously in a situation now where nothing is going to get done."
Not a lot has been done for six weeks, since the minimum-wage standoff began. It was not clear when the impasse would break. Some suggested that the tug of war was being driven by election-year politics, particularly Presidential politics.
"All this is obviously and clearly -- but it needs restating -- a struggle that is under way to define the terms of debate in the campaign," Tom Mann, a Brookings Institution scholar who is an expert on Congress, said in an interview today. "It really matters what's on the agenda and how it's framed, and there's no easy way to cut the differences."
Indeed, both parties' unanointed Presidential candidates were in the thick of the day's inaction.
Mr. Dole made an impromptu appearance this morning at Internal Revenue Service headquarters to advocate the repeal of the gasoline tax and, in passing, to note that it had been part of a five-year, $265 billion tax package that President Clinton orchestrated in 1993. That, Mr. Dole said, was "the largest tax increase in American history."
Mr. Clinton's campaign struck back by fax. A statement charged that Mr. Dole "more than tripled the gas tax in the 1980's" by backing two such increases of 5 cents a gallon, and added that it was Mr. Dole who "pushed through the largest tax increase in U.S. history" in 1982.
Yes, and no. Adjusted for inflation, the $214 billion tax increase that Mr. Dole supported in 1982 totals $320 billion in 1993 dollars. That eclipses the $265 billion increase that Mr. Clinton sponsored in that year as part of a deficit-reduction package.
Still, the 1982 increase was effectively a partial rollback of a 1981 tax cut of $750 billion, which Mr. Dole also backed. In 1993 dollars, the 1981 cut totals $1.19 trillion.
"It's basically a useless argument," said David Wyss, research director for DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Boston economic forecasting company. "Both passed tax increases, and both were probably justified."
As the Senate stood idle, Republicans tried to juggle the budget to offset the loss of gasoline-tax revenues. They elected to lift the tax temporarily, until November, and to pay the $2 billion cost by cutting the Energy Department budget and selling another slice of the broadcast spectrum. Mr. Dole said the next Republican budget, to be sketched out on Wednesday, would propose a permanent tax repeal.
Democrats, meanwhile, tried to decide whether to bow to the tax cut, which Mr. Daschle has called inevitable. Mr. Clinton had been poised to send Mr. Dole a letter accepting the repeal in exchange for a minimum-wage increase and a guarantee that oil companies would not pocket the tax cut's proceeds. But he held off after Democratic senators debated their position over lunch.
Mr. Daschle was mum. But another Democrat, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, said later that he believed there were enough Democrats to filibuster the tax repeal.
That did not occur. As a bill dubbed the Taxpayer Bill of Rights came up, Mr. Dole tried to amend it to repeal the gasoline tax and increase the minimum wage 90 cents, as Democrats have sought. But he also put in something Democrats oppose: a separate bill expanding businesses' right to hold discussions with employee groups.
Democrats argued that the bill's true purpose was to permit businesses to create rump unions, run by companies. So Mr. Daschle rejected the offer, calling the labor amendment a "poison pill."
Mr. Dole affected befuddlement, saying the Democrats were opposing their own minimum-wage increase.
"I didn't think we'd be rejected when we offered our colleagues what they wanted," he said.

HEADLINE: Consumers Trimmed Debt Rise in March

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Consumers restrained their buying on credit during March, the Federal Reserve said today, as installment debt grew at the slowest rate in six months.
Total consumer installment credit rose by $6.4 billion, at a 7.3 percent annual rate, little more than half the February jump of $12.2 billion, at a 14.1 percent rate. 
 It was the smallest monthly increase in installment debt since September of last year, when it was up $4.1 billion, at a 5 percent annual rate.
Every major category of credit buying in March was off from February's pace. Auto loans were the most striking, with no increase at all in dollar terms from February's $360 billion, as they rose only two-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate. Auto credit had risen in February by $3.8 billion, a 12.6 percent annual rate.
 The overall March slowdown was steeper than anticipated by analysts, who had expected that relatively high levels of consumer confidence and strong job gains during the first quarter would buoy credit-buying.
But Friday, the Labor Department said April job growth virtually stalled, with only 2,000 new jobs created, raising questions as to whether the economy was headed for sustained stronger growth or whether it will settle back later in the year.
During March, credit-card buying increased by $4.8 billion, at a 14.1 percent annual rate, still a fairly brisk expansion though down from the $5.3 billion rise in February, at a 15.9 percent rate.
Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said credit-card use was expanding robustly because it was increasingly used as a means of payment to take advantage of incentives like free airline miles.
"It's not only a means of extending credit anymore, but also a substitute way of paying," Mr. Dederick said.
With interest rates rising, the pace of monthly borrowing increases was likely to slow, he said, adding, "But by any measure people are still willing borrowers, albeit not as eagerly as before."
A category of credit simply labeled other, which includes consumer loans for such purposes as buying a boat but does not count home-equity loans, posted a $1.5 billion rise in March, a 6.5 percent rate.

HEADLINE: 10-State Swath of West Will Soon Hit 75 M.P.H.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, May 7

 BODY:
Eastern drivers mapping out routes for Western vacations this summer can plan on the shortest driving times in a generation.
Over the next month, five states -- Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico and Utah -- will phase in 75-mile-per-hour speed limits on rural Interstate highways. Five other states -- Arizona, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota and Wyoming -- recently raised their limits, so the new additions will create a solid bloc of 10 Western states where the speed limit will be at least 75 m.p.h. 
 Moving faster than desert roadrunners, Western legislatures raced to raise speed limits after President Clinton signed legislation last November that abolished the 21-year-old national maximum speed limit.
Critics say accidents will soar as drivers cope with speed limits sharply higher than the 55 m.p.h. that was the rule less than a decade ago.
While proponents argue that the higher speed limits will merely legalize existing driving speeds, highway patrol officers across the West report that they are issuing double and triple the volume of tickets they once did as drivers test the new limits. Officers say they have eliminated the old "fudge factor," where they stopped only those drivers going more than 10 miles an hour over the speed limit. And state legislatures have beefed up fines for speeding.
To advocates of fast driving, today's Westerners are recapturing a way of life their parents lost in 1974, when Washington braked drivers nationwide in an effort to save gasoline after Arab oil-producing nations imposed an embargo on the United States for supporting Israel in its October 1973 war with Egypt and Syria.
Indeed, for six of the states, the new 75-m.p.h. speed limits simply mark a reversion to the pre-1974 status quo. "This is the first step in devolution of power from Washington," said State Representative Ron May, a Republican who sponsored Colorado's new speed limit law.
But this spring, with higher speed limits and gasoline prices at their highest levels in five years, fuel bills are likely to soar in the West.
"Going 75 instead of 55 results in an average 50 percent increase in fuel consumption," said John M. DeCicco, senior research associate for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
With great distances to travel, Westerners are particularly sensitive about gasoline prices. Last year the average Wyoming resident spent $734 on gasoline -- slightly more than double the amount paid by the average resident of New York State or Washington, D.C., where distances are shorter and public transportation is widespread.
With a small population scattered over wide-open spaces, Westerners regard fast driving as a quality-of-life issue.
"Going from 65 to 75 adds 110 hours to my year," said Tom Polk, a salesman operating out of Omaha who drives 50,000 miles a year to cover his seven-state territory. Noting that some overnight road trips are now day trips, he added, "When you have a family, being home an extra three or four nights a month -- that's a big deal."
Ten years ago, it would take a Wyoming driver who obeyed Washington's 55-m.p.h. limit nearly six hours to drive the 322 miles separating Cheyenne and Sheridan. Today, at 75 m.p.h., that drive takes 4 hours and 20 minutes.
In Montana, where new daytime speed limits carry no number and are defined simply as "reasonable and prudent," a driver last week could sail down Interstate 94, though the flat, empty eastern half of the state, with the cruise control set at 85 m.p.h. and not worry about a speeding ticket.
Critics, including Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a group based in Washington, note that of the 10 Western states with 75-m.p.h. limits, eight, including Montana, were on a Federal Department of Transportation list of the 10 states with the highest number of fatal crashes per hundred million miles traveled from 1990 to 1994. The high number of fatalities was attributed largely to high speeds, low use of seat belts, and alcohol.
Reflecting a regional undercurrent of apprehension, The Arizona Republic contributed to the state debate with a cartoon that depicted a smoking car wreck, overshadowed by a sign that read, "75 -- the age you probably won't reach once they raise the speed limit."
But, after six months of higher speed limits, there is little sign of increased highway carnage in the West's three pioneering states, Wyoming, Montana and California.
In Wyoming there were 26 traffic fatalities in the first four months of this year, compared with 34 in the same period last year.
In Montana during the same period, there were 50 traffic fatalities this year and 49 last year. But in the first three months of this year, the Montana Highway Patrol investigated 2,703 accidents, 25 percent more than in the same period last year.
California increased speed limits on some highway sections to 65 m.p.h. on Dec. 17, and on other sections to 70 m.p.h. on Jan. 7. The total number of collisions increased 3 percent and fatal crashes increased 13 percent from Dec. 17 through the end of March, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the California Highway Patrol.
But analysis of the fatal accidents showed that alcohol-related crashes had increased by 44 percent, while crashes where unsafe speed was the primary factor had dropped by 15 percent.
Independent and government safety experts say results are too preliminary and too subject to seasonal weather fluctuations to draw definitive conclusions.
Still, said Albert E. Goke, safety director for Montana's traffic department, "the doom and gloom that was predicted is not occurring."
Votes in state legislatures this spring were lopsided in favor of higher limits.
Fighting a rear-guard action in Colorado, safety advocates noted that 37 of Colorado's 100 state legislators had received speeding tickets. The driver's license of Ray Powers, the Senate sponsor of the new speed limit bill, was revoked in the 1970's because he had an excessive number of speeding tickets.
The bill easily swept through both houses of the Colorado Legislature. Gov. Roy Romer signed it on April 25 before television cameras in the sign shop of the state Department of Transportation. Then he took off his coat and hand-stenciled Colorado's first 75-m.p.h. speed limit sign.
In Nebraska, only 22 percent of people polled last December supported raising the speed limit to 75 miles an hour. Nevertheless, the Legislature overwhelmingly approved the new limit, which will go into effect on June 1.
Preparing for an influx of summer tourists, state officials in the West are stressing common sense and individual responsibility in advertising campaigns.
In Montana, "reasonable and prudent" speeds depend on a number of factors, like traffic conditions, road conditions, the car and the driver, said Mr. Goke, who stressed that Montana did not want to attract tourists addicted to speeding.
And two weeks ago in Colorado, as Governor Romer washed the black ink from his hands at the sign shop, Capt. Larry Tolar, spokesman for the state Highway Patrol, warned reporters, "If you are traveling faster than 75 miles an hour, the face you see in your rearview mirror won't be a friendly one."

HEADLINE: SOFTWARE PIRATES GROWING IN NUMBER IN CHINA, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials said today that they had discovered evidence of a large number of previously undiscovered Chinese factories producing pirated versions of American software, videos and music, and that they are preparing to announce retaliatory action next week against more than $2 billion in Chinese imports to the United States.
If the Administration goes ahead with its long-threatened sanctions, the action seems bound to increase tensions in a relationship still mired in disputes over China's reported shipments of nuclear weapons material, its continued repression of dissidents and its efforts to intimidate Taiwan. 
 Several of Mr. Clinton's top advisers have said in recent days that they are worried about the steady deterioration of the relationship with Beijing. But they added that they had no choice but to impose sanctions in the piracy dispute because China had repeatedly ignored warnings that it must fulfill its commitments under a major accord signed in March 1995.
White House officials say that by retaliating against China in a dispute that is costing American companies billions of dollars in lost sales, the Administration hopes to defuse a broader movement in Congress to terminate China's preferential trading status, which is up for renewal next month. Ending those trading privileges, a senior Administration official argued today, "would essentially terminate our economic relationship" with China and wipe out whatever leverage Washington has over Beijing.
The Administration reiterated its support for China's broad trading rights -- which President Clinton "delinked" from Beijing's human rights record in 1993 -- during a meeting today between Vice President Al Gore and the British Governor of Hong Kong, Christopher Patten. Mr. Patten is visiting Washington to warn that terminating China's most-favored-nation trading status in the United States would devastate Hong Kong, the transit point for most of the goods made in China. Mr. Gore "told Patten that unconditional renewal of M.F.N. was fundamental to our policy of engagement with China," said David Johnson, a White House spokesman.
But that argument has failed to persuade many Democrats and Republicans in Congress, where a major argument over extending the trading privileges is already shaping up. A coalition of conservative groups said today that it would begin a lobbying campaign to revoke Chin's trading rights, declaring that the Administration's policy of "comprehensive engagement" had failed to change China's treatment of dissidents or its trading practices.
Caught in the middle is Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican nominee for President, who has scheduled a long-delayed speech about American policy in Asia for Thursday. Mr. Dole has a long history of supporting most-favored-nation treatment for China, but in recent weeks some of his advisers have been pressing him to modify that position. They are urging him to support a rollback of some tariff reductions extended to China by the Clinton Administration.
"This is a straddle position for people who don't want a disaster for American interests in China," Douglas Paal, a Republican foreign policy strategist and informal adviser to the Dole campaign, said today.
The Administration's warning today that a sanctions announcement is imminent appears to be part of a last-minute effort to get Chinese officials to respond to a four-part "action plan" presented to them in Beijing last month by Charlene Barshefsky, who was recently appointed acting United States trade representative. She set a deadline of May 15. One of Ms. Barshefsky's deputies, Lee Sands, is on his way to Beijing in hopes of getting a response from Chinese leaders, but a senior Administration official said today that "there are no signs of action."
China has publicly threatened to issue counter-sanctions against American goods. Shen Guofang, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, repeated that warning today in Beijing. The more pressure the United States applies, he said, "the less opportunities the United States will have in the Chinese market."
The hardening of positions on both sides has led to warnings in the United States that American relations with Beijing are in a downward spiral that may only accelerate.
"Unfortunately, there is no plausible scenario to get out of this," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management and, until a few months ago, the Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade.
"We are in a destructive routine," Mr. Garten said after returning from a recent trip to China. "We accuse the Chinese, they balk, we threaten sanctions, they threaten retaliation. And no one really has a plan for arresting this."
The United States could find itself imposing several sanctions simultaneously. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is still contemplating a limited set of penalties for China's reported shipment to Pakistan of ring magnets used in the production of nuclear weapons. He has pressed China for a commitment to restrict any shipments to Pakistan but has received unsatisfactory responses, a senior official said today. "We're approaching a critical moment on that issue as well," the official said.
But the evidence in the proliferation case is still murky. In the area of piracy, it is much clearer: For months, American officials have pressed China to act against the 31 "official" compact disk factories in China, some of which operate under the aegis of the Chinese military. This year those factories are expected to produce upward of 200 million illegal copies of compact disks and the far more profitable CD-ROM's, used in personal computers.
Under last year's agreement, China committed to closing the factories or entering licensing or joint venture agreements to make them legitimate producers. So far only a handful have been closed.
Now American officials say they have discovered about 13 more factories, called "underground" operations because they operate without Chinese Government permission. It is unclear whether those were opened since China signed its agreement with the United States, or whether they have previously been missed by American businessmen and intelligence agencies surveying the scope of the piracy.
Chinese authorities argue that they cannot keep up with the opening of the plants, and thus cannot be held responsible for their operation.
A senior trade official described that argument as nonsense. "If these plants were turning out videos for dissident groups they would have been closed in two days," he said.
When Ms. Barshefsky traveled to Beijing last month, she told her Chinese counterparts that they had to take four steps to avoid sanctions: close the plants or turn them into legitimate producers; extend enforcement efforts deep into Guangdong Province in southern China; implement new customs rules, and improve access to the Chinese market for American movie makers and software companies. "So far, we have not heard back on any of those issues," a senior official said.
It is possible that China is simply waiting to the last minute, betting it can cut a better deal after American companies warn about the damage they will suffer if they have to pay far higher prices for Chinese goods. China only agreed to last year's accord on the day $1 billion in threatened sanctions went into effect.

HEADLINE: Conde Nast Is to Move to a New Times Square Tower, Officials Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In yet another sign of the fast-paced resurgence of Times Square, city and state officials said yesterday that Conde Nast, the publisher of Vanity Fair, Vogue, Architectural Digest and 11 other magazines, will move its headquarters to a building planned for the northeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway.
The plan, which effectively will jump-start the long-stalled effort to build huge office towers at the south end of Times Square, was described yesterday by five people directly involved in the negotiations, including senior economic advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. The officials asked that their names not be used because a formal announcement is to be made today by Steven T. Florio, Conde Nast's president, and Douglas Durst, the developer who is to build the new Times Square tower. 
 Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the Mayor's development agency, was the only official to openly confirm the plan. He did so indirectly, crediting John S. Dyson, the Mayor's departing Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, with having "made this thing happen."
The deal is unusual in several respects, not the least of which is that Conde Nast, which is part of Advance Publications, is to receive $10.75 million in "corporate retention" tax breaks from the city and the state, even though its corporate identity is so closely aligned with Manhattan that real estate executives say it is an unlikely candidate to leave.
But one state official directly involved in the negotiations said Conde Nast had threatened to move close to half of its 1,570 Manhattan workers, who are now divided among more than 10 office buildings, to one or more locations outside the city.
The official said the exodus would have involved "back office workers," perhaps including circulation personnel, advertising sales staffs and others not directly involved in the magazines' editorial content.
Under the terms of the deal with Mr. Durst, the city and the state, Conde Nast is to consolidate all its Manhattan workers in the Times Square building. It was not clear yesterday whether the staff of The New Yorker, whose owner, S. I. Newhouse, also owns Conde Nast, would move from its offices at 20 West 43d Street. Conde Nast officials would not comment on the move.
Conde Nast is to occupy at least 500,000 square feet of office space, with an option to take over an additional 150,000 square feet, in the building that Mr. Durst is expected to begin erecting by the end of the year. The building would have a total of 1.6 million square feet of office and retail space and be ready for occupany by the beginning of 1999.
By signing Conde Nast as a large tenant, the officials said, Mr. Durst has all but assured himself of support from the city and the state in his bid to buy the Times Square site, which stretches from 42d Street to 43d Street and is best known to many as the site of the boarded-up Nathan's Famous restaurant. Mr. Dyson had said he would not approve the transfer from the current owners, a group headed by the Prudential Insurance Company of America, to the Durst Organization unless a large tenant were in place.
The Prudential group was selected in 1981 as the principal builder of what government officials envisioned as four huge office towers that would surround the intersection of 42d Street and Broadway, paving the way for a Times Square renaissance.
But the Prudential plan became bogged down by dozens of lawsuits by civic groups that considered the proposed towers too large, and later by an office glut that resulted from large-scale construction around the north end of Times Square in the late 1980's.
Although neither Prudential nor Mr. Durst have disclosed what he is to pay for rights to develop the Times Square site, Mr. Durst is known to have circulated his building plans among several civic groups and city agencies in an attempt to allay fears that his proposal would have the overbearing impact that many had feared in the Prudential plan.
Mr. Durst plans to build an office tower with almost precisely the same amount of office space as had been envisioned by the Prudential group, but he has said he will do it on a lot that is 30 percent bigger, adding adjoining property that he acquired during in the 1980's. That means his building would be neither as high or as bulky as the one planned by the Prudential group.
City and state officials said yesterday that they considered Conde Nast an ideal tenant for Mr. Durst's building. Although it would not be the first internationally known corporation to move to the once-seedy blocks of Times Square -- Morgan Stanley completed its move to a new headquarters at Broadway and 47th Street in January -- they said the publishing house would complement the revitalization already under way along the city's historic Great White Way.
"It is hard to imagine anything better than a publisher of fashion, entertainment and literary magazines for a street corner that is going to meld the city's fashion industry to the south with its newly energized entertainment district along 42d Street," one senior official said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Warns Children About Smoking

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J., May 7

 BODY:
President Clinton dropped in on a New Jersey high school today to urge tobacco companies to stop aiming advertising at children, and he went on to a series of receptions expected to raise $2 million for Democrats in the state as well as his own re-election bid.
It was the President's third visit to New Jersey this year, with many more expected, underscoring the importance of the state in his own effort to stay in office. Republicans and Democrats consider the state's voters a fickle group that has leaned Republican but that can be wooed back to the Democrats. 
 At Woodbridge High School today, Mr. Clinton met with 10 students who had fanned out across the community to find cigarette advertising that appealed to children and to show that laws banning the sale of cigarettes to minors were poorly enforced. It was part of Kick Butts Day, an effort organized by Mark Green, the public advocate for New York City, at 40 schools in 12 cities.
Mr. Clinton, addressing 3,000 people in the high school gymnasium, reminded them that his own mother had died of cancer at age 70 after smoking two packs a day for most of her life. He noted that of the 3,000 teen-agers who started smoking every day, 1,000 would eventually die from it. "A 1 in 3 chance that you will end your life sooner -- that is a lousy bargain for no benefit," he said.
He also urged the cigarette companies to be more responsible. "You in the tobacco business now surely see the clear emerging consensus in America that advertising billboards and promotions should not appeal to the children."
While the crowd roared and stomped their approval inside the gym, young smokers outside professed themselves unimpressed. "If you smoke, you are not going to stop because the President says so," said Jessica L. Omoletski, a junior who was barely off school grounds before she pulled a lighter and cigarettes from her backpack. "It's an addiction."
After his speech, Mr. Clinton left for a private reception at the New Vernon home of Arthur Goldberg, chief executive of the Bally Entertainment Corporation; 30 couples had each donated about $25,000. In an impromptu moment as he was leaving the reception, Mr. Clinton stopped his motorcade along a country road to play a few notes of "Take Five" on a saxophone that a young boy was flourishing.
He later flew by helicopter to Liberty State Park, where he attended another private reception and where more than 800 Democratic contributors attended a $1,500-a-plate dinner with the comedian Whoopi Goldberg serving as master of ceremonies.
Mr. Clinton used much of his speech, inside the restored Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal, to talk about social and economic problems. "We have to figure out what to do about all these people who get downsized from big companies but who still have a lot of good years left," he said.
The President said he would soon hold a meeting on the subject to find ways to get companies to focus on how to help such workers. He also discussed economic security, aid to inner cities, trade, crime and racial harmony.
The $2 million raised at the two events will be divided in about equal proportions among the Democratic National Committee, the New Jersey Democratic Party and Representative Robert G. Torricelli's campaign for the Senate seat being vacated by Bill Bradley.
Both Mr. Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican nominee, will visit New Jersey frequently between now and the November election, political experts say.
"New Jersey has a large suburban population and those are often the voters who make up the difference in presidential races," said Joe Lockhart of the Clinton campaign. "If you can convince those people to come to your side, you are well placed to prevail on Election Day."
Part of the interest in the state is purely numerical. New Jersey has 15 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the Presidency. Part of the interest also lies in free advertising: visits to New Jersey produce news reports in New York and Philadelphia, two of the four largest media markets in the country.
"Doing a little bit better in Wyoming wouldn't do much," said Steve Salmore, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.
Ed Gillespie, communications director for the Republican National Committee, said: "New Jersey is a bellwether state -- it swings, you can't count it in either column and it is always hotly contested. We have a few seats there to pick up."
Mr. Dole's forces believe he has a natural following among the large number of veterans in the state, and they solidly back their Republican Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, in making income tax cuts.
On two previous visits to New Jersey, Mr. Clinton also highlighted family concerns. On Feb. 15, he visited a public school to announce that he was setting aside $2 billion over the next five years to improve the use of technology in public school education. On March 11, he used a visit to a Superfund cleanup site to stress his concern for environmental issues. His next scheduled visit, June 4, is to deliver the commencement address at Princeton University.
New Jersey is also critical state in the makeup of the next Congress. The race for the seat being given up by Senator Bradley is considered to be one of the nastiest in the nation, pitting Mr. Torricelli against a Republican Congressman, Richard A. Zimmer. Both need to raise $6 million to $8 million.
The Democratic Party also needs to pick up 20 seats nationwide to regain the majority in Congress and it considers gaining at least one seat from New Jersey a possibility.
Woodbridge's Mayor, James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, said he mentioned to President Clinton today that the last President to visit was George Washington, who went on to re-election.
"Yeah, but he didn't have any opposition," the President quipped to the Mayor.

HEADLINE: Dole Says He Has Plan to Win Votes of Women

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Bob Dole tonight directly confronted for the first time one of his greatest weaknesses in his campaign for the White House -- his lack of support among women.
"I've seen some poll numbers, and you've seen the poll numbers that say, well, there's a gender gap," he said to a group of Republican women tonight. "Does this bother me? You bet it does. I don't believe there should be a gender gap; I think that gap will close. Do I have a plan to eliminate it? Yes I do." 
 His plan, Mr. Dole said, was to start discussing his support of certain pieces of legislation of particular interest to women. He noted first that he had sponsored a measure to make it easier to convict repeat rapists. However, that measure was part of the 1994 anti-crime bill, which Mr. Dole ultimately voted against because it contained a ban on assault weapons. The bill passed anyway.
The second item for which he took credit was "leading the Senate" to fund the Violence Against Women Act. That, too, was part of the anti-crime legislation that he opposed.
The Senate majority leader, who is the presumptive Republican nominee, then turned to other issues that Republicans hope to use as part of their appeal to women. He said his record also included "fighting for a balanced budget, for lower taxes, for better schools, for a strong national defense and for building a brighter future for all our citizens."
The second part of his strategy to woo women's votes, he said, would be to point out the "credibility gap" between President Clinton's words and his actions. He pointed to Mr. Clinton's promises to balance the budget and restructure welfare, only to veto Republican measures that Mr. Dole said would have done so.
In Woodbridge, N.J., today, President Clinton focused on an issue the Democrats have identified as a family concern: teen-age smoking. [Page B1.]
Mr. Dole did not make even passing reference in his remarks to the current debate within his party over abortion. Moderate Republicans, including some prominent governors and members of Congress, have vowed to wage a fight at the Republican National Convention this August over the party's platform, which calls for an outright constitutional ban on abortions.
The candidate's speech, and his decision to confront his problems with women voters, came as a new national poll made public today showed Mr. Dole trailing Mr. Clinton by 25 percentage points. The Harris poll, which had a margin of sampling error of three percentage points, said Mr. Clinton would beat Mr. Dole 53 percent to 28 percent.
While surveys show Mr. Dole trailing Mr. Clinton among almost all demographic and economic groups, he does the worst among women voters.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that in a two-way race, men were divided evenly between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, 45 percent for each, but 52 percent of the women favored Mr. Clinton, while only 34 percent said they would vote for Mr. Dole.
As they try to confront this problem, some Republicans, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, are describing the sex gap as a problem merely of perception.
Speaking earlier today to the same group of women addressed by Mr. Dole, Mr. Gingrich promised "a tidal wave of communications" to correct what he said were false impressions of the Republican agenda created by President Clinton's "shameful performance of systematically misleading the American people." He said Mr. Clinton's false characterizations of Republicans had been fueled by a "passive conspiracy" of the liberal media.
"Liberals love to divide us," Mr. Gingrich said. But the Republicans, he said, can argue that "it is the welfare state which has been the most systematic oppressor of young women in the last 30 years."
Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, said in an interview later that the Republicans "have the challenge of explaining, not in shorthand for those inside the Beltway, but in human terms, what our policies intend to do."
But Ann Lewis, deputy manager of the Clinton/Gore campaign, said Mr. Dole had been "wrong on every major issue" affecting women, including, perhaps most symbolically, opposing the Family Medical Leave Act," which President Clinton signed.
She said Mr. Dole had displayed "an eagerness to cut back sharply at the expense of issues and policies that make a difference in family lives. It's the kitchen-table issues. I don't know how he turns it around, unless he's prepared to detach himself from the Congress of which he is a leader."
Mr. Dole said tonight that the Republican Party was "just as caring and just as compassionate as the other party." His solutions to the problems facing women were similar to those he has been offering on the campaign trail -- cutting spending, balancing the budget and returning power to the states.
Like Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Dole also said the press sided with President Clinton and distorted what the Republicans were doing. "We need to convince the media that we have a message too," he said.
Until now, the Dole campaign has done little to address women directly. By way of expressing support for working women, Mr. Dole frequently tells audiences that if he is elected President, his wife, Elizabeth Dole, will take a job outside the White House -- returning to her post as president of the Red Cross.
But then he seems to undercut that message by adding that his wife would "not be in charge of health care," a dig at Hillary Rodham Clinton that some perceive as meaning that Mr. Dole thinks women cannot handle important jobs.
This is obviously not what Mr. Dole believes, since his chief of staff and his top fund-raiser are both women, and his wife has had a high-powered career of her own. Nonetheless he has had trouble conveying that he is sympathetic to the concerns of ordinary women.
Perhaps hurting him the most, pollsters say, is that Mr. Dole is linked with Mr. Gingrich and the Congressional Republican agenda, which many women have told pollsters goes too far in dismantling the safety net that Government traditionally has provided.

HEADLINE: A Hit Season for Broadway;
Seems Like Old Times With Influx of Theatergoers

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Last Wednesday evening, the same night the 33d and final opening-night curtain of the Broadway season went up (on "The Ideal Husband" at the Ethel Barrymore Theater), Arnie and Ronnie Malasky waited beneath the marquee at Royale Theater on West 45th Street, where they would soon go inside to see George C. Scott in "Inherit the Wind."
The Malaskys -- he is an actuary, she works in retailing -- live in Westport, Conn., and they are regular theatergoers, venturing into the city, they said, even during the lean recent seasons, maybe a dozen times a year for dinner and a show. But they have been unusually active lately, part of the throng that is suddenly enlivening business around Times Square. In the month before they came to see "Inherit the Wind," the Malaskys said, they attended "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "Seven Guitars" and "The Night of the Iguana." 
 "And we're standing here talking about what other tickets to get," Mrs. Malasky said. "I want to see 'Master Class.' He doesn't really like musicals, but he just said he wants to see 'Rent.' And I think I can talk him into 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.' "
Her husband added: "We've been debating about 'A Delicate Balance.' It does seem there are more good shows than usual. There are suddenly a lot of things to see."
You know what? The Malaskys are right.
That Broadway is dead is so often repeated that it is conventional wisdom, a truism without being true. But after a spate of openings in the last six weeks -- 17! -- and an unusual rash of spectacular reviews, it is untruer right now than it has been in a long time. In the final week before the Tony Award nominations deadline last Thursday, Broadway shows sold $10.6 million worth of tickets, about 30 percent higher than the average for the year. About 9.2 million people are expected to see Broadway shows this season, the highest total for the decade.
"There's a surge of energy all across the Street," said Rocco Landesman, for the last 8 1/2 years the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway houses. "It's the most exciting season since I've been on the scene."
Actually, the excitement is not so much the raw numbers: attendance and receipts for the season, which begins and ends officially with the Tony Awards ceremony in June, are up over last year, but last year they were up over the year before; and the number of shows up and running, 28, is actually one fewer than at this time a year ago. What is extraordinary is the range and quality of the offerings.
"Not in years has a theater season closed with the last-minute arrival of such a variety of first-rate productions," the chief critic for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, wrote in his season-concluding review of "The Ideal Husband" last week.
Such vigor on Broadway translates, of course, into money, for the theater district in particular and New York City in general.
"Certainly, what's going on hasn't been lost on anybody," said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District. "We've been hearing it from hotels. We've been hearing it from restaurants. I just got out of a meeting with 12 mayors from Russia, and the first thing they asked me was, 'Why is it so hard to get a Broadway ticket this week?' " She added that the Broadway season has dovetailed nicely with the recent openings in Times Square of the Virgin Records megastore and the All Star Cafe.
"When the theater is going great, it feeds into everything," she said.
The Tony Award nominations, announced on Monday (the winners will be declared on national television on June 2), served as a reminder that Broadway has reassumed the theatrical supermarket look it had decades ago when there were routinely 50 or more openings in a season. There are now two one-man shows, the bevy of long-running megamusicals, three new dramas (alas, still a short supply) and a formidable list of musical and dramatic revivals.
Most notably, unlike last year, when "Sunset Boulevard" was the only full-fledged book musical to be Tony-eligible, this season there were seven eligible musicals, five of which are currently running. And in a startling reminder that the nominating committee does not always think the audience is right, the two others, "Swinging on a Star" and "Chronicle of a Death Foretold," received nominations for best musical, while more lavish and commercially successful current shows, like "Big" and Victor/Victoria" did not.
In addition, it has been a season that has been remarkable for, among other things, its recognizable stars: Carol Burnett, Carol Channing, Jason Robards, Mary Louise Parker, Ellen Burstyn and Patrick Stewart have all appeared on the boards, and Julie Andrews, Elaine Stritch, Zoe Caldwell, Nathan Lane, Lou Diamond Phillips, Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, not to mention Mr. Scott, are still around.
"What's happened is that three elements are coming together," said John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer who specializes in the theater. "You have your long-running shows, your shows that opened early in the season and the usual spring rush." The long-runners have remained strong, he said; the early-opening shows, like "Victor/Victoria" and "Moon Over Buffalo," and some shows that opened late last year, like "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" and "Smokey Joe's Cafe," have hung on with surprising tenacity.
And the new shows -- the hip new musicals "Rent" and "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk" -- have bucked a longstanding Broadway problem by making use of theaters often deemed undesirable. "State Fair," for example, a fairly sizable musical, has squeezed itself into a fairly small theater, the Music Box; "Rent" is in the Nederlander, which, away from the madding crowd on the usually deserted and downbeat West 41st Street, has never been considered a welcoming spot. But the show itself is about a, well, low-rent district, and the thematic fit has thus far worked in its favor.
"Rarely has it been the case that all these things have come together in such a powerful way," Mr. Breglio said. "It's all happenstance, all serendipity. In the middle of the season, I was concerned because there seemed to be no way of getting new shows in, and now the spring has hit us, and we've gone from a booking jam to euphoria."
It is probably too soon to assess the dimensions of the boon that the current surge of hits has been to local business, particularly because spring is generally a spurt period for restaurants and hotels. But try walking through Shubert Alley at 7:45 P.M., grabbing a precurtain drink at Sardi's or an early table at Orso and the frisson of a happening in the theater district becomes palpable.
"It hasn't been easy lately to get into my pet parking garage," said Mrs. Malasky on Wednesday night, a bit of a good-natured grumble.
The Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square has been running at an occupancy level throughout April of 85 percent, 2 points higher than a year ago. And citywide, said Steven J. Morello, president of the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, hotel occupancy rates should be up over 80 percent for the summer and into the fall, also up from a year ago, even without the events like the Pope's visit and the 50th anniversary of the United Nations that swelled the tourist ranks.
"It appears we have another demand generator," said Jonathan Tisch, president of Loews Hotels, which operates four hotels in New York City. "Broadway is booming and so is the hotel business."
Business on Broadway and business in restaurants have long gone hand in hand. Indeed, restaurant owners in the theater district have fought successfully in the past to keep producers from moving to curtain times earlier than 8 P.M. Why? So people will have enough time to eat. But Fred Sampson, president of the New York Restaurant Association, said new shows were particularly good for the restaurant trade.
For the first year or so of a show's run, he explained, theatergoers tend to be city denizens and individual tourists who take time to eat either before or after. Once a show has been around awhile, he said, it begins to attract the economy bus tour trade, in which people are ferried in and out on too strict a schedule to enjoy a meal.
"Big," which opened on April 28 at the Shubert Theater on West 44th Street, Mr. Sampson said, "is a perfect example of a show that's great for us." The musical it replaced at the Shubert, "Crazy For You," had been ensconced there for four years.
"For a while there it seemed like Broadway would become a living museum." said George C. Wolfe, referring to the long-running musicals and revivals that have dominated the Broadway fare for years. It was a good sign, said Mr. Wolfe, the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, that new shows developed in the smaller nonprofit theaters -- like "Rent" and "Bring In da Noise" have landed in the theater world's most prominent commercial venue.
"The more Broadway can embrace complexity, the more it's going to become alive," said Mr. Wolfe, who is the director of "Bring In da Noise."
So for the moment, optimism reigns. But the theater is always, of course, an iffy proposition. No one is willing to swear that the lingering drought of the last several years is at an end. Some shows are likely to vanish after the Tony Awards hoopla is over next month (one, "Jack," a one-man show starring Nicol Williamson, closed on Sunday) and others will struggle to last out the year.
And there are other questions: Will "Rent" -- which began life last winter at the New York Theater Workshop in the East Village -- sustain the initial enthusiasm that accompanied its surprising emergence as an Off Broadway hit? Will "Bring In da Noise" tap into a black audience with its rendering of the history of black culture in America? If the two shows do not begin to attract a new audience to Broadway, many theater professionals feel, the future is dubious.
"It's really urgent that they succeed, and scary that they might not," said James B. Freydberg, the producer of "Big."
The cautious optimism is probably best expressed by Mr. Wolfe. Can the good times last?
"My romantic self says yes, of course," he said.

Late last year, while making plans to cover the 1996 Presidential campaign, ABC News producers discussed how to get more depth into the usual polling and interviewing of ordinary Americans on the hot topics of the political season. But there turned out to be no primary season to speak of, as Bob Dole quickly became the Republican candidate opposing President Clinton.
"We decided we didn't need primaries, didn't need candidates or a campaign to explore in some depth how American voters, and nonvoters, were feeling about this country," said Kathy Christensen, the executive producer of "World News Tonight." 
 The result was an unusual project for network news. Ms. Christensen sent 10 reporters out to various parts of the country, without camera crews or even producers. They were told to roam across a state or region and to spend a week or two talking to people, discovering their concerns.
"We determined that what they found is what we'd explore, rather than what we thought were the hottest topics based on polls or the legislative agenda," Ms. Christensen said. The correspondents then returned to the same communities with cameras, to tape segments for "Listening to America," which will appear each night for two weeks, starting on Monday, on "World News Tonight."
The reports are not confined to one theme, the economy, for instance. Some are personal, like a divorced mother's regrets about how she raised her children, and some address broader issues, like how government helps or hinders a community project.
"It's been a very long time since we dispatched this many reporters to cover a single story that was not a major disaster," said Peter Jennings, the program's anchor. Overall, he said, "we found less anger than we expected, but every bit as much anxiety."
Around the same time, NBC News reporters were also out talking to ordinary Americans, but with a very different focus. "Lie, Cheat and Steal: Dishonest in America" will appear in segments on "Nightly News," "Today" and "Dateline," for one week beginning on May 19. LAWRIE MIFFLIN

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slides Against the Mark, But Stocks and Bonds Lend Aid

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slid against European currencies yesterday after remarks by two German central bankers incited a big demand for marks, but the dollar partly recovered on rising American stock and bond prices.
European traders, who have been betting on further weakness in the mark, had to scramble to buy the currency and sell dollars after Hans-Jurgen Koebnick, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, told a news conference in Germany that he believed the mark's depreciation had run its course. 
 Traders have been figuring that Germany's frail economy would prompt the Bundesbank to ease interest rates again, which makes mark-denominated holdings less attractive. The German central bank lowered rates last month.
The mark rally was reinforced by remarks yesterday from another Bundesbank council member, Hans Jurgen-Krupp, who suggested to a Spanish banking conference that there wasn't likely to be further German rate cuts. On Tuesday, another Bundesbank council member, Edgar Meister, expressed similar sentiments.
Victor Polce, foreign exchange manager at the New York branch of Commerzbank, said: "You had a lot of people who were long on dollars. So when a couple of Bundesbank officials opened their mouths, they ran for the exits."
The mark's strength hurt the yen, and the dollar gained against the Japanese currency.
The dollar fell as low as 1.5143 marks before settling in New York at 1.5163 marks, down from 1.5253 marks on Tuesday. The dollar also traded at 105.20 yen, up from 105.13 yen on Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.5235 from $1.5100.
The dollar began to recover in New York trading on strong buying demand at the Treasury's auction of $14 billion in 10-year notes.
The results prompted a broader rally in the United States bond market that snapped a two-day decline, and helped turn around the faltering stock market as well. The rallies strengthened the dollar by increasing demand for the currency needed to buy the American securities.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had fallen more than 78 points in the morning to the lowest level in three months, rebounded to close with a gain of 53.11 points.
"The mark's strength was the feature of today's trading," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst with Smith Barney in New York. "But the rebound in stock and bond markets in the United States sort of helped the dollar."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A supercomputer deal pits buying American vs. fair trade.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AMERICANS make the best supercomputers in the world. Or at least they did. Two Japanese electronics giants, Fujitsu and NEC, are challenging the supremacy of Cray Research, the Minnesota supercomputer specialist that was recently bought by Silicon Graphics. The three are bidding to sell a supercomputer to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, an agency of the National Science Foundation. Should Washington come to Cray's rescue and lean on the foundation to buy American?
The Clinton Administration, which has yet to express an opinion, is under pressure to view the question through a parochial political lens. Supercomputing, after all, is a glamorous frontier of high technology, the sort of industry where American business must excel if President Clinton's vision of global capitalism powered by Yankee ingenuity is to become reality. Besides it is an election year in America, and the folks who make Fujitsu and NEC computers don't get to vote. 
 But economists see another issue at stake. How can we ask Tokyo to play fair on trade issues if Washington doesn't? asks Robert Lawrence of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "If we make an exception for protectionism in high technology," he argues, "we'll all be worse off in the long run."
Supercomputers occupy a modest niche in the computer market, and a not very profitable one. But the prestige of making dazzling machines that can perform tens of billions of calculations a second has kept a number of major hardware manufacturers, along with a handful of specialized producers, in the supercomputer game. And after years of Byzantine maneuvering to defend their home markets and penetrate foreign ones, America and Japan called a truce in 1990. They agreed to open both public and private procurement to the lowest bidders.
Japan's commitment to a free market is a matter of debate. Kenneth Flamm, an economist at the Brookings Institution, suggests that public procurement is still uncompetitive in the sense that nationality counts a lot. The Japanese Government, however, has purchased seven of its last 13 supercomputers from American makers, while Japanese companies have yet to make a sale to a government agency in America.
American makers, among them Cray, arguably hold the technological lead in specialized supercomputers for military purposes like the simulation of nuclear explosions. But in peaceful uses, Japanse equipment is competitive on cost, performance and reliability. Fujitsu and NEC have recently sold machines for weather simulation in third markets (Europe and Canada) where the buyers have no particular reason to play politics with supercomputers. That is why the stakes in the current case are so high: it apparently represents the first clear test of Washington's will to honor the supercomputer agreement.
In theory there is a slender economic rationale for protecting the domestic American supercomputer market. The world may have room only for a handful of efficient supercomputer makers, just as there is room only for a handful of efficient jet aircraft manufacturers. Giving Cray a preference in the largest piece of the market may thus make it possible for it to survive, even thrive, among the more diversified computer makers.
But Mr. Lawrence is skeptical. "Are there really infant industries in mature economies?" he asks. Even Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of Mr. Clinton's National Economic Council, has argued that other approaches will work better than a guaranteed government market. In her book "Who's Bashing Whom" (Institute for International Economics) she wrote that "if a strong American supercomputer industry is itself a policy goal, some direct public support, preferably funds for cooperative, generic R&D programs is warranted."
Cray has raised another issue, letting it be known that NEC would lose $3 million on a proposed three-year lease to the atmospheric research center. Below-cost sales by foreigners (but not by Americans) are illegal if they injure American competitors. It is hard to imagine, however, that a single sale would result in injury under the standard usually applied. In any case, Mr. Lawrence says, it would be inappropriate for the science foundation or the center to weigh this untested allegation in the procurement decision.
Representative Martin O. Sabo, a senior Democrat from Minneapolis, where many Cray workers live, and recipient of $5,500 in campaign contributions from Cray executives, urged the White House last month "to stand behind our vital supercomputer research and industrial sector at this critical time." But Rick Anthes, the head of the nonprofit corporation that directs the atmospheric research center in Boulder, Colo., insists that the buck has not been passed. "With the National Science Foundation's encouragement, we are playing it straight," he said.
Cray seems to have overplayed its hand, making a very public issue of a decision more likely to go in its favor if it were made in secret. But appearances can deceive. By making a fuss over a choice in which it is still unlikely to prevail, the company may at least be able to turn attention back toward the Japanese Government, which will also be buying a supercomputer in the near future. Sometimes you win even when you lose.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Cold Weather and Expectations Of Shortages Raise Grain Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Grain prices surged on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, propelled by continued cold, wet weather and anticipation that a Government report tomorrow would detail robust worldwide demand but low grain stocks and poor yields.
On other commodity markets, crude oil prices fell, hurt by reports that United States reserves are more than had been believed and uncertainty about talks between the United Nations and Iraq on a limited sale of Iraqi oil. 
 Grain prices gained as investors squared positions before the scheduled release tomorrow of the Agriculture Department's supply-demand report, said Robert Lekberg, an analyst with Goldenberg, Hehmeyer & Company in Chicago. Traders say they believe the report will show continued strong demand and dwindling American stockpiles.
July wheat futures and prices of nearby months jumped the limit on the Chicago Board of Trade. Daniel Basse, research director at the Agresource Company in Chicago, said the move came partly because wheat stocks are at 50-year lows. He also said that buying by investment funds and continued concern about planting delays in the northern spring wheat area were factors.
Mr. Lekberg said wheat prices also gained on a report by the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis, which estimated that Illinois farmers might have to plow under half of their soft red winter-wheat crop because of poor weather.
July wheat rose the maximum 20 cents, to $5.91 a bushel; July corn rose 12 cents, to $4.74 a bushel.
Crude oil prices dropped slightly because traders believed that the price had stabilized. Traders are also awaiting signs of progress as Iraqi and United Nations negotiators continue a fourth round of talks on a plan to let Iraq sell as much as $2 billion of oil over six months to pay for food and medicine.
The market is "not moving much until we find out if they will reach an agreement," Tim Evans, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, said.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Shows Marked Pickup in the Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
A survey by the Federal Reserve pointed today to a marked pickup in the economy during March and April, more evidence that expansion is solid again in most parts of the country.
"Activity advanced at a moderate pace," the Fed's survey found, while price increases remained mostly subdued and there was "only scattered" upward pressure on wages despite a tight job market. 
 One exception, however, was the New York district, which the Fed singled out as having "weakened somewhat" in the last two months. Among the poor performers were factories in the Buffalo area and the housing market in Albany, the latter continuing to suffer from state job cuts.
Job creation picked up in both New York and New Jersey but the unemployment rate still climbed in New York because of a sharp increase in the number of people seeking work. A clear bright spot, however, was tourism, which the survey found "continues to boom," with the hotel occupancy rate in New York City reaching a 16-year high in the first quarter of the year.
The Fed's survey of its 12 districts was part of the preparation for the May 21 meeting of the interest rate-setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee. Today's report seemed to increase only slightly the chance that the Fed would soon raise short-term rates to prevent inflation from accelerating.
The Fed's latest anecdotal survey, which was issued at noon, had little effect on the financial markets today. While bond prices surged, the rally was largely attributed to unexpectedly strong demand for 10-year bonds at a Treasury auction.
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its index of economic indicators, which tend to move at the same time as the economy as a whole, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in March, less than the eight-tenths of 1 percent gain posted in February.
Last week, the business-sponsored research group reported that its index of predictive indicators, formerly compiled by the Commerce Department, also moved up for the second straight month.
The Fed's survey, titled "Current Economic Conditions" but widely referred to as the beige book after the color of its cover, said in its summary that all 11 districts other than New York showed expansion and that several of them reported that the pace had "quickened" recently. It noted a pickup in both retail sales and in manufacturing and suggested that factory inventories were no longer higher than desired.
"Activity also picked up in nonfinancial services, commercial and consumer lending and real estate," declared the summary, written this time at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. On the other hand, "mortgage loan activity slowed, as did tourism in several districts and agriculture suffered from adverse weather."
The survey found minimal the effect of a 17-day strike in March against General Motors. Even in Buffalo, where 6,000 were idled, the deterioration of manufacturing was "not directly related" to the strike, the Fed stated. And the Cleveland district reported that the strike seems to have had "only a small effect" on sales.
Despite a low unemployment rate, averaging 5.5 percent during March and April, most districts saw "little upward pressure" on prices other than for energy and grains, the Fed also found. And wage pressures were "only modest" over all despite several industries in the St. Louis district reporting higher costs and Minneapolis reporting pay increases of 4 to 5 percent.
One striking example of how tight labor markets have become in the upper Midwest, especially for blue-collar workers, was the decision by the Minneapolis-St. Paul transit system to reduce the minimum age for bus drivers to 19. A restaurant in the St. Louis district was reported to have delayed its opening for two months for lack of help, while a Tennessee hotel was forced to recruit workers from overseas. Atlanta reported that filling entry-level positions "has become a challenge."
On the other hand, the Dallas district reported fewer wage pressures or labor shortages than earlier in the year while Kansas City said "employers report few wage increases" despite a continuing tight job market.
The word from Chicago was that the area economy "remained at relatively high levels" despite pockets of slowing or actual decline. "Labor market shortages continued to be the main concern of businesses despite softening demand for workers from the manufacturing sector," the Fed survey found.

HEADLINE: Minding More Than the Bottom Line;
Two Companies and Two Different Views of Corporate Responsibility

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
When President Clinton convenes a White House conference planned for next week on the nebulous but politically charged issue of corporate responsibility, the list of those reaping his praise will not include Caterpillar Inc. or its chief executive, Donald V. Fites.
Mr. Fites, after all, is accused by many of his own employees of busting unions, closing plants and grabbing for huge paychecks -- the kind of managerial behavior that politicians are condemning in an election year punctuated by themes of economic insecurity. 
 By contrast, Sidney Harman, the chief executive of Harman International Industries, will be one of the corporate managers Mr. Clinton holds up as a model of how treating workers well is not only the right thing to do, but good for business, too.
To keep workers at his speaker-manufacturing company employed during business downturns, Mr. Harman pays them to make parts he would otherwise buy from suppliers, or to build clocks out of scrap material. He also offers extensive training programs. And Mr. Harman, whose wife, Jane Harman, is a Democratic Congresswoman from California, has tried experiments such as allowing workers to share in the proceeds of cost savings they propose.
The reputations of Mr. Fites and Mr. Harman may be at opposite ends of the spectrum in the debate over corporate responsibility, the concept that managers must have a commitment to the welfare of their employees and communities -- the company's other stake holders, apart from investors -- as well as to their bottom lines.
But, economists and business executives argue, the widely varying approaches can obscure the fact that managers are often attempting to do much the same thing: taking action, based on their companies' circumstances, to protect jobs in an environment of ever-intensifying competition.
Mr. Fites might have caused considerable pain by beating back a strike and holding down wage increases. But viewed as part of an effort to turn around a company that a decade ago was in real danger of collapse, his strategy could be seen as helping preserve tens of thousands of high-paying American jobs when many manufacturers were shifting employment to low-wage sites abroad.
"The first and most important responsibility of any corporation is to be economically viable, because if it's not it will eventually die," said Peter Feuille, the director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations at the University of Illinois.
"That's the issue Cat sees itself as addressing -- to press for the protection of its economic interests so it can remain viable over the long haul," Mr. Feuille said. "The issue is what kind of balance do you strike among a company's stake holders as you do it."
The business world has long argued that the corporate-responsibility debate -- with its focus on layoffs and worker insecurity -- has all but ignored the American industrial renaissance of the last decade or so. Caterpillar is just one example among many that have helped the United States recapture its standing as the world's most competitive and innovative economy.
Just a few years ago, American business was being attacked for failing to meet the challenge posed by Japan and other nations. Yet now, its defenders complain, it is being cast as callous by politicians and the news media for undertaking the cost-cutting and efficiency-enhancing steps needed to make it competitive.
The success of that effort, they said, has bestowed the most tangible of benefits to workers: a healthy pace of job creation -- more than eight million in the last three years -- and a low unemployment rate, currently 5.4 percent. At the same time companies are generating higher profits, which make more capital available for investment in new enterprises, better equipment and new jobs.
"During this last 10 years we have literally transformed American industry and by any standards it is the most competitive in the world," said John Snow, the chairman of the CSX Corporation and the head of the Business Roundtable, a trade association for the nation's largest companies.
But, Mr. Snow said, that transformation raises other questions. "The trick here -- and it's one of the major public-policy issues of our time -- is how to achieve the benefits of this aggressive, competitive economic system that is advancing our interests and creating so much wealth, while also addressing the anxiety that is almost a natural consequence of the change," Mr. Snow said.
The arguments of chief executives can obviously be self-serving. Wage stagnation and other economic problems continue to afflict workers. Layoffs at some companies are caused by the need to clean up strategic mistakes by top managers -- who later earn huge salaries and bonuses by taking credit for solving the problems they created.
Some chief executives have had reputations as ruthless cost-cutters for years. John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric long ago earned the nickname Neutron Jack for eliminating people but leaving the buildings standing. More recently, Robert E. Allen of AT&T, Walter V. Shipley of Chase Manhattan and Albert J. Dunlap of Scott Paper have been condemned for jettisoning tens of thousands of workers and collecting huge paychecks for their trouble.
But for the most part, their companies are now better prepared to compete and preserve the jobs of remaining workers than they would have been otherwise. G.E., for instance, has not cut jobs in recent years, but has been stable or even added jobs as it has taken the lead in many of its markets.
The Caterpillar case is particularly telling. In the mid-1980's, Caterpillar was at risk of falling to an onslaught of Japanese rivals. The construction-equipment company, based in Peoria, Ill., developed a survival plan based on heavy investments in more productive factories and cost-cutting that included taking on its powerful unions over wages and benefits. That confrontation -- and especially Mr. Fites's success in breaking a long strike by the United Automobile Workers union last year -- left many employees reviling him. Mr. Fites's paycheck last year of $4.07 million, up 53 percent from 1994, did not help his reputation, and neither did his recent decision to close an inefficient plant in York, Pa., eliminating 1,000 jobs.
"Cat used to be a good corporate citizen," said Jerry Brown, the head of the United Automobile Workers local in East Peoria, Ill., which led the strike. "Now it's all about arrogance and greed."
But in the end, Caterpillar thrived, giving remaining employees more job security than they had a decade ago.
Harman's experience does not yield any outright heroes, either. At Harman's main speaker-manufacturing plants in Northridge, Calif., and Martinsville, Ind., Mr. Harman said, treating workers well has paid off. Productivity at the Martinsville plant, for example, has roughly doubled in the last five years, largely because of increased training and other incentives, he said.
Still, Mr. Harman added, even a passionate commitment to employees' welfare can not shield them from every exigency. In 1990, the company had to eliminate around 150 jobs in Northridge. Several months ago, it laid off 250 workers there, out of 1,800, because of soft demand.
Most of those 250 are back on the payroll, employed in what Harman calls its Off Line Enterprises, making wiring that would otherwise be purchased from suppliers, doing jobs such as security and gardening that would otherwise go to outside contractors and building clocks out of leftover materials. Once demand picks up, the workers will go back to their regular jobs producing the company's JBL, Harman-Kardon and Infinity brand stereo equipment.
Keeping 250 workers on the payroll costs his company $130,000 a week, Mr. Harman said. But most of that cost is made up by savings on what the company would otherwise be paying outside suppliers for parts and services, he said. If there is a direct cost, Mr. Harman said, it may be that jobs at suppliers are endangered.
Indirectly, there is a danger that such policies "move into an area where people confuse it with entitlement," he added.
Despite his enthusiasm, many executives are skeptical about the benefits of doing more for employees, especially when funds for investment are tight and pressure for improved earnings is intense.
There is also the question of how far Harman's resolve would extend if the company entered a prolonged downturn, when the price of principle might not be so easily absorbed by growing sales and profits.
Mr. Harman, though, is convinced he is on the right track. "What I absolutely believe is that honoring the people who do the work can produce stunning results for the company," he said. "If the people in the factory believe there's a real effort to help improve their skills, provide opportunities for advancement and job security, they can do things that will blow your mind."
On the political front, the thundering denunciations of executive greed issued by Patrick J. Buchanan during his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination have largely died out. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, after engaging in some tentative corporation-bashing early in the primary campaign, rarely mentions the issue anymore.
The Clinton Administration is taking a moderate approach limited mostly to giving public plaudits to companies that combine innovative employment and training programs with strong bottom-line performances.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has dropped his suggestion that "good" companies could be rewarded through tax breaks or other government largess. The Administration line now is that good employment policies are their own reward, by generating worker loyalty, productivity and creativity, and ultimately in helping improve profits.
Whether a commitment to corporate responsibility takes root or fades when the next hot political issue comes along is itself a subject of debate among corporate managers.
"Most executives at most companies come out of a traditional experience and see this as a lot of talk," Mr. Harman said. "Companies that think it's a lot of bull will respond poorly to feeling pressured. But if the President eloquently makes the case in favor and offers examples of companies that are successful, it might arouse some interest. The best inducements to do it are the results."

 It would be hard to find two manufacturers more different in their approaches to the issues of labor relations and corporate responsibility than Harman International and Caterpillar. Caterpillar is bigger, more profitable and more productive. But so far this year, investors like Harman's stock a lot better.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Soar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday after an auction of new 10-year notes received strong demand.
Bonds were bolstered on the long end by short-covering from investors who had bet on a drop in prices and on the short end by buying from investors fleeing early losses in the stock market. 
 While the rally pushed the yield of the benchmark 30-year bond below the psychologically important level of 7 percent for the first time since May 1, market participants remain cautious. Many are waiting for further clues to the direction of the economy -- and inflation -- in particular, tomorrow's report on producer prices in April.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended up 1 8/32, to 89 2/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.95 percent, from 7.07 percent on Tuesday. For bondholders, the day meant a gain of $12.50 for every $1,000 invested in bonds.
The release of the Federal Reserve's survey of regional business activity encouraged buying only because it contained no surprises. The survey, known as the beige book, showed a pickup in economic growth in March and April, but with only scattered reports of wage pressures despite continued tightness in the labor market.
Traders and dealers spent much of the morning yesterday setting up for the Treasury's $14 billion auction of new 10-year notes, the final leg of the Government's quarterly refunding. Dealers maneuvered yields a bit higher to find a level that would be attractive and bring in the most investors. Many were hoping that yesteray's results would not turn out as weak as the three-year auction the day before.
But the 10-year note sale was well received, resulting in an average yield of 6.902 percent, below the 6.91 percent the market had expected. And while retail interest from small investors was a little weaker than expected, the bid-to-cover ratio was better than expected at 2.39, well above last auction's 2.01, but still average. The bid-to-cover ratio that compares the dollar amount of bids with the securities sold.
The boost to the market from the auction then prompted buying from short-sellers seeking to limit their losses.
P. Christopher Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, noted that a number of short positions -- or sales of borrowed securities, made in hopes of buying them back at a cheaper price -- were established last Thursday, after a report on first-quarter gross domestic product showed a faster pace of growth than had been expected. These short-sellers were betting that prices would fall.
But when Friday's employment report was not as strong as feared, "the market built a foundation relatively close to where it had bottomed out," Mr. Leary said.
"And thus today once the supply of the 10-year was handled with ease, a short squeeze occurred giving the market a lot of its forward momentum," he said.
Mr. Leary also noted that there was much speculation about asset shifts from mortage securities into Treasury securities and stocks into Treasury securities, shaking an already nervous market. "I think to a certain degree the market traded as if it were surprised at the moderate economic growth the beige book report suggested," he said.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.807
Average Yield . . . 6.902%

HEADLINE: Competition May Thin Profits In Sport Utilities

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 8

 BODY:
From pint-sized Jeep Wranglers to Chevrolet Suburbans the size of a garage, sport utility vehicles have been the mainstay of profits at Detroit's Big Three auto makers since the late 1980's. But now a small traffic jam of new models is emerging in the market, and auto executives predict that the profits, while still enormous, will start to erode.
The Ford Motor Company plans to display its largest offering, the three-bench, nine-passenger Ford Expedition, at its annual meeting in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday. In the last four months, Toyota has introduced the small RAV 4 sport utility and the Lexus LX 450, Nissan has completely redesigned its Pathfinder and Chrysler has come out with a new Jeep Wrangler. 
 Stock analysts predict that the new models, particularly the Ford Expedition, should initially be big money makers, even though rising gas prices are making them more costly to drive. The Expedition, selling for as much as $36,000 with options, could easily prove to be the nation's most profitable auto, adding up to $1 billion a year to Ford's after-tax profits by 1998, predicted David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc.
"I haven't been a huge, rah-rah supporter of Ford stock," Mr. Bradley said, referring to the fact the No. 2 auto maker's shares had performed poorly until recent ly. "But this could make a difference." Ford has not officially priced the Expedition, which goes on sale in September as a replacement for the Ford Bronco, but it is likely to sell for $30,000 to $36,000.
For hot-selling, full-sized sport utility vehicles like the Suburban, profit margins now approach $10,000 apiece, but that is likely to shrink, auto executives say, as more models go on sale.
"Clearly the profits will come down in that segment -- there's a lot of capacity coming in," said G. Mustafa Mohatarem, the chief economist at the General Motors Corporation.
Executives are concerned, even at the Chrysler Corporation, which has the advantage of owning the Jeep trademark and posted record sales for several models last month from a year earlier. "To say that Jeep is not looking over its shoulders at some of the people coming into the market would be incorrect," said Ed Brust, the general manager of Chrysler's Jeep and Eagle division. "The competition is coming and it's going to be a real dogfight."
J. D. Power & Associates, the auto consulting company, calculates that the number of sport utility vehicle models on the market grew by only one, to 30, over the last five years. But over the next several years there will be a net increase of 18 models, to 48 models in 2000.
A few analysts say that is a recipe for trouble for the Big Three. "You're talking about flat sales and increased competition," said Paul D. Ballew, the chief economist at J. D. Power, who estimates that sport utility vehicles accounted for half the profits at Detroit's Big Three last year.
But executives at domestic and foreign auto makers said that they expected the sport utility vehicle market to continue growing over the next several years, as new, more comfortable models entice more customers to make the switch from cars. "What we're still seeing right now is an increase in that market," said Brad W. Larsen, United States manager of trucks and sport utility vehicles for the Toyota Motor Corporation.
Only one of every 16 cars and light trucks sold in 1990 was a sport utility vehicle. But by last year, the figure was one in nine.
Japanese auto makers invested heavily in the late 1980's to make midsized luxury sedans like the Acura and the Lexus LS 400, while Detroit placed its bet on a rising sport utility vehicle market. Having initially bet wrong, Japanese car makers are now developing many more sport utility models.
Auto executives and dealers said that rising gas prices seem to have had little affect so far on the demand for even the biggest, fuel-thirsty sport utility vehicles, which get as little as 13 miles to the gallon in the city -- less than a Cadillac. "These are expensive vehicles, more than $30,000 a vehicle, and for the people who buy these vehicles, 10 cents a gallon or more doesn't have any effect on them," said Henry Valencia, a GMC, Pontiac and Buick dealer in Santa Fe, N.M.
The California market may be an exception, G.M.'s Mr. Mohatarem said. Gas prices are likely to stay high in California because of the state's requirement for specially formulated gasoline to reduce air pollution, he said, and that will eventually discourage some sport utility sales.
"You will begin to see the mix of sport utility vehicles in California is less than in Texas, say," Mr. Mohatarem said.
While advertised for their rugged ability to ford streams and charge up hillsides, sport utility vehicles are mostly used by affluent families hauling children around the suburbs. The larger models are surprisingly rare in rural areas, where many people cannot afford them.
Don Smolek, a farmer in Monterey, Ind., said that while he and his wife would like a larger sport utility vehicle to replace their 1993 Ford Explorer, they were unlikely to buy the Expedition because of the price. "Mid-20's is about as high as I'd go," he said.
But the recent experience of auto makers has been that while many middle-class customers pinch pennies on car purchases, affluent buyers have been snapping up the most expensive mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles without even waiting for rebates and other incentives. Dianne C. Craig, the marketing plans manager for the Expedition and Explorer, said that Ford expected only 10 percent of the Expedition sales to come from Explorer sales, while the rest would come from various other companies' sales of luxury cars, expensive mini-vans and very large sport utility vehicles.
The Expedition will challenge the near monopoly that G.M. has had until now on very large sport utility vehicles. The Chevrolet and GMC Suburban, which is in tight supply, has three rows of seats, like the new Expedition, a feature that has drawn buyers with large families or with children who participate in car pools or group outings. Last year, G.M. introduced the strong-selling GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe, which are big enough for three rows of seats but not currently engineered to hold them.
The Ford Expedition is roughly the size of a Yukon or Tahoe and is designed to be easier to park than the mammoth Suburban. Mr. Bradley at J. P. Morgan said that with the market for very large sport utility vehicles growing briskly, G.M. was unlikely to be hurt very seriously by Ford's entry into the market.

HEADLINE: Clinton Approves Plan for Sanctions Against China Over Piracy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
President Clinton, meeting with his top foreign policy and economic advisers about rising tensions with China, approved a plan today to go ahead with sanctions on Chinese exports to the United States if Beijing fails to stop producing pirated American software, movies and music, the White House said.
Mr. Clinton told the acting United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, to proceed next week with the publication of a list of goods totaling about $3 billion annually that could be subject to 100 percent tariffs on June 15 unless China complies with an accord it signed with the United States a year ago. 
 Before the sanctions are imposed, the list is likely to be winnowed to about $2 billion, roughly equivalent to the damage that the Administration estimates is being done to American software producers and entertainment companies by pirates each year. That would represent only about 5 percent of China's annual exports to the United States.
"The President reaffirmed that if we don't get satisfaction, we have no choice but to go ahead with the sanctions," David Johnson, a White House spokesman, said this evening.
While the session focused on the dispute over China's failure to protect intellectual property, White House officials said that far more was at stake. The meeting also discussed a growing concern that relations with Beijing are slipping further, with no clear strategy for ending the cycle of threats and counterthreats.
As a result, nearly all top Cabinet members took part in the meeting: Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is considering separate sanctions against China for its shipment of nuclear materials to Pakistan; Defense Secretary William Perry; Gen. John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, and Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor.
But participants said there was little discussion of a grander plan for dealing with China. Instead, the meeting discussed how to design the sanctions list so that it is likely to have the maximum impact on Chinese companies, especially those close to the Government and the military, while causing the least disruption to American retailers and others who might protest the action.
Administration officials said that the list will be sent to Lee Sands, a trade negotiator who is to be in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday, just before the May 15 deadline that Washington set for action by China on a plan to carry out last year's accords. Presumably Mr. Sands will brief Chinese leaders on the contents in the hope of extracting a last-minute settlement.
But even if, the Chinese made some accommodation that prevented the list from being published, China will still have 30 days to act before the Customs Service begins applying the 100 percent duties.
"We expect they'll take this to the wire," one senior Administration official said today.
The negotiations will coincide with a bitter, annual Congressional debate over whether to extend the so-called most-favored-nation trade privileges to China that has already divided both the Democratic and Republican parties.
The Administration has said that it would be self-destructive to cancel the trading privileges, which give China the benefit of low tariffs in the United States. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican frontrunner for the Presidential nomination, is expected to address the issue on Thursday morning in his first major policy speech about Asia, and is expected to support renewing the trade benefits with some conditions.

Wall Street's Moody Day: Prices and Predictions Swing

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Asked yesterday which way stock and bond prices were going, Wall Street traders responded like the confused posse in a slapstick Western, shouting "Thataway!," and pointing in every direction at once.
Thus began a day of extraordinary volatility on the New York Stock Exchange. Less than an hour after the start of trading, sharply falling stock prices triggered the Big Board's 50-point "collar," which attempts to quell volatility by restricting certain types of computer-driven trading. 
 Then, late in the day's session, the collar was triggered again by rising prices, as the Dow raced more than 50 points above Tuesday's close. It was the first time that the collars had been used in both directions on the same day since the so-called circuit-breakers were put into effect in the wake of the market crash of 1987.
The sharp turns in stock prices followed a similar move in the bond market, where prices headed higher in early afternoon. Analysts cited a stronger-than-expected auction of 10-year United States Government notes in the bond market's reversal. Some also mentioned the Federal Reserve Board's release of its beige book survey of the economy, which said the economy's continued strong growth last month brought with it only moderate signs of rising inflation. [Page D4.]
In the end, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 7 percent for the first time in four days, finishing at 6.96 percent. The Dow industrials, meanwhile, which were down more than 78 points at one juncture, ended the day with a gain of 53.11 points, at 5,474.06.
But if professional traders are uncertain about the markets' direction, individual investors appear steadfast, at least when it comes to stocks. According to estimates released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, cash flow into equity mutual funds in April totaled $23 billion, up slightly from March and the second-highest total ever.
Bond funds, meanwhile, recorded no net gain or loss in assets last month, the trade group estimated.
Those cash flows, of course, reflect in part money committed to mutual funds before the April 15 tax deadline, and some companies that track mutual fund cash flows have reported that inflows slowed late last month and in early May. In the meantime, market gurus at some of Wall Street's biggest investment banks have grown increasingly cautious.
For example, Byron Wien, a closely watched investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, recently penned a report titled "The Coming 1,000 Point Decline," a prophecy that, if true, would result in a fall of nearly 20 percent in the Dow industrials.
And Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, startled Wall Street on Monday with his recommendation that investors take a smidgen of their international holdings and invest in gold, the traditional haven of inflation-hedging pessimists.
Some market observers saw in yesterday's trading activity a clear rejection of that bearishness, which appeared to be gaining speed after four straight declines in the Dow industrials.
Ralph Acampora, a technical analyst at Prudential Securities, said that traders were closely watching the Dow as it moved below 5,400 yesterday. The bellwether index last closed below that level on Feb. 2.
As a technical analyst, Mr. Acampora tries to forecast the stock market's direction based on past levels of prices, volume and other market indicators. When the bond market started to move higher, he said, buyers quickly appeared for stocks that had been beaten down in recent sessions.
"That tempered the bearishness that has been building up for several days," Mr. Acampora said. "I think this will serve as the bottom for more sustained advance in stock prices later on."
Mike Niedermeyer, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Investment Management, which manages $56 billion in mutual funds and similar accounts, took similar solace in the economic data from the Federal Reserve. "The risk of rates going up from here is very diminished," he said.
"We've felt that while the economy is on strong footing, it's not that strong," Mr. Niedermeyer said, adding that long-term rates should fall back below 6.5 percent by the end of the year.
Other market indicators also reversed course yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished the day up 6.52 points, or 1.02 percent, at 644.78, a gain slightly stronger than that of the Dow. The Nasdaq composite index rose a mere 0.59 point, to 1,183.57, however, as technology stocks had a more difficult time recovering from an early selloff.
Yesterday's volatility was the most extreme example of a tendency for wide short-term swings that the stock market has exhibited all year. So far, individual investors have been unshaken by the trend, a fact further amplified by the mutual fund cash flow estimates released yesterday.
For the fourth consecutive month, equity mutual funds took in more than $20 billion in new money. Before this year, monthly flows into stock funds had never reached the $20 billion level. The $23 billion April total was up from $20.5 billion in March, and the Investment Company Institute estimated that most of the growth came from greater flows to global and international funds.
And while bond funds recorded neutral flows last month, that continued a slowing trend in place for two months -- one that probably owes less to the recent decline in bond prices than to the strong performance of stock funds, many of which are outperforming the S.& P. 500 this year, as opposed to last year, when most stock funds trailed that benchmark.

HEADLINE: Leelanau County Journal
<HEADLINE>When Winter's Grip Wouldn't Let Go

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

DATELINE: LELAND, Mich., May 8

 BODY:
Each fall, the weekly Leelanau Enterprise promises $100 to the reader who comes closest to estimating the final winter snowfall on this peninsula famed for its breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and miles of cherry orchards.
On April 25, 34-year-old Donna Thomas was declared the victor with a guess of 217 3/4 inches, 70 inches higher than normal. Winter, though, was not yet over. Six days later it snowed 4 inches more, bringing the official total in Leelanau (pronounced LEE-lan-awe) County to 231 inches, surpassing the previous record by two feet. 
 "Everybody was fine until those last couple of snows," said Wendy VerSnyder, a clerk at the newspaper. "We've all had enough."
With weeks of zero and below-zero temperatures, and snow that often falls at the rate of a foot a day, Leelanau and its neighboring counties in northwestern Michigan are accustomed to hard winters and chilly, reluctant springs. Normally, though, April means putting away the boots and heavy coats, and early May's warm winds prompt lakeside homeowners to put their boat docks in the water.
Not this year. Beginning with the first snow in late October, people in this region of farms and forests near the northern end of Lake Michigan have endured six straight months of snow, ice and shivering.
On May 1, motorists were still brushing snow off their windshields.
Grand Traverse Bay, on the east side of Leelanau County, froze over on Feb. 3, and did not melt until April 20, the longest frozen stretch in 70 years, according to the Coast Guard.
In Antrim County, a record 245 inches of snow fell, seven feet more than normal. "It's been a lot of battle fatigue," said Fred Hunt Jr., the manager of the Antrim County Road Commission, describing the mood of his 35 snowplow drivers. "It was constant pounding. They even got tired of the overtime."
Just about the only people not complaining are the ski resort owners. The long season and Michigan's surging economy are credited with helping to shatter every record for customers and revenue. As late as Sunday, as daytime temperatures fell again to the 30's, the slopes remained open at Boyne Mountain in Charlevoix County, capping the longest ski season in the resort's 48-year history.
Even old-timers have marveled. "In 1921 or 1922 we had a heck of a snow in April. It blocked the railroad for six weeks," said Edward Kahrs, an 89-year-old retired farmer who has lived in Leelanau County his entire life. "That's about the last time I can recall any winter this long."
The unforgiving winter is part of an unusual period of erratic weather in the upper Midwest. Last summer, near-record heat turned normally frigid northern Lake Michigan so warm that swimming in it was actually enjoyable, residents say. The colors of fall, usually a palette of brilliance, were muted and short-lived as temperatures plunged below freezing in October, weeks earlier than usual. The cold air and warm water combined to produce blizzards of "lake effect" snow in November and December.
Climatologists say the jet stream in the upper atmosphere is the source of the severe weather, especially during this lost spring. Normally, the jet stream begins to move north by March or April, bringing with it warming temperatures. This year, it remained fixed well south of the Great Lakes.
The talk on the street is that global warming, ozone depletion or the Pacific phenomenon known as El Nino is producing the unusual weather.
Michigan's climate specialists say that El Nino is not a culprit and that there is no way to confirm whether man-made global environmental influences are involved.
"What we know for sure," said Dr. Fred Nurnberger, the state climatologist, "is that until the jet stream moves north, we will have below-normal temperatures."
It has been so cold that the usual harbingers of spring have been three weeks late. Morel mushrooms, a regional delicacy coveted for their flavor and meaty texture, have not yet popped up among the matted leaves on the forest floor. Only in the last day or so have the buds on the cherry trees begun to swell. Even the bees at Kirk Jones's Sleeping Bear Apiaries in Benzie County, south of here, were not flying until after May 1. "It was too chilly in April for the flowers to open," Mr. Jones said.
So alternative messengers of spring sufficed. The ice fishing shacks were hauled off Crystal Lake in Beulah, although the ice did not melt completely until April 19. Like the return of the swallows to Capistrano, the seasonal restaurant owners came back. Jim Barnes, who spent the winter in Australia, has been cleaning out Northern Delights Cafe, his hilltop restaurant in Benzonia, in time for opening to the summer trade later this week. Down the hill, Jonathan Clark returned from Texas to reopen his L'Chayim Delicatessen, serving corn beef and pastrami to overflow crowds.
"I have traditionally opened the first day of May, and this year we had three inches of snow," said Mr. Clark, who was raised in Benzie County and is nursing a bad spring cold. "That will tell you one reason why I want to go back to Texas.
"It's been lousy."

HEADLINE: Down 78 Before Noon, Up 53.11 at Close

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded sharply late yesterday in a rally touched off by a drop in interest rates.
After tumbling as much as 78.39 points before noon, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 53.11 points, to 5,474.06. 
 The New York Stock Exchange said that yesterday's session was the first time it had ever invoked both uptick and downtick rules in the same session. The rules, which take effect when the Dow rises or falls 50 points, limit some computer-guided trading in an attempt to stabilize the market.
Among the broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.52 points, to 644.78, and the Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.76 point, to 1,183.43.
The stock market took its cue yesterday from the bond market, where surging prices drove the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- an important benchmark for interest rates -- down below the psychologically important level of 7 percent, to 6.95 percent from 7.07 percent on Tuesday. The rally in bond prices, which move in opposite directions from yields, was prompted by a stronger-than-expected Treasury auction of new 10-year notes.
The drop in yields helped bank and other financial issues pace the stock market's recovery. Shares of J. P. Morgan rose 1 5/8, to 84 3/8, and American Express gained 1 3/4, to 47 7/8, helping lead the Dow industrials' advance.
"Investors are clearly worried about inflation, but most don't understand what they're looking at," said Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "There is no inflation in this economy."
Banks in particular benefit from declining yields because they let them pay less to depositors. Nationsbank rose 1 7/8, to 79 1/8; Banc One rose 7/8, to 34 1/8, and Wells Fargo jumped 3 1/4, to 237 3/4.
Semiconductor issues were mixed in anticipation of a report, subsequently delayed until today, that is expected to show demand for computer chips remained weak in April. Intel rose 7/8, to 68 3/4, while Motorola was unchanged at to 61 1/4, and Atmel lost 1 1/4, to 38 1/2. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of 16 stocks rose 1.21 points, to 208.86.
Mr. Orlando of Value Line said the outlook for technology stocks was good. Microsoft and Intel will have new products this summer. Microsoft will offer new Windows software while Intel will offer a new version of its Pentium chip.
Microsoft jumped 1 1/8, to 114 1/4; Cisco Systems rose 1/2, to 52 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard fell 1/4, to 103 3/4.
America Online slumped after the company disclosed a pricing plan that some analysts said could cut into future profits. The stock fell 5, to 65.
Associates First Capital, a unit of Ford Motor, jumped 5 3/4, to 35 3/4, in its first day of trading. Shares of Ford Motor fell 1/4, to 35 3/4.
Another initial public offering, Nova, climbed 10 1/8, to 29 1/8.
Eastman Kodak contributed 5.7 points, the most of any company, to the rise in the Dow industrials, as shareholders gathered for the company's annual meeting in Rochester. Kodak rose 2, to 75 7/8.
Equitable rose 1/4, to 23 1/8, after it reported first-quarter earnings that were better than expected.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Offers A Fresh Budget With New Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Discarding the financial plan he submitted only three months ago, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his 1997 budget would eliminate many of the financial gimmicks and overly optimistic assumptions that led to repeated criticisms from fiscal monitors in the first half of his term.
But the price of what he called his "more realistic" budget, to be unveiled today, was steep: significant new spending cuts by city agencies that have already endured two years of reductions, and a retreat from most of the tax cuts the Mayor proposed on Jan. 31. 
 As a result, the Mayor told a small group of reporters, the yawning deficits projected for the end of the century, which had reached more than $5 billion, have now been cut in half.
Mr. Giuliani's statements yesterday were an acknowledgment that those deficits have now become his paramount fiscal priority, well above his desire to cut property and income taxes. And with his third annual budget, one that takes him into an election year, the Mayor suggested for the first time that he has begun to listen to the complaints from budget monitors and bond raters.
"It seemed to me with the criticisms of the monitors and the rating agencies, it made much more sense to take out some level of tax reduction that wasn't going to happen anyway, to create a better effect on structural balance," he said.
Unlike the preliminary financial plan he proposed in January, the 1997 budget will contain much smaller estimates of state and Federal aid, and will not rely on gimmicks that cannot be repeated in future years, like selling the city's parking meters for a quick infusion of cash. January's ambitious package of tax cuts has been reduced by 75 percent, meaning among other things that the 12.5 percent income tax surcharge may no longer expire at the end of the year. As well, city agencies will have to cut another $450 million from their spending, on top of the $691 million estimated earlier.
The details of the $32 billion budget will not be released until today. But based on the sketchy information issued yesterday, it appears that his new budget is much more likely to be be greeted favorably by fiscal watchdogs than his previous efforts.
"If all this comes to pass, he'll get a strong congratulations from us," said Raymond B. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-financed group that has often criticized Mr. Giuliani's financial planning. "We'll have to see the details, of course, but we may be able to say that we're very pleased he's seen the light, albeit a bit slowly."
The nature of the new cuts, however, remains unknown, and they could affect city services in a way that would lead to more criticism. Mr. Giuliani promised yesterday that spending for child welfare and education would be increased. And as he has for two years, the Mayor said his spending cuts would not affect city services. A survey by The New York Times last fall, however, found that many residents and civic organizations believe that city services have been reduced.
In his first two years, Mr. Giuliani, like most recent mayors, used a variety of one-time cash infusions, or one-shots, to get himself through the year's budget. The practice is roundly criticized by fiscal monitors here and in other cities because it does not solve the underlying deficit, allowing it to grow each year.
The Mayor's January financial plan included six one-shots for 1997 that would bring in $300 million -- including selling the city's parking meters, the Brooklyn Army Terminal and a variety of vacant lots.
Administration officials said yesterday that all six of those one-shots would be dropped in the 1997 budget. Several cash infusions that have drawn criticism will be in the budget, though the administration does not consider them gimmicks.
The city, for example, is moving ahead on a plan to borrow $500 million over 30 years and give it to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in exchange for $250 million in cash this year. It plans to spend $207 million from the sale of WNYC-TV for operating expenses. There are also likely to be assumptions in the budget on pension savings that may not happen, and back rent for the two city airports which may not be paid.
In previous years, the city has also relied on overly optimistic forecasts of state and federal aid, only to cut spending later in the year when those forecasts didn't prove accurate. For the 1996 budget, for instance, the administration first counted on nearly $1 billion in state aid, including $700 million in cuts to the city's share of state health care and welfare spending. The city received only a third of that amount.
In January, Mr. Giuliani estimated that the city would get $750 million in similar savings from the state next year, a figure that fiscal monitors immediately called unrealistic. Yesterday, the Mayor said that figure had been trimmed to $300 million, one of the lowest assumptions of state aid in recent years.
"When you look at the budget from the point of view of how is it viewed by the rating agencies and the monitors, there'll be much more reliance on actual cuts in government, and much less reliance on state aid," the Mayor said. "This is probably the least amount of reliance on state aid the city has ever had, which, given the fact that there isn't a state budget still, seems like the most prudent thing to do."
The Mayor said forcefully that he remains committed to carefully targeted tax reductions in order to stimulate the economy and noted that he had earlier cut the hotel tax and the commercial rent tax, reductions that remain in effect. But 1997 was to have been the year when the tax cuts began to directly affect city residents, rather than tourists and businesses. The 12.5 percent personal income tax surcharge was to have expired at the end of 1996, the sales tax on clothing purchases under $500 was to be dropped, and the property tax on co-ops and condos was to have been reduced.
The deficit has drastically changed those plans. The Mayor said yesterday that the co-op and condo tax reduction would be deferred for at least a year, the clothing sales tax would be cut in half rather than dropped, and the income tax surcharge would continue, pending state approval. Those tax cuts, he said, were more ambitious than realistic.
"I knew we weren't going to enact all of those, but the more aggressive I make the number, the better chance I have of doing many of them," he said, adding that the sales tax cut would stimulate the economy more than the income tax cut, possibly producing more revenue for the city.
He also acknowledged that proposal by the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, to use the income tax surcharge for rebuilding schools had proved too popular in Albany to stop, so he decided to include it in his budget. He refused to commit himself to using the money for school rebuilding, however, saying the subject will be negotiated with Mr. Vallone before being submitted to the State Legislature.

HEADLINE: Peace Plan for Liberia Seeks to Demilitarize the Capital

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana, May 8

 BODY:
West African leaders, in a last-ditch attempt to avert full-scale civil war in Liberia, approved a sweeping peace plan today that is intended to demilitarize the capital, Monrovia, and restore the country's fractured governing council.
Liberia's four principal militias grudgingly approved the plan, which calls for an immediate cease-fire, the removal of weapons and ammunition from the capital, and the return of an estimated $20 million worth of vehicles and equipment looted from international relief agencies in Monrovia in a month of fighting. 
 To help achieve this, the committee of the Economic Community of West African States called for the restoration of Roosevelt Johnson, a militia leader and former Minister of Rural Development, to his Cabinet post. Mr. Johnson's chief adversary, Charles Taylor, a deputy chairman of the governing council and initiator of the civil war in 1989, said his group would accept Mr. Johnson's reinstatement.
[Fighting resumed today in Monrovia, and aid workers returning to the city after fleeing the violence said they feared an outbreak of cholera, The Associated Press reported.]
Momolu Sirleaf, Liberia's Foreign Minister and a Taylor appointee, said: "We have all paid a terrible price for this fighting. We underestimated the volatility of the situation, and all of the players have suffered."
If many involved in Liberia's peace effort came out of today's meetings with renewed initiative, for others the new plan's weaknesses loom as large as its objectives.
Once those objectives are met, the plan calls for Liberia's Council of State to organize elections, which delegates here said would choose a new government this year based on proportional representation.
The plan also calls for stronger international support for the demoralized and underequipped 8,500-member West African peacekeeping force in Liberia.
Diplomats said today that Belgium and Denmark had offered to pay for additional peacekeeping battalions from Ghana and Burkina Faso, which has not so far taken part. The United States reiterated its willingness to provide as much as $30 million in new support, which would be used for equipment and training.
Particularly bitter criticism of the United States was expressed at the meetings here by West African leaders. Because Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed American slaves, there has always been a connection between the countries, but many in West Africa consider that Washington has been uninvolved in the crisis, other than in providing relief shipments and some financial aid. Unless it becomes more deeply involved, the West Africans and many Liberians say, no settlement can work.
While various aspects of the plan will be overseen by different agencies, the real teeth in it may come as much from an implicit threat by the region to abandon Liberia. Participants in the two-day meeting here said that could happen in July, when leaders of the Economic Community of West African States meet again, if by that time the country's militias have not cooperated fully.
"Few of us are prepared to spend time and resources on conferences on the same subject time and again," said Ghana's President, Jerry John Rawlings, who is chairman of the group.
Explaining the absence of several heads of state who had been expected here, Mr. Rawlings said: "The sub-region has grown tired of this issue. We should be grateful that so many high-level delegations have decided to come."
The meetings were conducted at the foreign minister level by the 16-member committee, made up of representatives of nine countries.
By repudiating the model of a collective presidency, the foreign ministers who worked out the settlement cast heavy responsibilities on Wilton S. Sankawulo, a grammarian who is the nominal chairman of Liberia's governing council.
Since taking office in September, Mr. Sankawulo has been seen by many observers as ineffectual, and since the start of the latest crisis, there has been a growing perception that he is controlled by Mr. Taylor.
Mr. Sankawulo reinforced that impression in a rambling speech to the conference today in which he made an unambiguous attack on Mr. Johnson and militia leaders who have supported him in the fighting.
A dismayed Ghanaian diplomat said of Mr. Sankawulo: "This man lives with Taylor, he is fed by Taylor, and he even gets his pocket money from Taylor. By his very speech he has made clear that he is not the kind of person the situation calls for. We are going to have a very hard time ahead."
By relying on the peacekeepers to play a greater role in enforcing the peace in Liberia, the plan also glosses over the force's own role in precipitating the crisis.
In the weeks that led up to the fighting, diplomats say the peacekeepers seemed to wink as Mr. Taylor and allied militia leaders moved weapons and fighters into Monrovia.
When the fighting began, the peacekeeping force, which had repelled fierce offensives against the capital in the past, melted away from its positions, and its members often watched complacently as the city was overrun with fighters and given over to wholesale looting.
For many, the latest unrest in Liberia has its roots in fighting between Nigerian units in the peacekeeping force and Mr. Johnson's faction over control of diamond fields near the town of Tubmanburg.
Most of all, however, the peace plan fails to explain how the atmosphere of venomous distrust separating one militia from another, and some of the factions from the peacekeeping force, can be cleared.
Nowhere was this distrust more apparent than in the attitude of Mr. Johnson, who appeared not to be mollified by the offers to reinstate him. After the latest fighting, Mr. Johnson said that to entrust his security to the West African peacekeeping force was tantamount to accepting the slaughter of his own men.
Referring to a previous peace plan, he said: "Last year these very same diplomats gave us a formula, and that formula has failed. Now, rather than honestly looking at the reasons for the failure, they are saying, 'Hey, guys, go back and apply the same formula.' They might as well be saying, 'Go back and fight it out.' "

HEADLINE: In New 6-Year Budget Plan With Gentler Reductions, Republicans Ease Toward Center

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans moved toward the moderate center in the balanced-budget debate today, offering a new six-year plan to erase the Federal deficit that assumes a far smaller tax cut and gentler reductions in popular programs than they had demanded even six months ago.
Many of the plan's major proposals for savings are close or identical to those in a compromise budget-balancing plan that 20 moderate Republicans and Democrats released last week, and that President Clinton has praised. 
 The Republicans also bowed to Mr. Clinton's position on an important part of the politically sensitive Medicare program, accepting a decline in insurance premiums that automatically took place last year even as the program's cost mushroomed. Republicans had sought last year to hold premiums at what was then their current level.
Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader and presumptive Republican Presidential candidate, called the plan "a very reasonable and very responsible budget which will be in balance by 2002."
Of the President, he added, "We think it's one he might be inclined to accept."
That said, the proposal also resembles in some ways the last budget deal that Republicans offered, and Mr. Clinton rejected, in negotiations that collapsed in February.
Indeed, the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, issued a statement later today saying the new proposal "looks like more of the same," and calling the spending levels for Medicare and other benefit programs unacceptable. He again called for new budget talks between Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders.
At least one Republican principal in the earlier talks, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, said that even if the two sides could agree on the savings in specific programs, they were worlds apart in their ideas of what policy changes were needed to make those savings occur.
Mr. Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the Republican proposal sought to take Federal control of welfare, Medicare, education and other major programs and "send it home" to the states and to individuals. By contrast, he said, Mr. Clinton's budget seeks to preserve those powers in the Federal bureaucracy.
"I don't know how you reach agreement when the level of disagreement is over whether you trust people or not," he said.
The new Republican plan is the starting point for the 1997 budget that Congress intends to write and send to Mr. Clinton by fall. It proposes to cut $77 billion from domestic discretionary programs like road building and environmental protection. Defense spending would rise by a total of $13 billion from the current year's level.
Spending on welfare and benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid would still grow, sometimes sharply, but the rise would still be smaller than if the programs were left unchanged.
Medicare spending, for example, would increase from $209 billion in 1997 to $279 billion in 2002, but that increase would still save $158 billion over six years. Medicaid spending would be $72 billion less than is now forecast; welfare spending would drop $53 billion below projections.
The Republican plan proposes $122 billion in tax cuts over six years, all of which would be devoted to a $500-a-child tax credit. That compares with $245 billion in tax cuts that the party demanded in legislation that passed Congress last November, and which Mr. Clinton vetoed.
But Mr. Kasich and others made it clear that Congress's tax writing committees would be free to tack on additional tax relief if they could find the money to pay for it by closing tax loopholes. In particular, Mr. Kasich said the legislation that Congress eventually passes would also include a cut in the tax rate on capital gains.
"My feeling is you'll have a gross tax cut that approaches $180 billion -- gross," he said.
Congressional leaders said they stuck, by and large, to the changes in policies that were the foundation of the 1996 budget, and which contributed heavily to the impasse with Mr. Clinton last winter.
The plan still envisions handing most responsibility for welfare programs to the states and ending the Federal entitlement to Medicaid benefits, although Mr. Kasich said the poor would still receive some form of guaranteed medical care.
Like Mr. Clinton's proposal, the plan would further open Medicare to managed care plans like health maintenance organizations; unlike his plan it would give retirees the option of setting up tax-free savings accounts to pay medical bills.
The House version proposes to eliminate both the Energy and Commerce Departments; the Senate would leave Energy somewhat intact. The House proposal would eliminate the Goals 2000 education program and end direct lending to college students by the Federal Government, programs close to Mr. Clinton's heart.
But the plan also addresses some of the Democratic attacks on spending cuts that have cost the Republican Congress dearly in political support. The Senate version would raise spending for space exploration above Mr. Clinton's proposed 1997 level, and raise 1997 spending on two environmental programs, the Superfund hazardous-waste cleanup effort and the Safe Drinking Water Act, by a total of $1.2 billion.
The latest numbers cannot be compared directly with the figures in the budget that Republicans sent to the White House last November, because that proposal spread tax cuts and savings over seven years. The latest plan would take effect a year later and would achieve balance in six years.
Many of the new spending proposals nevertheless are less dramatic than those first offered by Congress last fall, for reasons ranging from calculated politics to pure fate.
The switch from a seven-year to a six-year plan has made it easier to reach balance, because it means that the tax cuts have one less year in which to rack up revenue losses.
Also, a better-than-expected economy has softened the forecasts of welfare spending and bolstered estimates of tax revenues.
Republicans also benefited from their success in cutting spending in this year's budget. Domestic discretionary spending for the year that ends on Sept. 30 will have dropped $20 billion below the previous year, the first such decline in decades; those savings will multiply over the next six years.
"Their spending cuts are lower because they actually accomplished a good deal last year, although nobody seems to have recognized it," Robert O. Reischauer, the Brookings Institution scholar who headed the Congressional Budget Office until 1995, said in an interview.
Mr. Reischauer said he was familiar with the broad outlines of the latest proposal. "It's a credible means of achieving their objective of a balanced budget," he said. "But it would be more credible if the tax cuts were scaled back and their assumed reductions in discretionary spending were moderated."

HEADLINE: Fewer File First Claims for Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The number of first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,000 last week to the lowest level in four months, the Labor Department said today. New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 336,000, down from 348,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, when claims fell by 24,000.
Last week's total is the smallest number of new claims since 316,000 were filed in the week that ended on Jan. 13, when the blizzard along the East Coast and severe weather elsewhere kept many laid-off workers from visiting unemployment offices. 
 Many analysts had expected a slight increase last week to about 355,000. They contend the current range of claims indicates modest job growth.
The Labor Department earlier reported that after jumping to 624,000 in February, the number of new jobs slipped to 140,000 in March and just 2,000 last month.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims fell by 3,500, to 353,750, from 357,250 the previous week. The latest total is the lowest since the average was 348,250 during the period ended last Sept. 2.

HEADLINE: Prices and Hopes Rise As Spring Art Auctions Reveal a Robust Market

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
The 1996 spring auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in Manhattan will not be remembered for their high prices. Nor will many blockbuster paintings stand out in anyone's mind. Still, these sales have made a significant impression on the art world because of the increase in the number and enthusiasm of buyers at every level.
Even the market for contemporary art, which has been trying desperately to pull itself out of a five-year slump, got a big boost this week. 
 Call it a pent-up desire to spend money, a decision that the time is right to invest in art again or simply a positive feeling about the economy -- whatever the reason, the percentages of art that sold at every auction were higher than either Sotheby's or Christie's had seen since the art market soured at the end of 1990. And for the first time in five years, the middle range of the market was suddenly hot.
This was quite a change from the last two seasons, when buyers were so discerning that only the top end -- the priciest works, with a pristine past -- was desirable. Those works that did not pass the test would, more often than not, remain unsold. But as the buying pool grew this spring, so did the price range of the art that was bought.
"Now, there is a market for everything, if it is estimated properly," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in New York. "There's definitely more confidence in the market."
Diana D. Brooks, chief executive officer of Sotheby's worldwide, agreed. "There's clearly a desire to buy art, and this season there were a lot of new buyers."
Maybe the overheated prices at the recent Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sales at Sotheby's made art buyers stop and think: after watching a set of golf clubs sell for more than $700,000, and a rocking chair bring nearly $500,000, perhaps an Impressionist painting for under $500,000 suddenly seemed reasonable.
"It's true that a lot of attention was drawn to the art market as a result of the Onassis sale," Mrs. Brooks said. She also reported that several buyers from the Onassis sale, who were new to Sotheby's, came and bid at its Impressionist and modern sales.
In taking stock of the last two weeks, art experts were quick to point out that the market was performing in a traditionally cyclical fashion. "We're mid-cycle," said Mr. Burge, who predicted that the market, which hit bottom in 1991, could reach another peak in about three years.
Even the buyers are beginning to form a predictable pattern. This season, for the first time in five years, buyers from Asia were supporting the Impressionist and modern art sales. At the Christie's sale, 16 percent of the buyers were Asian; at Sotheby's the following evening, that grew to 20 percent. But in contrast to the boom years of the late 1980's, when Asians often paid gigantic prices for second-rate works, this season's buyers tended to bid with a fair amount of caution.
Gone are the Asian dealers investing in mid-range Impressionist paintings as though they were cashing in a speculative stock; while dealers were still bidding, both auction houses said the dealers tended to be working on behalf of collectors. Japanese collectors still tended to dominate the Asian buying, as they had during the late 1980's, but this season there were also bidders and buyers from Indonesia, Korea, Singapore and Malasia, countries experiencing an economic boom.
Impressionist paintings have long been popular in Asia. At Sotheby's, the evening's most expensive work, Monet's "Grain Stacks at Giverny, Morning Light" (1889), went to an unidentified Asian buyer for $7.1 million, just above its $7 million high estimate.
(Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
As a whole, Impressionist paintings sold more solidly than they have in years, but prices tended to hover around their estimates. At Christie's, David Nahmad, a Manhattan dealer, bought Monet's "Contarini Palace" (1908), a view of the Venetian palace with its reflection in the Grand Canal, for $4.2 million, just above its $4 million low estimate.
Many bidders at Christie's also fought to own Monet's "Charing Cross Bridge," which finally fetched $3.9 million, above its high estimate of $3.5 million. At Sotheby's, Vuillard's "Square Berlioz (La Place Vintimille)," a 64-by-90-inch painting of a small square seen from the artist's balcony in Paris, sold to David Tunick, the Manhattan dealer, for $3 million, right at its low estimate.
This season's most expensive painting was also bought by a dealer. James Roundell, from London, bidding on behalf of a client, purchased van Gogh's "Interior of a Restaurant" (1887-1888) for $10.3 million, right at Christie's estimate. The painting had belonged to the Danforth family from Rhode Island and had been in private hands for generations.
Such multimillion-dollar sales were harder to come by at the contemporary art auctions. But if a painting, drawing or sculpture was well priced, bidders were hungry to buy it.
And buy they did, often at prices well above the works' estimates. Of the two auction houses, Christie's had a leaner sale, with only two paintings selling for more than $1 million. Both were new to the market. Topping its sale, held on Tuesday night, was Willem de Kooning's "Mailbox," a 1948 gem, which sold to an unidentified American collector bidding by telephone for $3.7 million, above its $3 million high estimate. Christie's sale totaled $15.2 million, in the middle of its $13.2 million-to-$17 million estimate. Of the 46 works offered, 9 failed to sell.
Sotheby's offered five paintings with prices above $1 million, but three of them did not find buyers. "We were disappointed," Mrs. Brooks said. "But some of these works had been offered around. On other works, there were still many strong prices."
Sotheby's sale, held on Wednesday night, brought a total of $13.4 million, below its $23 million-to-$31 million estimate. Of the 59 works for sale, 14 did not find buyers. The evening's biggest disappointment came when de Kooning's "Woman as Landscape" (1954-55) failed to sell. Bidding never passed $4.9 million, way under its estimated price of $6 million to $8 million. Works by Franz Kline and Jasper Johns also failed to sell.
But when something was fresh and priced right, buyers responded. Gorky's "Study for Agony" from 1947, for instance, sold to an unidentified bidder for $2.4 million, just under its $2.5 million low estimate.
The property that outshone everything else at Sotheby's on Wednesday night was the group of 17 works from the estate of Helen W. Benjamin, a New York philanthropist. Sixteen sold, many for well above their estimates. Among the highlights were Kline's "Acute Accent," a 1957 black-and-white abstract painting, which sold to a telephone bidder for $717,500, just below its $800,000 low estimate, and Agnes Martin's "Tree," a 1964 grid painting, which sold for $525,000, well above its $350,000 high estimate and a record price for the artist.
Because contemporary art collectors tend to be younger, estates like the Benjamin one are rare. "But when you do get one, there are often 10 bidders for every lot," Mrs. Brooks said. "People go crazy for estate property."

Yield Climbs Back Over 7% On Long Bond

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Concerns that new price data will show a pickup in inflation dragged down Treasury prices yesterday, pushing the yield on the long bond back above 7 percent.
A report on jobless claims caused more jitters for a market already nervous about inflation. The Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits for the first time fell 12,000 last week, to 336,000 -- the lowest level since the week that ended Jan. 13. The report reminded market participants a day before the Government reports on producer prices in April that labor and inflation pressures had not faded. 
 James Padinha, an economist with MMS International, San Francisco, said a substantial increase in the cost of gasoline during April could be reflected in today's Producer Price Index and next week's Consumer Price Index, which may ratchet up the market's fears about inflation.
"However prepared the market is for the possibility of painful P.P.I. and C.P.I. numbers, it will still wince when the headline figures hit," he said. "But anything more pronounced than only a short-term reaction is probably not justifiable."
Yesterday, the inflation concerns kept many buyers on the sidelines and caused others to sell long maturities and seek refuge in the shorter maturities.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 23/32 , to 8712/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7.02 percent, from 6.95 percent on Wednesday.
The market received some support from an auction of 36-day cash management bills, which saw strong investor demand. The Treasury sold $13 billion of the bills at an average rate of 5.05 percent. Cash management bills are sold to meet the Treasury's short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regularly scheduled auctions.
In bond futures trading, which can affect cash market trading, "the technicals look pretty clear-cut," said Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston.
"The market looks biased to trade between a price of 10731/32 and 1078/32 on the June bond futures contract," she said. "A caveat would be if the market tries to break and reverse the pivotal 1088/32 level and that would trigger a further rally up to 1092/32 to 11/32 ."
Yesterday, the June bond futures contract hit a day session high of 10812/32 , with the low set at 10717/32 , as it closed at 10718/32 .
In the corporate bond market, the Chrysler Financial Corporation, through its Premier Auto Trust 1996-2, sold $1.5 billion of asset-backed securities in four parts through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company. The issue is backed by automobile loan receivables.
The $300 million class A-1 issue was not reoffered to the public but retained by Chrysler while the $735 million A-2 class, which has an average life of 0.96 years was price to yield 5 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than the one-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which was about 5.44 percent by late in the day. The Libor is the rate that large international banks charge each other for loans in dollars.
A $435 million A-3 class, with an average life of 2.07 years was priced to yield 6.45 percent, or about 32 basis points more than a two-year Treasury note. For $264.4 million of an A-4 class with an average life of three years, the yield was 34 basis points more than a Treasury three-year note.
The class A securities are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 36-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark's One-Day Rally Fades, Improving Value of the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday, deriving strength from a selloff in the mark that traders attributed largely to profit taking from a short-lived rebound.
Ambiguous comments from the German central bank's chief economist about the risks of creating a single European currency by the end of the decade may also have contributed to mark weakness and dollar strength, some dealers said. 
 In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5200 marks, up from 1.5163 on Wednesday. The dollar traded at 104.72 Japanese yen, down from 105.20 yen. The British pound eased to $1.5231 from $1.5235.
The mark had risen sharply on Wednesday and early yesterday after some members of the policy-making council of the central bank, the Bundesbank, said that the currency's gradual depreciation had run its course and that interest rates were not likely to fall further. Those remarks were seen as a signal to buy marks.
But the lack of any follow-through comment from senior bank council members about the mark's value helped convince traders it was time to take profits from the currency's rally.
By late afternoon in Europe, they were buying Japanese yen and selling marks. That indirectly helped the dollar against the mark and other European currencies.
"The lack of any Bundesbank remarks helped us recover in the dollar," said Elena Shperling, senior currency trader at the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch.
Although no council member of the German central bank made any market-moving remarks yesterday, some traders said that a speech by its chief economist, Otmar Issing, to the Bavarian state parliament might have contributed to renewed speculation that German rates would come down. Lower rates would weaken demand for marks by making mark-denominated deposits less attractive.
Mr. Issing said high deficits and other financial problems among European Union countries might require a delay in the plan for a single currency. Such a delay might create some leeway for these countries, led by Germany, to lower interest rates in order to combat economic sluggishness.
"It appears to me they could be setting up the market for a rate cut in the near future," said Hugh Walsh, vice president at ING Capital Markets in New York.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Without an economic cycle, those high-flying cyclical stocks may be in for a hard landing.

BYLINE: By Reed Abelson 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in cyclical stocks have already discovered significant relief from the recent slide in the stock market. Although the broader market has fallen nearly 3 percent since its peak in mid-February, cyclical stocks have withstood much of the turbulence. So far this year the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index has climbed 13 percent, compared with a 5 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index.
Because the economic picture has improved, the fortunes of cyclical companies like Caterpillar, Ford Motor and Union Carbide, which typically move in tandem with the general economy, have brightened considerably. Wall Street strategists have gone from predicting a possible recession to arguing about how fast the economy is growing. 
 But the Federal Reserve's apparent victory in engineering a soft landing and quick takeoff for the economy may prove less a blessing than many investors expect. While some cyclical stocks should continue to do well as the economy expands, the lack of a cycle may actually make them less attractive. Many have already run up in price and may well serve as a harbinger for a sharp market downturn, Thomas McManus, an investment strategist for Morgan Stanley, contends.
"I'm convinced there will not be a big move in cyclicals," Mr. McManus said. He argues that individual investors considering a bet on cyclical stocks might do well instead to consider traditional growth stocks like American Home Products and Gillette as long-term holdings. "For all but the most sophisticated investors, it's probably not going to be a good time to own cyclicals," he said.
The best way to make money buying cyclical stocks is to scoop them up at or near the bottom of the cycle, Mr. McManus noted, but recognizing such a bottom is nearly impossible for most individuals. Still, those prescient enough to have bought shares of Chrysler at $9 in late 1990, for example, are looking at tremendous gains. "You get one big trade per economic cycle," he explained. "All you have to do is hold your nose and buy them in a recession." By preventing a deep and prolonged recession, the Fed denied investors the opportunity to buy cyclicals at their lows.
To be sure, investors with good timing have been able to make some money by investing in cyclicals, and Mr. McManus sees an opportunity for some further profits. But many of the cyclical stocks that do well at the beginning of an economic expansion, like auto or housing-related stocks, have already recovered nicely and moved on to substantial gains. Chrysler, for example, bottomed at $38.25 in early 1995 before reaching a new high of a shade over $65. It closed yesterday at $64.50, up 37.5 cents.
The lack of a cycle may also hurt some of these companies by encouraging the competition. Companies are far less likely to expand or enter new markets if they are in the throes of an economic downturn or worried about an impending recession. Nissan and Toyota, for example, might not have been as busy as they have introducing new sports utility vehicles if the economic cycle had not been as smooth. "At least a good thing about cycles is it keeps your competitors at bay," Mr. McManus said.
Investors should now be focusing on what Mr. McManus calls late cyclicals, companies that tend to benefit from the last stages of an economic expansion like Champion International, the paper and forest-products company, and Alcoa, by providing manufacturers with raw materials. "It's almost like a relay race," he said, describing the passing of the torch between the two groups. Mr. McManus is also bullish on the Canadian stock market because of the preponderance of Canadian mining, energy and forest-products companies.
If the Canadian market, as measured by Morgan Stanley's own index, does better than the United States market this year, it could also signal a coming stock market decline. Since 1980, the Canadian market has outperformed domestic stocks in only three calendar years -- 1983, 1987, and 1993 -- each of which preceded a rate increase by the Fed and a subsequent stock market drop. This time could be no different, Mr. McManus suggested, noting that late-cycle stocks tend to be the last group of equities to do well before a downturn, although they may hold up better in a decline. Morgan Stanley is forecasting a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, or a roughly 20 percent decline, in the second half of 1996.

HEADLINE: Price Increases: First They Have to Stick

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Dennis Russell, a home builder in San Diego, has been waiting a long time to charge more. The strong interest in the last three homes in his latest project -- 45 tract houses priced at $118,000 each -- seemed like a perfect invitation to add several thousand dollars to the sale price. But he passed up the opportunity.
"Why do that and anger people?" he asked. Maybe next time he will try building similar three-bedroom houses to sell at $125,000, but they will be slightly bigger and fancier. "I'll gingerbread them up and add 100 square feet," he said. "People are awfully resistant to a price increase without some extra value." 
 That stiff resistance to higher prices is showing up across the country, suggesting that despite the recent burst of economic activity and sharply rising grain and oil prices, inflation is unlikely to get much of a foothold. Still, there is a visceral fear that it just might. Many people, watching gasoline prices, are starting to worry whether the relentless rise in inflation that plagued the 1970's and early 1980's can return. Two powerful oil shocks fed the spiraling inflation of those years, and now the rising gasoline prices are making nerves jangle.
But times have changed. When a hint of inflation has shown itself, the Federal Reserve has stepped in, raising interest rates to discourage the credit-based spending that might keep prices rising. Right now, such intervention does not seem necessary, the Fed suggested on Wednesday in its beige book survey of the economy. "We still don't see definitive reports of higher inflation," the report said.
Even without action from the Fed, intense competition is helping to insure abundant resistance to price increases. Grain prices are up, but the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies cut the price of Post Raisin Bran and other cereals by 20 percent this month, hoping to take sales away from competitors. American auto companies raised 1996 model prices by 2.5 percent on average, but rebates are more than offsetting the increases for many vehicles.
Coca-Cola replaced its 16-ounce coke with a 20-ounce version, in the process quietly raising the price for an ounce. But stiff competition has forced the company into discounts that have cut the price of an ounce to below what it was for the 16-ounce bottle, according to Government data. And even as rising petroleum prices make the raw material for plastic more expensive, Rubbermaid Inc., maker of numerous plastic household items, insists that the price of its basic 32 gallon garbage can will remain under $10.
"We are going to resist any price increase, for the garbage can or any other product," said William Pfund, a Rubbermaid vice president. "Consumers have developed a disinflationary mind-set, and they have come to expect more for less."
On Wall Street, a debate is under way between those who say that resistance to price increases will continue to keep inflation low and those who argue that the economy is entering a new phase in which prices will begin to climb higher.
"The basis for a long-term buildup in inflation is already present," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond trading firm. "For more than a decade we have seen commodity prices and wages moderate, and now for a decade, we will see commodity prices and wages go up, with each reinforcing the other."
Such concerns, embraced by many stock and bond traders, help explain why some interest rates have risen by as much as a percentage point this year. As the inflation hawks see it, rising grain and energy prices will force Americans to dig deeper into their wallets, prompting workers to press for higher wages. With unemployment already at relatively low levels and the economy going strong, employers will have little choice but to pay more. The spurt in labor costs in the first quarter, rather than being a temporary blip, was just the first of more to come, this argument goes.
Once wages begin to rise, Mr. Jones and others say, employers will be forced to pass along the increases in the form of higher prices, ushering in a new era in which wages and prices chase each other higher and higher.
To be sure, consumer prices -- which have been rising at an annual rate of under 3 percent for the last four years -- may well move a bit higher in the months ahead, mainly in response to the higher gasoline prices. The increases so far could add three-tenths of a percentage point to the national inflation rate, raising it to 3.1 percent, from 2.8 percent in 1995, according to Patrick Jackman, chief of the division at the Bureau of Labor Statistics that plots the monthly changes in the Consumer Price Index.
But many economists are convinced that the spurt in oil prices will not last. And even if it did, they say, such price spikes can no longer be counted on to create the price and wage pressures that in the past have been the sine qua non for spiraling inflation.
"Labor costs remain restrained, rising at the slowest rate in 40 years," said Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist. What's more, he argued, the jump in wages in the first quarter was narrowly based, focused mostly in retailing.
As for higher petroleum prices working their way into other products, Mr. Pfund of Rubbermaid insists his company will hold the line on its plastic cans and kitchenware. Plastic is made from a resin that emerges from a petrochemical product made largely from oil. The price of this raw material soared early last year, partly as a result of temporary plant closings. Rubbermaid, to offset the $200 million increase in its costs, raised the prices of its houseware products by 4 percent in April 1995, the first price increase in five years.
But ever since, Rubbermaid has achieved enough cost savings in other areas, Mr. Pfund said, to avoid further price increases, for the time being, although the price of resin, having fallen sharply late last year, has begun to rise again.
Similarly, the nation's airlines have used the expiration of the 10 percent Federal ticket tax as an opportunity to actually cut fares despite rising aviation fuel prices. Instead of cutting fares back by the full 10 percent, airlines reduced them by only 7 percent, one study showed, keeping the difference to fatten profits and pay higher fuel bills.
In other industries, most attempts to push through higher prices have met with skepticism. The International Paper Company, for example, recently put out a feeler -- an announcement that it would try in June for a $50 a ton increase in the price of linerboard, which is used to make cardboard shipping containers. That was greeted with little enthusiasm at the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, another big linerboard maker.
"Candidly," said Timothy McKenna, director of investor relations, "there are mixed views as to whether a price increase would be successful."

HEADLINE: What Do Angry Women Want?

BYLINE: By Mary Beth Cahill; Mary Beth Cahill is executive director of Emily's List, a group that supports Democratic women candidates.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of a mass desertion by female voters in the fall, some Republicans have acknowledged the gender gap and are trying to do something about it, including softening the hard-right anti-abortion language in the party platform. Not even a wholesale revision of that plank seems likely to help. According to the latest New York Times/CBS Poll, President Clinton currently leads Senator Bob Dole among women by a whopping 18 points.
Democrats may well be feeling complacent. But that would be a mistake. There is a critical bloc of women -- angry, working class and focused on economic issues -- who may aid the Republican cause, as they did in 1994, simply by deciding not to vote. 
 The gender gap will no doubt shrink in the days leading up to the election. Last month, a poll by our group of about 1,000 registered voters found a strong preference for Mr. Clinton among professional women and a similar tilt among suburban women. Even Roman Catholic women supported Mr. Clinton over Mr. Dole by double digits.
Meanwhile, an astonishing 32 percent of women who described themselves as evangelicals said they were thinking of not voting in November.
The potential bright spot for the Republicans is the volatility of voter turnout among women, particularly those who are not college graduates. Indeed, 59 percent of the people who voted in 1992 but abstained in 1994 were women, according to a Democratic Leadership Council poll. There was more than hype to the notion that "angry white men" were the deciding factor in the 1994 Republican rout.
Democrats hope that the "drop-off" voters -- mostly women who did not graduate from college -- will be a boon to them this year. But voter turnout isn't the only question mark. According to a new Emily's List survey due out next week, a third-party candidacy by Ross Perot would undercut Mr. Clinton's margin among these female voters by 14 points, while shaving only seven points from Mr. Dole. Equally important, their support for Mr. Clinton is wide but shallow: 25 percent say they would also consider voting for Mr. Dole. Their support for Congressional Democrats is even shallower, with 36 percent saying they would consider voting Republican.
The volatility of this group stems in part from anger, in part from fear. One year ago, Emily's List conducted focus groups of women who were not college graduates. For the most part, they saw nothing for them in the Republican "revolution" and little more from the Democrats.
The willingness of these voters to turn out for President Clinton depends largely on the Democrats' ability to remind them of the unpopular Republican positions on the environment, education and Medicare. The drop-off voters were repelled by the Republican Congress, but these disaffected voters were also skeptical of the Democrats' ability to improve their lives.
So the Republicans may yet succeed in either luring away drop-off voters or, more likely, in depressing their turnout. If a Democratic message fails to mobilize these easily disappointed voters, it won't be hard to convince them that politics is a dead end and voting is pointless. As a Chicago woman said in one of our focus groups: "Sometimes you feel it just doesn't matter."
If that sentiment prevails, then once again we'll be hearing lots of post-election talk about the "angry white man" -- and little mention of his angry wife and sister, daughter and mother.

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Korea Agree On Joint Search for Missing

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The United States and North Korea announced today that later this year they expect to begin their first joint effort to search for the remains of thousands of Americans soldiers missing from the Korean War.
The announcement, which could signal a broad improvement in ties between the two countries, means that Pentagon investigators could soon be wandering the North Korean countryside, searching for evidence of the burial sites of Americans missing since the war ended in 1953. 
 Under the agreement, reached after six days of negotiations in New York City, the United States will pay $2 million to North Korea for its earlier efforts to locate the remains of the more than 8,100 Americans and United Nations personnel, most of them Americans, reported missing in the Korea War.
In a joint statement, the United States commended North Korea for "its past sincere efforts in recovering and returning U.S. servicemen's remains," and both countries expressed "their belief that this agreement will contribute to the improvement of relations."
The United States and North Korea first discussed the search for the remains of lost American soldiers in 1987, and the dialogue is scheduled to resume next month when the two countries will discuss details of the joint search. "Both sides expect this meeting will result in joint recovery operations this year," the statement said.
Defense Department officials said today it was unclear how much freedom of movement American investigators would have in the search for burial sites. But any degree of freedom would provide the United States with a remarkable opportunity to gauge economic and political conditions in one of the world's most closed societies.
A similar agreement with the Vietnamese Government several years ago produced a significant diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Hanoi, with Defense Department investigators allowed to roam the Vietnamese countryside in the search for burial sites. Since 1992, the remains of 110 Americans previously listed as unaccounted for in the Vietnam War have been identified and returned home.
The North Koreans have so far delivered more than 200 sets of American remains across the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. Of those, 46 were returned between 1990 and 1992, with the United States paying $897,000 to reimburse the North Koreans for the cost of search and recovery. Another 162 were returned in 1993 and 1994. Only five of those sets of remains have been positively identified.
The North Koreans asked for $4 million for the remains returned in 1993 and 1994, but the United State balked at the figure. The North Koreans are known to be desperate for hard currency, with foreign diplomats posted in North Korea reporting a wealth of anecdotal evidence, including food shortages, that suggests that the country is in an economic crisis.
North Korea has long sought direct talks with the United States on a formal peace treaty between the two countries, but Washington has maintained that such talks must be held first between the two Koreas. The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and technically, North Korea is still at war with the United States and South Korea.
Alan Liotta, a Defense Department official who was a member of the American negotiating team in New York, said that today's agreement on a $2 million payment removed what "had long been a stumbling block" in negotiations with North Korea.
"With this agreement, we are now prepared to move into detailed discussions to begin joint recovery operations," he said.
Robert Gallucci, a former State Department official who helped negotiate an agreement two years ago to halt North Korea's nuclear program, said that any agreement that allowed American investigators access to North Korea would be "significant, although I'm very cautious not to overstate it."
"This is a step in the right direction toward having the North Koreans begin to re-engage with us and therefore with the rest of the international community," he said.
In January, Pentagon officials revealed that at least two American soldiers reported missing in Korea were apparently alive and living in North Korea. The two men, members of the Second Infantry Divison, had defected in the 1960's, after the Korean War. Defense Department officials said they were revealing the information to quash false reports in the South Korean press suggesting that American war prisoners were alive in North Korea.

HEADLINE: Bankers Trust Settles Suit With P.& G.

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Paying a steep price to end a bitter battle, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation agreed yesterday to forgive most of the nearly $200 million the bank contended it was owed by Procter & Gamble over two complex transactions in 1993.
Bankers Trust said the agreement, which settles a lawsuit brought by Procter & Gamble, resolved the last major dispute over losses incurred by its clients in 1994 from derivatives, which are based on various financial markets, like stocks, bonds or currencies. When interest rates rose sharply in 1994, all sorts of investors -- not just Bankers Trust clients -- ranging from some of Piper Jaffray's mutual funds to Orange County, Calif., racked up huge losses on derivatives that were sensitive to interest rates. 
 Procter & Gamble was perhaps the most prominent corporation to contend that it did not understand the risk of derivatives after its two deals with Bankers Trust lost value very rapidly in 1994.
Yesterday's agreement calls for Procter & Gamble to pay Bankers Trust $35 million in cash and to void a separate contract in which Procter & Gamble was owed money by Bankers Trust.
Bankers Trust said the value of the voided contract was $14 million, while Procter & Gamble said it was only $5 million.
The ambiguity of the actual value of the settlement allowed both sides to claim some manner of victory. Procter & Gamble said that the bank forgave 83 percent of the debt. People close to Bankers Trust say the bank calculates the settlement at 74 percent.
In other similar disputes, Bankers Trust has forgiven between 40 and 70 percent of the amount owed, people familiar with the bank said. Over all, Bankers Trust has charged off about $300 million for losses related to disputes with clients over derivatives.
In either case, analysts and lawyers said the settlement appeared to be more favorable to Procter & Gamble than had been expected. But they presumed that Bankers Trust was willing to settle in order to avoid a potentially embarrassing trial, which was scheduled to begin in Federal District Court in Cincinnati on May 20.
"The settlement seems high," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "But it eliminates the risk to their reputation from a trial and the prospect of damages had things not gone their way."
While preparing for the trial, Procter & Gamble discovered a number of taped conversations between traders boasting of how much money they were making from these deals and how little Procter & Gamble understood they were at risk. In an unusual case of press restraint by a court, Business Week magazine was prevented for several weeks last fall from printing excerpts from those tapes it had obtained from sealed court documents.
The tapes recorded Kevin Hudson, the trader who sold Procter & Gamble the two contracts, saying, "It's like Russian roulette, and I keep putting another bullet in the revolver every time I do one of these."
Other than for these tapes, many legal experts argued that Bankers Trust had a strong case that Procter & Gamble was a sophisticated company and fully able to evaluate the risks of its dealings.
Nonetheless, Bankers Trust has been trying to settle the case for months, people familiar with the bank said. Until the last week or so, Procter & Gamble had insisted that Bankers Trust forgive 100 percent of its losses. Negotiations began recently culminating with a meeting Wednesday night between Bankers Trust's new chairman, Frank N. Newman, and his counterpart at Procter & Gamble, John E. Pepper, at a New York law firm.
People familiar with Bankers Trust's legal case said they believed that Procter & Gamble might have considered settling after the judge, John Feikens, ruled against the company on several key points over the last month.
Indeed, after the settlement was reached, Judge Feikens yesterday dismissed the company's allegations that Bankers Trust engaged in deceptive trade practices, that it breached fiduciary duty and that it engaged in misrepresentation and negligence. That ruling pleased the banks and brokerage firms that sell derivatives because the judge asserted that the derivatives were not securities and thus not subject to more stringent securities laws. And he ruled that Bankers Trust did not have a fiduciary obligation to look after Procter & Gamble's interests in the transaction.
Bankers Trust said the settlement would have no financial effect on its earnings as it had already charged off a large portion of the Procter & Gamble transactions. Procter & Gamble said that as a result of the settlement, it would take money out of a reserve, increasing its pretax earnings by $120 million.
Bankers Trust still awaits a Government-mandated report from an independent counsel that will evaluate whether it has instituted the proper procedures to prevent future problems. The report, due in June, will also look at whether charges should be brought against some of the Bankers Trust employees involved in the disputed transactions.
Even with the Procter & Gamble suit behind it, analysts say that Bankers Trust faces a long, hard road to restore its profitability and credibility with customers. In the first quarter, the bank earned $138 million. While that's better than the $157 million loss it faced a year earlier, it represents half the profit level of the heady days of 1993. And the bank's derivative business, once its flagship, barely broke even in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S BUDGET PLAN: A NEW COURSE;
An Apocalyptic Deficit Doomed the Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Ever since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, New York City mayors have been required to employ a warning system for budget gaps, predicting deficits four years ahead. Those numbers had never been large enough to cause much concern until Jan. 31, the day Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani put out his financial plan for the years leading into the next century.
In that plan, the Mayor predicted that the budget deficit in the year 2000 would exceed $5.2 billion, by far the largest gap forecast in city history. That number set off alarms in the office of every fiscal monitor and bond rater in the city. The ringing grew so loud that, finally, Mr. Giuliani issued a 1997 budget yesterday strikingly different from any other in his term. 
 The looming deficit left the Mayor with no choice but to reverse course, his aides said yesterday, producing a retreat both from his proposals for new taxes and from a series of financial maneuvers roundly criticized by the monitors. His 1997 budget is a recognition that the deficit posed a much bigger problem for the city, and potentially for him, than high property and income taxes.
"The deficit issue had been raised to the point where we had to come up with a plan to bring it down dramatically," said Peter J. Powers, the First Deputy Mayor. "A lot of people had raised questions about it, so we needed to show the world that we could get there and shrink that deficit."
For the first two years of his term, Mr. Giuliani derided the warnings of the city's budget watchdogs that New York City's fiscal health was teetering dangerously out of balance. He was cutting both spending and taxes, he argued, and should be given more credit for reversing decades of municipal wastefulness.
But for all his cuts, the long range deficit only grew larger because of tax cuts and expensive agreements with labor unions, among other things. So the warnings grew louder with each budget. This year they became too disturbing to ignore. By dropping the new tax cuts and gimmicks and slashing the budgets of many agencies, the Mayor's new budget reduces the long-term deficit by nearly 50 percent, according to his estimates. By doing so, Mr. Giuliani finally won grudging praise from the bond raters and budget monitors.
"All in all, we'd have to say that we were pleased he recognized some of the big problems that we've all been making a fuss about," said Rosemary Scanlon, the deputy state comptroller for New York City. "He has started to pay attention to the issue of long-term balance with a more realistic plan."
The Mayor was able to cut the annual growth of city spending, largely by reducing the city's work force by 22,000 over the last two years. His methods for balancing each year's budget, however, had the effect of pushing the larger fiscal problems into the future. The municipal unions, for example, have been granted long-term contracts that increased wages beginning in 1998 while imposing no cuts in benefits. The administration also used several techniques to borrow against future revenues in exchange for short-term infusions of cash.
These and other tactics bought labor peace and got the Mayor through each year's budget. But they also inflated the long-term deficit beyond any in the past. The labor contracts alone were 44 percent of the $5 billion deficit for the year 2000, according to an analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission. The tax cuts, many of which have now been dropped, were another 32 percent.
Because the contracts couldn't be changed, the Mayor chose instead to drop proposed tax cuts that were close to his heart, and to make further deep reductions in spending. He even agreed to keep a surcharge on personal income, due to expire in December, that his own administration said was the equivalent of a tax increase. Many budget watchers said the Mayor had no choice.
"It was pure necessity, the force of simple arithmetic," said Eugene Keilin, the former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. "Looking out to the years ahead, he could see that he had to really cut it now or he'd wind up with a problem he couldn't deal with."
Mr. Keilin argues that this year's budget is a vindication of the forecasting mandated by the fiscal crisis in 1975, forcing mayors to see the results of their actions down the road. The fiscal monitors, had seized on the $5.2 billion deficit.
"When you saw the $5 billion in absolute terms, it really blew a lot of people's minds," said Raymond B. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-financed group that has been monitoring budgets since 1932.
The new budget hardly eliminates the year 2000 deficit. It is simply reduced to $2.9 billion, larger than the projected deficits during the Dinkins administration. The Mayor and his aides say they can reduce that figure by further budget cutting, especially if the economy improves.
But by most reckonings, $600 million to $1 billion in one-shot financial maneuvers remain in the new budget, techniques that provide only a year's worth of cash without helping the long-term problem. That is less than the average $1.9 billion of one-shots in each of the Mayor's first two budgets, but enough that bond raters remain wary.
"The Mayor appears to have removed from his budget some of the one-shots, although I wouldn't want to suggest that they're not still an issue," said Robert Kurtter, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, which has considered downgrading city bonds. "The new positions of the city on the tax cuts provides a firmer foundation for the city's revenue base, and gives the city more time to close the structural gap."
Some advocates for city programs, angry at the $450 million in new cuts the Mayor announced yesterday, accused him of giving in to the demands of the bond raters. But in the complex political calculus of city budgets, Mr. Giuliani undoubtedly knew he would encounter such criticism no matter what he did. What he didn't need, heading into an election year, was a group of conservative financial monitors howling about a massive deficit. With one stroke yesterday, he did much to mute those voices.

HEADLINE: Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Moody's Service

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service, the bond-rating agency, received some good news yesterday when a Federal judge threw out a lawsuit over its unsolicited rating of bonds that a Colorado school district sold in 1993.
But the decision in the Federal District Court in Denver did not address the school district's recent contention that Moody's violated Federal antitrust laws. The Justice Department's antitrust division is investigating whether Moody's, in effect, threatened bond issuers with unwanted ratings to insure the issuers hired the agency. 
 Judge William Downes dismissed the three claims brought last year by the Jefferson County, Colo., school district, which said that Moody's interfered with and damaged its bond sale.
Moody's argued that its ratings were opinions, protected by the First Amendment. "We are pleased with the court's ruling, as our livelihood depends on such protection," William O. Dwyer, president of Moody's, said in a statement.
The firm, which is a division of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, said it rates the creditworthiness of bonds -- without being asked -- to protect investors. The bond issuers generally pay for the ratings and investors rely on them to judge the riskiness of securities they plan to buy. Some big investors limit their purchases to the top-rated issues.
The ruling "is really good news for Moody's," Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer and an expert on the municipal bond, or muni, market, said. But because the Justice Department investigation is continuing, and includes other bond issues as well as the school district's, he added, "Moody's is still in the soup, so to speak."
In 1993, the Colorado district hired two other bond-rating firms, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, a unit of the McGraw-Hill Companies, and Fitch Investors Service but did not engage Moody's, the biggest and most expensive service. On the day of the sale, Moody's announced that it planned to rate the bond issue and "made statements that reflected badly on the school district's creditworthiness," W. Stuart Stuller, a lawyer representing the school district, which covers a large area west of Denver, said.
The school district contended that Moody's was retaliating because other firms were hired, and was trying to insure that the district used Moody's in the future.
Moody's subsequently rated the bonds Baa1; both Fitch and S.& P. had given them higher ratings of double A, Mr. Stuller said. The district asserted that because of Moody's action, it paid a higher interest rate, which cost it $769,000.
The school district plans to appeal Judge Downes's ruling after the court takes some action on the antitrust claims that the district filed on April 30, Mr. Stuller said. Moody's said its lawyers believe the court's dismissal of the original lawsuit effectively bars the antitrust claims.

DATELINE: BELLEVILLE, N.J., May 8

 BODY:
Marie Capparelli, 75 years old, joined her four 18-year-old classmates in Pamela Hagerty's word-processing class at the high school today for a lesson in pulling images from the WordPerfect program's memory. A retired secretary, Mrs. Capparelli sits in twice a week to freshen her keyboard skills and update her grasp of technology.
On Friday night, Mrs. Capparelli and about 350 friends her own age -- give or take 10 years -- have reservations at the high school for the second annual "senior" prom, courtesy of the Belleville school board. A 17-piece swing band will play wartime melodies in the gymnasium, which will be decorated in pinwheels of blue and gold, the school colors. A caterer will serve finger sandwiches, sodas, pastries, tea and coffee. And teen-age students will be on hand to chat and dance with the strangers of their grandparents' or, maybe, great-grandparents' era. 
 With this prom and an open invitation to the elderly to attend high school classes at no cost, Belleville, a tidy middle-class community of 34,000 just north of Newark, joins a growing list of New Jersey school districts that are reaching out to the elderly and trying to draw them closer to schools and students.
Superintendents talk about the value of opening communication lines and building bridges to the elderly, particularly in these straitened economic times. For years, the fact of fixed incomes and childless homes have made the older citizens wary of ever-increasing school spending and taxes, and they have been a potent voting bloc against education budgets.
In Belleville, taxpayer anger has hobbled the school budget for years. Over the last 30 years, only three annual budgets have won voter approval. Property taxes here seem relatively high: $4,548 on a house with the average assessment of $40,000. Of that sum, $2,108 goes to the schools and $2,440 to local and county governments.
But last month, the 1996-97 budget of about $32 million -- up only 2.45 percent -- passed by 52 votes from about 2,000 cast. To school officials here, that was a landslide.
Michael Lally, Belleville's School Superintendent, said he believes last spring's first annual prom for the elderly helped win some crucial "yes" votes, although some of the promgoers grumble at the notion of trading votes for a dance. Nonetheless, as Mr. Lally and his staff reviewed final details for Friday night's event, he said: "The 'senior' prom last year went a long way in causing this budget to pass. It didn't hurt this community, and it sure didn't hurt this education system. It produced more good will in three hours than all our budget-instruction meetings."
This year, Mr. Lally told his aides, he wanted 15 to 20 students from each class at the prom. And he wanted them to mingle and dance with the elders. In his youth, he said, he could talk more easily with his grandparents than with his parents, and he wants more generational interaction at Belleville High.
"Each generation can learn from the other," Mr. Lally said. "Children benefit from the wisdom of grandparents, and grandparents benefit from the vitality of a child."
This theme has taken root in other school districts.
In Hamilton Township, outside Trenton, retired people have served as volunteer aides for teachers for 16 years, handling all sorts of chores. School officials call the helpers "robins." About 80, ranging in age from 40 to 86, turn out most days. Earl Mason helped in a first-grade section five days a week. But he cut that to three days after his wife complained that he was no longer mowing the lawn. In one kindergarten, the children call their volunteer "Grandma Cook." She is really Mary Cook, age 82 and the retired tax assessor in Hamilton.
"They're all just wonderful people," Elaine Szul, the program director, said of the robins. "Often they say, 'I get more out of this than the kids do.' "
Livingston High School began holding annual "senior" proms in the mid-1980's. Merchants donate everything for the hot buffet; some students serve the "seniors" and dance with them, while others offer dramatic skits and musical presentations during breaks in the dancing. Livingston's board also sponsors four luncheons a year for the elderly, and the high school drama club gives one performance of its annual musical exclusively for them, after serving them a spaghetti dinner.
In Totowa, in Passaic County, the School Superintendent, Viktor Joganow, created the Education Foundation, a fund for good-will programs, when he took office in 1990. Golf outings, auctions of donated merchandise and other activities raise about $50,000 for the fund each year. The money is spent on educational programs, medical clinics, seasonal theme dances and craft workshops.
"It's great for our kids without grandparents, and for our seniors without grandchildren," Dr. Joganow said. Since creation of the Education Foundation, all six annual school budgets have passed, and Dr. Joganow said he believes the programs the fund finances have swayed some voters.
Belleville's school board will spend about $3,000 on Friday's prom, Mr. Lally said. Some of the elderly complain about tax money paying for their dance, but more say that last spring's was a delight and that they will go to this one.
"Seniors built this town, this state and this country," said Joe Fornarotto, a member of the Tuesday club, an elders' group. "We deserve something."
Dorothy Barbig, 82, said she hoped this prom would be as nice as last year's.
"It was amazing; it was beautiful," she said. "They treated us like royalty. We danced all night long."
As Ms. Hagerty's word-processing class ended today, her four teen-age students wished Mrs. Capparelli a good time at the prom.
Beaming, she replied, "Come and see us."
She has a new black chiffon gown with red and yellow roses for the dance, she said. "But I don't have a date," she added, with a little frown.
It was mock dismay. Mrs. Capparelli, whose husband died in 1972, has reserved a table with nine other widows. They will not be the only ones. Many of the women in Belleville's three senior citizen clubs have outlived their husbands, and they outnumber the men in the clubs by about 15 to 1. Line dancing is popular, especially to tunes like "Winchester Cathedral," "New York, New York" and the occasional polka.
Many of the elderly belong to all three clubs. They spend most mornings and early afternoons at the clubhouse on Franklin Avenue, playing cards or bingo, planning trips and raising money for charity.
They seem a spunky bunch. They frown on talk about pills, sickness, raising children and baby-sitting their grandchildren, said Betty Barr, 72, the president of the Friday club. "And you rarely hear anybody talk about what they did before," she said. "We lean to the future. It's important who you are, not what you were. There is a life after 60. We've had a few marriages. We've got a lot of boyfriend-girlfriend stuff."
The clubs hold dances on Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day, and seem eager for any excuse to hold a party.
This year's prom theme is "Remember When: In the Make-Believe Ballroom." But few seem nostalgic for a long-gone era or ready to plunge into reminiscence. Most club members were teen-agers in the Depression in the 1930's and during World War II and never got to their own high school prom, including Mrs. Capparelli, who was in Belleville High's Class of '38.
"Whoever went to proms then?" she said. "Only the rich kids."

HEADLINE: Race, Mortgages and Statistics;
The Unending Debate Over a Study of Lending Bias

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
These statistics don't lie: Black and Hispanic home buyers have a harder time getting mortgages.
But why? If lenders discriminate by race, it is up to bank regulators and the Justice Department to enforce anti-bias laws. If, however, minorities are less likely to obtain mortgages mostly because they are more likely to suffer from poverty, the cure -- allocating credit by skin color -- is arguably worse than the disease. So thoughtful policy makers were delighted when the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston set out in 1990 to answer the question using sophisticated statistical methods. 
 But four years after the 1992 release of the Boston Fed's findings -- which concluded that racial discrimination was still widespread in the banking industry -- otherwise mild-mannered academic experts have gotten into mudslinging matches over the research's implications. Detractors attack the study as defective in its methodology and tainted by ideological preconceptions. Supporters dismiss their concerns as overblown and wrongheaded.
The publication of the full study in March in the American Economic Review, the flagship journal of the American Economic Association, seems only to have escalated the rhetoric. "I am extremely worried that economics is becoming like other social sciences -- not very scientific," said Anthony Yezer, an economist at George Washington University and a Boston Fed critic.
The study has had an enormous impact on the banking industry. Both the Justice Department and the Massachusetts Attorney General began investigations of lending discrimination in the Boston area shortly after its dissemination. In December 1993, for example, the Justice Department settled a lending-discrimination case against the Shawmut National Corporation, then New England's third-largest banking institution, after it agreed to take steps to prevent discrimination and pay at least $960,000 to black and Hispanic applicants who were denied loans.
And the Clinton Administration intensified not-so-friendly efforts to persuade lenders to serve minorities. In one celebrated case, the Justice Department forced a suburban Washington bank that had few black mortgage applicants to open an office in a black neighborhood.
The biggest loser in this no-win battle was Alicia Munnell, whose name appeared first among the study's authors because she was the Boston Fed's head of research in 1992.
Last year, Ms. Munnell, then a senior Treasury official, was widely expected to be nominated to the Federal Reserve Board by President Clinton. But bankers, angered at the housing-discrimination study, lobbied heavily against her, and Mr. Clinton, his popularity then at a low ebb, last summer decided to duck the fight. Ms. Munnell was named instead to the White House's Council of Economic Advisers.
Flawed or not, the Boston Fed's investigation had a noble purpose: leveling the mortgage playing field for minorities. Racial discrimination has been a fixture of the American housing market since Colonial times, and continues in the 1990's despite state and Federal fair-lending laws. It takes many forms, from "redlining" -- the refusal of lending institutions to make loans to residents of deteriorating neighborhoods -- to charging minorities higher interest rates and fees.
Newsday recently reported that its examination of almost 100,000 mortgage-loan applications on Long Island showed blacks had been rejected almost three times as often as whites, even when they had the same income. And this week, the Fleet Financial Group of Boston agreed to pay about $4 million to black and Hispanic customers to settle allegations of overcharging them for mortgage loans.
Unequal treatment of minorities isn't necessarily motived by racism; it can also reflect lesser creditworthiness or other economic disparities. Indeed, while the Boston Fed's finding that racial discrimination is a significant problem has stiffened regulators' resolve to police lending practices, skeptics see little in it to justify new efforts to bully banks into lending more to minorities.
The Fed study's authors would like to declare victory and vacate the battlefield. "I really believe the debate has to move on," said Geoffrey Tootell, now an assistant vice president of the Boston Fed.
That is wishful thinking. But the debate is worth a closer look, both because it revolves around the burning issue of racial discrimination -- and what government should do about it -- and because it offers an unusual window into the cloistered world of econometrics, a field of research that uses mathematical principles to test economic theories.
This story really begins in 1989 with amendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act that required banks to keep records of rejected mortgage applications, along with details about the applicants' race, sex and income. The early data suggested that black applicants were twice as likely as whites to be rejected, a fact that made headlines.
Minority groups interpreted the numbers as proof of discrimination in lending. Bankers argued that the results showed only that minority applicants generally had lower incomes, smaller savings and less-certain job prospects -- making them less qualified borrowers.
Most economists operated on the assumption that competitive pressures would induce banks to approve loans to all creditworthy customers. Even if some banks discriminated against qualified black applicants, their reasoning went, others would step into the breach to make a profit. Indeed, this thought was never far from the minds of the research team at the Boston Fed. "Our guess was there was little or no discrimination," Mr. Tootell recalled.
To settle the matter, the Boston Fed leaned on 131 mortgage lenders in the Boston area to provide detailed information about all black and Hispanic applicants, along with comparable data for a random sample of whites. From the data, they devised a "rejection equation" in which standard statistical methods were applied to isolate the impact of applicants' income, savings, credit history, employment, and collateral in the prospective home purchase.
The researchers determined that these purely economic factors partly explained the difference in the probability of an application's rejection. But they found that race mattered, too. Before adjustment for creditworthiness, minority applicants in Boston were 2.7 times as likely to be rejected as white applicants. After the adjustment, the ratio became a lower, but hardly trivial, 1.6.
The Boston Fed concluded that lenders themselves, rather than regulators, were in the best position to eliminate bias because discrimination was subtle and probably had more to do with the unconscious attitudes of loan officers than with bank policy. Richard Syron, then the president of the Boston Fed, testified before Congress that "as long as lenders sincerely believe their procedures are beyond reproach, efforts to get them to change will have limited success."
But even as liberals debated alternative approaches for eliminating the bias found by the Boston Fed, some economists were questioning the quality of the research. First at bat was David Horne of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The F.D.I.C. used its independent authority as a regulator to obtain records from 70 banks that accounted for half the loan applications reviewed in the study. Mr. Horne found what he considered serious inconsistencies. As just one example, he identified several cases in which the grounds for rejecting relatively affluent minority applicants had nothing to do with their race and everything to do with their ineligibility for the subsidized Government mortgages they were seeking.
He noted, moreover, that a minority-owned bank specializing in lending in black neighborhoods was responsible for half of all the minority rejections in the F.D.I.C. sample.
Ted Day and Stan Liebowitz, economists at the University of Texas at Dallas, also uncovered what they considered flaws in the study. They found large numbers of applications in which the interest rates apparently were either far above or below market rates. Eliminating these implausible cases from the sample, they found, sharply reduced the extent of discrimination that could be inferred with statistical methods.
Messrs. Day, Liebowitz and Horne all noted, too, that the method of judging applicants' creditworthiness could make a big difference in the determination of bias. Using the banks' own credit standards rather than those in the Boston Fed study, for example, seemed to eliminate race as a significant factor.
Not everyone who took a second look at the Boston Fed study has found it wanting. James Carr and Isaac Megbolugbe of the Federal National Mortgage Association's Office of Housing Research eliminated application records they believed were polluted with inaccurate data and still found strong statistical evidence of bias. John Yinger, an economist at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University and the author of "Closed Doors, Opportunities Lost" (Russell Sage Foundation) wrote that "despite a few extreme claims about data errors or omitted control variables, the results of the study have held up very well."
The divergence of opinion is not surprising. Most economic research based on statistical inference is vulnerable to second-guessing because the evidence it uses is less reliable than data from controlled scientific experiments -- say, the effects of new drugs on laboratory animals.
Moreover, most econometric results are open to interpretation. In this case, it is exceptionally difficult to tease out the impact of discrimination by race, which is illegal, from discrimination based on purely economic factors, which is how banks serve capital markets. "Doing the best you can with the available data sometimes isn't good enough," argues James Heckman, an econometrician at the University of Chicago.
What makes the duel between respected economists unusual in the Boston Fed case is the open belligerance of the combatants. Mr. Liebowitz of the University of Texas, for example, went so far as to question the motives of the authors. "Before any study is considered definitive," he wrote in The Wall Street Journal in 1993, "it should be checked far more carefully than this study was checked. Unless, of course, truth is not the goal."
Mr. Yinger was no less restrained in attacking the arguments of Mr. Horne of the F.D.I.C. "Horne's critique was irresponsible," he said.
The study's authors took a subtler dig at their accuser -- but, by the etiquette of their profession, an even harsher one. "Horne," they wrote in the American Economic Review, "was unable to replicate" the data underlying the errors he claimed to have found in their work -- a thinly veiled charge that he had fudged his research. They also reiterated their conclusion that "a serious problem may exist in the market for mortgage loans."
For his part, Mr. Horne says that the Boston Fed used an incomplete draft of his work provided on condition it not be cited for publication.
The moral to this tale, suggests Mr. Heckman of the University of Chicago, is the need to treat empirical research on sensitive issues of public policy with greater caution. "There is a common misunderstanding," he explained, "that there is objectivity in numbers."

HEADLINE: Chip Index Dips for 6th Month in Row

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 9

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator declined in April for the sixth consecutive month, a trade group reported today.
But the drop was moderate compared with the revised March figure, a sign that prices and demand for chips might have begun to stablize. 
 The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.78, down from a revised figure of 0.79 for March. The April figure surpassed March's as the lowest in the nine years that the association has been keeping track.
The numbers were reported after the close of the stock market. Analysts had expected April's ratio to be somewhat flat to slightly higher compared with the figure for March, which the association initially reported as 0.80.
The book-to-bill compares orders against shipments. Thus, a ratio of 0.78 indicates that for every $100 worth of products shipped, only $78 worth was ordered, an indicator of declining sales.
But because the ratio measures dollars, not units, it had been skewed in recent months by a rapid decline in the price of dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAM's, the most common chip. So, some analysts argue, the decline in the ratio may not accurately indicate a decline in demand.
The industry association, which will soon release its midyear forecast, said it still expected positive growth for 1996. April's numbers suggested that the chip market had stabilized after a sluggish first quarter, the group said. The numbers also signaled that 1996 would be a year of slower growth than was 1995, when the world chip market grew 42 percent, the association said.
Orders and shipments both declined in April. At $3.13 billion, orders declined 2.8 percent compared with March. Versus a year ago, however, the pace of new orders in April decreased 22.5 percent. At just above $4 billion, shipments declined 2.6 percent compared with March, but were up 15 percent from $3.49 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.
Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, said orders were substantially below expectations, while shipments were off slightly.
"The only saving grace in all this is that it looks like sales of finished goods remain decent," he said, referring to strong results from personal computers and networking companies.

HEADLINE: After a String of Dictators, Ugandans Get to Vote Again

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, May 9

 BODY:
For the first time in 16 years, Ugandans stood in line this morning to vote for a new president, ending a bitter race that became a referendum not only on President Yoweri Museveni's tenure, but also on his vision of a democracy without political parties.
Turnout was heavy as nearly eight million registered voters walked to crude polling stations and waited in line for hours, sometimes in the rain, just for the chance to mark a paper ballot with an indelible pen and push it into a metal lock-box. 
 "This is an historic election, if it goes well," said Hamid Galabuz, a 40-year-old vegetable vendor, as he stood in line at a Kampala school. "We don't know what will happen."
The polling was peaceful across most of the nation, officials said. The military stayed away, leaving security to local constables. Though there were reports of voters being turned away because they were not on official lists, the problems were not widespread enough to invalidate the results, election officials said.
Diplomats and opposition leaders maintain that with the short campaign season of one month and the ban on party activity, Mr. Museveni had such a heavy advantage that he cannot lose, whether the election is fair or not.
One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "This election falls short and does not meet international standards of free and fair. Still, it's a step forward."
That an election is being held at all is a watershed in Uganda, a once-prosperous land that became independent in 1962 and has suffered under a succession of murderous dictators.
Ten years ago Mr. Museveni's guerrilla army won a civil war, marched into Kampala and seized power, ending nearly 20 years of brutal oppression under Idi Amin, Milton Obote and Tito Okello.
Since then, Mr. Museveni has been widely credited with restoring stability and moving Uganda toward economic recovery, but he has repeatedly put off elections. He argues that political parties have done nothing but brew chaos here, dividing the country along racial and religious lines.
Parties are not allowed to field candidates, meet, organize or raise money. But Mr. Museveni's National Resistance Movement, the political branch that grew out of the rebel army, has essentially become the ruling party.
"Political parties are spoilers," Mr. Museveni told tens of thousands of supporters at a rally on Tuesday. "By this vote, you will be able to show the world that Africa is Africa, Europe is Europe and America is America. I do not go to Europe to lecture them on how to run their countries."
The main opposition candidate, Paul Ssemogerere, the leader of the old Democratic Party, has promised to bring back party politics, cut the military, increase social spending and negotiate peace with rebel groups in the north.
After campaigning ended on Wednesday, Mr. Ssemogerere said the election had been neither free nor fair. He complained that his supporters had had only one month to campaign in 39 districts. They had been harassed by the authorities, he said, and prevented from organizing, while Mr. Museveni had essentially been campaigning for nearly two years, relying on the power of incumbency and Government largess.
Still, the race is expected to be tight, partly because of the ethnic tensions that always lie under the surface here.
Mr. Ssemogerere is a scholarly man, a former Deputy Prime Minister who has spent his whole life in Government, either as a party leader or as a bureaucrat. In 1980, his party narrowly lost a parliamentary election to Mr. Obote's party.
Now Mr. Ssemogerere has put together an unlikely and fragile coalition. He mended fences with Mr. Obote's party, the same people who engineered his defeat in 1980. He enjoys support among his own tribe, the Baganda, as well as among northern ethnic groups like the Langi and Acholi, which lost power when Mr. Museveni's army, made up predominately of southerners, swept into Kampala.
One problem for Mr. Ssemogerere is that the only issue uniting the opposition is their belief that Mr. Museveni has been in office too long and has frozen out other parties.
For his part, Mr. Museveni has accused Mr. Ssemogerere of plotting to bring back Mr. Obote from exile in Zambia and of colluding with a Christian fundamentalist rebel group in the north.
Mr. Museveni, who still retains a military man's gruff candor on the hustings, has lost no opportunity to remind voters of Mr. Ssemogerere's alliance with Mr. Obote's party and his promise to hold peace talks with the northern rebels.
One of Mr. Museveni's newspaper advertisements shows a pile of skulls and bones from a mass grave during the Amin era. "THINK," it says. "Don't forget the past. One million Ugandans, our brothers, sisters, family and friends lost their lives. Your vote could bring it back."
The strategy has worked well. Many Museveni supporters say they would have backed Mr. Ssemogerere but for fears that Mr. Obote would return. Repeatedly, they say they will vote for Mr. Museveni because he has brought peace to a country where people had lived in fear of being killed by the Government.
But Mr. Ssemogerere has played on the resentments of the unemployed, especially demobilized soldiers and civil servants who lost jobs when Mr. Museveni pushed through an economic austerity program in the late 1980's.
In northern towns, Mr. Ssemogerere has hammered away at Mr. Museveni for allowing the north to lag behind the south in development.
Some of Mr. Ssemogerere's supporters say they see Mr. Museveni as an autocrat at heart. A few expressed fears that he would not give up power, even if defeated.
"Ten years is too long," said Sunday Mutumba, 27, a mechanic. "When African leaders stay in power too long they become dictators."

HEADLINE: Minimum Wage? As One Man Finds, It's Really a Matter of Perspective

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: The differences in a paycheck.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: NORTH CANTON, Ohio, May 9

 BODY:
Robert Bobbitt Sr. is a past president of the board of the Canton Urban League. For much of his life, civil rights have been the most important political issue for Mr. Bobbitt, who is black.
Even as he moved upward in the corporate world, becoming a vice president for Pepsi-Cola in Detroit, he continued to vote for the party he felt was best for him and for black people, the Democrats. 
 But in the mid-1980's, Mr. Bobbitt changed his life. He jumped off the corporate ladder to become his own boss, buying his first McDonald's restaurant, in a Canton suburb. He worked long hours, did well, bought a second McDonald's in 1989 and, last week, bought two more.
Being the boss changed Mr. Bobbitt's politics. Nearly a decade ago he began voting Republican. The Democrats' current push in Washington to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 illustrates why.
"Before, I would have thought of the minimum wage as a social issue," he said. "Then you start working for yourself, and all the risk and responsibilities are on you."
"Raising the minimum wage will take money out of the entrepreneur's pocket," he said. That would include Mr. Bobbitt's pocket. He says the Democrats' effort to raise the minimum wage would drive up his labor expenses, cutting his annual profit by $20,000 a restaurant, $80,000 altogether.
While the think-tank economists debate the cost versus benefits of a minimum-wage increase, on Main Street people are quite clear about where their self-interest lies.
Mr. Bobbitt did not want a reporter interviewing the workers at his McDonald's on North Main Street here, but he has no doubt as to how they feel. "We do our surveys," he said. "Most people will always tell you they're not making enough money."
Indeed, national polls indicate that nearly 80 percent of Americans favor President Clinton's plan to increase the minimum wage. Standing at the corner of another nearby Main Street, in the Canton suburb of Louisville, a dozen people who were asked all favored raising it.
"It ought to go to $10," said Wilma Brunner, a crossing guard. "No matter where I've worked, I had to start at minimum wage -- Kmart, Camelot Music. I listen to Rush Limbaugh. I know he's against it, but I don't go along with Rush on this one."
Ask people about the minimum wage, and you often hear the anger they feel for their jobs. Tammy Green, 30, who until recently worked at a nursing home earning $7.48 an hour, does not worry that businesses could be hurt.
"Business people made their million -- they have more than I do," Ms. Green said. "To fill up your tank costs $16. You're working the first four hours for gas."
Francis Lilly, 21, was mowing the lawn in front of Jim Edwards Ford, where he is a lot manager earning $5 an hour. "If I'm having a hard time at $5," he said, "I can imagine what it's like making $4.25."
Sara Frock earns $8 an hour in a sales office and gets no health benefits. Indeed, a recent study by the Job Training Partnership in Canton shows that none of the fast-food places surveyed here in Stark County -- McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Hardee's, Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen -- provide health benefits.
"It's minimum-wage people and the people like me who have to carry the people on the top," Ms. Frock said.
About 2 percent of the nation's 107 million workers earn the minimum wage, while an additional 9 percent earn between $4.25 and $5.15 and so would also be affected directly by the President's proposal. The typical worker in that pay range is a white woman over the age of 20.
But if the minimum is lifted, millions more not directly affected would most likely see their wages rise as employers adjusted pay scales upward.
Wages in Ohio are low by East Coast standards, and wages in the Canton area are low by Ohio standards, ranking near the bottom among the state's dozen largest urban centers. Yet even here, most companies must pay above $4.25 to attract workers. Unemployment is close to the national rate of 5.4 percent; everywhere there are "now hiring" signs for entry-level jobs at drugstores, nurseries, restaurants.
The Job Training survey indicates that McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's restaurants in Stark County pay up to $4.75 to start, with small non-restaurant businesses like Buckeye Paper, Chips Enterprises and Electric Melting Services paying $6 to $6.50.
Last week Mr. Bobbitt and Tom Schervish, who owns interests in seven local Burger Kings, two Fudd ruckers restaurants and two Pancho's Southwestern Grilles, met with their Congressman, Ralph Regula, a moderate Republican, seeking his support.
They explained that 60 percent to 70 percent of their employees were suburban teen-agers, many living at home and working to pay for a car and insurance. "The idea that people are living off the minimum wage is a totally false scenario, a bleeding-heart ploy," Mr. Schervish said.
They said that if the minimum rose, their menu prices would, too, hurting poorer families the most.
When they had finished talking to Mr. Regula, who has not yet taken a stand on the issue, Mr. Bobbitt felt they had a chance to defeat any increase. But Mr. Schervish, who has been battling minimum-wage bills much longer, did not. "I got the feeling from Ralph it didn't matter what the arguments are," Mr. Schervish said. "The Republicans don't want to be outmaneuvered by Clinton. It's the popular thing, it's going to happen, the Republicans will go along, and there's not a hell of a lot that can be done about it."
Mr. Bobbitt had wanted to own a business all his life. Though he rose to the level of regional vice president at Pepsi, he felt there was a ceiling on how high he could go because he is black. (Larry Jabbonsky, a Pepsi-Cola spokesman, said, "I can't speak for Mr. Bobbitt's experience, but I can assure you we are unswerving in our commitment to diversity in the workplace and there are no limits to this commitment.")
Mr. Bobbitt left Pepsi to take a management position at Coca-Cola in the early 1980's, but had something else in mind.
He started secretly training in a McDonald's ownership program in May 1984, ultimately putting in 2,000 hours at one of the restaurants. "I'd get to my job at Coke at 7 in the morning," he said. "A typical day went until 6 or 7 at night. Then I'd drive to a McDonald's an hour away -- I didn't want to run into anybody I knew -- and I'd be there until midnight making hamburgers. I'd get home at 1 and have to be up at 6."
After a year and a half, he had qualified for ownership but did not have the money to buy a franchise. A McDonald's costs $500,000 and requires a $200,000 down payment. McDonald's accepted Mr. Bobbitt in a lease program that gives qualified people three years to assume ownership. McDonald's created the lease option to diversify its ownership ranks, bringing in more members of minorities, Mr. Bobbitt said.
His first restaurant was in Jackson, a Canton suburb. By taking a salary of only $25,000 in the beginning, he said, he saved enough money to buy the restaurant in a year.
He was impressed that McDonald's did not try to steer him toward an inner-city location. Today all four of his restaurants are in the suburbs, and, like those suburbs, his 250-person work force is virtually all white.
Mr. Bobbitt says part of what made his conversion from Democrat to Republican easier was that at McDonald's he felt he was associated with a corporation that treated him without bias.
There are still times he feels pulled two ways. He belongs to a black church, United Christian Faith, and most of his friends there and at the Urban League are Democrats. Indeed, the National Urban League supports increasing the minimum wage.
Nor does he have the venom toward Mr. Clinton that fellow businessmen like Mr. Schervish feel.
"Being a a black person, from the standpoint of social policy I'd vote for Clinton," Mr. Bobbitt said. "I like the cultural diversity in his Cabinet. I see him giving more opportunities to minorities and women. But I have to turn to the Republicans because of my business interests."
He has also gone to his Republican representatives for help on issues like workers' compensation and employee health benefits. He voted for George Bush in 1988 and 1992, and he expects to vote for Bob Dole this time.
Before he could finish an interview at his restaurant here the other day, the manager on duty, Brenda Anderson, rushed over, her drive-thru headset all askew. "We're in trouble!" she said. One worker had left for home early because her son had been beaten up; another had finished at 11. The lunch rush was backing up. They were three deep and five across at the front counter. Seven cars were backed up at the drive-thru.
Mr. Bobbitt, the entrepreneur, shot out of his seat, rushing behind the counter.
"I'll take the drive-thru!" Ms. Anderson said. "You be the runner." He looked up at the computerized screen for drive-thru orders. "Two McChicken combos, two 22-ouncers, two large fries!" he said, stuffing them into a bag, then handing it off.
"A Happy Meal!" he called, picking up a little Robin Hood toy, then moving toward the fries.
 
Throughout the Presidential election year, articles in this series will examine Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County, a political bellwether for decades.

HEADLINE: Democrats Reject a Dole Plan to Cut Gas Tax

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Thwarted all week by a Democratic filibuster, Senator Bob Dole today proposed legislation that would reduce the Federal gasoline tax by 4.3 cents, without other provisions of the sort President Clinton has called "poison pills."
Mr. Dole contended that his tax reduction proposal, coupled with a plan supported by the Clinton Administration to force commercial banks to pay more of the cost of the savings and loan bailout, met Mr. Clinton's demand on Wednesday for a "clean" gas tax bill. The President said then that he would sign such a bill. 
 "It could almost have come from the White House," Mr. Dole said, "and we are pleased to accommodate the White House when we can."
But Democrats said they would not go along until Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader and presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, guaranteed them an equally uncomplicated vote on increasing the Federal minimum wage to $5.15 from $4.25 an hour.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, rejected the Dole proposal, saying, "The President offered to break the logjam, repeal the gas tax, plus increase the minimum wage. The majority leader has left off an important part of the equation. Instead of a win-win, it's still going to be a lose-lose."
Mr. Dole's continued pressure for a reduction in the gasoline tax is part of a broader strategy on taxes that the Senator is considering. Believing that Mr. Dole had picked up momentum with the issue, a senior aide to him said today that the Dole campaign was considering a much more dramatic call for an across-the-board cut in income taxes in an economic plan it is drafting.
But Mr. Dole got nowhere in the Senate today. After a four-day stalemate, the chamber adjourned for a long weekend, and no votes will be held until Tuesday.
Before he offered his new proposal, Mr. Dole failed in an effort to break the Democratic filibuster against his last package of legislation, a combination of the gasoline tax cut, the minimum wage increase and legalization of some kinds of meetings between employers and workers, which are now held illegal as violations of collective bargaining laws. Democrats contend that the last provision will weaken unions, and it is the target of their filibuster.
It takes 60 votes to end a filibuster, and Mr. Dole mustered only 52, all of them from Republicans. Forty-three Democrats and 1 Republican, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, voted against cutting off debate.
Then Mr. Dole put forward his new approach and filed a cloture motion to end debate on it. "Do you want to vote for lower gas prices?" he asked. "Then you vote for cloture on Tuesday. Want to vote for lower travel costs, lower inflation, better job protection for employees in the transportation industry? This will be an opportunity."
Mr. Dole said that "in the spirit of the President's press conference yesterday asking for cooperation, I have decided to offer the gas tax repeal, which he said he would sign, and pay for it with a measure that he wanted desperately."
Mr. McCurry agreed that the Administration wanted the measure requiring banks and savings and loans institutions to pay more of the costs of the failures of savings institutions in the 1980's, but he said it wanted it separately.
The vote on ending debate on the newest approach by Mr. Dole is scheduled for Tuesday. But Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, made it clear that he would fight that motion, as he fought today's.
Of the latest Dole plan, Mr. Daschle said: "It is more of the same. It is similar to many of the other proposals we have been presented over the last several weeks, and obviously it is unacceptable.
"We have indicated our desire to have a vote on the gas tax, and we are prepared to accept that. But we also obviously feel the need to have the same vote on the minimum wage."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the chief sponsor of the proposed increase in the minimum wage, joined in the criticism. He complained that the Senate was now in the "Doledrums," quoting a dictionary definition of the word with its usual spelling of "doldrums." He termed it "a period of inactivity, listlessness or depression."
"The American people look to the Congress for action on the minimum wage," Mr. Kennedy said "and all they see are cloture petitions, quorum calls and procedural gymnastics to avoid taking action."

HEADLINE: Dole's Views on U.S. Asian Policy: Lost Credibility and Weak Leadership

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech today by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan research organization, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency:
 
 I believe America's global future will soon be an important issue in this election. And I believe that President Clinton's foreign-policy track record of weakness and indecision, and double-talk and incoherence, has diminished American credibility and undermined American interests. 
 Failures of leadership in Asia, such as coddling North Korea, lacking a strategic policy toward China, and a conspicuous absence of the President from the debate over most-favored-nation status for China have eroded American power and purpose in the Pacific.
The bottom line is that American credibility in Asia is low and still declining, and American interests are challenged throughout the region. As a direct result of the weak leadership, vacillation and inconsistency, which are the hallmarks of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy, the world's sole super power finds itself drifting and defensive, with an uncertain course and an untrusted voice in the Pacific Basin.

Policy Changes
 Last month President Clinton announced a four-party peace initiative in North Korea involving the United States, China and the two Koreas. The initiative surprised the Chinese. No mention was made of resuming North-South talks.
North Korea has not responded.
The administration also undertook, "missile non-proliferation," talks with North Korean leaders despite the regime's blatant -- and I would repeat, blatant -- violations of existing arms control agreements.
President Clinton should cease bilateral contacts with North Korea on proliferation and on diplomatic normalization until North Korea resumes direct discussions with South Korea as it committed itself to do five years ago. . . .
It's time for the United States to work with South Korea and Japan as well as other Asian allies on the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missile defenses: a Pacific Democracy Defense Program, if you will. And our three countries have territory or military forces under direct threat of missile attack today.
Our three countries have the resources and experience to work on missile defense programs today. And with American leadership, our three countries can have the political will and technological means to defend our territory and our people tomorrow.
Japan and Korea face a clear and present danger from ballistic missiles and should be our top priority under the Pacific Democracy Defense Program. It's time to move past paper studies to the deployment decisions.
And let me move briefly to Japan because the most important security relationship America has in Asia is with Japan. With a solid security alliance between the U.S. and Japan, there can be peace and stability in Asia. Without such an alliance, there most likely will not be peace.
In 1994 the Clinton Administration provoked a trade war and lost, and then declared victory, even though President Clinton received nothing. The Clinton Administration chose uncoordinated and contradictory tactics and did not work with the forces in Japan favoring deregulation, competition and economic reform.
The result has been an increase in both the bilateral trade deficit and in Japanese trade and nationalism.
Japan must open its sanctuary market and level the playing field. We must start by resolving ongoing commercial disputes that cost U.S. companies millions and millions of dollars in lost sales. If negotiated solutions are not reached, swift action under U.S. existing trade laws will be required. If our trade disputes are not resolved, American public support for U.S.-Japan security relationship will inevitably decline, to the detriment of both countries.

 China and Trade Policy
 And let me turn now to U.S.-China relations. I don't believe there's a more complex relationship in the world than our relationship with China, and not one that will have ultimately greater historical consequences.
Our strategic goal should be clear: a China which does not threaten its neighbors and a China which plays by the rules of the international system of nonproliferation and trade, a China which is peaceful, prosperous and free.
If our goal is clear, so, too, is the path to achieve it. We should prioritize our interests, communicate our priorities to the Chinese leadership, and implement a policy, implement our policy in a confident and a consistent manner. . . .
China's leadership must be convinced that undermining the stability of regional balances of power will carry an international price. And as far as Taiwan is concerned, I think we must make our commitment for the peaceful resolution of differences between China and Taiwan clear.
The Clinton Administration's policy of ambiguity in my view sends a signal of uncertainty to Taiwan and to China and to all of our Asian allies. Our policy should be unmistakably resolute. If force is used against Taiwan, America will respond. That is the strategic bottom line in the Taiwan Relations Act, which I was proud to help shape. And during the debate on a critical section of the act concerning efforts to address the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, I argued for clarity. And on March 17, 1979, I said on the Senate floor it was vital to convey the assurance that specifically spelled out our nation's commitment to aid the Republic of China in resisting aggression. . . .
There's no more clearly defensive and clearly necessary weapon system for Taiwan than effective missile defense. The current policy of not sharing information on missile threats or missile technology with Taiwan must be changed. . . .
I think we also ought to be very forthright, right out front, right out in the open about our commercial relations with China. President Clinton was right in 1994 when he finally decided extension of most-favored-nation status was the best way to promote our long-term interests in China including greater respect for human rights and the rule of law.
We should extend M.F.N. to China not because it is in our economic interests but because it's in our national interest, and there's a big difference. . . .

China's Immense Promise
 Now, President Clinton has never clearly articulated a strategy for dealing with China or how M.F.N. extension fits into that strategy. Consequently, President Clinton faces a tough sell for M.F.N. on Capitol Hill.
And let me also add that extending M.F.N. is not in itself a China policy. It's not even a China trade policy. Over the last decade, U.S. exports to China have tripled, but Chinese exports to the U.S. have increased nearly tenfold. Our current trade deficit is $34 billion a year and climbing. And China holds immense promise as a market for U.S. goods, services and agriculture products, but China is mortgaging that promise through protectionist policies. Intellectual property rights piracy, for example, costs American companies at the cutting edge of global competitiveness about $2 billion annually -- $2 billion annually -- because of the I.P.R. problems.
And China must live up to the trade agreements it has freely entered into, whether on intellectual property or on textiles and apparel. . . . And we should move to a targeted and proportional response, including proposing an immediate list of sanctions under U.S. trade law. China enjoys liberal access to our markets, but a wide array of barriers inhibit American exporters.
And American policy should be clear about the Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization. China will enjoy the fruits of W.T.O. only after -- let me underscore "after" -- it demonstrates a willingness to play by the accepted rules of the GATT system. And I hope the Administration will work with the Congress on this issue, so it will not be necessary for the Congress to work on legislation itself.
This should not be a unilateral U.S. effort, and for an Administration which prides itself on assertive multilateralism, the Clinton team has been woefully inadequate in building coalitions on international issues. Unfair Chinese trade practices affect Japan, South Korea, the European Union, Asean, Australia, New Zealand, and each of these have parallel interests to the United States. . . .
Many argue that M.F.N. should not be extended to China because of its terrible record on human rights. China's record on human rights and tolerance of political opposition is indefensible. No doubt about it, you can't defend it.
But China is by no means alone. There will be a debate on M.F.N. for China this year, but not on M.F.N. for Russia, where 30,000 Chechens have been slaughtered; on M.F.N. for Syria, which has no political freedom, occupies Lebanon, and provides safe haven for terrorists. Trade is not a panacea, and freer trade does not always lead to democracy. . . .
But in China, continuing trade offers the prospect of continuing change. Capitalism has already corroded central government control. Some provincial governments in China control resources in excess of most Third World states. Market forces will predominate as China needs to import food and energy and capital and technology. . . .
Economic liberalization has bloomed while the seeds of political liberalization have only begun to be planted.
But as a rule of law emerges for commercial transactions, demands for individual rights will increase. Democracy breeds calls for more democracy. And U.S. policy should encourage the fragile opening in China through continued exchange programs, the National Endowment for Democracy, through Radio Free Asia, and through continued trade support for freedom and democracy with all the tools in our arsenal.

HEADLINE: Oil Company Profiteering Fuels Price Increase

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your May 6 editorial on whether the Clinton Administration should impose oil sanctions over human rights abuses in Nigeria: The White House is unlikely to do anything to risk a further fuel price increase. When Nigerian oil workers went on strike two years ago to protest military rule, world oil prices went up. Until Americans are in the streets protesting the situation in Nigeria, why would any politician risk a measure that, while proper, could fuel more bad election-year news?

HEADLINE: Dole Attacks Clinton Asia Policy Although He Supports Part of It

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
In a blistering election-year attack on President Clinton's policy in Asia, Senator Bob Dole lacerated the Administration today as incoherent and naive and said the President's "double talk" had undercut American authority abroad.
"As a direct result of the weak leadership, vacillation and inconsistency, which are the hallmarks of Clinton Administration foreign policy, the world's sole superpower finds itself drifting and defensive, with an uncertain course and an untrusted voice in the Pacific Basin," Mr. Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, said in a speech today. 
 Nonetheless, while Mr. Dole asserted that his would be a different kind of Presidency, he appeared to back many Administration positions.
Most prominently, Mr. Dole reaffirmed his support for renewing preferential trade privileges for China, lining up solidly behind the Administration and spurning the conservative wing of his own party. Still, he said, Mr. Clinton's weak leadership on the matter threatened its prospects on Capitol Hill.
"As we have seen in Bosnia, Iran, Cuba and elsewhere, when President Clinton is faced with a fork in the foreign policy road, he takes it," Mr. Dole said. [Excerpts, page A8.]
As Mr. Dole continues to sink in the public opinion polls, the five-term Senator from Kansas drew today on one of his perceived strengths -- his toughness on foreign policy -- to counter the President on one of his perceived weaknesses: his lack of firm footing on the world stage and his reputation for changeability.
Mr. Clinton has "squandered the rich foreign policy legacy he inherited by making inconsistency, confusion and incoherence the common features of American diplomacy," Mr. Dole said. He said the President's track record "of weakness, indecision, doubletalk" had undermined American interests.
The speech, delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan research organization, took months to draft and nearly an hour for Mr. Dole to read.
"There's a lot more than simply 'Dole announces support for extending M.F.N.'," a Dole aide said, a reference to continuing the so-called most-favored-nation trade status for China. But his position on this issue has been a central question since Mr. Dole -- under pressure from conservatives who want a tougher stand toward China and eager to distinguish himself from Mr. Clinton -- appeared last month to waver in his long-held support for special trade status for China.
The Dole team provided a background briefing for reporters and offered advance texts of the speech; the Clinton team responded by making top officials available for interviews and using no less than Vice President Al Gore to answer Mr. Dole.
Mr. Gore praised Mr. Dole for "courage" in supporting the President's policy on trade with China and for backing President Clinton's announcement this week that he would impose significant sanctions on some of China's exports -- while continuing the preferential trade status -- if China continued to pirate American software, music and videos.
"I think he showed courage in rejecting the growing forces of isolationism and know-nothingism in the Republican Party" in the middle of a campaign, Mr. Gore said.
As for the rest of Mr. Dole's criticism of Mr. Clinton's Asia policy -- the Senator accused the President of "coddling" North Korea, slighting South Korea and "amateurish posturing" in trade disputes with Japan -- Mr. Gore was dismissive, calling it "fluff and dust" required by partisan politics to disguise the fact that he generally agreed with Administration policy.
A White House official said Mr. Dole appeared desperate in employing a strategy of "slandering" the President. "Their strategy is to use foreign policy as a character issue because they can't fight us any other way," the official said. "They are grasping at straws to find something to criticize us about, when it's basically an endorsement of our policy."
Conservatives, led by Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Dole's erstwhile rival for the Republican nomination, have been railing against renewal of trade privileges for China, citing Beijing's human rights abuses, forced abortions, and selling of nuclear technology to rogue nations. Mr. Buchanan could not be reached today after Mr. Dole's speech.
But American businesses with a stake in China have favored a deepening of economic ties.
Defending his long-held support for renewing most-favored-nation trading status with China, Mr. Dole said: "We should extend M.F.N. to China, not because it is in our economic interest, but because it is in our national interest. To deny M.F.N. for China would set back our relations more than two decades and send a disastrous signal of American withdrawal to our strategic allies."
He quoted Mr. Clinton as saying in 1992, when he was a candidate for President, that he would "link China's trading privileges to its human rights record and its conduct of weapon sales." Mr. Dole noted this promise had "an unusually short shelf-life" once Mr. Clinton was elected, "collapsing in about six months under the weight of its own naive and contradictory purposes."
In response to conservatives, Mr. Dole said: "Denying M.F.N. would not free a single dissident, halt a single missile sale, prevent a single threat to Taiwan or save a single innocent Chinese life."
Although China's record on human rights was indefensible, he said, it is not the only country committing abuses while enjoying most-favored-nation status, citing Russia and Syria. "In China," he said, "continued trade offers the prospect of continued change."
Administration officials said they expected that Mr. Dole's backing would help ensure the measure's success on Capitol Hill.
Still, many expect a fierce struggle when the Administration formally notifies Congress of its intentions to renew the trading privileges, which it must do before June 3. Unless both houses vote to cancel it, it is automatically renewed. The House is expected to cancel it or at least attach conditions the Administration would find unacceptable. But the Senate, especially now with Mr. Dole's support, appears likely to favor renewal.
As for other matters that Mr. Dole discussed today, Mr. Gore refused to respond in any detail to many of them. To Mr. Dole's demand for the deployment of missile defenses for Taiwan, Mr. Gore said the Administration had already deployed some missile defenses to the Asian region and would provide more, including "a recent agreement with Taiwan" to give it a Patriot antimissile system of medium technology by 1998.
"I'm not sure Mr. Dole's aware of what's going on," Mr. Gore said. "He talks about 'paper studies.' We've gone a long way past that."

The Sound of Money

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In today's exploding Times Square -- where mobs jam the new Virgin Megastore and Conde Nast just joined Disney and Madame Tussaud's on the bandwagon of new tenants -- Julie Andrews's loverly display of primadonnaism this week seemed a quaint relic of the past.
It was 40 years ago that this star triumphed on Broadway in "My Fair Lady" -- and most of the Wednesday matinee audience who witnessed her curtain speech at "Victor/Victoria" knew her from way back then. The speech itself -- in which Ms. Andrews declined the dubious distinction of a Tony Award nomination -- was a rare throwback to the time when Americans cared so much about the Broadway theater that a well-executed publicity stunt could become a national event. 
 For Ms. Andrews, her Tony fit was certainly her shrewdest career move since she bared her breasts in the movie "S.O.B." in 1981. Her pique landed her on the front page of The New York Post for days, with such priceless headlines as "Tony Baloney" and "Mary Poppins Hoppin' Mad," and soon the international press chimed in. Tony Adams, a "Victor/Victoria" producer, reports that the show's box-office receipts have jumped 50 percent. So sweet was the "controversy" that some Broadway hands dreamt aloud that this June a TV audience might actually tune in the Tony telecast, whose Nielsens have hit rock-bottom.
Yet it's hard to imagine that one show's P.R. bonanza will lift the rest of the theater. Even as Ms. Andrews made news by lamenting how her musical had been shut out of every Tony category but her own, the half-price ticket booth told another story of Broadway in 1996. The highly acclaimed shows that received all the Tony accolades that "Victor/Victoria" did not -- "Bring In Da Noise," "Master Class," "Seven Guitars," "A Delicate Balance," among many others -- were all dumping seats for that night at steep discounts.
What's the problem in what is widely regarded as Broadway's best season in years? It's surely not that "Victor/Victoria," a lackluster star vehicle at best, was a victim of rank injustice -- especially given the real Tony competition this year. Even so, the awards have long been a joke. Only last season Broadway's most acclaimed performance, Nathan Lane's in "Love! Valour! Compassion!" failed to be nominated; three years earlier a Tony nominating committee was purged (as this year's no doubt soon will be) after it ignored plays that were running to nominate those that had closed. Variety long ago exposed still-rampant fraud in the voting process, and the hapless Tony show itself, network TV's sole celebration of live theater, will this year have more pre-recorded segments than ever before.
But the mere fact that such unprofessional nonsense has gone on so long without reform -- devaluing the Tonys to the point where even a big winner like 1994's "Passion" still flops -- is, as the prominent theatrical lawyer John Breglio puts it, "symptomatic of the underlying chaos in this business." The Tonys are the least of the crises in a leaderless industry that can't slow the rising production costs and ticket prices that, "Rent" notwithstanding, deter audiences younger than Ms. Andrews's and are likely to leave most of this season's "hits" drowned in red ink.
Earlier this week the legendary producer David Merrick, untamed by a stroke, got so angry he wheeled without warning into the theater's trade association, the increasingly fratricidal League of American Theaters and Producers, less to plead for his own "State Fair" than to berate the "imbeciles" he feels are destroying Broadway. Like Ms. Andrews, he is a survivor of Broadway's golden age -- and wrote the book on turning a mediocre musical into front-page news when he announced the director Gower Champion's death at the opening-night curtain call for "42nd Street" in 1980.
But such stunts by veterans of another Broadway, fun as they may be, cannot repair an industry so fractious that its management can't even muster a united bargaining front for this year's crucial union negotiations. If the Broadway theater is to be the jewel, not the perennial economic invalid, of the new Times Square rising all around it, it had better worry less about whether a venerable star will turn up for the Tonys than about whether it can attract a new generation of customers to turn up for its shows.

Middle-Aged Vigilantes: The Gang Has Grown Up

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
From the macroeconomic and sociological perspective visible through its litter of corpses, the muddled Middle Western "Original Gangstas," which opened yesterday, has a lot to say about what is wrong with America. And when it comes to what's wrong with movies, this tale of generational vengeance also speaks eloquently.
Filmed in Rust Belt towns like Gary and East Chicago, Ind., "Original Gangstas" resurrects many of the stars of the so-called black exploitation movies of the 1970's -- among them Fred Williamson, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, and Richard Roundtree -- to tell the story of a depressed community that rises from the oppression of youth gangs to take back its streets. 
 Before "Original Gangstas" descends into the sort of ill-conceived bloodbaths and settling of accounts that owe more to the conventions of movies than the demands of logic, this film, directed by Larry Cohen and written by Aubrey Rattan, builds on the vast technological and economic tides that have swept away Gary's steel industry, devastated black blue-collar workers and reduced many of their children to angry, disaffected dropouts.
Against this backdrop, the film tells its story of a promising young basketball player slain for hustling a gang, of a decent grocer beaten and shot for trying to help the police, and of the middle-aged heroes who band together, as they did in their youth, to try to set things right when the white authorities, including the mayor and the police, prove inept and impotent. The subtext that glorifies middle-aged vigilantes reflects a climate that has nourished private militias that regard government with a disillusioned, hostile eye.
Along with its murders, drive-by shootings, loathsome villains, keen sense of gang fashion and plentiful trash talk, "Original Gangstas" deals knowingly, if glancingly, with out-of-wedlock pregnancy, children growing up without fathers, fathers who never know their children and the generation gap that separates the putative good old days of rock- and bottle-throwing gangs from those of gangs armed with knives, pistols, Molotov cocktails, dynamite and the latest in automatic weapons.
Mr. Williamson, who produced the film, plays a former professional football star who returns to Gary from his comfortable life in Los Angeles after his father, the grocer, is shot and decides to take on the gangs. Mr. Brown, as a former boxer who is the father of the young basketball player, is, like Mr. Williamson, a founder of the Rebels, the gang now preying on their neighborhood. Ms. Grier portrays the mother of the slain young man who brought up her son alone.
Thicker of waist and longer of tooth these days, Mr. Williamson, 58, and Mr. Brown, 61, still pack plenty of panache and handle the action with authority and dispatch. The rekindled romance between Mr. Brown and Ms. Grier receives perfunctory handling, and a rock, rap, gospel score accompanies the violence.
Plenty of sense underlies "Original Gangstas," but this film takes the easy route when it trains its guns on the box office and turns its back on originality.

After Much Ado, Japan Passes '96 Budget

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 10

 BODY:
After months of bitter wrangling, the Japanese Parliament today approved a $715 billion budget for this fiscal year, which began on April 1.
The budget, which reflects an increase of 5.8 percent over the previous year's figure, widens the Government's financial deficit. In an illustration of its recent economic woes, Japan has now moved from a country that had a financial surplus four years ago to a country with one of the biggest deficits in the world. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that the financial deficit of the Government represents 3.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1995, compared with 1.6 percent in the United States.
In a magazine article published today, Masayoshi Takemura, the former Finance Minister, calls the budget issue one of the biggest crises facing the Japanese Government, referring to it as a "budgetary breakdown."
"Frankly, I had thought the budget deficit was a problem faced by the U.S. and European nations," Mr. Takemura said in his article, published in a magazine called Chuo Koron. "But by fall last year, I came to seriously realize that it was Japan that has slipped into the worst state."
"Japan's budget deficit is a domestic issue, but it will receive attention as a serious issue affecting the world economy," he added.
Some analysts, however, discounted the seriousness of the budgetary problems, and a Ministry of Finance official, Kazumi Akiyama, dismissed the criticisms.
"I don't think Japan will collapse because of the budget deficit," Mr. Akiyama said.
With today's passage, debate will now turn to the real source of the delay, a controversial plan to use about $6.5 billion initially in taxpayers' funds to pay for the liquidation of ailing mortgage companies, called jusen. In a compromise struck between the ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party, and the New Frontier opposition party, taxpayers' funds will only be used once a detailed framework has been worked out.
But the plan, which had originally seemed assured of passage when it was first proposed by the Ministry of Finance late last year, faces such strong public opposition that it is still uncertain whether outright use of taxpayers' funds will take place.
The New Frontier Party, which had staged a sit-in protest in Parliament, opposed the use of taxpayers' funds. And recently Government officials, including Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, have called for certain banks to take some of the financial burden off taxpayers.
A number of Japan's large commercial banks helped found the jusen, lending money to them and playing a role in management. The banks have agreed to write off those loans, but they have refused to contribute more money to pay for the liquidation of the jusen.
"What the banks are fearing is taking on the role of savior of the financial system," said James Fiorello, a banking analyst at ING Barings Securities (Japan) Ltd. "In that role, their liabilities could be limitless."
The ailing jusen represent only a small portion of the overall bad debt debacle. Financial institutions are expected to have written off about $145 billion in bad debt in the year ending March 31, but according to some estimates, there still remains about $500 billion more in bad debt.
Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service issued a pessimistic assessment of Japan's financial system. Under its financial strength ratings for banks around the world, Japan has the largest number of banks with weak ratings, and in its report, Moody's said there continued to be "growing uncertainty regarding the Japanese authorities' ability to provide safeguards for overall stability in the banking system."
Moody's said that certain big banks were well positioned to weather financial difficulties, including the effect of land prices, which continue to slip. But it had doubts about certain smaller institutions, and forecast that with capital adequacy slipping below international standards, some institutions would be forced to increase capital or reduce loan assets.
