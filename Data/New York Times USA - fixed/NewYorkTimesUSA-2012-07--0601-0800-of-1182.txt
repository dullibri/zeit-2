HEADLINE: Shares Slip On Decline In Retail Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell modestly on Monday after a surprising decline in June retail sales provided the latest worrying sign about the economy.
Increasing nervousness about the economy, and continuing concerns about Europe's fortunes, pushed up bond prices and the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note touched its record low at one point Monday. 
The 0.5 percent decline in retail sales in June, the third consecutive monthly decline, contrasted with economists' expectations for a small increase.
''Three months in a row of lower retail sales is pretty concerning,'' said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management. ''People are going to have to lower their G.D.P. estimates. Given that, I'm surprised the market is holding so well.''
Although the stock market has fallen for six out of the last seven trading sessions, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up about 7 percent from a low reached in early June despite the worsening economic data.
On Monday, the S.& P. 500 fell 3.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,353.64. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 49.88 points, or 0.39 percent, to 12,727.21. The Nasdaq composite index lost 11.53 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,896.94.
One bright spot on Wall Street was Citigroup's earnings, which exceeded estimates. Shares of Citigroup gained around 0.6 percent to $26.81. Although the company, the third-largest American bank by assets, reported stronger-than-expected earnings, its profit fell 12 percent.
Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments, said a tug of war was going on between better-than-expected earnings in the financial sector and worries about the economy.
''The next week or so, the market will be driven more by earnings than economic numbers,'' Mr. Cherukuri said, noting that recent cautious outlooks from corporations could translate into disappointing earnings. Many companies have issued warnings on profits recently. The ratio of negative earnings guidance to positive for the second quarter is 3.3 to 1, the worst since 2008, Thomson Reuters data showed.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, 102 18/32, while its yield fell to 1.47 percent, from 1.49 percent late Friday. During the trading session, the 10-year yield touched 1.442 percent, matching the record low set on June 1.
While the low yields are not enticing, most investors remain too nervous about the global economy and the debt crisis in Europe to take much risk, analysts and traders said.
''Treasuries at these low yields are not great trades,'' said Brian Edmonds, head of interest rates at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''People are just being forced into them.''

HEADLINE: Two Arrests In China Unnerve Art World

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and CLARE PENNINGTON

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The frothy contemporary-art scene here has lost some of its ebullience in the three and a half months since a German art handler and a Chinese associate were detained on charges that they undervalued imported art to avoid customs duties.
Gallery openings are a bit more subdued, anxious art dealers have been keeping a low profile, and several wealthy collectors have been barred from leaving China while the investigation continues. Auction house giants like Sotheby's and Christie's have been asked to cooperate with the authorities in what has become a wide-ranging investigation.
''Lots of people here are not going into work, or they are only using junior staff at their offices and galleries,'' said a Beijing gallery director who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the tension surrounding the issue. ''They can't arrest everybody, but everyone is still nervous.''
In the meantime Nils Jennrich and Lydia Chu, employees of the art-handling company Integrated Fine Art Solutions, languish in a Beijing jail on suspicion of smuggling, a crime normally associated with the illegal importation of drugs or arms. The charges carry a maximum of a life sentence. 
Mr. Jennrich, 31, the company's general manager and a German citizen, was taken away on the evening of March 30 during a raid of the business's Beijing offices; hours later Ms. Chu, 29, its operations manager, was summoned for questioning. Mr. Jennrich's family and colleagues have expressed concern for his health, saying he has been forced to share a cell with 11 others. During the first days of his detention, they added, he was interrogated for 36 hours straight, a violation of Chinese law.
''It's a living nightmare,'' said Mr. Jennrich's fiancee, Jenny Dam, who said the couple had planned to marry in May.
No trial date has been set.
The detentions have put a spotlight on the mercurial Chinese legal system and raised questions among collectors and industry executives about the potential pitfalls of China's fast-growing art and antiques market, which last year surpassed the United States to become the world's largest, according to the European Fine Art Foundation. The crackdown, industry professionals have warned, could dissuade Chinese collectors from bringing home art purchased abroad.
Some have privately questioned the government's motivation, noting that Integrated Fine Art Solutions has handled the work of Ai Weiwei, the maverick artist who has earned the government's wrath for his criticism of the ruling Communist Party. Others have suggested that the case is aimed at taking down a foreign-owned company to clear the way for a well-connected domestic player that recently began lavishly investing in the art-handling business.
''China is supposed to be a lot more integrated with the world economy,'' said Jonathan Schwartz, chief executive of Atelier 4, an art logistics company based in New York. ''The decision to throw someone in jail tells you that China is not really playing by similar rules as the other large nations that are dealing with culture and transit.''
The Foreign Ministry has declined to comment on the case.
Speaking from Hong Kong, the chief executive of Integrated Fine Art Solutions, Torsten Hendricks, dismissed the allegations -- that the accused tried to help buyers avoid $1.6 million in import duties -- saying his company does not get involved in art valuation.
''We forward, store and install artwork, that is all,'' said Mr. Hendricks, who was also questioned in Beijing by the authorities but was later allowed to leave the mainland. ''Determination of value, the statement of this value, is not our responsibility.''
Legal experts said that art handling firms simply work with the values provided by their clients, but that Chinese law is murky on whether individuals employed by shipping companies can be held liable for undervaluing a work.
Nancy M. Murphy, a lawyer at the Beijing firm Jincheng, Tongda & Neal, who is advising Mr. Jennrich's family, said she hoped that the authorities would take into consideration whether the accused personally profited from undervaluing the work in question.
Ms. Chu's fiance, Benoit Granier, said he found the accusations hard to fathom, given Ms. Chu's modest life, including sharing an apartment with five others. ''She's just trying to find a way in her life,'' he said.
Setting aside questions of Mr. Jennrich's and Ms. Chu's culpability, several industry experts say the practice of undervaluing art and antiques on Chinese customs forms is widespread. The International Convention of Exhibition and Fine Art Transporters, a trade organization, noted the problem last year in a newsletter and suggested that the practice was harmful to all involved. ''There is no way around these regulations without breaking the law,'' it wrote.
In China imported art is often levied with duties that can reach 35 percent of an object's value. Many industry veterans complain of a customs process that is notoriously onerous.
International art experts acknowledge the difficulty of valuing contemporary art, noting that a wild jump in price at auction after a piece passes through customs does not necessarily suggest undervaluing at the border.
Ms. Murphy, the lawyer, said it took an experienced appraiser to know the difference between fraud and the vagaries of a white-hot art market.
She suggested that the arrests were aimed at sending a message to bigger players in the international art scene. ''Kill the chicken to scare the monkey,'' as she put it.
The crackdown has touched other companies and individuals. Officials have detained three Chinese citizens, including the editor of an art magazine and the chairman of an art investment company. A Chinese transport company, Noah Fine Art Shipping Agency, was forced to turn over a list of its clients, according to The Oriental Morning Post.
Given how lucrative the art market has become, Chinese authorities have a keen interest in reducing tax dodging. Last year China accounted for 41 percent of worldwide auction revenues and about 30 percent of the overall art and antiques market, according to artprice.com and the European Fine Art Foundation.
Karen Sanig, the head of art law at Mishcon de Reya, a firm based in London, said that customs authorities around the world often impose fines after accusations of undervaluing art but that they rarely use their full powers to detain suspects. ''It is unusual for two agents from a shipping firm to be arrested,'' she said.
Integrated Fine Art Solutions is a relatively small player in art shipping but it has high-profile clients, including the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art -- one of China's best-known museums -- and it handles major international art fairs in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
A number of art professionals, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of drawing unwanted attention from the authorities, have suggested that the government may simply be trying to remove the competition as it prepares to enter the lucrative art-handling business.
Two weeks before the detentions, the state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group presided over the groundbreaking for a free-trade zone in the capital that will include an advanced art-handling warehouse. According to the state news media, Gehua is investing $785 million in the venture.
There is little precedent for the case against Ms. Chu and Mr. Jennrich, although if the recent prosecution of a Belgian Sinologist accused of smuggling an ancient sarcophagus out of China is any indication, the punishment may be stiff. In 2008 the Belgian, Kurt de Raedemaeker, was convicted of illegally exporting the relic, despite his insistence that he had obtained the necessary government permits.
He received a life sentence, but after spending some time in prison he was allowed to serve his sentence in a Beijing hotel. The former Belgian ambassador, citing Mr. de Raedemaeker's heart problems, called the punishment a ''slow death sentence.'' Mr. Raedemaeker, who was 48, died in March in his hotel room.

HEADLINE: R/GA Plans to Create a New Agency Model

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
It did not take long for a leading digital agency to decide to expand again.
In May 2011, R/GA, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, announced it would add two offerings for clients, in the areas of event marketing and data visualization. Now, R/GA is adding two more offerings, with a third most likely on the way.
Also, the agency is further expanding its number of offices around the world by opening outposts in Austin, Tex.; Bucharest, Romania; Los Angeles; and Sydney, Australia. Those offices join seven existing offices -- in Buenos Aires, Chicago, London, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm and Sao Paulo, Brazil -- along with the agency's New York headquarters. 
Executives are being hired by R/GA to lead the two new offerings. One is in the realm of consulting, intended to compete with consultancies like Accenture and McKinsey & Company.
The other will be centered on product innovation, which is helping conceive, create and bring out new products and services. That one, meant to compete against firms like Ideo and Frog Design, is being established after R/GA worked on new-product assignments for marketers like Barnes & Noble, with Nook; Google, with Google Wallet; and Nike, with the Nike+ FuelBand.
The offering that will probably be added, in a new Los Angeles office, is in the area of branded entertainment -- that is, assisting marketers to develop content like television shows, music and Web series in which brands and products are integrated.
The additional offerings at R/GA join around 15 services already available to clients that include social media, mobile advertising, relationship marketing, analytics, commercial production and, of course, digital advertising.
The growth of the agency's portfolio of services comes after its growth in revenue and employees. Worldwide revenue last year totaled $242 million, according to the trade publication Advertising Age, compared with $190 million in 2010. The total employee head count exceeds 1,100, the agency says, compared with 1,072 in May 2011.
For some time, the senior managers of R/GA have urged Madison Avenue to reconsider labeling agencies ''digital'' and ''traditional,'' or describing marketing services as ''above the line'' and ''below the line.''
''Everything is digital,'' is what Bob Greenberg, chairman, chief executive and global chief creative officer at R/GA, likes to say.
''I really wanted to create a new agency model,'' he said in an interview. Just as the rise of television advertising led American agencies like Leo Burnett, DDB and Ogilvy & Mather to become worldwide agency networks, he added, the rise of ''Internet, mobile and social'' advertising is leading R/GA to increase its presence.
For example, ''everybody in L.A. has an app now instead of a script,'' Mr. Greenberg said.
''I do think we're going to need about 20 more'' offices, he added, because Interpublic ''has asked us to become global, as opposed to being 'international.' ''
''We have locations we know we want to be in,'' he added. ''We have one client who'd like us to be in Tokyo, Korea, Mumbai and Shanghai as soon as possible.''
The consulting practice, which R/GA is calling business transformation, will be headed by Chris Stutzman, who is joining the agency as managing director, reporting to Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Stutzman, 39, had been vice president and principal analyst at the division at Forrester Research devoted to chief marketing officers.
''My ears were trained to tune in on what the problems were for C.M.O.'s'' who wonder ''where is their business going to be in five or 10 years,'' Mr. Stutzman said, ''and how they can help move their businesses forward.''
One question they ask frequently, he added, is ''How do you leverage digital technology to create true competitive advantage and make us more relevant in the market?''
To lead the product innovation offering, R/GA is hiring Jeff Mancini, as vice president, also reporting to Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Mancini, 41, had been senior director for digital strategy at Interbrand, part of the Diversified Agency Services division of the Omnicom Group.
''Almost any agency you speak to says it has the capability to create innovative ideas for clients,'' Mr. Mancini said. ''Here, we're trying to look at a more integrated model for how new products and services can work more closely together through technology.''
''I can't think of a business that does not need to think of itself as selling digital brands,'' he added.
Product innovation is particularly valuable now for marketers, Mr. Mancini said, because it ''helps to meet consumer demands quicker'' -- important when consumer demand is being inhibited by the uncertain economy.
A goal of the new offering is to expand product innovation beyond the realm of new products to include ''helping improve on a product that may have launched to average success,'' he added, ''and make it stellar.''

PERSON: Stephen R. Covey 

HEADLINE: Stephen R. Covey, Herald Of Good Habits, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Stephen R. Covey, who won a global following and a five-year run on best-seller lists by fusing the genres of self-help and business literature in his 1989 book ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People: Restoring the Character Ethic,'' died on Monday at a hospital in Idaho Falls, Idaho. He was 79.
The cause was complications of a bicycle accident three months ago, his family said in a statement. 
Mr. Covey's book sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, and also became the first audiobook to sell more than a million copies. After conferring with Mr. Covey over Thanksgiving in 1994, President Bill Clinton said American productivity would greatly increase if people followed Mr. Covey's advice. More than two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies flocked to use a consulting company he had founded.
Mr. Covey was a bit baffled by his success. He said he was simply telling people what he thought they already knew: the efficacy of good behavior. All that people had to do was form habits out of their best instincts, he said, calling his seven nuggets of knowledge natural laws, like gravity. They are:
1. Be proactive
2. Begin with the end in mind
3. Put first things first
4. Think ''win-win.''
5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood
6. Synergize
7. Sharpen the saw; that is, undergo frequent self-renewal.
''We believe that organizational behavior is individual behavior collectivized,'' Mr. Covey said. He expanded the lesson in 2004 in ''The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness,'' in which he urges people to find their own distinctive voices and to encourage others to find theirs.
Among his other books, ''Seven Habits for Highly Effective Families,'' published in 1997, advocates that families come up with mission statements. ''The Leader in Me,'' published in 2008, embodies his ideas for educational reform. His goal was to change society, he said, calling his catechism first and foremost an action plan. ''What is common sense isn't common practice,'' he declared.
Mr. Covey was a Mormon, and some saw large elements of Mormon theology in his work, though his language was ecumenical. He denied any Mormon bias in his books, saying he drew inspiration from the Scriptures and from history's great thinkers.
In 1996, Time magazine named Mr. Covey one of the 25 most influential Americans, and Forbes called ''Seven Habits'' one of the top 10 business management books ever. As speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich drew on Mr. Covey's advice and asked him to help write a chapter on personal strength in American culture for a student reading in a college course Mr. Gingrich taught.
''Seven Habits'' became part of the vernacular. Campaigning in the Iowa Republican primary last year, Mitt Romney referred to the book in offering his ''seven habits for highly successful economies.'' Parodies have cropped up. One, published in 1996, was titled ''The 7 Habits of Highly Defective People: And Other Bestsellers That Won't Go Away.''
Stephen Richards Covey was born on Oct. 24, 1932, in Salt Lake City, and grew up on an egg farm outside the city. A promising athletic career was cut short by degeneration in his legs, causing him to use crutches for three years as a teenager.
In an interview with Fortune magazine in 1994, he told of his parents' constant encouragement. ''You're going to do great on this test,'' he remembered his mother saying as he went to sleep the night before a school exam. ''You can do anything you want.''
He entered the University of Utah at 16 and earned a degree in business administration. He spent two years in Britain as a Mormon missionary before returning to the United States to earn an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. He sometimes preached the Mormon doctrine on Boston Common.
After another missionary stint, in Ireland, he earned a doctorate in religious education from Brigham Young University. His thesis was on ''success literature'' in American history.
At Brigham Young, he became an assistant to the university's president and began teaching his self-help ideas on campus, drawing as many as 1,000 students in a single class. In 1983 he gambled everything he owned on starting the Covey Leadership Center, a training and consulting concern in Provo, Utah.
In 1997 it merged with Franklin Quest, founded by Hyrum Smith, a time-management expert, to become the Franklin Covey Company. It now operates in more than 50 countries and had $160.8 million in sales last year.
Mr. Covey is survived by his wife, the former Sandra Merrill; nine children; and more than 50 grandchildren.
Mr. Covey hated to waste time. He made copies of documents and kept them in briefcases under his desk in case he lost an original. And he liked to do more than one thing at a time. Fortune reported that he was once seen at a gym lying on the floor of the shower room being sprayed by three shower heads while he brushed his teeth and shaved.
In explaining his second recommended habit -- Begin with the end in mind -- Mr. Covey urged people to consider how they would like to be remembered. ''If you carefully consider what you want to be said of you in the funeral experience,'' he said, ''you will find your definition of success.''

HEADLINE: Ivory Poachers and Their Enablers

 BODY:
Two events in the past month illuminate the scope of the market in illegal ivory. On June 27, more than 1,200 elephant tusks were incinerated in Gabon, in a fire lit by the Gabonese president, Ali Bongo, as evidence of his country's crackdown on poaching. And last Thursday in New York City, two merchants, operating out of shops on West 45th and West 46th Streets, pleaded guilty to possessing illegal ivory artifacts worth more than $2 million. 
These events demonstrate two necessary components of any successful effort to control the killing of elephants for their tusks -- vigilance at the source and vigilance at the end-market. Yet the Gabonese bonfire and the arrests and guilty pleas in Manhattan raise a depressing question: Can any animal prized by humans and living in the wild be protected from the economic suction of the human appetite? The answer, when it comes to elephants (and many other species), appears to be no -- at least not without vigilance on a scale we've barely begun to imagine.
Last year was the worst year for elephant poaching since the sale of ivory was banned internationally in 1989. Twenty-four tons of ivory were seized, most of it passing out of Africa via Kenya and Tanzania and destined for China and Thailand. This is to say nothing about the amount of illegal ivory that made its way around the globe without being seized. But whether you count captured tusks or elephant carcasses, one thing is clear: poaching pressure has been growing steadily more intense.
According to Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants, an international antipoaching program run by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, poaching is driven by poverty and weak law enforcement where elephants live -- in Africa and Asia -- and by market demand.
That, in turn, is a reminder of a basic fact in conservation. Cracking down hard on the source of supply and the illegal market is the right thing to do. But the long-term solution lies in improving the economic lives of the humans who live among elephants.

HEADLINE: Court Allows Occupy Hong Kong To Continue Its Protest, for Now

BYLINE: By NEIL GOUGH

 BODY:
HONG KONG - As global movements against capitalism go, the members of Occupy Hong Kong have demonstrated surprising staying power.
If ever there was a city where pure or considerably unfettered capitalism has approached its logical end, surely Hong Kong is it. The city is home to more billionaires than popularly elected legislators. It has more Cartier, Gucci, Hermes and Louis Vuitton boutiques than Hong Kong Island has hospitals or post offices. Buddhism and Taoism are the main religions here, but bank branches outnumber temples by more than two to one.
''In Hong Kong, if you don't follow the rules set by big corporations and big capitalism, you just cannot survive,'' said Tiv Wong, a young publishing industry freelancer who has been active in the Occupy movement.
Even against this backdrop, Occupy Hong Kong has stayed on for nine months. But the protest in Hong Kong - where demonstrators have staked their claims to an open-air plaza beneath the Asian headquarters of HSBC in Central, Hong Kong's financial district - may be in its last days. 
On Monday, a legal bid by HSBC to obtain a court order to evict the protesters came before a judge for the first time.
Many in the city are surprised that the bank waited so long to take action. But the first hearing ended in a draw, as the court allowed time for the three named defendants, who have no lawyers and are representing themselves, to submit reasons that they should be allowed to stay.
Two defendants, Ho Yiu-shing and Wong Chung-hang, are promoting the Occupy movement's goals. The third, Mui Kai-ming, is protesting against HSBC over the execution of his sister's will.
A follow-up hearing was scheduled for Aug. 13, effectively giving the occupiers an extra month at their camp. Still, the case could result in a clash that might become ugly.
''If there's an order for us to move out at last, we will try our best to stay,'' Mr. Wong said. ''Of course, some of us don't believe in law and may not follow the court order.''
It may seem surprising that the protesters in Hong Kong have managed to lay their claim to their site even as their counterparts at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan and at St. Paul's Cathedral and Finsbury Park in London have long since been evicted by the authorities or decamped of their own accord.
But a look at the wealth gap in Hong Kong indicates how the idea of the Occupy movement has captured a degree of support.
Hong Kong's boom throughout much of the previous century was driven by waves of immigration from mainland China. Behind nearly every tycoon's fortune in the former British colony is a version of a rags-to-riches tale that had woven itself into the city's ethos by the time it was handed back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
But disenchantment with this dream has grown in recent years as the wealth gap has widened, property prices have soared and average citizens have become increasingly priced out, in many cases by well-heeled investors and visitors from the Chinese mainland. The average home price is around 13 times the median annual household income.
Hong Kong's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality in which zero represents perfect equality and 1 means one person holds all the income, rose to 0.537 last year, according to government figures released last month. That is the highest reading for any developed economy in Asia.
At the same time, a growing reaction against perceived collusion between big business and an undemocratically elected government has sent demonstrators into the streets. Hundreds of thousands marched in an annual pro-democracy rally on July 1 and, in smaller numbers, the Occupy protesters have gathered supporters.
''It was once thought that people like Li Ka-shing were cultural heroes and everybody could become rich if you worked hard enough and a few breaks came your way,'' said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, referring to the Hong Kong tycoon who is considered the wealthiest man in Asia.
''Today, increasingly, people don't think that, and they have become much more cynical about the gap between rich and poor,'' Professor Mathews said. ''This is having a fairly remarkable effect on Hong Kong.''
The Occupy encampment is a case in point. Though it has dwindled from a peak of 100 to 200 protesters last autumn, 10 to 20 people still gather at the site for twice-a-week meetings, and a handful of stalwarts remain in residence around the clock.
On Saturday afternoon at the plaza beneath the HSBC building, only three middle-age occupiers were visible. One was napping on a sofa. A dozen or so tents were mostly empty except for simple bedding, household items and protest signs.
Alan Chiu, 48, a technology specialist who is unemployed, has been living at the camp full time for the last two months. He says things have gone smoothly, except when one member of the proudly leaderless group tried to proclaim himself the one in charge. That member has since moved nearby, where he camps alone in front of a row of automated teller machines.
HSBC's patience with the occupiers, however, has run its course. The bank's Hong Kong unit filed deeds and leases dating to 1857 as part of its lawsuit, which names three individual protesters and ''defendants whose names are not known,'' who are identified as ''the occupiers.''
According to the filings, the plaza beneath the skyscraper was deeded during construction in 1983 as a ''dedicated area for the purposes of public pedestrian passage.'' But the title documents also require the bank to keep the property ''in a clean and tidy construction and free from any obstruction,'' according to an affidavit from HSBC's chief operating officer in Hong Kong, Mark Ivan Boyne.
Mr. Boyne says the camp has resulted in stained granite tiles, required the bank to cancel activities and charity events planned for the space and created safety concerns over debris and cooking over open and gas fires.
''As the occupation continues, the hygiene situation is deteriorating and will likely continue to deteriorate,'' his affidavit said.
Camp or no camp, some see the movement as indicative of problems in contemporary Hong Kong, as younger protesters become increasingly vocal in their complaints against a deeply unpopular government.
First- and second-generation immigrants from the communist mainland may be wary because many of them ''did have a better life during the heyday of capitalism under British rule,'' said Chris Chan King-chi, an assistant professor in the department of applied social sciences at the City University of Hong Kong, who supports the Occupy movement.
''Especially because full democracy has not been achieved in Hong Kong,'' he continued, ''the general public will be of the view that the origin of our current problems is the government, rather than capitalism.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tax-Exempt Group's Election Activity Highlights Limits of Campaign Finance Rules

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In early 2010, a new organization called the Commission on Hope, Growth and Opportunity filed for nonprofit, tax-exempt status, telling the Internal Revenue Service it was not going to spend any money on campaigns.
Weeks later, tax-exempt status in hand as well as a single $4 million donation from an anonymous benefactor, the group kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign against 11 Democratic candidates, declining to report any of its political spending to the Federal Election Commission, maintaining to the I.R.S. that it did not do any political spending at all, and failing to register as a political committee required to disclose the names of its donors. Then, faced with multiple election commission and I.R.S. complaints, the group went out of business.
To Democrats and some campaign finance watchdogs eager to force more transparency in spending by independent groups, Hope, Growth and Opportunity stands out as the kind of ''pop-up'' organization that operates in virtual secrecy, with legal impunity. 
''I still don't know who they are,'' said John Spratt, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, who lost his 2010 re-election bid after facing a deluge from the group. ''It's a classic case.''
Efforts to require more public accounting of campaign money hit a new roadblock Monday evening in the form of a Republican filibuster that stopped the Senate from formally debating it. The measure fell 9 votes short of the 60 required to clear the procedural hurdle, with no Republicans voting in favor. But Democratic senators planned to keep discussing the bill -- the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act -- into the night, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, voted no so that under Senate rules, he could bring it up for a second vote on Tuesday to highlight Republican opposition.
Republicans blasted the effort as grandstanding at a time when the nation faces far more pressing challenges.
''This amounts to nothing more than member and donor harassment and intimidation, and it's all part of a broader government-led intimidation effort by this administration,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who once advocated broader disclosure but has become the legislation's fiercest critic.
Advocacy groups say the lesson of the Commission on Hope, Growth and Opportunity is that the nation's campaign finance laws are in tatters, and without changes, such organizations will proliferate.
''C.H.G.O.'s story is a tutorial on how to break campaign finance law, impact elections, and disappear -- the political equivalent of a hit and run,'' Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, wrote in a new report.
Since the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, prominent nonprofit organizations like Priorities USA, which supports Democrats, and Crossroads GPS, which backs Republicans, have pulled in tens of millions of dollars from anonymous donors to focus on high-profile contests, like the presidential race. But groups like Hope, Growth and Opportunity can serve as a conduit for large donors focused on races beneath the radar.
The main donor behind Hope, Growth and Opportunity appeared intent on knocking off Mr. Spratt, a House veteran from South Carolina and one of only three committee chairmen who lost in the 2010 Republican tsunami. The group's initial spokesman was Scott Reed, a prominent Republican strategist who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. Its officers included Steven Powell, a Republican media consultant; James Warring, a Maryland certified public accountant; and William B. Canfield, a longtime Republican lawyer.
Its application to the I.R.S. said it did not plan to spend any money trying to influence the selection, nomination, election or appointment of any person to federal, state or local public office. Instead, it would exist to advance ''the principle that sustained and expanding economic growth is central to America's future.''
The group raised $4.8 million, $4 million from one contributor.
Mr. Reed, now a senior strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's political efforts, declined to discuss Hope, Growth and Opportunity. Mr. Canfield called the group a client, not an employer, and said he had not had contact with it since signing its 2010 tax return early last year. The group's other officers did not respond to phone calls.
But the promotion of economic growth was at best indirect. Within weeks of winning the I.R.S.'s designation as a ''social welfare organization,'' the group began running the first of nearly a half-million dollars in ads in South Carolina depicting Mr. Spratt as a profligate spender. It encouraged voters to join his Republican opponent, Mick Mulvaney, in his ''fight against the big spenders in Washington.''

HEADLINE: British Bank Fighting Bid For Data In Rate Case

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS, AZAM AHMED and IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Even as lawmakers in London hammered a top Barclays executive over the bank's role in a rate-rigging scandal, another financial firm that is largely owned by the British government is fighting an investigation into the vast scheme.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, one of more than 10 banks under scrutiny from authorities around the globe, is refusing to turn over crucial information to Canadian regulators, court documents from Ottawa show. 
The bank, which is 82 percent owned by the British government, is an unlikely foe.
British lawmakers have taken the lead in publicly shaming executives and regulators who failed to curb interest rate manipulation before and after the 2008 financial crisis. And the pushback comes in contrast to the more conciliatory approach of several institutions ensnared by the global investigation.
Barclays, which last month agreed to pay $450 million to British and American authorities for improperly influencing interest rates, cooperated with the multiyear case, although it too dragged its heels on producing documents at first. Some European banks are now scrambling to strike deals with authorities, according to lawyers close to the case.
The Canadian court documents, collected over the last year, hinted that two other big banks were aiding authorities. Those banks are UBS and Citigroup, according to people close to the matter.
Many banks are trying to avoid the fallout that has hit Barclays, which has prompted the resignation of two top executives. On Monday, British politicians took aim at one of the Barclays executives, Jerry del Missier, the bank's former chief operating officer. Barclays was ''up to its armpits in dishonest activity,'' said Pat McFadden, a British politician who sits on the committee overseeing the testimony.
The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Monday that it was ''cooperating with regulators in their investigations.'' But in the court documents, the bank said it was unable to share certain information with Canada's Competition Bureau because of British law. Further, the bank said that sharing the documents would amount to an ''unreasonable search and seizure'' and violate its ''privilege against self-incrimination.''
''We want to cooperate with the C.C.B. and have proposed ways to do that which allow us to comply with our English legal obligations,'' the bank said in the statement.
The Canadian investigation spans from 2007 to mid-2010, and encompasses traders at JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Citibank, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. UBS, the big Swiss bank, is a central target in the broader investigation.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the American regulator that started the interest rate investigation in 2008, is pursuing a potential civil case against the bank, according to people briefed on the matter. UBS has also already reached an immunity deal with an arm of the Justice Department, which could protect the bank from criminal prosecution under certain conditions.
While whispers of the wide-ranging investigation emerged in the early days of the 2008 financial crisis, the scandal came into focus last month when Barclays settled with the trading commission and the Justice Department and the British Financial Services Authority. Authorities had accused the bank of trying to manipulate an interest rate to protect profits and to project a stronger image of its health to skittish markets.
The inquiry centers on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The benchmark underpins the pricing on trillions of dollars in financial products, including mortgages and credit cards.
At least nine government agencies - including authorities in the United States, Canada, Britain, Switzerland and Japan - are examining wrongdoing. The Justice Department is also building potential criminal cases against big banks and their employees, including traders at Barclays, according to government officials close to the case.
The Canadian Competition Bureau, like other regulators, is investigating whether several banks colluded to manipulate interest rates. The Canadian regulator is focused on the Libor rates in Japan's currency, the yen.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has been pushing back against the Canadian regulator.
The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ottawa has ordered the bank to turn over a variety of documents and records to the government. But the British institution is trying to quash the effort.
In that proceeding, lawyers for the bank argue that their unit in Canada does not have access to the material in question. Transferring it from the parent company to the Canadian unit, the bank argues, would violate British banking and data privacy laws.
But the argument is at odds with the aggressive approach British lawmakers have taken toward the Libor scandal. That the British government has a controlling stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland - and has not shied away from imposing its will on the bank - only adds to the curious standoff. In recent months, the government has moved to rein in executive compensation and curtail the bank's risky businesses.
British politicians have been unflinching in their pursuit of Barclays.
At a parliamentary hearing on Monday, British lawmakers repeatedly asked Mr. del Missier why he was not aware of the manipulation of Libor at Barclays dating back to 2005. He indicated that he told employees to submit lower rates at the behest of regulators, but he said he was not aware of manipulation until 2010.
The political ire was not reserved for the bank alone. Politicians also harshly criticized one of the bank's top regulators.
''This was unregulated, and you were warned about it,'' George Mudie, a British politician who sits on the committee overseeing the testimony, said to Financial Services Authority officials.
''It should have been settled before this whole thing blew up.''
Mark Scott contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cuba Hits Wall in 2-Year Push To Expand the Private Sector

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Nearly two years into the Cuban government's economic overhaul aimed at slashing public payrolls and bolstering private enterprise, the reforms have slowed so much that many Cuban entrepreneurs and intellectuals are questioning the aging leadership's ability -- or will -- to reshape one of the world's last Communist systems and shift nearly half of the island's output to private hands.
Those awaiting measures to create even more opportunity for private business got the opposite last week, when news spread of a little-advertised government decision to charge steep customs duties on the informal imports, from Miami and elsewhere, that are the lifeblood of many young businesses.
''This could have a huge impact,'' said Emilio Morales, president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, who said state-owned shops in Cuba were losing business to street vendors. ''It shows the state isn't ready to compete with the private sector.'' 
After the Cuban government began allowing people to open businesses in late 2010, nearly a quarter of a million of them have opted to work for themselves over the past 20 months, opening restaurants, snack bars and makeshift shops, driving taxis and fixing cellphones. Together with those who took advantage of an earlier experiment with privatization in the 1990s, about 387,000 Cubans, out of a population of about 11 million, are now self-employed; Cubans are also buying and selling homes and cars among themselves for the first time in 50 years.
As the private sector has grown, so has the deluge of goods brought to Cuba each day in suitcases and duffel bags, principally from Panama, Ecuador, the United States and Spain. With no access to a wholesale market, Cubans turn to friends, relatives and so-called mules for everything from food to trinkets to iPhones. This parallel trade has ballooned to more than $1 billion per year, Mr. Morales estimates, since the Obama administration began loosening of restrictions on travel and remittances in 2009.
Yunilka Barrios, who sells sunglasses, hairbands, nail polish and glittery bra straps from a grimy, narrow doorway, was alarmed by the prospect of a 100 percent tax on informal imports that the government indicated would go into effect in September. ''Things seem to be tightening up,'' she said.
Economists, businesspeople and diplomats believe President Raul Castro is treading carefully because of resistance from midlevel functionaries reluctant to lose their perks, and from conservative officials nervous about the social and political impact of economic enfranchisement.
The Cuban leader, who has sworn off the ''shock therapies'' that ruptured the Soviet Union, said in a speech in December that the government would proceed ''without hurry or improvisation, working to overcome the old dogmatic mind-set and correcting any mistakes in a timely fashion.''
But the pace of change has been too slow for people like Yelena Lopez de la Paz, who went bust because of competition, lack of experience and low margins. She opened a snack bar on her block last July, and made about $100 profit the first month, selling pizzas, juice from her mother's homegrown mangos and chewing gum sent by her grandmother in Miami. Then three snack bars opened nearby, and by the time she closed in November, Ms. de la Paz was taking home a dollar a day.
''I was investing a lot of money and time and earning nothing,'' she said in frustration.
Given the lack of progress, the government's pledge in April to move about 40 percent of the country's output to the nonstate sector in five years is less and less plausible, experts say.
''At the rate they are going, there is no way they will reach that figure,'' said Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a Cuban-born professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh.
With the National Assembly set to meet next Monday, Cubans are anticipating an expansion of the number of co-ops beyond the existing agricultural ones.
Separately, the government is turning small, state businesses, including cafes and watch repair shops, over to employees in some provinces. It has lifted a $4 ceiling on the value of contracts between state entities and individuals and is subcontracting work, such as construction, to independent operators.
''This is the first time since the 1970s or 1980s that the country has a plan, and this is the first time that there is discipline in implementing the strategy,'' said Rafael Betancourt, an economist based in Havana.
Even some who see the changes as slow remain confident they will happen. ''It may be a little frustrating for a spectator,'' said Philip Peters, a Cuba expert at the Lexington Institute in Virginia, ''but it's not a five-alarm fire.''
But such caution is at odds with Cubans' urgent needs, some say. Orlando Marquez Hidalgo, editor of the Catholic magazine Palabra Nueva in Cuba, said recently that if workers laid off by the public sector failed to find other jobs, their ''discontent and frustration'' would grow, as would ''the number of those who dissent or wish to leave.''
''Time is vital,'' he said.
The government aims to trim state payrolls by 170,000 this year and add 240,000 private-sector jobs, a tough goal given that just 24,000 Cubans took out licenses for self-employment in the first five months of the year.
Esteban Lazo Hernandez, a vice president of the Council of State, said in April that private-sector output would grow to between 40 percent and 45 percent of the gross national product in five years, from about 5 percent now.
Not all the entrepreneurs are struggling. Some restaurants and taxi services are making profits, and Carlos Saladrigas, a Cuban-American businessman, said during a visit to Havana in March that he knew of people ''making a lot of money, even by American standards.''
In interviews, a dozen Cuban entrepreneurs said they were making much more than they were in the public sector. However, supplies at state retail stores were expensive and unreliable, they said, and they often used the black market to cut their overhead.
The owner of a snack bar, who asked not to be identified because he was describing illegal activity, said he bought hamburger rolls out of the back door of a state-run bakery and meat patties from a friend who filched ground beef from his employer. One man selling hardware said most of it came from ''Roberto,'' a Cuban euphemism for stolen goods.
For Amarilis Albite Cabezas, a 23-year-old accounting student who runs a busy snack bar in her home in a Havana suburb, the restrictions stem from a continued distrust of individual wealth.
''They just haven't gotten things organized,'' said Ms. Albite, who gave up on getting a bank loan to buy a $700 refrigerator because she was asked to provide two guarantors, each of whom would have to leave the full amount in escrow until she had repaid.
''They opened these businesses so that people could survive and so that they, too, would survive,'' she added. ''But I don't think anybody is getting rich. That would be -- I don't know -- capitalism.''
Professor Mesa-Lago said one impetus for reform may be Cuba's dimming hopes of tapping offshore oil deposits. Repsol, the Spanish oil giant, decided in May to leave Cuba after its second well came up dry. Other companies are exploring different sites, but the dry well dented Cuba's prospects of reducing its dependence on Venezuela, which provides billions of dollars' worth of oil each year in exchange for a range of Cuban services.
For the moment, Ms. Barrios is happy in her doorway, taking home $10 to $15 on a good day, after she pays $2 to the neighbor who shares the entrance. She has cut prices to compete and frets about rumors that the government may crack down on stalls in passages and entranceways.
As she fished for change in a pouch at her waist, she said, ''I just want to keep this going.''

HEADLINE: Revolution and Opportunity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. LUONGO

 BODY:
More than a year has passed since the Arab Spring, the catchall name for the revolutions sweeping the Middle East. The political and economic changes have closed some doors and opened others for business people willing to tolerate risk.
''I have seen a flurry of activity because of the Arab Spring that was not happening before,'' said Naava Mashiah, an Israeli who is the chief executive of M.E. Links, a consulting company that she described as working ''to nurture economic relationships between Israel and other places.''
Ms. Mashiah, who works out of Geneva, said much of the activity is in soft diplomacy and informal development meetings, often coordinated with human rights and nongovernmental organizations. She mentioned helping clients develop contacts in or from locations that include Tunisia, Qatar, Egypt and Libya.
''It is bringing people together, even if it is a think tank,'' she said, adding: ''A lot of networking goes on in the corridors.'' She described the current back-channel activity and potential as akin to the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians, which touched off an economic boom. 
Chuck Dittrich, executive director of the U.S.-Libya Business Association, said he thought that American business people needed to ''just get over there and get a feel for the place,'' even if it did not seem immediately productive.
Mr. Dittrich said that association members were meeting Libyan government officials and business people, and that they were ''not so much there to sell, as more developing relationships as they do their planning process and decide where to go now.'' He mentioned Libyan trade shows focusing on oil, transportation and infrastructure development, health and education.
Mr. Dittrich said the Libyan economy had begun to be liberalized in 2005, when Muammar el-Qaddafi, then president, began courting the West. From a business perspective, he said, that means ''the glass is more than half full,'' adding, ''The ingredients are all there for them to pull this off in a very good way.''
American businesses that wait too long, fearing the risks, could be left behind, he said. Mr. Dittrich said his group visited in April, and ''we were the first organized U.S. business organization to go to Tripoli since the conflict.'' But, he said, ''Turkish and European delegations were there right from the early days.''
But a business traveler briefly stopping in the region has to make different preparations from someone who is based in a country in the midst of change. Marshall L. Stocker, a chartered financial analyst with the Boston hedge fund manager Emergent Property Advisors, moved to Cairo in June 2010, and temporarily fled after the mass protests began on Jan. 25, 2011.
''In Egypt, cells were off, the Internet was off. Obviously there was no business to be done. I was barricaded in my apartment,'' he said, adding, ''I self-evacuated to the airport with tickets for three different flights'' that his wife had arranged for him from the United States.
Mr. Stocker returned in February 2011, after Hosni Mubarak resigned as president. Despite the disruptions, he said, Egypt presents business opportunities. ''Now is a great time to buy assets,'' he said. ''Conceptually, and in practice here, assets are falling in value.''
He said his company was interested in Egypt because of the direction its business climate was moving. ''One of the things that attracted us to Egypt was that the World Bank had improved its 'ease of doing business' rating,'' he said. ''Egypt had become more hospitable to investment. From 2004 to 2007, it had the single greatest improvement in 'ease of doing business' of any country in the world.''
While things have generally settled, he said he was prepared for emergencies. ''As a result of the Arab Spring, I bought political evacuation insurance, and I have a satellite phone,'' he said. He uses Global Rescue, a company that provides medical evacuation, security services and other emergency assistance. Still, Mr. Stocker said some Cairo business travel costs had decreased, including hotel rates and airfares.
The Arab Spring also affected regional flight patterns, particularly between Egypt and Israel, where near-daily direct flights once connected Tel Aviv and Cairo. The Israeli airline El Al now flies once a month, and the Egyptian carrier Air Sinai often cancels scheduled flights.
Ms. Mashiah suggested using neutral Jordan as an alternative meeting or connection point for these and other Middle East countries. She also recommended using Europe for initial meetings between American and Middle Eastern business people, avoiding visa issues and other risks.
With no direct flight connections between the United States and Libya, Mr. Dittrich said his group used varied hubs, including Frankfurt, Rome and Istanbul, to reach Tripoli. Once there, he said, internal connections on Libya's Buraq Air were in ''new Boeing planes, right on time and cheap.''
There are now fewer direct connections between the United States and Egypt, Mr. Stocker said. He now flies through Amsterdam or Paris, lamenting the connection time. Egyptair has direct flights from Kennedy Airport in New York to Cairo.
The Arab countries are not the only region of the world undergoing transformation. John McAuliff, executive director of the Fund for Reconciliation and Development, which works to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba, said certain sectors of Cuba's economy were open to Americans, despite Treasury Department restrictions.
''Agriculture is allowed. Ag people can do this, can go for the purpose of discussing sales,'' with Cubans, he said, adding that ''telecommunications is allowed.''
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, also recently liberalized its economy, though there are few Western business travelers. Marilyn Downing Staff, president of Asia Transpacific Journeys, said she had mostly seen travelers from aid groups like CARE, World Vision and Doctors Without Borders.
Asian business travelers have long made inroads, she said, from Chinese oil industry representatives to sales teams from Korean and Indian car, soap, clothing and refrigerator companies. ''All bets are off with the embargo lifting,'' she said. ''Things are changing as we speak.'' The problem, she said is ''the business traveler is going to struggle to get appropriate accommodations. The infrastructure is maxed out,'' with few hotels at international business standards.
Still, those with experience in troubled or developing regions will discount such concerns. Ms. Mashiah, the Israeli consultant, said, ''If you are afraid of turbulent times, this is not right for you.''
But, she added, ''the more risk, the more opportunity.''
''There is a risk for business people who wait five years, but some come in right on the ground, like in Iraq,'' she said. ''And they are reaping the profits.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Trims 2013 Forecast For Growth To 3.9%

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund, unimpressed with the policy actions taken to stem the European sovereign debt crisis, on Monday cut its forecast of growth in 2013.
In a periodic update of its economic forecast, the Washington-based institution warned that the measures taken in Europe have not done enough to quiet markets and restore growth. The fund maintained its forecast of 2012 economic growth at 3.5 percent, but it cut its forecast of growth in 2013 to 3.9 percent, down from the estimate of 4.1 percent it made in April. In 2010, the world economy expanded 5.3 percent.
The monetary fund cautioned that even those tepid forecasts might be too optimistic, if Europe does not do enough to ameliorate its debt crisis and if policies to improve growth in emerging markets fail to gain traction. 
''Clearly, downside risks continue to loom large, importantly reflecting risks of delayed or insufficient policy action,'' the fund warned.
Countries experiencing the biggest reductions in expected growth include Brazil and India, whose economies have cooled this year; newly industrialized Asian economies, like Korea and Singapore, hit by a broader global slowdown; and Britain, struck by austerity budgeting.
Prospects in high-income countries outside the euro zone and in emerging markets have dimmed, Jose Vinals, the head of the fund's monetary and capital markets department, said in prepared remarks. ''This has left them more vulnerable to spillovers from the euro area. It also reduces their ability to address homegrown fiscal and financial vulnerabilities.''
The fund had stern words for American policy makers: avoid the ''fiscal cliff'' and lift the debt ceiling promptly, for the sake of the United States economy as well as the world's.
The monetary fund estimated that a failure to extend some of the Bush tax cuts and to reverse some of the automatic, across-the-board government spending cuts looming at the end of the year would cause the economy to stall on the brink of recession, ''with significant spillovers.''
It warned American policy makers that the country could experience considerably higher borrowing costs if they do not create a plan to reduce the country's deficits in the medium term as well.
The fund's economists also noted the adverse market reaction caused by the brinkmanship over the debt ceiling last year in a separate analysis of the global capital markets. Policy makers should raise the statutory borrowing limit ''well ahead of the deadline'' in order to ''mitigate risks of financial market disruptions and a loss in consumer and business confidence,'' they warned.
''Uncertainties about the fiscal outlook in the United States present a particular latent risk to global financial stability,'' Mr. Vinals said.
The fund reduced its estimates of American growth in 2012 and 2013 by a tenth of a percentage point, anticipating that the economy will expand just 2 percent this year and 2.3 percent next year. It warned that the recovery had seemed to experience an ''underlying loss of momentum'' recently. But it said that ''distortions'' from seasonal adjustment and ''payback'' from the unusually warm winter -- which drew economic activity forward from the spring -- seemed to be part of the explanation.
As has become usual in recent years, the fund saved its starkest warnings for Europe. It said that the flood of cheap euro loans offered by the European Central Bank -- the long-term refinancing operations -- had eased the crisis this year.
But yields have started spiraling upward again in countries including Spain and Italy, making further European bailouts seem a near inevitability, destabilizing the global financial markets and suppressing growth on the Continent.
Europe needs a stronger banking union, including a cross-Continental guarantor of deposits; structural reforms to improve growth prospects; more monetary easing; and better plans for budget-cutting in the countries struggling to convince global investors of their financial stability, the fund said.
''The utmost priority is to resolve the crisis in the euro area,'' its economists wrote. ''The recent agreements, if implemented in full, will help to break the adverse links between sovereigns and banks and create a banking union.''
The news was not all bad. The fund said that global growth figures had come in surprisingly strong in the first three months of the year, even as the United States entered a sharper slowdown than many economists had expected.
Financial markets had responded positively to measures taken by the European Central Bank to shore up European financial institutions, for one, and global trade and industrial production had turned up, helping countries including Germany and some big Asian exporters. The significant decline in oil prices also helped bolster growth around the world and ease inflationary pressures.

HEADLINE: Keeping Nutritious Dairy Foods in Our Diets

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Got Milk? You Don't Need It,'' by Mark Bittman (column, July 8), misses the mark. For most of us, eating three daily servings of dairy (milk, cheese or yogurt) as recommended by leading health and nutrition organizations means that we're getting a generous helping of nutrition at an affordable price -- both per penny and per calorie. 
Not to mention that dairy foods taste great and play a central role in many of our favorite meals and snacks.
Maintaining healthy habits -- like exercise and enjoying three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy foods each day -- throughout our lifetimes can mean the difference between a frail skeleton and a strong one in old age. Meeting dairy recommendations has also been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes.
As concern grows about obesity and our health, let's not cast doubt upon milk, one of the most economical and nutrient-rich foods on our tables.
GREG MILLER Rosemont, Ill., July 10, 2012
The writer is president of the Dairy Research Institute, which is financed by dairy farmers and the industry.
To the Editor:
Mark Bittman's column suggests that the happy cow on the family farm is a thing of the past: not so fast, and not true.
While it is true that the American dairy industry needs an overhaul and puts small and medium-sized farms -- in New York State and beyond -- at serious risk, there is an alternative to simply dropping dairy from our diets and accepting the collapse of dairy farming: find great farmers who use sustainable practices and treat their herds with care, pay them a fair price that recognizes their efforts, and reintroduce them to consumers.
Rebuilding our connection to farms and farmers gives consumers access to superior products, lets us know where our food comes from, and helps keep farmers farming. And it doesn't have to be too expensive.
DAN HORAN New York, July 9, 2012
The writer is chief executive of Five Acre Farms, a brand of local food products that are carried at the supermarket.

HEADLINE: For Fans Of Knicks, Conflict Over Lin

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK; Ken Belson and Tim Rohan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The frenzy is spreading, just as it did all those months ago, a palpable buzz reverberating from Midtown to Chinatown and to every corner of every borough. Jeremy Lin is still stirring passions, except this time with his contract, not his clever passing.
The Knicks have until Tuesday night to match a three-year, $25.1 million offer to Lin, the 23-year-old point guard sensation, or lose him to the Houston Rockets. The contract devised by Houston contains a $14.98 million balloon payment in the final year: a provision that could cost the Knicks three times that amount in luxury-tax penalties under the N.B.A.'s restrictive new system.
So the debate now rages: to pay or not to pay. To invest in Lin's enticing potential and popularity, or to let him leave.
Suddenly, everyone is a salary-cap expert, an economist, a scout and a chief executive. 
''Got to let him go,'' said Joe Anthony, a 38-year-old Brooklyn resident, speaking outside a sporting-goods store at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. ''While he has all of the potential in the world, I think there's a lot of question marks.''
Lin electrified Madison Square Garden and became a global star in February when he seized the Knicks' point guard job and sparked a seven-game winning streak, saving their season. His made-for-Broadway story was irresistible: Harvard-educated. Undrafted. Overlooked. Waived twice. The son of Taiwanese immigrants. An Asian-American in a league with no others.
Lin's No. 17 jersey became a top seller in days. ''Linsanity'' T-shirts flew off the racks at local sporting-good stores. Sports Illustrated put him on back-to-back covers. ''Saturday Night Live'' devoted skits to him. Restaurants named sandwiches and shakes after him. Creating Lin puns became a sport unto itself.
But Knicks fans are a tormented, anxious lot, scarred by years of bad basketball, bloated payrolls and underachieving players. The thought of devoting $25 million to a virtual rookie with a 26-game resume strikes some fans as less than sane. Others cannot bear to see Lin leave, no matter the cost.
''I think for the last 10 years, people have had nothing to get excited about for the Knicks,'' Nelson Park, 29, said while taking a smoking break outside a Midtown office building. ''And finally, after one year, we have something. I mean, how many millions of dollars have they spent on other players?''
Outrage and despair filled blogs, message boards and Twitter timelines over the weekend, when word circulated that the Knicks were likely to let Lin go. Fans threatened to stop watching games, to cancel their season tickets, even to -- gasp -- switch allegiances to the Brooklyn Nets.
When the Knicks struck a deal Saturday night to acquire Raymond Felton, a veteran point guard, the prospect of losing Lin seemed more real than ever. A person briefed on the team's thinking said it was highly unlikely the Knicks would match.
Two petitions aimed at reversing that fate were begun Sunday. One referred to Lin as ''the best thing that has happened to New York Knicks basketball in the last 20 years.'' It had 7,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon.
The emotions may be even stronger in Chinatown, where Lin-watching parties flourished in February. Wilson Tang, the 33-year-old owner of Nom Wah Tea Parlor, hosted some of those gatherings.
''The whole Linsanity thing was great,'' Tang said. ''It was great for New York. It was great for the Knicks. It was great for sales. It was great for Asian-Americans like myself, to see someone like that make it.''
Although Tang said it would pain him to see Lin go, he said his loyalty to the Knicks would not change, ''because I'm a New York Knicks fan, not a Jeremy Lin fan.''
Another fan, Jeffrey Wong, said in an e-mail that he was ''probably a little more caught up than most fans'' when Linsanity erupted. He called the contractual debate ''a little confusing and frustrating.''
''But I think in the end, if the Knicks don't re-sign Jeremy, and even if they do, they come off looking like bumbling idiots,'' Wong wrote.
Of course, Knicks fans are sadly accustomed to bumbling, ill-fated decisions.
The franchise spent the last decade chasing fading stars and overhyped talent with huge salaries, like Stephon Marbury, Jalen Rose and Steve Francis. The Knicks led the league in payroll and luxury-tax payments for years. All it got them was a permanent seat at the N.B.A.'s draft lottery -- except in the years when the Knicks had no first-round pick because they had traded them away.
The scars of that legacy are evident on all sides of the Lin debate. Some fans see an albatross contract and shudder at the thought of a smaller, speedier Jerome James. Others see a cruel twist: that after years of fiscal recklessness, the Knicks have suddenly gone conservative.
''The problem the Knicks have faced for the last 10 years is just cap issues and maneuverability,'' said Anthony, the fan who favors letting Lin go. He added, ''If this guy turns out to be a bust, then they're going to be caught with another lame duck that they're not going to be able to move.''
Park, who wants the Knicks to match the contract, said it was worth the risk.
''It's a lot of money, but compared to what they've spent in the past, it's not that much,'' he said. ''Again, players like Marbury and Eddy Curry, they've gotten nothing out of it.''
Still others say the issue is not the money, but the resume. Lin averaged 18.6 points and 7.6 assists in his 26 games as an everyday player. But he hardly played as a rookie, and his ultimate value is unclear.
''They're paying him $1 million for every game that he's actually started in his career,'' said Connor Loughlin, a 26-year-old fan who was heading to work in Midtown.
Even Lin's teammates have become engulfed in the debate. Carmelo Anthony, when asked if the Knicks should keep Lin, referred to the contract as ''ridiculous.'' J. R. Smith, in an interview with Sports Illustrated, said the contract could stir jealousy in the locker room.
At one Midtown restaurant, Lin's probable departure will not only hurt some patrons' feelings, but their stomachs. At the height of Linsanity, the chef at Feile, on West 33rd Street, created the LIN-burger -- ''a five-spice pork burger,'' said Mark Collins, the restaurant's manager. ''Had some ginger on it. Some pineapple. A really interesting burger.''
''At the time of Linsanity, when it was at its height, they couldn't get enough of it,'' Collins, a Knicks fan, said of the burger. ''It was very popular.''
Collins, 37, said the dish was discontinued when the season ended but would return if Lin did. Now he figures it is gone for good.
The LIN-burger was priced at $11 which, when you think about it, is a lot to pay for an entree with such a short track record.

HEADLINE: Weakness in Retailing Dims Outlook

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The outlook for the economy appeared dimmer on Monday after a report said Americans spent less at retail businesses for a third straight month in June. 
The report led some economists to reduce their estimates for economic growth in the April-June quarter. Many now think the economy grew even less than in the first quarter of the year, when it expanded at a sluggish 1.9 percent annual rate.
Spending in June fell in nearly every major category -- from autos, furniture and appliances to building, garden supplies and department stores. Over all, retail sales slid 0.5 percent from May to June, the Commerce Department said.
Retail sales had not fallen for three straight months since the fall of 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.
The weak American spending figures were reported on the same day that the International Monetary Fund slightly lowered its outlook for global growth over the next two years.
''However hard you look, there's just no good news in this report at all,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics.
Retail sales were still 4.7 percent higher in the April-June period than in the second quarter of 2011. And the retail sales figures do not include spending on services, which represents a larger portion of the economy.
Still, Mr. Ashworth said overall economic growth probably slowed to an annual rate of just 1.5 percent in the second quarter. That is not enough to lower the unemployment rate, which is currently 8.2 percent.
In Monday's report, the Commerce Department also said Americans spent less in April than previously thought. In part because of that, Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, lowered his estimate of growth in the April-June quarter to a 1.4 percent annual rate from 1.7 percent.
Chris G. Christopher Jr., a senior economist at IHS Global Insight, estimated that the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter and that growth would probably stay below 2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters.
Mr. Christopher said the biggest problem was meager job growth. Consumers have also been rattled by volatile stock prices stemming from Europe's debt crisis.
Some of the sting of Monday's retail sales report was eased by a separate report from the Commerce Department that American companies added to their stockpiles in May. When businesses step up restocking, they tend to order more goods, leading to more factory production.
Business inventories grew 0.3 percent in May from April, matching April's increase. Business sales fell 0.1 percent in May, matching the April decline. Total stockpiles rose to $1.58 trillion in May, nearly 20 percent higher than the low point in September 2009.
Separately, factory activity in the New York region is growing at a slightly faster pace, according to a survey issued Monday. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State manufacturing index increased to 7.4 in July from a reading of 2.3 in June. Any number above zero indicates growth.

HEADLINE: Guarding the Numbers

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On Tuesday morning at precisely 8:30, after a 10-second countdown synchronized to the Naval Observatory's atomic clock, a Labor Department official will flip a master switch in the agency's battened-down pressroom and computers will blurt out the monthly Consumer Price Index.
Until that moment, the market-sensitive data will be guarded with launch-code secrecy, a precaution against anyone who might try to take advantage of an accidental or a surreptitious leak to gain an insider's edge in the financial markets, turning milliseconds into millions.
Yet for all the rituals of high security, government officials have become increasingly nervous that their process is vulnerable, and are now overhauling it. 
After a yearlong review that included scrutiny by anti-hacking specialists from Sandia National Laboratories, officials at the Labor Department revoked the credentials of a few little-known news organizations that appeared to serve financial clients rather than the public at large.
The government has also ordered other media groups to replace their computers in the lockup room with new computers under tighter controls.
The efforts stem from the newfound importance of high-speed trading, which began to grow significantly in the middle of the last decade and is now a central part of some hedge funds' investment strategies. By gaining information seconds or minutes before others, high-speed traders -- sometimes known as high-frequency or algorithmic traders -- can use the computerized nature of modern finance to make quick profits or, if a bet goes wrong, take large losses.
In addition to the inflation numbers, the lockup process, in use at several agencies, covers releases on economic growth, home sales, gas prices, corn yields and the unemployment rate, among other things.
The Labor Department's overhaul was ignited by inquiries starting in 2007 from the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the department's own inspector general. Officials did not cite any specific major breach of security, but they had grown concerned that one was possible. Two instances in 2008, when Reuters accidentally released data a few seconds too early, heightened concerns.
The clampdown has strained the Labor Department's relations with some of the world's biggest news agencies, including Reuters and Bloomberg News. In negotiations with the department and at a fractious Congressional hearing, the companies suggested the government was taking extreme measures against an imagined threat.
At the center of the Labor Department's effort was a so-called Red Team from Sandia Labs, a federally financed research group operated by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, which has half a century of experience in computer security, including work on the military's command and control networks.
The ''root cause'' for the review, the team noted, was the possibility of traders or their agents working inside the lockup.
Acting on the team's recommendations, Labor Department officials sought a wholesale replacement of the computer equipment in the lockup room. The replacement is scheduled to happen by September, although further steps to shield against surreptitious transmissions are possible later.
At a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month, the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Keith Hall explained the main worry, which is that the growing reliance on high-speed trading had created the potential for participants in the media lockup to give an unfair advantage to traders.
''Lockup participants may now have access to specialized computer equipment and software that links them directly to automated trading models,'' he noted. ''This effectively allows financial market transactions to be driven from inside lockups.''
Carl Fillichio, the Labor Department official in charge of the overhaul, described a series of malfunctions and violations over the last few years, including the installation of fiber optic cables in the lockup room without permission or the use of BlackBerrys or mobile phone cameras. Media companies themselves have complained about competitors who ''may have gained unfair advantage in speed of transmission or have surreptitiously broken embargoes,'' Mr. Fillichio added in his testimony.
Some members of the media, however, say the crackdown is unnecessary. (The New York Times does not participate in the Labor Department lockup.)
''What is the problem you think, you imagine that this will prevent?'' asked Daniel Moss, an executive editor at Bloomberg News, in an April conference call between Mr. Fillichio and news organizations. Mr. Moss, plainly exasperated, repeated the question several times but got no clear answer.
Government officials consider the potential security problems to be real. After a five-member team from Sandia Labs visited the lockup room last July, it identified ''verified vulnerabilities in processes, procedures and systems used to protect'' embargoed data, according to the summary of its report.
The team warned about methods of sneaking information out, such as by hidden transmitters, or bypassing the black boxes and master switches that keep the lockup room under electronic quarantine through other means, like wireless Internet. The team noted that ''likely adversaries'' had the technical and financial resources and possibly the willingness ''to bend and potentially violate rules and laws.''
But it said any culprits were unlikely to ''employ violent means to meet their goal of exfiltrating embargoed data prior to the official release time.''
At the oversight hearing, Mr. Moss of Bloomberg News argued that traditional media outlets were not the problem and suggested that the Labor Department instead expel those groups connected to algorithmic traders from the lockup.
Ultimately, the Labor Department did pull the credentials of a few organizations -- including Need to Know News, a small enterprise owned by the German exchange. Its data goes directly from the lockups to specialized trading programs. Mr. Fillichio explained that they were not ''primarily journalistic'' and did not ''disseminate their information to a wide audience.''
Chris Rhea, chief executive of Need to Know News, referred questions to a spokesman, who did not respond.
In the initial stages of the crackdown, Mr. Fillichio ordered lockup participants to use government computers, transmission lines and even pens and pencils and paper while inside the lockup. Media groups objected.
''This proposal threatens the First Amendment,'' Mr. Moss said at the oversight hearing, adding that it would give the government ''access to a reporters' thoughts, drafts or notes as a condition for covering the news.''
After another round of negotiations, the government backed off a bit. For now, some equipment owned by media companies is expected to stay. But over the next few months they will have to deliver new, shrink-wrapped terminals, which will be subject to inspection and maintenance by Labor Department technicians.
One question that is still unresolved is how many seats each organization will be allowed.
Space is tight in the lockup. And paradoxically, all the attention to this obscure room on a drab corridor has brought newcomers knocking, as if at the door of a speakeasy.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:

HEADLINE: In Tiny Bean, India's Dirt-Poor Farmers Strike Gas-Drilling Gold

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS; Sruthi Gottipati contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LORDI, India -- Sohan Singh's shoeless children have spent most of their lives hungry, dirty and hot. A farmer in a desert land, Mr. Singh could not afford anything better than a mud hut and a barely adequate diet for his family.
But it just so happens that when the hard little bean that Mr. Singh grows is ground up, it becomes an essential ingredient for mining oil and natural gas in a process called hydraulic fracturing.
Halfway around the world, earnings are down for an oil services giant, Halliburton, because prices have risen for guar, the bean that Mr. Singh and his fellow farmers raise.
Halliburton's loss was, in a rather significant way, Mr. Singh's gain -- a rare victory for the littlest of the little guys in global trade. The increase in guar prices is helping to transform this part of the state of Rajasthan in northwestern India, one of the world's poorest places. Tractor sales are soaring, land prices are increasing and weddings have grown even more colorful. 
''Now we have enough food, and we have a house made of stone,'' Mr. Singh said proudly while his rail-thin children stared in awe.
Guar, a modest bean so hard that it can crack teeth, has become an unlikely global player, and dirt-poor farmers like Mr. Singh have suddenly become a crucial link in the energy production of the United States.
For centuries, farmers here used guar to feed their families and their cattle. There are better sources of nutrition, but few that grow in the Rajasthani desert, a land rich in culture but poor in rain. Broader commercial interest in guar first developed when food companies found that it absorbs water like a souped-up cornstarch, and a powdered form of the bean is now widely used to thicken ice cream and keep pastries crisp.
But much more important to farmers here was the recent discovery that guar could stiffen water so much that a mixture is able to carry sand sideways into wells drilled by horizontal fracturing, also known as fracking.
The fracking boom in the United States has led to a surge in natural gas production, a decline in oil imports and a gradual transition away from coal-fired power plants. Fracking may also have spoiled some rural water supplies and caused environmental damage in parts of the United States, but it is hard to find anyone in Rajasthan who sees fracking as anything but a blessing.
''Without guar, you cannot have fracturing fluids,'' said Michael J. Economides, a professor of engineering at the University of Houston who is a fracking expert. ''And what everybody is worried about is that there is virtually no guar out there now.''
India produces about 85 percent of the world's guar. As worries rose about the prospects for this year's monsoon, which is vital for an adequate crop, speculation over guar production built to a frenzy. Trading in guar futures was even suspended, and with the monsoon still behind schedule, it remains postponed. Ramesh Abhishek, India's chief commodities market regulator, said guar trading would resume when supplies proved adequate.
''If the physical market doesn't provide enough supplies, then the futures market causes more harm than good,'' Mr. Abhishek said.
Now, an international effort is under way to ensure that guar supplies come closer to meeting the soaring demand, and hundreds of thousands of small farmers here have been recruited in the effort. Leading the way is Vikas WSP, an Indian company that specializes in the production of guar powders.
Many farmers sold their seed stock last year when prices shot up, so Vikas has held rallies in small towns to pass out free seeds, including new high-production hybrids. The company persuaded farmers with irrigated land in the state of Punjab, north of Rajasthan, to plant guar in the spring instead of cotton. That crop is now coming to market.
And Vikas signed contracts with farmers guaranteeing a return of nearly $800 per acre if they planted guar, no matter what this year's monsoon brought.
''Whatever they produce, we will buy,'' said Sanjay Pareek, a Vikas vice president.
Anticipating a heavy crop, Vikas is more than doubling its processing capacity by building two new plants in Jodhpur, the second-largest city in Rajasthan. By next year, the company will be able to produce 86,400 tons of guar powder each day, it said. Smaller producers are taking similar steps.
''Last year was an extraordinary year,'' said S. K. Sharma, managing director of Lotus Gums and Chemicals in Jodhpur. ''In 35 years in this business, I've never seen that.''
Mr. Sharma said his company would soon open a second plant dedicated entirely to serving gas companies, adding that he was cautiously optimistic that guar prices would remain robust. ''But we know there are efforts to grow guar in China, Australia, California and elsewhere, and it has us worried,'' he said.
Despite the expanding supply, many analysts believe that guar prices will remain high for the foreseeable future. Neil Beveridge, an oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said demand for fracking services should continue to grow rapidly as the industry expanded outside North America. ''We're already starting to see a big increase in Eastern Europe, Argentina, Australia, China and India itself,'' he said.
Susan L. Sakmar, an energy analyst in San Francisco, cautioned that the fracking boom could slow and that guar alternatives could be developed. But Mr. Economides, the Houston fracking expert, dismissed such talk. ''There are no easy or cheap alternatives to guar,'' he said.
That is good news for guar producers. Farmers, traders and processors around Jodhpur admitted fulfilling some long-held dreams with the profits they made last year. Some took trips to Europe; some bought gold; others got married.
At a Massey Ferguson tractor dealership in Jodhpur, where sales have doubled in recent years, Nathu Parjapat of Haripura was buying a tractor for his father-in-law, whose own profits from farming guar allowed him to provide a dowry of 12 grams of gold and half a kilogram of silver when Mr. Parjapat married his daughter.
''So now I'm buying a tractor for him,'' Mr. Parjapat said as his father-in-law stood next to him, nodding with grave approval.
Mr. Singh, the farmer with the new house, said he would plant his entire field with guar this year instead of spreading his risk among other crops. His family is able to sleep on the stone roof, where a constant breeze keeps them cool. His old mud house, now occupied by goats, has a roof made of sticks that did not allow such a luxury.
Mr. Singh's sister, Issa Rathore, showed off a silver ankle bracelet and a toe ring, both bought with guar profits. But her smile quickly vanished when she was asked whether she expected a similar windfall in the coming months. She glanced at the sky, and the children around her grew hushed. ''Will the monsoon be enough this year?'' she asked. ''Who knows?''
Online Correction: July 17, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article said incorrectly in the Web summary that the affected farmers were in northeastern India, rather than northwestern India.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Step Up Accusations on Jobs

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Peter Baker reported from Cincinnati, and Michael D. Shear from Washington. Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- President Obama and Mitt Romney escalated their running battle over capitalism, integrity and the economy on Monday as each sought to portray the other as part of the nation's problem rather than its solution.
At a freewheeling town-hall-style meeting with supporters here, Mr. Obama took aim at Mr. Romney's corporate tax proposals, saying they would create jobs overseas rather than at home. Mr. Romney's campaign accused Mr. Obama of ''crony capitalism'' by using government resources to reward donors at the expense of the middle class.
The sharp exchanges came after a week in which the president's campaign pounded away at Mr. Romney over business deals at the Boston-based private equity firm he founded and over his refusal to release more than two years of his personal tax returns. 
In focusing on his opponent's tax policies on Monday, Mr. Obama tried to cement the impression of an out-of-touch tycoon, while Mr. Romney tried to get off the defensive by questioning the president's ethics.
''We don't need a president who plans to ship more jobs overseas or wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas,'' Mr. Obama told supporters at Cincinnati Music Hall in this important swing state. ''I want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in Ohio, that are investing in Cincinnati, that are investing in Hamilton County. I want to give incentives to companies that are investing in you.''
Mr. Obama cited a study saying that Mr. Romney's plan to eliminate taxes on foreign income earned by corporations would create 800,000 jobs. ''There's only one problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The jobs wouldn't be in America.''
The study, published in the journal Tax Notes by Kimberly A. Clausing, a professor at Reed College, argued that those overseas jobs could offset jobs at home. ''With high unemployment rates, why further tilt the playing field in favor of jobs in low-tax countries?'' she wrote.
Republicans said the study was conducted by a professor from a well-known liberal college who contributed money to Mr. Obama's campaign and to other Democrats. They also pointed out that the policy she and Mr. Obama oppose is actually supported by members of the president's jobs advisory council and export advisory council. It was also supported by Mr. Obama's own bipartisan commission on reducing the national debt, led by Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator, and Erskine B. Bowles, a former Clinton White House chief of staff.
Corporations argue that eliminating taxes on foreign income, a policy called a ''territorial tax system,'' would encourage them to repatriate that money and invest it in the United States. ''A territorial tax system should be adopted to help put the U.S. system in line with other countries, leveling the playing field,'' the Simpson-Bowles commission concluded.
Jennifer R. Psaki, an Obama spokeswoman, said Professor Clausing was a ''well-respected economist'' and brushed off the fact that Mr. Obama's own advisers disagreed with him on the issue. ''Of course the president receives a range of advice from outside advisory boards,'' she said, ''but the only view that matters is the president's. And he thinks this is the wrong approach.''
Mr. Romney, who held no public campaign events on Monday, authorized a new Web video asserting that Mr. Obama has steered money and payoffs to political supporters. The video shows headlines from news organizations as Mr. Obama sings the opening verse from ''Let's Stay Together'' in the background, a response to an Obama campaign ad released Saturday featuring Mr. Romney singing ''America the Beautiful.''
Among the headlines shown in the latest Romney ad: ''Report: Obama's big-money raisers get key posts, access, stimulus dollars,'' and ''Democratic donors rewarded with W.H. perks.''
In a statement, Mr. Romney's campaign said: ''Middle-class families are struggling in the Obama economy. Instead of working to restore their economic security, President Obama is too busy rewarding his biggest donors. The Obama record is one of political payoffs and middle-class layoffs.''
Ms. Psaki said Mr. Romney was ''treading on thin ice here,'' noting that the president has released information that Mr. Romney has refused to. ''President Obama has set a bar of transparency that Mitt Romney has not met, cannot possibly meet, even on his tippy toes,'' Ms. Psaki said.
Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, said Mr. Obama was trying to distract voters from a string of disappointing jobs reports with ''shiny objects'' -- meaning the attacks on Mr. Romney's business record. The Romney campaign's response will be to call out Mr. Obama's ''Chicago-style politics and Chicago-style economics,'' Mr. Gillespie told reporters on a conference call.
Mr. Obama's event here, cast as his first town-hall-style meeting of the campaign, was animated at times. The heavy topics were leavened by lighter moments. A barber asked if he could cut Mr. Obama's hair, but the president declined. ''You would not want a president who was disloyal to his barber,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Regulators And HSBC Are Faulted By Senate

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
8:55 p.m. Updated The global bank HSBC has been used by Mexican drug cartels looking to get cash back into the United States, by Saudi Arabian banks that needed access to dollars despite their terrorist ties and by Iranians who wanted to circumvent United States sanctions, a Senate report says.
The 335-page report released Monday also says that executives at HSBC and regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ignored warning signs and failed to stop the illegal behavior at many points between 2001 and 2010. 
In one case, an HSBC executive successfully argued that the bank should resume business with a Saudi Arabian bank, Al Rajhi Bank, despite the fact that Al Rajhi's founder had been an early benefactor of Al Qaeda. HSBC's American branch ended up supplying a billion dollars to the bank.
The report is the product of a yearlong investigation by a Senate subcommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It points to the problems at HSBC, Europe's largest financial institution, as indicators of a broader problem of illegal money flowing through international financial institutions into the United States.
''Banks that ignore money laundering rules are a big problem for our country,'' said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the subcommittee. ''Also troubling is a bank regulator that does not adequately do its job.'' He called HSBC's compliance culture ''pervasively polluted for a long time.''
HSBC executives are expected to apologize for shortcomings in the bank's internal controls in a hearing of the subcommittee on Tuesday. The company said in a statement on Monday that ''we will apologize, acknowledge these mistakes, answer for our actions and give our absolute commitment to fixing what went wrong.''
Mr. Levin, however, said on Monday that HSBC had promised to fix similar problems in years past and failed. ''While the bank is saying all the right things, and that is fine, it has said all the right things before,'' he said.
The hearing is unlikely to be the end of HSBC's problems. The bank has disclosed in regulatory filings that the issues with money laundering are also being investigated by the Department of Justice and could lead to criminal charges and ''significant'' fines, which analysts have said could reach $1 billion.
The report on HSBC is the latest of several scandals that have recently rocked global banks and highlighted the inability of regulators to catch what is claimed to be widespread wrongdoing in the financial industry. The British bank Barclays recently admitted that its traders tried to manipulate a crucial global interest rate, and multiple major banks are under investigation. JPMorgan Chase disclosed last week that its employees may have tried to hide trades that are likely to cost the bank billions of dollars.
Mr. Levin said that wrongdoing in the financial world has been exacerbated by the relatively light touch of government regulators. ''As long as a bank just sees that it is going to be dealt with kid gloves, I think we are going to continue to see these shortfalls that have been so endemic,'' Mr. Levin said.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has come under particularly harsh criticism for showing too much deference to the banks it regulates. The new leader of the agency, Thomas J. Curry, has promised a stricter approach since he took over in April.
Mr. Curry said in a statement on Monday that members of his staff ''fully embrace'' the subcommittee's report, and he is expected to testify Tuesday that the agency is already carrying out many of the report's recommendations.
Regulators have been paying close attention to the willingness of global banks to facilitate illegal flows of money from outside the United States. The Treasury Department announced last month that ING Bank had agreed to pay $619 million to settle charges that it moved money into the United States from Cuba and Iran, despite sanctions against those countries, for nearly two decades. Since 2009, there have been five similar settlements between American regulators and other banks, including Barclays and Credit Suisse, over illicit transactions.
In the Senate report, HSBC is facing accusations that it helped its clients circumvent rules intended to stop transactions from countries facing international sanctions, and in some cases flouted laws in pursuit of profits.
While HSBC is accused of moving money into the United States from North Korea and Cuba, the most extensive problems involved accounts in Iran. An independent audit, paid for by HSBC, found that the bank facilitated 25,000 questionable payments involving Iran between 2001 and 2007. In some cases, HSBC executives counseled Iranian financial institutions on how to evade the filters of American regulators, the report says.
When the bank developed a way to process transactions for Iran's largest retail bank, an HSBC executive wrote an e-mail to his colleagues that said, ''I wish to be on the record as not comfortable with this piece of business.'' None of his colleagues responded and the deal went ahead, according to the report.
The subcommittee also found evidence of widespread wrongdoing in HSBC's failure to stop money laundering through accounts tied to drug trafficking in Mexico. The bank is accused of shipping $7 billion in cash from Mexico to the United States in 2007 and 2008 despite several warnings that the money was coming from cartels that needed a way to return their profits to the United States.
In many of the cases detailed in the report, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is said to have spotted the problematic behavior. But in nearly every case, the subcommittee found that the agency gave HSBC only a warning or mild punishment and did not push the bank to make large-scale changes.
The agency ultimately issued a cease-and-desist order against HSBC in 2010 after other law enforcement agencies began looking into the problems. Mr. Levin, though, said that his subcommittee found that some of the problems had not been fixed by the time the subcommittee began looking into them over the last year.
A new chief executive took over at HSBC early last year and he has committed to making sweeping changes at the company. In its statement, the bank laid out several steps it had recently taken to increase oversight of international flows of money.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rise in Pill Abuse Forces New Look at U.S. Drug Fight

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Damien Cave reported from Mexico City, and Michael S. Schmidt from Washington.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- America's drug problem is shifting from illicit substances like cocaine to abuse of prescription painkillers, a change that is forcing policy makers to re-examine the long and expensive strategy of trying to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States.
This rethinking extends beyond the United States, where policy makers are debating how to better reduce demand for painkillers. The effects would also be felt here and in Central America: With the drug wars in Mexico inflaming violence, some argue that the money now used for interdiction could be better spent building up the institutions -- especially courts and prosecutors' offices -- that would lead to long-term stability in Mexico and elsewhere.
''The policies the United States has had for the last 41 years have become irrelevant,'' said Morris Panner, a former counternarcotics prosecutor in New York and at the American Embassy in Colombia, who is now an adviser at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ''The United States was worried about shipments of cocaine and heroin for years, but whether those policies worked or not doesn't matter because they are now worried about Americans using prescription drugs.'' 
The same sense that there is a need for a new approach was expressed last week by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former federal prosecutor, who declared the war on drugs ''a failure'' that imprisons people who really need treatment.
While a major change in policy is not imminent -- ''It's all aircraft carriers, none of it moves on a dime,'' as one senior Obama administration official put it -- the election of a new president in Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, is very likely to have an immediate impact on the debate. Mr. Pena Nieto has promised to focus not on drugs but rather on reducing the violent crimes that most affect Mexicans.
Mexico and other countries nearby, especially Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, are withering under a metastasizing threat: violence caused by drug traffickers battling for power, to move drugs, extort businesses, and kidnap and kill for ransom. The American response so far has mostly involved a familiar escalation of force, characterized by the addition of law enforcement and military equipment and personnel to help governments too weak to combat trafficking on their own.
But in Mexico, a focus of American antidrug efforts in recent years, a shift in priorities is already apparent. Since 2010, programs for building the rule of law and stronger communities have become the largest items in the State Department's antidrug budget, with the bulk of the money assigned to Mexico. That amounts to a reversal from 2008 and 2009, when 70 percent was allocated to border security and heavy equipment like helicopters.
Even some officials with the Drug Enforcement Administration and Justice Department say they now recognize that arresting kingpins and seizing large drug shipments have failed to make Mexico more stable, largely because of corruption and other flaws in the Mexican justice system.
American officials say they are now focused on training Mexican prison guards, prosecutors and judges, while supporting Mexican programs aimed at keeping at-risk youths from joining gangs.
''We see crime as the leading threat in some countries to economic growth and the leading threat to democracy,'' said Mark Feierstein, the United States Agency for International Development assistant administrator for Latin American and the Caribbean.
Still, law enforcement remains a major element of the government's strategy, as the deployment of a commando-style squad of D.E.A. agents in Honduras has demonstrated. And the Obama administration has ruled out drug legalization, despite expanding support for the idea in Latin America, while designating about 60 percent of the federal antidrug budget of roughly $25 billion a year to supply-side efforts, with 40 percent to demand, as the government has for decades.
Eric L. Olson, a security analyst with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said the growing debate had, so far, mostly led to confusion. ''Some U.S. officials favor building institutions; others think it's hopeless,'' he said.
Other experts are more critical of the Obama administration, pointing to the continued focus on cocaine interdiction, especially in Honduras, where the D.E.A. squad has been involved in a series of recent raids. One left four people dead, including two pregnant women, and in another one, last week, two people who were said to be smugglers were killed.
''It just hasn't worked,'' said Mark L. Schneider, a special adviser on Latin America at the International Crisis Group. ''All interdiction and law enforcement did was shift cultivation from Colombia to Peru, and the increase in interdiction in the Caribbean drove trafficking to Mexico, and now with the increase in violence there it has driven trafficking to Central America as the first stop. So it is all virtually unchanged.''
What has changed is Americans' use of cocaine.
The most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that an estimated 1.5 million people had used cocaine in the previous month, down from 2 million in 2002 and, according to an earlier government survey, 5.8 million in the mid-1980s. (Methamphetamine use has also fallen in recent years, while heroin use was up somewhat, to 239,000 users in 2010 from 213,000 in 2008.)
Some officials argue the cocaine decline shows that supply-side efforts have worked, but experts note that prices in the United States have held mostly steady since the late 1980s, suggesting the prominent role of a decrease in demand. Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that in the United States, cocaine had simply run its course among aging addicts. ''What you're recording,'' he said, ''is the rate at which they are dying or quitting.''
Now the drugs most likely to land Americans in emergency rooms cannot be interdicted. Studies show that prescription painkillers, and stimulants to a lesser extent, are the nation's biggest drug problem. The same survey that identified 1.5 million cocaine users in 2010 found 7 million users of ''psychotherapeutics.'' Of the 36,450 overdose deaths in the United States in 2008, 20,044 involved a prescription drug, more than all illicit drugs combined.
And whereas cocaine and heroin have been concentrated in big cities, prescription drug abuse has spread nearly everywhere. ''Today there is drug use in every county in Ohio, and the problem is worse in rural areas,'' said Mike DeWine, the attorney general of Ohio.
''This is an urgent, urgent issue that needs to be addressed promptly,'' said Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. So far, she said, the response from government and the health care industry has been inadequate.
But momentum for a broader change in domestic drug policy -- as in foreign policy -- appears to be building. D.E.A. officials say they have recently created 37 ''tactical diversion squads'' focusing on prescription drug investigations, with 26 more to be added over the next few years.
''Unfortunately,'' said Representative Mary Bono Mack, a Republican from California who is co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Prescription Drug Abuse, ''it's because more and more members are hearing from back home in their district that people are dying.''

HEADLINE: The Capitalism Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Let's say you are president in a time of a sustained economic slowdown. You initiated a series of big policies that you thought were going to turn the economy around, but they didn't work -- either because they were insufficient or ineffective. How do you run for re-election under these circumstances?
Do you spend the entire campaign saying that things would have been even worse if you hadn't acted the way you did? No. That would be pathetic. You go on the attack. Instead of defending your economic policies, you attack modern capitalism as it now exists. You blame the system for the economy. You do this with double ferocity if your opponent happens to be the embodiment of that system. 
This is what the Obama campaign appears to have done in recent months. Instead of defending the policies of the last four years, the campaign has begun a series of attacks on the things people don't like about modern capitalism.
They don't like the way unsuccessful firms go bust. Obama hit that with ads about a steel plant closure a few months ago. They don't like C.E.O. salaries. President Obama hits that regularly. They don't like financial shenanigans. Obama hits that. They don't like outsourcing and offshoring. This week, Obama has been hitting that.
The president is now running an ad showing Mitt Romney tunelessly singing ''America the Beautiful,'' while the text on screen blasts him for shipping jobs to China, India and Mexico.
The accuracy of the ad has been questioned by the various fact-checking outfits. That need not detain us. It's safest to assume that all the ads you see this year will be at least somewhat inaccurate because the ad-makers now take dishonesty as a mark of their professional toughness.
What matters is the ideology behind the ad: the assumption that Bain Capital, the private-equity firm founded by Romney, should not have invested in companies that hired workers abroad; the assumption that hiring Mexican or Indian workers is unpatriotic; the assumption that no worthy person would do what most global business leaders have been doing for the past half-century.
This ad -- and the rhetoric the campaign is using around it -- challenges the entire logic of capitalism as it has existed over several decades. It's part of a comprehensive attack on the economic system Romney personifies.
This shift of focus has been audacious. Over the years of his presidency, Obama has not been a critic of globalization. There's no real evidence that, when he's off the campaign trail, he has any problem with outsourcing and offshoring. He has lavishly praised people like Steve Jobs who were prominent practitioners. He has hired people like Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, whose company embodies the upsides of globalization. His economic advisers have generally touted the benefits of globalization even as they worked to help those who are hurt by its downsides.
But, politically, this aggressive tactic has worked. It has shifted the focus of the race from being about big government, which Obama represents, to being about capitalism, which Romney represents.
Just as Republicans spent years promising voters that they could have tax cuts forever, now the Democrats are promising voters that they can have all the benefits of capitalism without the downsides, like plant closures, rich C.E.O.'s and outsourcing. Just as Republicans used to force Democrats into the eat-your-spinach posture (you need to have high taxes if you want your programs), now Democrats are casting Republicans into the eat-your-spinach posture (you need to accept outsourcing and the pains of creative destruction if you want your prosperity).
The Romney campaign doesn't seem to know how to respond. For centuries, business leaders have been inept when writers, intellectuals and politicians attacked capitalism, and, so far, the Romney campaign is continuing that streak.
One thing is for sure. As Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute has said again and again, it's not enough to say that capitalism will make you money. You can't fight what is essentially a moral critique with economics.
Romney is going to have to define a vision of modern capitalism. He's going to have to separate his vision from the scandals and excesses we've seen over the last few years. He needs to define the kind of capitalist he is and why the country needs his virtues.
Let's face it, he's not a heroic entrepreneur. He's an efficiency expert. It has been the business of his life to take companies that were mediocre and sclerotic and try to make them efficient and dynamic. It has been his job to be the corporate version of a personal trainer: take people who are puffy and self-indulgent and whip them into shape.
That's his selling point: rigor and productivity. If he can build a capitalist vision around that, he'll thrive. If not, he's a punching bag.

HEADLINE: Citigroup's Profit Drops, But Beats Expectations

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
7:50 p.m. Updated
Citigroup on Monday reported that both its revenue and profit fell in the second quarter, underscoring the anemic economic environment financial institutions face in the United States and abroad.
While the results came in ahead of analysts' forecast, net income dropped 12 percent while revenue was down 10 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Citigroup is the country's third-largest bank by assets, behind JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
The bottom line, however, was helped by lower credit losses and tight controls on expenses - a major goal of Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. 
The bank's expenses were down 6 percent from the second quarter of 2012 and credit losses fell 31 percent.
''In short, we are on top of the things we can control,'' Mr. Pandit said during a call with analysts on Monday. ''We are managing our expenses closely and making sure we are right-sized for the environment we anticipate.''
Citigroup, along with Bank of America, was among the institutions hardest hit by the financial crisis of 2008, and Mr. Pandit has spent the last four years slowly restoring the company to profitability while disposing of weaker assets.
Citi Holdings, the division of the company with the problem assets, recorded a loss of $920 million in the quarter. But that division's assets continue to shrink, falling 28 percent from the same period a year ago.
The increased flow of red ink at Citi Holdings is largely caused by losses on consumer home mortgages as the bank winds down a $100 billion portfolio of soured mortgages, said John Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer.
''It's hard for this portfolio to turn a profit,'' Mr. Gerspach said. ''We're constantly looking to sell those delinquent loans and work our way through it.''
Citigroup shares remain far below where they were before the financial crisis, but rallied slightly with Monday's earnings report. Its stock rose 16 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $26.81.
In its release, the bank reported earnings of $2.9 billion, or 95 cents a share, with revenue falling to $18.6 billion. Those earnings include a $219 million gain based on how certain company debt is valued, as well as a one-time loss of $424 million on the sale of a stake in Akbank T.A.S., a Turkish bank.
Excluding one-time charges, Citi reported earnings of $1 a share on revenue of $18.8 billion. Analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 89 cents a share on revenue of $18.9 billion.
''It's not stellar, but if you look at the broad strokes, revenues were reasonably resilient and they're controlling expenses,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura. ''It's hard to get too excited about any bank in this environment, but when you factor in that Citigroup is trading at half of tangible book value, the stock is appealing.''
''Asia is slowing and Europe is a mess, but Citi was still able to deliver loan and deposit growth in their core businesses,'' he added.
Supporting the idea that businesses remain more bullish than consumers, Citigroup said that lending to mid-to-large companies jumped 22 percent, while borrowing by consumers increased by 2 percent.
Mr. Gerspach said much of the growth in corporate loans was coming from trade finance, a sector European banks had pulled away from amid economic problems on the Continent. ''It opens a window for a bank like us to capture market share and we're doing just that,'' he said.
As for individual borrowing, Mr. Gerspach noted that ''there isn't a lot of consumer loan growth in the U.S. The U.S. consumer is still deleveraging.''
Within the more volatile capital markets businesses, results varied sharply by segment. Investment banking fees slumped 21 percent to $854 million, while equity trading revenue fell 29 percent, to $550 million.
As a result of lower expenses and credit losses, income at the securities and banking unit rose 18 percent, to $1.4 billion.
While Wall Street remains a key business for Citigroup, more and more of the company's earnings are coming from its consumer bank as well as its giant transaction services business, which helps businesses process payments and manage internal capital.
The two divisions - global consumer banking and transaction services - contributed 73 percent of the bank's revenue in the second quarter of 2012, up from 46 percent two years ago. The remaining 27 percent came from its securities and banking unit.
Asked about the Libor scandal now rattling the broader banking industry, Mr. Pandit and Mr. Gerspach both said Citigroup was cooperating with requests for information from several jurisdictions.
But Mr. Pandit suggested that Citigroup might fare better than institutions like Barclays, which are facing large penalties in settling Libor-related claims. Last month, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to British and American regulators to settle claims that it had manipulated how Libor is set.
''The only thing I can say is, Do not infer from the situation of one Libor-submitting bank that every bank is the same,'' said Mr. Pandit.
In a sign that the bank's balance sheet is gradually strengthening, Citigroup said its Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III accords increased to 7.9 percent in the second quarter, up from 7.2 percent in the first quarter. Under Basel I, which is currently in effect, Tier 1 common equals 12.7 percent. The ratio, a measure of the bank's ability to absorb losses, is closely watched by investors, especially since the Federal Reserve turned down a proposal by the bank to raise its dividend earlier this year because of capital concerns.
Citigroup's dividend, now at just one cent per quarter, is expected to eventually be raised, but not before 2013.
Like other large banks, Citigroup is trimming its ranks, with total employees worldwide falling by 2,000 - to 261,000 from 263,000 - in the last three months, but Mr. Gerspach said he did not foresee ''massive'' job cuts.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Beijing's Censors Could Test the Mettle of Iron Man

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The state film censors in Beijing can be a prickly lot. They prefer to see foreign films that have a rosy view of the mainland and heroic Chinese actors - which could spell trouble for the upcoming "Iron Man 3" and its evil comic-book fiend the Mandarin. Hollywood studios have already edited and rewritten some major films to please the censors. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - They're known to be a prickly lot, the film censors in Beijing who select the 34 foreign films that can be shown in China each year. When China is the setting for a film, they want the nation to be shown as wholesome, industrious, upbeat. Better still if there's some derring-do, with heroic Communist scientists working furiously to save civilization. That kind of thing.
So getting an evil Chinese character like the Mandarin past the government cinema police could prove to be a challenge for the makers of "Iron Man 3," which is scheduled for release next spring. 
(Forget for now the casting choice that has the Mandarin being played by a non-Chinese actor who's also a Commander of the British Empire. We'll address that in a forthcoming episode, er, blog post.)
If the Mandarin stays in character and gets some decent screen time in the next installment of the Iron Man franchise, he's going to be a tough sell to the censors. His Marvel Comics biography says he's a Chinese national with a long history of violent throwdowns with Tony Stark. Fond of kidnapping, he has magical rings, an interceptor ray and a killer satellite at his disposal. From time to time he has employed the Heart of Darkness and the Eye of Yin. He also has a jet car. 
In spite of all that firepower, things could look bleak for the Mandarin. When Beijing's censors took a dislike to a bald and bearded Chinese pirate - played by the splendid Chow Yun-fat, no less - they made him walk the filmic plank: He was edited out of the version of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" that was shown in China. (It probably didn't help that his character was renowned as the lord of the South China Sea, an area of high political tension for China in recent years.)
The censorati even reject TV shows if they feature time travel. My colleague David Barboza that the guidelines also discourage dramas that "casually make up myths, have monstrous and weird plots, use absurd tactics, and even promote feudalism, superstition, fatalism and reincarnation." 
The Los Angeles Times recently wrote about a number of changes made to major Hollywood films to appease the Communist censors. A scene of laundry hanging outside in Shanghai was cut from "Mission: Impossible III." Scenes from a shootout in Chinatown were whacked from "Men in Black 3." In a remake of "Red Dawn," Chinese invaders targeting the United States were digitally turned into North Koreans. 
These artistic compromises carry a financial logic. The Chinese movie market, even with its restrictions, is seen as increasingly vital for Hollywood filmmakers: It's now the world's second-largest market, after North America. A story this month in The Economist crunched some of the numbers: 
China's film market grew to more than $2 billion in 2011 (North America's was $10 billion). But the 81 Chinese films released in the first five months of 2012 had a market share of only around 30 percent, whereas the 34 foreign films took over 65 percent. James Cameron's "Titanic 3D" remains China's highest-grossing film of 2012 so far, raking in around $160 million.
One film-industry expert said Chinese moviegoers can bump a film's box-office receipts by as much as $50 million. 
With fewer than three dozen foreign films allowed onto mainland screens each year, there is tremendous competition among studios and filmmakers to get on the approved list. They do this by pleasing (or not offending) the censors in Beijing. Hence the edits and the rewrites.
Highly skilled Chinese engineers were written into "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen," according to The Los Angeles Times, even though no such characters were in the original book. In the disaster movie "2012," the U.S. president's chief of staff "extolled the Chinese as visionaries after an ark built by the country's scientists" was used to rescue mankind, the paper wrote. 
"Meanwhile, Chinese bad guys are vanishing - literally," the Times piece said. "Western studios are increasingly inclined to excise potentially negative references to China in the hope that the films can pass muster with Chinese censors."
It will certainly help "Iron Man 3" that it's being co-produced and partly funded by a well-connected company in China, the Beijing-based DMG Entertainment. (Marvel Studios and Disney are the film's other partners.) 
And some of the scenes will be "set" in China.
The film's director, Shane Black, said at the Comic-Con gathering in San Diego last week that Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and the other principal actors would not be working in China, as had been rumored. Instead, a "plate crew" will travel to China to film atmospheric footage and background scenes that will be inserted behind the actors in post-production.
"Basically we're setting aspects of the film in China," Mr. Black said, "but we won't be filming in China."
Rob Steffens, a Marvel Studios executive, said the China settings "will enhance the appeal and relevance of our characters in China's fast-growing film marketplace."

HEADLINE: For Rajasthan's Farmers, a Rare Victory

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Demand for Guar, a bean used in natural gas drilling, brings an economic boom. 

 BODY:
A hard little bean has helped score "a rare victory for the littlest of the little guys in global trade," Gardiner Harris wrote in The New York Times from Lordi, India. 
An increase in guar prices "is helping to transform this part of the state of Rajasthan in northwestern India, one of the world's poorest places," he wrote. "Tractor sales are soaring, land prices are increasing and weddings have grown even more colorful."
"Now we have enough food, and we have a house made of stone," farmer Sohan Singh said proudly while his rail-thin children stared in awe. 
Guar, a modest bean so hard that it can crack teeth, has become an unlikely global player, and dirt-poor farmers like Mr. Singh have suddenly become a crucial link in the energy production of the United States.
For centuries, farmers here used guar to feed their families and their cattle. There are better sources of nutrition, but few that grow in the Rajasthani desert, a land rich in culture but poor in rain. Broader commercial interest in guar first developed when food companies found that it absorbs water like a souped-up cornstarch, and a powdered form of the bean is now widely used to thicken ice cream and keep pastries crisp.
But much more important to farmers here was the recent discovery that guar could stiffen water so much that a mixture is able to carry sand sideways into wells drilled by horizontal fracturing, also known as fracking.
The fracking boom in the United States has led to a surge in natural gas production, a decline in oil imports and a gradual transition away from coal-fired power plants. Fracking may also have spoiled some rural water supplies and caused environmental damage in parts of the United States, but it is hard to find anyone in Rajasthan who sees fracking as anything but a blessing.

HEADLINE: Regulators and HSBC Are Faulted by Senate

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The global bank has been used by Mexican drug cartels, by Saudi Arabian banks with terrorist ties and by Iranians who wanted to circumvent sanctions, a Senate report says. 

 BODY:
The global bank HSBC has been used by Mexican drug cartels looking to get cash back into the United States, by Saudi Arabian banks that needed access to dollars despite their terrorist ties and by Iranians who wanted to circumvent United States sanctions, a Senate report says.
The 335-page report released Monday also says that executives at HSBC and regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ignored warning signs and failed to stop the illegal behavior at many points between 2001 and 2010.
In one case, an HSBC executive successfully argued that the bank should resume business with a Saudi Arabian bank, Al Rajhi Bank, despite the fact that Al Rajhi's founder had been an early benefactor of Al Qaeda. HSBC's American branch ended up supplying a billion dollars to the bank.
 The report is the product of a yearlong investigation by a Senate subcommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It points to the problems at HSBC, Europe's largest financial institution, as indicators of a broader problem of illegal money flowing through international financial institutions into the United States.
"Banks that ignore money laundering rules are a big problem for our country," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the subcommittee. "Also troubling is a bank regulator that does not adequately do its job." He called HSBC's compliance culture "pervasively polluted for a long time." 
HSBC executives are expected to apologize for shortcomings in the bank's internal controls in a hearing of the subcommittee on Tuesday. The company said in a statement on Monday that "we will apologize, acknowledge these mistakes, answer for our actions and give our absolute commitment to fixing what went wrong."
Mr. Levin, however, said on Monday that HSBC had promised to fix similar problems in years past and failed. "While the bank is saying all the right things, and that is fine, it has said all the right things before," he said.
The hearing is unlikely to be the end of HSBC's problems. The bank has disclosed in regulatory filings that the issues with money laundering are also being investigated by the Department of Justice and could lead to criminal charges and "significant" fines, which analysts have said could reach $1 billion.
The report on HSBC is the latest of several scandals that have recently rocked global banks and highlighted the inability of regulators to catch what is claimed to be widespread wrongdoing in the financial industry. The British bank Barclays recently admitted that its traders tried to manipulate a crucial global interest rate, and multiple major banks are under investigation. JPMorgan Chase disclosed last week that its employees may have tried to hide trades that are likely to cost the bank billions of dollars.
Mr. Levin said that wrongdoing in the financial world has been exacerbated by the relatively light touch of government regulators. "As long as a bank just sees that it is going to be dealt with kid gloves, I think we are going to continue to see these shortfalls that have been so endemic," Mr. Levin said.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has come under particularly harsh criticism for showing too much deference to the banks it regulates. The new leader of the agency, Thomas J. Curry, has promised a stricter approach since he took over in April.
Mr. Curry said in a statement on Monday that members of his staff "fully embrace" the subcommittee's report, and he is expected to testify Tuesday that the agency is already carrying out many of the report's recommendations.
Regulators have been paying close attention to the willingness of global banks to facilitate illegal flows of money from outside the United States. The Treasury Department announced last month that ING Bank had agreed to pay $619 million to settle charges that it moved money into the United States from Cuba and Iran, despite sanctions against those countries, for nearly two decades. Since 2009, there have been five similar settlements between American regulators and other banks, including Barclays and Credit Suisse, over illicit transactions.
In the Senate report, HSBC is facing accusations that it helped its clients circumvent rules intended to stop transactions from countries facing international sanctions, and in some cases flouted laws in pursuit of profits.
While HSBC is accused of moving money into the United States from North Korea and Cuba, the most extensive problems involved accounts in Iran. An independent audit, paid for by HSBC, found that the bank facilitated 25,000 questionable payments involving Iran between 2001 and 2007. In some cases, HSBC executives counseled Iranian financial institutions on how to evade the filters of American regulators, the report says.
When the bank developed a way to process transactions for Iran's largest retail bank, an HSBC executive wrote an e-mail to his colleagues that said, "I wish to be on the record as not comfortable with this piece of business." None of his colleagues responded and the deal went ahead, according to the report.
The subcommittee also found evidence of widespread wrongdoing in HSBC's failure to stop money laundering through accounts tied to drug trafficking in Mexico. The bank is accused of shipping $7 billion in cash from Mexico to the United States in 2007 and 2008 despite several warnings that the money was coming from cartels that needed a way to return their profits to the United States.
In many of the cases detailed in the report, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is said to have spotted the problematic behavior. But in nearly every case, the subcommittee found that the agency gave HSBC only a warning or mild punishment and did not push the bank to make large-scale changes.
The agency ultimately issued a cease-and-desist order against HSBC in 2010 after other law enforcement agencies began looking into the problems. Mr. Levin, though, said that his subcommittee found that some of the problems had not been fixed by the time the subcommittee began looking into them over the last year.
A new chief executive took over at HSBC early last year and he has committed to making sweeping changes at the company. In its statement, the bank laid out several steps it had recently taken to increase oversight of international flows of money.

HEADLINE: Underpinnings of Greek Tragedy in Israel

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN and DAVID FURST


HIGHLIGHT: Adi Nes explores issues of Israeli identity and masculinity in his work. His latest project, "The Village," is on display at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York. 

 BODY:
Adi Nes is an outsider. He is a Sephardic Jewish gay artist.
He is an outsider in Israel, a country that was forged by a people who, during two millenniums of diaspora, were outsiders.
Mr. Nes remembers his mother singing to him when he was a child growing up in the Israeli development city Kiryat Gat. Often, the lyrics told idealized tales of the pioneers of modern day Israel.
Even at an early age, it was clear to Mr. Nes that he and his family did not match this ideal. His parents were Sephardic Jews who had emigrated from Iran. He grew up among many darker-skinned children who looked different than the Ashkenazi Jews, of Eastern-European descent, that dominated popular culture.
"When Israel was established, pioneers wanted to create an image of a man that is very different than the weak Jew from the diaspora," he said. "The kids that lived in the villages that surrounded Kiryat Gat fit the idea of what was Zionist."
As he grew up, he searched for a place to belong. But as a gay man, he always felt a little like a stranger in a mainstream Israeli culture that he saw as promoting the ideal of the macho Israeli settler or soldier.
"It's a position that I will always be stuck in, first of all because I'm a photographer and a photographer will always be outside," Mr. Nes said. "But it comes from my childhood: if you are growing up as the outsider, you will always keep this position in life. The only place where I am not an outsider is in my own family, with my partner and four children."
Mr. Nes, 47, has explored issues of Israeli identity and masculinity in his photographic work by creating visual tableaux that are often influenced by art history and philosophy. He takes ordinary Israelis, and the occasional actor, and poses them as if he were both cinematographer and screenwriter.
His most recent project, "The Village" is on display at the Jack Shainman Gallery through July 28. With "The Village," he returns to the vision of Israel that his mother sang about. But beneath the surface, this version is no longer so ideal.
The village, he says, is like a dream that is bigger and better than life but also has "a layer of fears and horrors and things that are bad."
"The country started with a dream, and then more and more, we decided to ignore the dreams," he said. "I'm trying to bring myself back to the dream without forgetting the reality."
There is an overlay of Greek tragedy in Mr. Nes's village.
"There is a specific routine in every Greek tragedy. Someone is doing something in his life, repeats the sin of pride, of hubris, then he's punished and he suffers. And the moment he suffers, this is the moment that he's changed, or the viewer of the tragedy is changed. "
Mr. Nes's most famous image, "The Last Supper Before Going Out to Battle" () from his "Soldier" series, shows young male soldiers arrayed along a table as if they were in Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper." In 2007, a print sold at auction for $264,000.
The soldier series came out of his time in the Israeli army. He was a "fragile and sensitive child in the periphery," who finally became part of a society when he entered the army. "I felt like I was married together to the men that served with me," he said.
A later experience as a reserve duty guard in a Palestinian detention house made him feel a lot less comfortable and left him disillusioned. It also led to the series "The Prisoners" (). As a guard, he befriended one of the prisoners and realized that there was no way he would shoot his friend if he tried to escape.
During a deep recession in Israel, in 2002, Mr. Nes started a series in which he recreated biblical scenes using homeless people.
When he began "Biblical Stories," he had recently ended a long-term relationship and was in the midst of a midlife crisis. He questioned whether he should continue to live and work in Israel. By now, Mr. Nes was successful enough as an artist to have a career in New York or Paris. But he realized that he couldn't move because so much of his art dealt with Israeli identity.
"I can't just take pictures outside of Israel when this is my main subject," he said.
When he looked around him, he noticed that Israel, too, was "having a very deep identity crisis." He wondered why Israeli Jews choose to stay. Was it ethnicity? Religion? A connection to the land or an obligation to each other?
He used the Bible as a sort of spinal cord of Israeli society, creating contemporary representations of Abraham and Isaac, Cain and Abel, Ruth and Naomi, and Job.
After 20 years of creating these fictional visual narratives, Mr. Nes has come to the conclusion that all the strands of his existence form his art - and all the layers that exist in his art - exist inside of him.
After all, he is a Sephardic gay man who grew up in a development town, as well as a photographer and artist.
He is an outsider. And an Israeli - which is sometimes difficult for him to define.
"It's really hard to tell what is Israeli because there's not one voice that covers everything," Mr. Nes said. "If you are looking from the inside, you will see a different thing than you will see from the outside. If you are looking from a political point of view, from the tension between the Palestinians and Israelis, you will find one answer. If you look from the historical point of view, or the Holocaust point of view, from Europe or the U.S., you'll find different answers."

HEADLINE: How Much Gentrification Is Happening in the Bronx?

BYLINE: DAN KEDMEY


HIGHLIGHT: An influx of new residents has stoked fears that the Bronx would become the next Brooklyn. But a deeper look suggests that the fears of gentrification are overstated. 

 BODY:
Last week in the magazine, Adam Davidson looked for signs of an economic revival in the Bronx, the poorest urban county in the nation. Online commenters on Davidson's article were especially vocal in response to the question, "Why Can't the Bronx Be More Like Brooklyn?" Affordable rents have attracted a new wave of migrants to the borough. More than 16,000 Manhattanites moved to the Bronx between 2005 and 2009, making it the most popular destination for New Yorkers on the move. The influx of new residents has stoked fears that the Bronx would become another beachhead for wealthy, white-collar professionals in search of the next Brooklyn.
But a deeper look at who is moving to the Bronx suggests that the fears of gentrification are overstated. Nearly 80 percent of new migrants have no bachelor's degree; 73 percent are ethnic minorities; 44 percent live below the poverty line. Unlike the other boroughs adjacent to Manhattan, the Bronx has absorbed only a trickle of gentrifiers, and a tide of urban poor. Read the full column to find out why the Bronx can't (and shouldn't) become another Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Government Spending and the Economy

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: A federal stimulus program that devoted more of its funds to consumption and investment spending would have done more to increase economic growth and might, perhaps, have quieted critics on both sides of the aisle, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In a recent post, my colleague Casey Mulligan, who has been a critic of federal stimulus spending, made an important point about that spending - whether it is stimulative or not depends vitally on its composition. Government purchases - consumption and investment spending - add to growth, he said, but transfer payments do not. I wish to examine this point further.
To begin with, all data on economic growth come from something called the National Income and Product Accounts, a large, complex and interconnected accounting of everything we can measure that affects growth. The summary statistic that comes from this data is the gross domestic product. It has its faults, to be sure, but it is the best single figure we have to tell us how well we are doing, economically.
The principal categories that constitute G.D.P. are personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, government consumption and investment (federal, state and local), and net exports (exports minus imports). 
A change in any one of these categories has the same effect on G.D.P. as a change in any other. Thus, $1 of spending by individuals is the same as $1 of investment by businesses, $1 of exports or $1 less of imports, or $1 of either consumption or investment at any level of government.

I want to concentrate on the government category. The first thing to notice is that only consumption or investment spending adds to growth. But much government spending does not fall into this category. It consists of transfer payments - that is, taking money from one group of people and giving it to another. Interest payments on debts and subsidies to businesses are other major categories of government spending.
Much of consumption spending is for salaries to government employees but also includes various goods and services purchased and consumed by governments. Investment spending consists of public works and long-lived assets like Navy ships and Air Force bombers.
If we look at 2011, we see that nominal G.D.P. was $15,094 billion. Of this, the vast bulk was personal consumption: $10,726 billion. Investment was $1,916.2 billion. Exports were $1,473.4 billion. Subtracting imports of $2,664.2 billion yields a negative net export figure of $578.7 billion. Government consumption and investment at all levels was $3,030.6 billion, or 56 percent of total government spending of $5,409.9 billion. 
Breaking down government spending's contribution to G.D.P. further, we see that the federal government added $1,232.9 billion and state and local governments added $1,797.7 billion. Of the federal component, $824.9 billion was for military spending and $407.9 billion for nonmilitary purposes. Federal aid to state and local governments is netted out to avoid double counting.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the division of the Commerce Department that collects the NIPA data, calculates the contribution of each component of G.D.P. to its real (inflation-adjusted) growth rate:
Government's role in economic growth turned negative in 2011 because of budget cuts, subtracting more than four-tenths of a percentage point from the real G.D.P. growth rate. Federal consumption and investment spending for both military and nonmilitary purchases fell in real terms relative to 2010, and cutbacks at the state and local level were especially severe, as teachers and other workers suffered layoffs, which subtracted almost three-tenths of a percentage point from real G.D.P. growth.
With this framework for analysis, we can examine how the stimulus program enacted in February 2009 has affected the economy.
According to the federal Web site that tracks stimulus programs, $763.1 billion of the original $840 billion program has been disbursed. Of this, $297.8 billion, or 39 percent, went to tax cuts, like the Making Work Pay tax credit. Another $236.7 billion, or 31 percent, went for various contracts, grants and loans. And $228.6 billion, or 30 percent, went for transfer payments.
Thus we see that most of the stimulus was unlikely to ever have had much impact on growth. Transfers and tax credits only raise growth if they cause individuals and businesses to increase their consumption or investment spending. Undoubtedly they did to some extent. 
But studies have long shown that people's spending is largely a function of what they view as their "permanent income." Temporary increases tend to be saved and thus do not add to spending or growth. Keep in mind also that the federal deficit constitutes negative saving, which offsets any increase in saving resulting from deficit-financed tax cuts or transfers.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis has put stimulus outlays into a NIPA framework. As of March 31, $452.6 billion of net stimulus funds had been disbursed in ways that show up in the national income accounts. Of this, the vast bulk, $399.7 billion, went for transfer payments. Another $9.6 billion went for subsidies and $68.1 billion for capital transfers to state and local governments. Only $37.8 billion went for consumption and $11.8 billion for investment - the only two categories of outlays that we know add to growth. 
Thus it appears that only 11 percent of total stimulus outlays definitely added to growth; the rest may have had no effect at all.
I think that much of the criticism of the stimulus legislation on both sides of the political spectrum has been misplaced. Liberals tend to decry the small overall size of the original package, while conservatives say it was too big. But perhaps the very limited allocation for investment and consumption was the problem.
Potentially, we could have had a smaller program that was far more concentrated on consumption and investment spending that would have given us more "bang for the buck," done more to raise growth at a lower budgetary cost, and maybe made both sides happy.

HEADLINE: Decoupled and Divided

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: About that "attack on capitalism". 

 BODY:
And so, predictably, Romney is accusing Obama of "attacking capitalism" and "dividing America" by raising questions about Bain and those hidden tax returns. This is all par for the course; many of us remember how any criticism of Bush was unpatriotic, and if I recall correctly, during the dotcom bubble the Wall Street Journal argued that any skepticism about stock market valuations showed a lack of faith in free markets.
The special Romney twist-- aside from the willful misrepresentation of what Obama actually said about business success -- is Mitt's desire to have it both ways. He's proud of his business record and his success, he says, but at the same time wants us to believe that he had nothing to do with Bain's actions over a three-year period when he was still its CEO, and is completely unwilling to let us see the tax returns that would tell us something about exactly how he achieved his current wealth. (There are two competing theories about his tax stonewalling. One is that he had one or more years of zero taxes. The other is that he actually made a lot of money in 2009, because he shorted the market. We may never know which is true.)
Anyway, just a reminder about what's really dividing America: the fact that a rising tide no longer raises all boats. Remember what the CBO told us:
And there has been a dramatic decoupling between overall economic growth and the fortunes of the typical family:
It's not an "attack on capitalism" to suggest that growing income disparities and the corresponding failure of most Americans to benefit from rising productivity are problems. Still, what can be done? Well, you can ask the rich to pay somewhat higher taxes, and you can strengthen the safety net -- which is what Obama actually advocates. But Romney wants to do the reverse.
So Romney wants us to celebrate the success of people like him, even though their success doesn't seem to have benefited ordinary families, and even though he stands for policies that would aggravate the gap between a fortunate few and everyone else. And then he accuses Obama of dividing America.

HEADLINE: Bank of England Chief Denies New York Fed Gave Warning on Rate-Rigging

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that there was "no suggestion of fraudulent behavior" in an e-mail in 2008 from Timothy F. Geithner, then chief of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

 BODY:
8:05 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON - Senior British officials said on Tuesday that they did not receive warnings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York about possible rate-rigging during the financial crisis of 2008.
Speaking to a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday, Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, said discussions with American authorities had instead focused on ways to improve the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. 
Timothy F. Geithner, who then ran the New York Fed, sent an e-mail to Mr. King in June 2008 that outlined reforms to the Libor system. They included recommendations that British officials "strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure" and "eliminate incentive to misreport," according to documents released last week.
 Mr. King said the correspondence with Mr. Geithner, who is now the United States Treasury secretary, did not represent a warning about potential illegal activity related to Libor.
"At no stage did he or anyone else at the New York Fed raise any concerns with the Bank that they had seen any wrongdoing," Mr. King told the parliamentary committee on Tuesday. "There was no suggestion of fraudulent behavior."
Mr. King also provided additional detail about his discussions with Mr. Geithner concerning Libor. 
The two men met in Basel, Switzerland, in May 2008 during a regular meeting of central bankers from the world's leading economies. During a conversation, Mr. King said he had asked Mr. Geithner to submit suggestions about potential changes to the Libor system, according to Mr. King's testimony on Tuesday. 
The discussion was followed by several phone calls between Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and William C. Dudley, the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who was the executive vice president of its markets group at the time of the discussions.
Mr. King said the New York Fed did not share internal memorandums, which questioned whether international banks were accurately reporting their Libor submissions. American authorities began collecting information as early as 2007 about potential problems with the rate-setting process.
"Our contacts at Libor contributing banks have indicated a tendency to underreport actual borrowing costs," New York Fed officials wrote in one of the memos, "to limit the potential for speculation about the institutions' liquidity problems."
Mr. King said some of the recommendations about changes to Libor that Mr. Geithner had sent in 2008 were included in a report by the British Bankers' Association, the trade body that oversees the rate. The industry association released a review in late 2008 that outlined changes to the Libor process.
"At no stage did the New York Fed express any concerns about the final outcome," Mr. King told the parliamentary committee.
Senior British officials said they did not believe the New York Fed's recommendations were a warning that Libor was being manipulated, according to Mr. Tucker of the Bank of England, the country's central bank. Suggestions from American authorities included how to "eliminate incentive to misreport" Libor submissions, as well as expanding the number of international banks that participated in the rate-setting process.
The recommendations "didn't set off alarm bells," Mr. Tucker said on Tuesday.
Mr. Tucker's role in the rate-manipulation scandal was again questioned after new e-mails were released on Tuesday that detailed his discussions with Robert E. Diamond Jr., former chief executive of Barclays. 
Documents from Barclays and government authorities show that the Bank of England official called Mr. Diamond in October 2008 to discuss the firm's funding position at the height of the financial crisis. Regulators said Jerry del Missier, a top Barclays executive, later misinterpreted that conversation as an instruction from the British central bank to lower the firm's Libor submissions.
The new e-mails released by the Bank of England show that Mr. Tucker had written to Mr. Diamond about Libor as earlier as May, 2008. 
The documents also illustrate a close relationship between Mr. Diamond and the government official. After it was announced that Mr. Tucker would become deputy governor of the Bank of England in December 2008, Mr. Diamond e-mailed to congratulate him: "Well done, man. I am really, really proud of you," Mr. Diamond wrote.
Mr. Tucker was equally friendly in his response. "Thanks so much Bob. You've been an absolute brick through this," he said in an e-mail reply.
British lawmakers also questioned the senior officials on Tuesday about the steps that led to Mr. Diamond's resignation this month. The British bank agreed to a $450 million settlement in June in connection with the manipulation of Libor.
Two days after the settlement was announced, Adair Turner, chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority, talked to Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, about whether Mr. Diamond was the right person to lead the bank.
The Financial Services Authority had previously raised concerns about the bank's corporate culture, and Mr. Turner said there were questions about whether Mr. Diamond was the most appropriate individual to lead the changes in governance inside Barclays.
The conversation was followed by a discussion between Mr. King and Mr. Agius on July 2, during which Mr. King said Mr. Diamond no longer had the support of the Financial Services Authority.
After the discussion, Mr. Agius held a conference call with the bank's nonexecutive directors, who decided to ask Mr. Diamond to resign. 
"If Bob Diamond had stayed on," Mr. Turner told the parliamentary committee on Tuesday, "I strongly suspect that it would have been to the disadvantage of shareholders as well."

Marissa Mayer of Google Takes the Helm at Yahoo | Marissa Mayer starts on Tuesday as the new chief executive of Yahoo, after spending 13 years shaping some of Google's most popular products. She faces a daunting challenge.
Ms. Mayer, Yahoo's fifth leader in less than a year, is charged with turning around a company that pioneered the technology industry in the 1990s but recently has been trying to remain relevant. Yahoo missed innovations in search and social media, falling behind its rivals Google and Facebook. Even though Yahoo's audience remains sizable, the company has struggled to define a distinct strategy.
The appointment makes Ms. Mayer one of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley and corporate America. One of Google's earliest employees, she was behind the way users interacted with Gmail, Google News and Google Images, but she did not have a clear path to the upper echelons of the company.
In an interview with DealBook, Ms. Mayer said Yahoo was "one of the best brands on the Internet." She recalled that when she started at Google, the company would conduct user surveys and "people didn't understand the difference between Yahoo and the Internet." DealBook 
Mayer Looks to Bring Advertisers Back to Yahoo | The New York Times reports: "While Facebook and Google enjoy a 16.8 percent and a 16.5 percent share of the online display ad market in the United States this year, Yahoo's share has fallen to 9.1 percent - a big drop from 2008, when the company's share of the market stood at 18.4 percent - according to eMarketer." new york times

Goldman's Earnings Fell 12% in Second Quarter | Goldman Sachs reported on Tuesday that its profit fell 12 percent in the second quarter, as the investment bank continued to grapple with a moribund economy.
The Wall Street firm reported $927 million in earnings applicable to common shareholders. That amounts to $1.78 a share, which still beat the average analyst estimate of $1.13 a share.
The firm was bolstered by an improvement in its core fixed-income trading business, where revenue rose 37 percent, to $2.2 billion, from the period a year earlier. But many of Goldman's other operations, including advising companies on takeovers and equity and debt offerings, continued to decline. DealBook

HEADLINE: After Barclays Scandal, Regulators Say Rates Remain Flawed

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: In Congressional testimony, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission expressed concern that big banks manipulated certain interest rates for their own gain. 

 BODY:
9:06 p.m. | Updated 
Federal authorities cast further doubt on Tuesday about the integrity of a key interest rate that is the subject of a growing investigation into wrongdoing at big banks around the globe.
In Congressional testimony, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission expressed concern that banks had manipulated interest rates for their own gain. They also indicated that flaws in the system - which were highlighted in a recent enforcement case against Barclays - persist.
"If these key benchmarks are not based on honest submissions, we all lose,"Gary Gensler, head of the trading commission, which led the investigation into Barclays, said in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee.
In separate testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he lacked "full confidence" in the accuracy of the rate-setting process.
The Fed faces questions itself over whether it should have reined in the rate-manipulation scheme, which took place from at least 2005 to 2010.
Documents released last week show that the New York Fed was well aware of potential problems at Barclays in 2008. At a hearing in London on Tuesday, British authorities said the New York Fed never told them Barclays was breaking the law.
The scrutiny intensified on Tuesday as Representative Randy Neugebauer, chairman of the House subcommittee investigating the Libor scandal, announced plans to seek additional documents from the New York Fed about JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the three American banks involved in setting interest rates.
The concerns center on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, an essential benchmark that affects the cost of borrowing for consumers and corporations. Trillions of dollars in mortgages and other financial products are tied to Libor, which is set daily based on reports from a panel of large banks.
Several government agencies, including authorities in the United States, Canada, Britain and Japan, are examining whether the banks made bogus reports.
Last month, Barclays agreed to settle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department and the Financial Services Authority of Britain for $450 million. The British bank was accused of reporting false rates that both bolstered its profits and projected an overly rosy image of its health during the financial crisis.
"The conduct occurred regularly and was pervasive," Mr. Gensler said on Tuesday.
The actions also happened in plain view of regulators.
In 2008, Barclays informed the New York Fed that it was submitting artificially low rates. The concerns were passed on toTimothy F. Geithner, then the chief executive of the regulatory body.
But the New York Fed did not tell other authorities in the United States or Europe about the specific problems at Barclays. Instead, it proposed changes to the rate-setting process. At the time, Mr. Geithner recommended in an e-mail that British officials "strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure" and "eliminate incentive to misreport," according to documents released last week.
"At no stage did he or anyone else at the New York Fed raise any concerns with the bank that they had seen any wrongdoing," Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, told a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Geithner.
Mr. King said his discussion with Mr. Geithner did not represent a warning sign about potential illegal activity.
"There was no suggestion of fraudulent behavior," the British central bank official told Parliament. His colleague Paul Tucker, who also received the e-mail from Mr. Geithner, echoed his statements, saying in testimony that the recommendations "didn't set off alarm bells."
Rather, the British central bank passed along the proposed changes to the British Bankers' Association, a trade group that oversees the rate.
In his testimony on Tuesday, Mr. King said that some of the New York Fed's recommendations were included in a Libor review conducted by the trade group.
The British Bankers' Association also sought feedback from the CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange, according to documents provided to The New York Times. In a July 2008 letter, the exchange argued that the plan "must have teeth" and "credibility."
In late 2008, the British Bankers' Association adopted changes to the Libor process. But neither the regulators nor the trade group put a stop to Barclays' illegal activities, which continued through 2009.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke issued a broad defense of the Fed's actions in 2008 after it learned that banks were misrepresenting interest rates.
"Isn't there a responsibility to alert the customers?" SenatorJeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Banking Committee, asked Mr. Bernanke. "If you had it to do over again, would you also be alerting the customers?"
Mr. Bernanke said it was hardly a secret that Libor was losing credibility. During the financial crisis, the media and the markets were swirling with speculation about problems with the rate-setting process. At the time, the Fed was primarily focused on saving Wall Street from collapse.
"The responsibility of the New York Fed was to make sure that the appropriate authorities had the information, which they did," Mr. Bernanke said.
The Barclays case was the first to stem from the broader global investigation, which involves more than 10 other banks, including UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland. While much scrutiny has focused on European banks, authorities are also investigating big Wall Street companies like Citigroup and JPMorgan.
Mr. Gensler on Tuesday said his agency "has and will continue vigorously to use our enforcement and regulatory authorities to protect the public, promote market integrity, and ensure that these benchmarks and other indices are free of manipulative conduct and false information."
Banks, Mr. Gensler said, "must not attempt to influence" Libor. "It's just wrong and against the law."
But the problems may remain, say regulators. On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke said the benchmark still lacked credibility.
"It's clear beyond these disclosures that the Libor system is structurally flawed," he told lawmakers.

HEADLINE: Drilling Down: Jared Bernstein Says Small Businesses Are Not Overtaxed

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: An economist argues that the best thing the president and congress could do for small businesses right now is to provide them with economically healthier customers. 

 BODY:
This week's Dashboard roundup of small-business news includes a link to a blog post by Jared Bernstein, the former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden who is now a senior fellow at a Washington research group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mr. Bernstein's post argues that Americans are not as overtaxed as some may think. We decided to follow up with Mr. Bernstein to ask him about small businesses and taxes. A condensed version of the conversation follows.
Q.
A.
Of course it's often a burden on a business -- or a household, or a dog or a cat -- to increase their tax payments. And smaller businesses have less insulation - typically less cash reserves, less access to credit markets or export markets - from such increases. But there are two key issues that are overlooked. 
First, remember, it's only the income above the $250,000 threshold that's facing a higher tax rate. If your business income -- and we're mostly talking pass-throughs here -- is $255,000, it's not that whole sum that faces the higher rate, it's the $5,000 above $250,000. So if the top rate goes from 35 percent to about 40 percent, which is what's on the table, that's $250 in new taxes.
Second, as my blog post emphasized, in historical terms, households and businesses are paying less in taxes than they have in decades. I'm sure it doesn't feel that way - this remains a tough economy. And I'm sure there are exceptions. But the data are very clear on this point.
Finally, let's not forget that we're talking about less than 3 percent of small businesses here, so I'm not sure about your framing of the question: " small businesses."
Q.
A.
As an economist, I try to answer such questions by looking at the research, but there's surprisingly little research on this question. What there is I'd have to say isn't hugely convincing. I'm quite certain that the truth is this: If you're running a business and you need to hire another worker to meet increased demand for what it is you're producing - if not hiring that worker means you'll leave money on the table - than hire him or her you will.
I've worked for small businesses for most of my career and that's the way we've always treated hiring. Obviously, you never ignore your tax liabilities. But in the real world, they're not nearly as determinative as the D.C. debate would lead you to believe.
Q.
A.
Good question, and I'm actually about to put up a new post about that. The short answer is no -- because I don't believe the non-federal taxes have increased to offset the decline in the federal taxes. That's why so many states have been struggling with their budgets for so many years now.
Q.
A.
Of course. Just like lowering taxes is very clearly implicated in increasing deficits and debt. And yes, spending less has to be part of the solution too, but we've actually already taken such steps with over $2 trillion in spending cuts on the books -- though, as you might have guessed, Congress is trying to unravel them before they even take place. House Republicans, for example, have voted to reverse the defense cuts.
Business owners should care for the same reason anyone should care -- small-business owners are people, too! -- and then a few other reasons. We can't keep up our national public infrastructure on the historically low levels of revenue we're collecting, and that's bad for business productivity and customer access. I'd include public education as a key public good here, and businesses benefit a great deal from a better-educated work force.
Q.
A.
Given the magnitude of increases we're contemplating, definitely not. The research is quite clear on this point. Just think back to the Clinton years, since that's the tax regime I'd like to see us return to. Those were much stronger growth years for G.D.P., jobs, business formation, incomes and wages than the George W. Bush years, though taxes were a lot lower in the latter case.
Q.
A.
Basically, I think we have this question pretty much backwards, and I think I know why. The best thing the president and congress can do for small businesses right now is to provide them with economically healthier customers, and that means more temporary jobs programs, at least until the private sector is firmly back up off the mat - ideas like state fiscal relief and infrastructure repairs.

HEADLINE: Is Romney Overreacting to Bain Attacks?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: There's still not much evidence that the Bain attacks have hurt Mitt Romney's standing with voters. But the Romney campaign's response could change that. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign has begun to push back against the notion that President Obama's critiques on his tenure at Bain Capital have damaged him. A memo released by Mr. Romney's pollster, Neil Newhouse, suggests that the margin between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama has been narrowing rather than widening in the polls despite the attacks.
I would take issue with the notion that the race has been tightening. Instead, once you remove the statistical noise from the polls, the trajectory looks roughly flat based on our analysis. Mr. Obama has maintained a narrow, but fairly consistent, lead of about 2 points over perhaps the last six to eight weeks.
But Mr. Obama's lead has also not been widening -- and I think Mr. Newhouse is correct that the evidence for the impact of the Bain attacks is rather thin, or at least has been up to this point.
At the same time, Mr. Romney's campaign has begun to behave as though the attacks are a fairly big deal. And it has backed into a more defensive posture that could change the nature of how they are perceived by the public going forward.
Mr. Obama's position over Mr. Romney is somewhat stronger than you might expect based on Mr. Obama's approval ratings -- but not necessarily as compared to his favorability ratings, which have usually shown that more Americans than not take a favorable view of him personally.
Is Mr. Obama's position stronger than it "should" be based on the tepid economic recovery -- another sign that Mr. Romney might be a below-average candidate? That is a more debatable case, because it is hard to know exactly how the public perceives the economy and assigns credit or blame to Mr. Obama for its performance. Various models published by economists and political scientists claim that Mr. Obama should be anything from a clear underdog to a clear favorite based on the country's economic performance.
Our economic model, which looks at a wider array of economic indicators than the other ones do, is a bit more equivocal. Essentially, it suggests that Mr. Obama's narrow lead in the polls is broadly consistent with the economy's lukewarm performance.
There are two things to keep in mind when interpreting this evidence. First, Mr. Obama's lead in the polls -- about 2 points -- would reflect a below-average performance for an incumbent. Since World War II, elected incumbent presidents have won by an average of 7.5 points when seeking a second term.
Second, the historical evidence seems quite definitive that the public reacts more to the change in economic performance -- that is, the rate of growth in crucial economic indicators in the year or so leading up to the election -- than to how strong the economy is in an absolute sense. Over the last 100 years, there has been literally no relationship between the unemployment rate on Election Day -- a measure of how completely the economy is fulfilling its productive potential -- and the election result.
But there have been positive and statistically significant relationships between the growth rate in the economy -- as measured by G.D.P., jobs, income and other indicators -- and the election result.
The recent rate of growth -- about 2 percent across an average of indicators, which is below average but not recessionary -- points to a below-average but not necessarily losing position for Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama may also be helped somewhat by the fairly low rate of inflation, which receives some weight in our model -- and, we think, also, in voters' perceptions about how the economy is performing. It's a little easier to adjust to a new but mediocre "normal" if grocery prices aren't rising every time you go to the supermarket. 
In short, there is no perfect way to measure the economy, let alone how voters react to it -- but the horse-race polls, at least, are not manifestly inconsistent with how voters have reacted to similar circumstances in the past. The notion that Mr. Romney is an underachieving candidate may be plausible, but there is not much proof of it.
Some polls have also asked voters directly what they think about Mr. Romney's business experience. The results vary depending on question wording, but some polls suggest that voters see it as being a roughly neutral factor overall.
A recent Washington Post / ABC News poll, for instance, found that about a quarter of voters thought that Mr. Romney's work in "buying and restructuring companies" was a major reason to support him, another quarter said it was a major reason to oppose him, and half said that it didn't make much difference.
It does not necessarily follow that Mr. Obama's Bain attacks have been fruitless. They may have succeeded in turning a positive attribute for Mr. Romney -- his business experience -- into a neutral one. And it may be that voters do view Bain Capital as something of a negative factor, but this is counterbalanced by other strengths they perceive in Mr. Romney.
Still, the case that they are a "game changer" has been pretty tenuous -- and it is hard to move the numbers in the first place in a partisan environment like this one. The vast majority of voters will make a decision based on their party affiliation, and many of those that don't will decide based on their views of the economy. Campaign strategies and personal attacks might shift the numbers by a point or so in either direction -- and in a close election like this one, that might make the difference. But they have an awful lot of partisan and economic gravity to escape.
In recent days, however, Mr. Romney's campaign has begun to behave like Bain Capital is more of a negative factor than a positive or even neutral one. Instead of pointing to successes like Staples -- and pointing out that some of Mr. Obama's claims about the outsourcing that has allegedly occurred at some other Bain investments is factually dubious -- they have instead begun to behave as though Bain Capital's track record is nothing to be proud of.
In going on all five major news networks in a set of interviews on Friday night, Mr. Romney claimed that he was not responsible for decisions that Bain Capital made from 1999 -- when he began to run the Salt Lake City Olympics -- to 2002, when he began to run for governor of Massachusetts. 
But voters may read between the lines in ways that Mr. Romney does not intend. If Mr. Romney is striving to avoid responsibility for whatever Bain Capital did from 1999 to 2002, it may suggest to them that some of the investments that Bain Capital made during this period were dubious. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Romney may find it harder to claim the moral high ground when the details of what Bain did are murky -- and Mr. Romney does not seem inclined to shed light on them, like by releasing more years of his tax returns. 
In other words, Mr. Romney has in some ways begun to ignore his pollsters' advice. Instead of being more forthright in his defense of Bain's activities -- a strategy that seemed to be roughly achieving a draw in the public's eyes -- he has been in damage-control mode, and has not necessarily been adroit at it.
That means it's at least worth watching the polls over the next couple of weeks to see whether the attacks become more damaging going forward. 
For the reasons I cited before -- relatively few members of the public are "persuadable," and they have many other matters to evaluate along with Bain Capital -- it would be an upset if there were a huge swing in the polls. There may well not be any measurable change at all. 
But if Mr. Romney does begin to run 4 or 5 points behind Mr. Obama in the polls -- rather than zero to 3 points behind, as he has in recent weeks -- that would be a sign that his strategy has backfired.

HEADLINE: July 17: Obama's Re-election Chances Fall on Gloomy G.D.P. Forecast

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Tuesday was an eclectic day for polling news, but one data point had the largest influence on our forecast: the latest edition of The Wall Street Journal's economic forecasting survey. 

 BODY:
Tuesday was a bit of an eclectic day for economic and polling news, but there was one data point that had the largest influence on our presidential forecast. That was the latest edition of The Wall Street Journal's economic forecasting survey, which showed more bearish projections for gross domestic product and other economic indicators. Economists now expect the below-average growth that the economy has been experiencing to continue for quite a while, with G.D.P. growing at a rate of about 2 percent into early 2013. The panel's previous projections had not been especially bullish, but had been closer to 2.5 percent.
The G.D.P. projections are one of seven economic variables that our model uses in its forecast; a couple of the others were also updated on Tuesday.
Inflation remains low: in fact, there was no inflation at all in June, as the decline in gas prices offset a modest increase in other goods. This is welcome news for consumers, but it did not immediately help Mr. Obama in our forecast because the model was already giving him the maximum amount of credit for the low inflation rate. (The model does not give "extra" credit to the incumbent candidate when the inflation rate is below 2 percent, since a 2 percent inflation rate is considered optimal by economists.)
There was also data out on industrial production on Tuesday, which showed a rebound in June after a decline in May. Industrial production has generally been fairly robust over the past year, and is one of the more emphatic signs that our economy - however tepid the recovery might be - is at least not in recession right now. However, since the trend in the industrial production numbers had already been favorable (excluding the poor May data point), the new numbers did not shift our model's economic index much.
On the polling front, there were new polls out in Iowa and New Hampshire that look superficially good for Mr. Obama - he held leads of five points and four points in those surveys. But in both cases, the pollster had shown a larger lead for Mr. Obama before. To some extent, this probably reflects reversion to the mean, especially in the case of the Iowa poll, in which Public Policy Polling had previously given Mr. Obama an implausible 10-point lead.
Overall, Mr. Obama's chances of winning the Electoral College declined to 66.8 percent in the forecast model, from 68.7 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: How to Be American

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Don't work in Chicago. Do avoid paying taxes. 

 BODY:
Because there are no important issues to discuss - the economy is fine, the war on terrorism has been won, the Euro zone is thriving, poverty, hunger and disease are no more- the Republicans have turned back to the all-important question of what it means to be a real American.
Not in the technical, birther movement sense. More in the abstract, House Un-American Activities vein.
In a conference call today with reporters, John Sununu, the former White House chief of staff, former New Hampshire governor and serial abuser of White House perks and corporate jets, called the Obama campaign a "bunch of liars," for raising questions about Mitt Romney's status at Bain after 1999.

Then he said, "I wish this president would learn how to be an American." Mr. Sununu elaborated on that statement a bit later, saying what he meant was that he wished Mr. Obama would adopt the "American formula" for economic policy and introduce an environment where "entrepreneurs can thrive." (Has Mr. Sununu been out to Silicon Valley recently?)
In another interview on Fox News, Mr. Sununu suggested that Mr. Obama "had no idea how the American system works" because "he spent his early years in Hawaii smoking something, and spent the next set of years in Indonesia." Mr. Sununu added that Mr. Obama worked in a "socialized structure" and entered politics in Chicago.
OK, let's review the criteria.
To be an American, you can't have smoked "something" at any point in Hawaii (it's not clear whether that applies to the rest of the country, or to all smokeable substances), you can't disagree with right-wing economic doctrine. And you can't work in Chicago.
Is there anything else?
According to Senator Lindsey Graham you use off-shore tax havens. "It's really American to avoid paying taxes, legally."
I'm calling my accountant.

HEADLINE: Lax Controls at Banks, or Systemic Rot?

BYLINE: SCOTT JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC officials will answer charges today that the bank helped drug cartels and terrorist groups evade U.S. banking laws, as RBS allegedly resists Canadian investigators. 

 BODY:
At what point will we start to ask, after digesting the details of each new banking scandal, "Next?" 
Readers could be forgiven for wondering after the latest jaw-dropping report on a bank's alleged misdeeds. 
Officials from HSBC, Europe's largest bank, will testify before the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday about whether the bank facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars in illicit funds. 
According to the panel's 335-page report, which was released on Monday, HSBC officials left open the way for the illegal transfers of huge sums of money by warring Mexican drug dealers, as well as Saudis with ties to terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda, and Iranians eager to bypass sanctions. 
And just as the new HSBC scandal comes to light, the now-old Libor scandal is widening. The latest turn involves the Royal Bank of Scotland refusing to cooperate with the Canadian authorities investigating the bank's possible role in the rate-setting scandal. The bank's lack of cooperation, given the fact that it is 82-percent owned by the British government, is gobsmacking, as they say.
RBS, one of more than 10 banks under scrutiny from authorities around the globe, is refusing to turn over crucial information to Canadian regulators, DealBook reports. 
DealBook also has chapter and verse on the HSBC scandal. U.S. investigators have been looking into HSBC for a year, and the bank is just the latest casualty in a string of investigations and sanctions. 
Last month two of Europe's largest financial institutions were forced to pay large fines for violations. London-based Barclays paid a $453 million settlement to U.S. regulators for manipulating interest rates, while the Dutch bank ING paid $619 million for violating the rules governing sanctions imposed on Cuba and Iran. Several other banks have also paid fines and more may be coming soon, Bloomberg reports. 
HSBC is being used as exhibit A in an ongoing effort by the Obama administration to shut down, or at least slow down, the use of global financial institutions as tax shelters, transit points and hiding spots for dirty, dangerous money. The report revealed that the bank's Mexico office transferred upwards of $7 billion in cash from so-called "casas de cambio" (exchange houses) to its U.S. offices over the course of 2007 and 2008 - transactions officials said would have been impossible unless they included a significant amount of illegal drug proceeds.
Parts of the report - including a mind-boggling section detailing how HSBC's Mexico staff ran a $2.1 billion subsidiary operation in the Cayman Islands for tens of thousands of customers with no staff and no offices - read more like a passage from a John Grisham novel than a government account: 
Two years later, in 2008, John Root, senior HSBC Group Compliance officer, rediscovered the 2006 audit when examining KYC (Know Your Customer) problems in the Cayman accounts. He wrote: "The real surprise was the existence of an HBMX audit in January 2006 on KYC for the USD Cayman accounts. It is not clear who in AML responded, and how. Blank looks all around." His supervisor, Mr. Bagley, later jokingly remarked to the Head of Group Audit for Latin America and the Caribbean, Graham Thomson: "I do find it surprising that there can have been no response and yet the audit was closed out. Is this a breach or are you in audit becoming softer."
Other infractions are alleged to have dated back more than 10 years, including some 25,000 transactions with Iran worth close to $20 billion. 
The Senate report also found that HSBC officials repeatedly ignored warnings about the state of its regulatory environment. In 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an organization that purports to "ensure a safe and sound national banking system for all Americans," cited HSBC for deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering controls, for maintaining a backlog of some 17,000 alerts to suspicious activity on accounts and a "failure to monitor" $60 trillion in wire transfers. 
Yet Monday's report also took the O.C.C. to task for repeatedly ignoring warning signs for more than a decade, raising questions as to whether the regulators are, themselves, being adequately regulated. 
HSBC officials will likely apologize to the Senate committee today, as they already have on numerous previous occasions, as the BBC reports. The bank has apparently cooperated fully with investigators in terms of providing documents and officials for interviews. But as the head of the Senate panel pointed out on Monday, the bank has said the right things, all the while doing the wrong thing, many times before.
All of this raises questions: Are regulators and therefore governments themselves complicit (at best) in the corruption that seems to riddle the global financial system; and at what point is the capitalist system itself called into question? To what extent are these scandals the result of the system's own values?

HEADLINE: Helping Parks Sustain Themselves

BYLINE: KELLY SLIVKA


HIGHLIGHT: Just by recycling rainwater, parks provide a service to the city, officials emphasize at a parks conference in New York. 

 BODY:
Some major sustainability themes have emerged as over 850 landscape architects, government officials, city planners and park enthusiasts meet in New York City for the Greater and Greener International Urban Parks Conference. Among the issues highlighted on Monday were recycling of rainwater and reclaiming former landfills and brownfields as park spaces.
Addressing the conference, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg emphasized that parks help the local economy by boosting property values and improving the quality of life. He noted that the city has spent over $3 billion on park improvements in the past decade.
Ideally, a lot of that money should come back to the city through saved costs from improved park health and added infrastructure, Charles McKinney, an urban designer with the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, said at a conference panel on sustainable park design. Parks improve public health by encouraging outdoor recreation, and by collecting storm water runoff that otherwise enters the overtaxed city sewage system.
During his panel presentation, Mr. McKinney highlighted a few guidelines for building sustainable parks presented by the Design Trust for Public Space, a nonprofit based in the city. He said that sustainable modern parks should try to keep the soil in which trees are planted aerated and stratified, for example, so that it supports a natural ecosystem of grubs and bacteria.

Mr. McKinney also cited a new, efficient water-usage design in Printer's Park in the Bronx that directs the runoff from a park fountain, which would typically runs right into the sewers, through channels to water greenery. Sustainability guidelines have also been integrated into the design of Fort Totten in Queens, Mr. McKinney said.
Because of budget shortfalls, several other park upgrades have not yet factored in sustainability, Mr. McKinney acknowledged after the discussion, although the goal is "aspirational."
The conference, held at New York University, began on Saturday with tours of green spaces around the city and ends on Tuesday evening with a reception hosted by Mayor Bloomberg.

HEADLINE: After Pressing Attacks on Obama, Romney Surrogate Later Apologizes

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: One of Mitt Romney's top surrogates, John Sununu questioned the president's American bona fides and said that Mr. Obama springs from "that murky world in Chicago where politician and felon has become synonymous." 

 BODY:
10:04 p.m. | Updated In a week of sharp and sometimes personal attacks between the Romney and Obama campaigns, one of Mitt Romney's top surrogates, John Sununu, increased the intensity of accusations on Tuesday, questioning the president's American bona fides and saying that Mr. Obama springs from "that murky political world in Chicago where politician and felon has become synonymous."
In a comment that struck some as an attempt to raise doubts about the president's national origin, Mr. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor, said that he wished Mr. Obama "would learn how to be an American." Mr. Sununu, a tough political fighter whom the Romney campaign has long used to get its message out, made the comments on a conference call with reporters that had been organized by the campaign.
On the call, Mr. Sununu was immediately hit with a question about what he had meant, and he backpedaled quickly, explaining that he was trying to draw attention to what he believes is the president's lack of practical knowledge about how the business world works.
"What I thought I said, but I guess I didn't say, is that the president has to learn the American formula for creating business," Mr. Sununu said. "The American formula for creating business is not to have government create business. The American formula for creating business, that I wish he would get comfortable with, is to create a climate in which entrepreneurs can thrive. If I didn't give all that detail, I apologize." 
And Mr. Sununu opted to explain himself even further later in the day, telling a radio audience: "I had four or five times commented on the fact that there's an American formula for creating jobs and talked about the fact that I wish he would understand what the American formula for creating jobs is. It's not government, but the role of entrepreneurs, and I screwed up about the third time I said it. I said I wish he would learn to be an American. Obviously, I was referring to learning how jobs are created in America - the American formula for creating jobs - and I used a choice of words that a couple of people are interpreting the wrong way. I had no intention of going back to the American versus not-American issue."
On Tuesday night, Mr. Sununu walked back his comments again, issuing an apology for his language. "Frankly, I made a mistake," he said on CNN. "I shouldn't have used those words. And I apologize for using those words."
But he made clear that he was sticking by the original intent of his criticism. "I don't apologize for the idea that this president has demonstrated that he does not understand how jobs are created in America," he said.
The comments seemed to reflect a week of deep frustration for the campaign: After another downbeat economic report that should have given him a boost against Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney instead found himself on the defensive day after day after day, pushing back on calls from Democrats and some Republicans to release more tax returns and struggling to respond to questions about when he relinquished influence over investment decisions at Bain Capital, the leveraged-buyout firm he used to run.
Mr. Sununu's calculated insinuation - he used similar language on a television appearance - that there is little daylight between felons and Chicago politicians like Mr. Obama was also a punch back at a senior Obama campaign official, Stephanie Cutter. Last week, Ms. Cutter had said that Mr. Romney was either misleading voters about the timing of his handing over control at Bain or "misrepresenting his position at Bain to the S.E.C., which is a felony."
On Tuesday, the Obama campaign immediately blasted Mr. Sununu's remarks and said they called into question whether the Romney campaign had "officially gone off the deep end" in trying to deflect questions about Mr. Romney's business career and investments.
"The question is what else they'll pull to avoid answering serious questions about Romney's tenure at Bain Capital and investments in foreign tax havens and offshore accounts," a statement from the Obama campaign said. "This meltdown and over-the-top rhetoric won't make things better - it only calls attention to how desperate they are to change the conversation."
Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who is seen as one of the leading contenders to be the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said on MSNBC that "Governor Sununu has a knack for colorful language," but that on "this one, he admitted perhaps he wasn't as clear as he should have been."
Mr. Sununu also displayed that pugnacity earlier in the day on Fox News, where, in only 42 words, he brought up suggestions of Mr. Obama's past marijuana use, implied that Mr. Obama was comfortable in a socialist setting and noted that he had lived in Indonesia, which is an overwhelmingly Muslim country.
"He spent his early years in Hawaii smoking something, spent the next set of years in Indonesia, another set of years in Indonesia, and, frankly, when he came to the U.S. he worked as a community organizer, which is a socialized structure," Mr. Sununu said.
By midafternoon one thing was clear: Mr. Sununu, at least temporarily, had shifted some of the media's attention away from tax returns, Bain, and offshore investment accounts - but possibly not in the way he had intended.

HEADLINE: In Texas, a Presidential Duel Over the Economy

SAN ANTONIO - Neither man said the other's name, but President Obama and former President George W. Bush laid out contrasting economic philosophies here in Texas on Tuesday in an unusual and unintentional back-and-forth between the country's current and past leader.
Mr. Obama flew to Mr. Bush's home state to headline four campaign fund-raisers and in the process warn the country against returning to the policies of his predecessor. Mr. Bush separately unveiled a new book outlining ideas for reinvigorating an economy that has sputtered under his successor.
The divergent messages were more an accident of geography and happenstance than planning. Aides to each man said events were set without knowing the other's schedule. But the proximity and timing brought into sharp relief the choices facing the country in this fall's election on polarizing issues like taxes, jobs, growth, regulation and free enterprise.
At the first of four fund-raisers in San Antonio and Austin, Mr. Obama told 1,200 supporters that Republicans led by his presumptive opponent this fall, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, wanted to return to the policies that led to the economic troubles that have confronted his presidency.
"We spent almost a decade doing what they prescribed," Mr. Obama said. "And how did it turn out? We didn't see greater job growth. We didn't see middle-class security. We saw the opposite. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes, precisely because there were no regulations that were adequate to the kinds of recklessness that was being carried out."
He added, "I don't know how you guys operate in your life. But my general rule is, if I do something and it doesn't work, I don't go back to doing it."
The message was similar to the one he delivers in most of his campaign speeches, but delivering it here in Texas highlighted the person he blames.
Just hours later, Mr. Bush planned to convene a group of economists in Dallas, where he now lives and is building his presidential library and public policy institute. The former president released a book, "The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs," which includes essays by economists, including five Nobel Prize winners.
The former president wrote the foreword and offered no assessment of Mr. Obama's record, in keeping with his post-White House practice of not commenting on his successor. The underlying thrust of the book, though, is predicated on the notion that the economy has not been repaired in the three and a half years since Mr. Obama took over from Mr. Bush, and that more robust actions are needed.
The former president proposed a goal of sustained 4 percent annual growth, which would be ambitious for a country that has grown just over 3 percent a year since 1948 and is currently below 2 percent. "We're an economy in transition," said Brendan Miniter, who edited Mr. Bush's book. "If we don't set the target higher, if we just continue to stumble along, ultimately we're going to pay a pretty stark price."

HEADLINE: From the Prime Minister's Twitter Feed, a Puzzling View of Foreign Investment

BYLINE: VIVEK DEHEJIA


HIGHLIGHT: The facts behind Manmohan Singh's recent Tweets. 

 BODY:
Recent news on foreign direct investment (FDI) into India has been rather grim. India's central bank recently said that in the first two months of the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2012, FDI fell by 38 percent, dropping from $5.15 billion in the same period last year to a meager $3.2 billion this year. The news on foreign portfolio investment was equally grim - the net drain from the economy in this period was $1.4 billion, compared to a net inflow of $1.82 billion last year at this time.
By contrast, the official Twitter page of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ran a series of cheery tweets on Monday.
"India is the 3rd most desirable destination for Foreign Direct Investment," said one.
"FDI inflows to S Asia turned around as a result of higher inflows to India, the dominant FDI recipient in the region" said another tweet.
"FACT: 'The two large emerging economies, China and India, saw inflows rise by nearly 8 percent and by 31 percent, respectively'," another boasted.
The tweets cited the recently released World Investment Report 2012 by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We at India Ink initially found the discrepancy between the gloomy central bank statistics and the apparently good news in the U.N. report to be puzzling.
After closer examination the apparent contradiction is more easily understood. The official statistics relate to the actual level of investment in the months of April and May of this year.
The UNCTAD report, on the other hand, is based on much older statistics and a survey that asked a smattering of anonymous company executives from multinationals around the world where they might like to invest in the future. The FDI inflows the report cites are for 2011. The "desirable destination" ranking comes from a survey conducted by UNCTAD.
Based on a list of 174 "validated country responses," India ranked third, after China and the United States, as the area that these companies would most like to invest in sometime between 2012 and 2014. This survey was conducted by e-mail and through a "dedicated Web site" between February and May of this year.
There is no indication of which official within each of these companies might have responded to the e-mail query or on the Web site: whether, for instance, someone in fact responsible for making an investment decision, or a public relations officer tasked with responding to the U.N. organization's survey.
Either way, these responses represent a wish list of sorts, rather than any indication of a firm commitment to a future investment. Inflows did not turn around, although the number of anonymous company executives who wished they could invest in India did increase. (Maybe because actually investing here has become so tenuous after recent Finance Ministry proposals raised questions about retroactive taxation.)
How about the claim that inflows to South Asia turned around as a result of inflows to the dominant recipient, India? These figures also relate to the 2010-2011 fiscal year, and India's dominance is easily explained. The grouping of countries, other than India, includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Iran, a country generally not considered a South Asian economy. India is by far the largest economy in its region, and Iran, which faces numerous sanctions due to its nuclear program, could hardly be expected to be a major recipient of foreign investment. It's hardly surprising, therefore, that India should have received the lion's share of foreign investment flowing into this region.
What's the bottom line?
The hard statistics of actual FDI flows tell one tale, and a survey of a relatively small number of possible yet uncommitted investors tells another. We'll leave it to you, the readers of India Ink, to decide which you find more relevant.

HEADLINE: Gloomy Forecast for States, Even if Economy Rebounds

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and MICHAEL COOPER; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The fiscal crisis for states will persist long after the economy rebounds as they confront rising health care costs, underfunded pensions, ignored infrastructure needs, eroding revenues and expected federal budget cuts, according to a report issued here Tuesday by a task force of respected budget experts.
The problems facing states are often masked by lax budget laws and opaque accounting practices, according to the report, an independent analysis of six large states released by the State Budget Crisis Task Force.
It said that the financial collapse of 2008, which caused the most serious fiscal crisis for states since the Great Depression, exposed deep-set financial challenges that will worsen if no action is taken.
''The ability of the states to meet their obligations to public employees, to creditors and most critically to the education and well-being of their citizens is threatened,'' warned the chairmen of the task force, Richard Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor of New York, and Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
The report added a strong dose of fiscal pessimism just as many states have seen their immediate budget pressures begin to ease. And it called into question how states will restore the services they have cut during the downturn, saying that the loss of jobs in prisons, hospitals, courts and agencies have been more severe than in any of the past nine recessions.
''This is a fundamental shift in the way governments have responded to recessions and appears to signal a willingness to 'unbuild' state government in a way that has not been done before,'' it said, noting that court systems had cut their hours in many states, delaying actions including divorce settlements and criminal trials.
The report arrived at a delicate political moment. States are deciding whether to expand their Medicaid programs to cover the uninsured poor as part of the new health care law, with the federal government pledging to pay the full cost at first. Public-sector unions feel besieged, as states and cities from Wisconsin to San Jose, Calif., have moved to save money on pensions. And Washington's focus on deficit reduction -- with big budget cuts scheduled for after the fall election -- has made cuts to state aid inevitable, many governors believe.
If federal grants to the states were cut by just 10 percent, the report said, the loss to state and local government budgets would be more than $60 billion a year -- nearly twice the size of the combined tax increases that states enacted during the fiscal crisis from 2008 to 2011.
Things are worse than they appear, the report contends.
Even before the recession, Medicaid spending was growing faster than state revenues, and the downturn led to higher caseloads -- making the program the biggest share of state spending, as states have cut aid to schools and universities. States have not set aside enough money to cover the health and retirement benefits they owe their workers. Important revenue sources are being eroded: states are losing billions of sales tax dollars to Internet sales and to an economy in which much consumer spending has shifted from buying goods to buying lightly taxed services. Gas tax revenues have not kept up with urgent infrastructure needs. And distressed cities and counties pose challenges to states.
While almost all states are required by law to balance their budgets each year, the report said that many have relied on gimmicks and nonrecurring revenues in recent years to mask the continuing imbalance between the revenues they take in and the expenses they face -- and that lax accounting systems allow them to do so.
The report focused on California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Virginia, and found that all have relied on some gimmicks in recent years.
California borrowed money several times over the past decade to generate budget cash. New York delayed paying income tax refunds one year to push the costs into the next year and raided several state funds that were supposed to be dedicated to other uses. New Jersey borrowed against the money it received from its share of the tobacco settlement and, along with Virginia, failed to make all of the required payments to its pension funds.
Texas delayed $2 billion worth of payments by a month -- pushing the expenses into the next year. Illinois has billions of dollars of unpaid bills and borrowed money to put in its pension funds.
Desperate budget officials often see public pension funds as an almost irresistible pool of money. One common way of ''borrowing'' pension money is not to make each year's ''annual required contribution,'' the amount actuaries calculate must be set aside to cover future payments. Despite its name, there is usually no enforceable law requiring that it be paid.
As a result, the report found that from 2007 to 2011, state and local governments shortchanged their pension plans by more than $50 billion -- an amount that has nothing to do with the market losses of 2008, which caused even more harm.
When money is withheld from a pension fund, the arrears can snowball, because most states count on the money compounding at a rate of about 8 percent a year. Eventually the unfunded liability grows unmanageable. And states and municipalities have promised an estimated $1 trillion in health benefits -- that most have not started saving for -- to their retirees.
While the report called New York's practice of delaying payments to its pension fund a ''gimmick,'' Morris Peters, a spokesman for the state's budget division, said that the state was not relying on any new gimmicks. But the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, praised the task force for ''bringing the severity of this crisis to the fore.''
Others welcomed parts of the report. Matt Fabian, the managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, a research and consulting firm, said that while it might alarm some investors in the short term, ''in the long term it's a good thing for creditors to get a handle on these costs.''
And Kerry Korpi, the director of research at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, agreed with its findings that the federal government should consider how its actions impact state and local governments, and that states should modernize their tax systems to pay for needed services.
The task force chairmen said they wanted to call attention to the severity of the problem without making it worse by spooking the investors who buy municipal bonds. State and local governments cannot function if they lose their access to credit, as New York City did in 1975.
Mr. Ravitch, a primary player in resolving New York City's near breakdown, said he did not see the states' problems today as analogous. The states, he said, are not juggling the giant load of short-term debt that New York City had back then.
Mr. Volcker disagreed.
''New York City went and spent a lot of money they didn't have,'' Mr. Volcker said. ''We're doing exactly the same thing today on a grander scale.'' He said that it was characteristic of financial markets to fail to respond to problems until they became a crisis.
''They'll lend right up to the brink,'' he said. ''That's the lesson of this. You don't want to act too late.''

HEADLINE: Heads in the Clouds Amid a Cloudless Landscape

BYLINE: By JOHN WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A MILLION HEAVENS
By John Brandon
272 pages. McSweeney's Books. $24.
John Brandon's novels are choral compositions in the voice of marginal Americans. In them he marshals the thoughts and stories of small-time crooks, troubled adolescents and low-wage workers with higher aspirations, alternating perspectives in the key of hard luck.
His previous novels, ''Arkansas'' and ''Citrus County,'' were each told through the eyes of several characters. His latest, ''A Million Heavens,'' is even more populous, and each brief section comes with a header announcing its point of view: ''Reggie,'' ''Soren's Father,'' ''The Wolf.'' 
Yes, the wolf. In an echo of Cormac McCarthy's novel ''The Crossing,'' Mr. Brandon casts the animal in a featured role, tracking its thoughts in the same intimate way of everyone else in the book.
''A Million Heavens'' opens with the wolf, and Mr. Brandon manages, for a while, to generate an understated power from the conceit: ''The wolf understood that he had stopped short in some sort of courtyard and he understood that these humans had sneaked up on him, or he had snuck up on them without meaning to, which was the same.''
The setting is Albuquerque and Lofte, N.M., a nearby struggling town where ''denial was finally running low.'' Denial is usually one of the few things not burdening Mr. Brandon's characters, who tend to recognize, and sometimes embrace, their limitations, disappointments and rap sheets. This book has as many plots as people, all of them tethered, some more firmly than others, to the story of Soren, a boy in a coma on the top floor of a hospital.
At a piano lesson before he became sick Soren produced a remarkable 16 seconds of music. He had never played the instrument before. A weekly vigil for him outside the hospital grows from a half-dozen people to about a hundred -- ''huddling in the parking lot,'' ''like cattle awaiting a storm'' -- and then gradually shrinks until it's down to a lone young woman who continues to show up.
The book's most satisfying other strands involve the mayor of Lofte and his halfhearted attempts to revive the town; a gas station owner inspired to test his mettle in the desert; and a believably frustrating relationship between Dannie, a 33-year-old woman, and her much younger boyfriend, Arn. (''You don't have health insurance, do you?'' Dannie asks him. ''I never do anything dangerous,'' he replies.)
Mr. Brandon channels many influences while always sounding like himself. At his best, which he's at with some frequency here, he writes in a crackling way about small hopes and larger despair. He gravitates to the kind of regional misfits who drew Flannery O'Connor's eye, and his dialogue is snappy and eccentric, like a combination of two masters of the craft, Elmore Leonard and Charles Portis. ''Every place is the same,'' one character tells another, trying to sound wise. ''Some places it rains a lot and some places it doesn't rain at all. Other than that, every place is exactly the same.''
In previous books Mr. Brandon has conspicuously established his working-class bona fides. His author bio for ''Arkansas'' included a note about the times he spent working ''at a lumber mill, a windshield warehouse, a Coca-Cola distributor, and several small factories that produce goods made of rubber and plastic.'' ''Citrus County'' included a similar note referring to ''a Frito-Lay warehouse and a Sysco warehouse'' as well as a stretch of unemployment.
His updated credentials mention two writing fellowships and no menial work. Whether it's a direct result of moving off the warehouse floor or not, ''A Million Heavens'' charts new territory for Mr. Brandon. It is still firmly rooted in a soil of economic decline and environmental alienation (''As long as you were in the desert, you were lost.''), but as its title implies, it also has more celestial aims. It suffers some for those ambitions, especially in a thread about Reggie, a young musician killed in a car accident who occupies a purgatorial state where he reluctantly composes songs on a mysterious piano. Reggie's ex-bandmate Cecilia begins to hear and record her friend's post-mortem melodies and lyrics.
The afterlife is a tricky milieu for any writer; maybe even trickier than the souls of wolves. And though Mr. Brandon never gets treacly, there's still something about the application of his gritty gifts to the sweet hereafter that feels strained -- like Steve Buscemi playing a guardian angel. It would have been enough to leave open the question of whether Cecilia, one of the book's strongest creations, is really in touch with Reggie.
The wolf eventually plays a sillier role too, with Mr. Brandon giving in to the temptation to make the creature too human. Listening to a young woman singing, ''He felt the angst that had been building in him begin to evaporate.''
The frequent section breaks at times make the book feel schematic and overcrowded. In an interview while working on the novel, Mr. Brandon said the book had ''way too many characters.'' The recurring presence of some does feel unnecessary, like the piano teacher who was the only witness to Soren's prodigious outburst.
To Mr. Brandon's credit, there's no grand unifying gimmick waiting in the wings. As the book goes on he reveals a few subtle connections among characters, but he's content to leave some dots unconnected. The shortcomings of ''A Million Heavens'' are those of a confident young author trying new things, which is no crime and may even pay dividends. Its strengths -- assured prose, well-timed wisecracks and a convincing crew of pilgrims just waiting for directions -- are quickly becoming Mr. Brandon's trademarks.

HEADLINE: Leave The Statue, To Remember

BYLINE: By TA-NEHISI COATES. 
Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic, is a guest columnist. Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
Happy Valley is a nation, nestled in the rolling green of Pennsylvania, currently wrestling with its martial tradition and the disgrace roiling its core. Once Happy Valley's venerable hero, Joe Paterno, led his knights in defense of the nation's honor. Paterno's champions were known for a making a show of their particular brand of scholar-athleticism and bragging of doing things ''the right way.''
They were drilled on the importance of developing the body as well as the mind and outfitted for the quiet civilian life that awaited them after the sounds of battle had faded. The ethos of team sports, personal sacrifice for the greater glory of all, was embodied in the great warrior cry, ''We are Penn State.'' 
On the night Joe Paterno was fired, the wizened warlord led his nation in that great chant one last time. He was standing outside his house, arm around his longtime wife. He was 84 years old and soon to be given a diagnosis of lung cancer. His eyes flashed behind the great windows of his ever-unwieldy frames. He was, for the first time in many decades, unemployed. But much worse, his name was tied to the heinous crimes of a child predator, Jerry Sandusky.
He urged the crowd to get a good night's sleep and study. He urged prayer for Sandusky's victims. Then he turned to the crowd and shouted, ''We are Penn State!'' The chant is supposed to summon up notions of honor, strength and sacrifice. But after Paterno disappeared into his house to wrestle with his own private demons, the assembled citizenry of Happy Valley took to the streets and vented theirs.
It is a truth of history that good people do sometimes do heinous things, but that makes it no easier for the human mind to accept. Acceptance got a little easier last week when Louis Freeh, a former director of the F.B.I. who led a special investigation into the Penn State matter, produced damning evidence that Paterno, when confronted with a most horrific crime, the rape of a child, laid down his arms and ran for cover. This is not the kind of man to whom we dedicate memorials, and following the Freeh report there has been a movement afoot to take down the statue of Paterno that stands outside Beaver Stadium.
The need to clean history so that the record might reflect our current values, and not our sordid past, is broad. In Columbia, S.C., there stands a statue of Ben Tillman, the populist South Carolina senator who helped found Clemson University and, in his spare time, defended lynching from his august national offices. For years there have been calls to remove Tillman's statue, emanating from those who think it a shame to continue to honor him. But in a democracy, memorial statues are not simply comments on their subjects, but comments on their makers. That Americans once saw fit to honor a man who defended terrorism from the Senate floor is a powerful statement about our identity and history.
Whereas Tillman's most spectacular sins were known at the time of his lionization, Paterno's only later came to light. And yet the central sin that now haunts Happy Valley has long been in evidence -- a tragic myopia. The Freeh report noted that a janitor who'd witnessed one of Sandusky's rapes declined to report it, fearing that Penn State would close ranks to protect the football program. It is easy to talk about what we would do were we in the janitor's place. Much harder is to conclude that we might be susceptible to the same fear, that living in a culture where football is a creed, we too might tremble before the nation's wrath.
The problem here is not that Paterno shamed Happy Valley, but that Happy Valley, through its broad blindness, has shamed itself. Last week an artist who'd once painted Paterno with a halo altered his mural by removing it. This effort has less to do with the better rendering of Paterno and more to do with escaping the shame of hasty canonization.
Arguing for the statue's removal, the legendary coach Bobby Bowden said he wouldn't want Sandusky's crimes ''brought up every time I walked out on the field.'' That's the point. Sandusky's crimes should never be forgotten, nor should the crimes of the broader community. It is shameful to deify men who put nationalist ritual before children. But it is more shameful to pretend that this elevation was achieved by Joe Paterno's singular hand.
Removing the Paterno statue allows Happy Valley to forget its own compliance in a national crime, to expunge its own culpability in its ruthless pursuit of glory. The statue should remain, and beneath it there should be a full explanation of Sandusky's crimes, Paterno's role and some warning to all of us who would turn a pastime into a god and elect a mortal man as its avatar.

POLAND MANAGES TO AVOID
EUROPE'S ECONOMIC GLOOM
Poland's economy was the only one in the European Union that did not shrink in 2009, the year the financial crisis hit hardest. While nowhere near the 6.8 percent clip Poland achieved in 2007, growth is forecast at 2.7 percent this year, the fastest in the bloc, after expanding by 15.8 percent from 2008 to 2011. But the kind of infrastructure money that helped build Poland's highways is being phased out. PAGE A4
AFGHAN SOLDIER CONVICTED
For the first time, an Afghan military court convicted an Afghan soldier of killing troops from the American-led coalition in what is known as a green-on-blue attack. Afghan officials said that the court had sentenced to death a man who gunned down four French soldiers in January in Kapisa Province. The attack prompted France to speed up the withdrawal of its combat forces from Afghanistan . PAGE A4 
TRADE THAW WITH RUSSIA
For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, a bipartisan coalition in Congress has agreed to normalize trade relations with Russia. But at a time of renewed tension with Moscow, lawmakers have decided to grant the status with one large caveat -- that Russian officials be held responsible for human rights abuses. PAGE A9

HEADLINE: New Data Shows Growth Remains Tepid

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer prices were flat in June as the cost of gasoline dropped, offering some relief for Americans and room for the Federal Reserve, if it chooses to act, to ease monetary policy further to help the faltering recovery. 
Other reports on Tuesday showed that confidence among home builders climbed to a five-year high in July and industrial production rebounded last month. Despite that, the economic growth trend remains tilted to the weak side, analysts said.
''There is a growing case for a helping hand from the Fed for the economy and the recovery,'' said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at TD Securities. ''Monetary policy is the only game in town.''
The Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, offered few new clues on Tuesday whether the central bank was moving closer to a fresh round of monetary stimulus. He told the Senate Banking Committee the Fed would act, if necessary, to support the economy.
The economy has been slammed by fears of steep government spending cuts and higher taxes next year, and troubles from the debt crisis in Europe. That has caused a slowdown in job growth and declines in retail sales over the last three months.
The unchanged Consumer Price Index in June was in line with economists' expectations and followed a 0.3 percent drop in May, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. Stripping out food and energy, inflation pressures were also benign. The core rate for the C.P.I. rose 0.2 percent for a fourth straight month.
Over all, consumer prices rose 1.7 percent in June from a year earlier after increasing by the same margin in May.
The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter and estimates for the April-June period are converging around a 1.5 percent pace.
A second report on Tuesday showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index, which measures sentiment among home builders, jumped to 35 in July, the highest since September 2002. The index was 29 in June.
In a reversal of fortunes, housing has been one of the few brighter spots in the economy, with the decline in home prices apparently bottoming out in recent months. Still, residential construction is only a small fraction of gross domestic product.
''The recovery in the housing market is persisting despite recent signs of slowing growth in other sectors of the economy,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.
A third report from the Federal Reserve showed industrial production grew 0.4 percent in June, pushed up by output at factories, especially automakers, after falling 0.2 percent in May.
But growth in manufacturing slowed sharply in the second quarter, expanding at an annual rate of 1.4 percent during the second quarter, compared with a 9.8 percent pace in the previous three months.
With both domestic and global demand weak, factories will most likely struggle to increase production.
Last month, overall inflation was held back by a 2.0 percent drop in gasoline prices, offsetting a 0.2 percent rise in food prices. Gasoline prices at the pump have declined about 53 cents from their peak around $4 a gallon in April, easing some of the strain on household budgets.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Sales Rise 3%; Profit Falls Slightly

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The world economy may be stumbling, but its consumers are still buying Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite.
The Coca-Cola Company, the maker of those brands and many other beverages, reported on Tuesday that its second-quarter profit edged lower, to $2.79 billion, or $1.21 a share, compared with $2.8 billion, or $1.20 a share, in the period a year earlier, when more shares were outstanding. 
Revenue grew 3 percent, to $13.09 billion.
Coke's performance held up despite higher ingredient costs and a 4 percent decline in sales in Europe, where a combination of abysmal weather and economic and financial crises dented the appetite for fizzy drinks. Nor is the outlook rosy, Muhtar A. Kent, Coke's chief executive, warned analysts. ''We find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy,'' he said.
But Coke has been performing well under such conditions for the last couple of years, he said. ''Operating in this environment has become the norm for us,'' Mr. Kent added. Sales volume was up 4 percent worldwide and 1 percent in North America.
The company's use of a mix of packaging sizes, which allows it to adjust various prices -- and profit margins -- has helped it, as have lower prices for plastics, aluminum and other commodities.
Coke's big Olympic marketing campaign has started, with Mr. Kent carrying the torch on one leg of the pre-Olympic relay. Coke will do more recycling of its packaging at these Games than ever before, and has committed to reusing what it recycles within six weeks.
Coke faced an unexpected challenge in the second quarter from Americans who apparently stayed home instead of setting out in their cars for summer vacations. That meant more people bought lower-margin multipacks of sodas than the more profitable single-serving sizes sold in gasoline stations and convenience stores.
''It was counterintuitive because actually gas prices had eased off a little bit,'' Mr. Kent said.
Shares of Coke rose $1.21, or 1.6 percent, to $77.69.

HEADLINE: The Greening of Professional Sports

BYLINE: By ALLEN HERSHKOWITZ. 
Allen Hershkowitz is a senior scientist and directs the sports greening project at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

 BODY:
THE White House is hosting a conference on the greening of sports on Thursday to recognize the sports industry's growing embrace of energy efficiency, water conservation, recycling, healthier food and the role it plays in spreading the environmental message.
All the major professional sports leagues in the United States will be represented at the event, as well as scores of teams, site managers, athletes and environmentalists. Through their nonpartisan leadership on the field, court or rink, professional and collegiate sports and their sponsors are showing their many fans practical, cost-effective solutions to some of our planet's most dire ecological issues. 
It goes without saying that sports is a hugely popular, economically influential industry. Hundreds of millions of people watch sporting events each year, and 61 percent of Americans identified themselves as sports fans in a Marist poll last November. Moreover, the global supply chain of the sports industry includes many of the largest and most influential corporations on earth.
And consider how culturally influential sports can be: Jesse Owens in 1936, debunking the Aryan supremacy myth. Billie Jean King beating Bobby Riggs in the famous ''Battle of the Sexes'' tennis challenge match. Passage of Title IX, leading to financing for women's athletics. Muhammad Ali's objection to the Vietnam War and his role as a spokesman for civil rights. Magic Johnson's openness about his H.I.V./AIDS, which helped destigmatize that illness. Jackie Robinson breaking the race barrier in Major League Baseball.
There is no single business undertaking or law that can solve our many ecological crises alone. It takes a combined effort by individuals and businesses alike to create change. The actions taken by professional sports are starting to add up.
Fifteen professional stadiums or arenas have achieved LEED certification for green building design and operations, and 17 have installed on-site solar arrays. Millions of pounds of carbon emissions have been avoided, and millions of pounds of paper products have been shifted toward recycled content or not used at professional sports sites. Recycling and composting programs have been developed or are planned at virtually all professional stadiums and arenas, and the large concessionaires, which collectively feed tens of millions of people each year, have all developed environmentally preferable menus for at least some of their offerings.
At Major League Baseball's 83rd All-Star Game last week, the hosts, the Kansas City Royals, bought carbon offsets certified by the Environmental Protection Agency for emissions from the 120,000 kilowatt-hours of energy used during All-Star Week events and purchased credits to restore depleted watersheds for the 600,000 gallons of water used. The 120 solar panels installed at the stadium earlier this year will produce 36,000 kilowatts annually. Recycling containers were placed in offices, suites, concourses and parking lots at the stadium, and environmental awareness was promoted with public service announcements in stadium signage and an ad in the 2012 All-Star Game program. Certainly, much work remains to be done, but it is heartening to note that dozens of teams across the country are adopting energy efficiency measures, renewable energy, recycling, water conservation, safer chemicals and healthier food. Tens of millions of fans are being educated about environmental stewardship by teams and leagues throughout the world.
Lessons from previous cultural shifts that have moved our society forward suggest that the change needed today in our thinking about the environment will not be led by government. The Civil Rights Act was not enacted because Congress led the way on race relations. The Vietnam War did not end because Congress led the way on defunding United States participation in that conflict. The same is true of other social issues like drunken driving, gender equality and marriage equality. In each case, government did not lead on the reforms needed to address these issues, it followed. Congress was forced to act by public opinion.
Clearly, Congress is not leading the way in addressing the urgent issues of global climate disruption, biodiversity loss and so many other ecological threats. We must encourage government to respond to these threats, and in order to do that, we need to promote a cultural shift in how Americans view their relationship to the planet.
To instigate this, few sectors can be as influential as the sports industry. There is a reason some of the largest industries on earth pay millions of dollars to affiliate with professional sports. They know it is an effective way to influence the culture of the marketplace.
And professional sports recognizes it's time to take the lead once again. And so they will stand at the White House to show their support for a cleaner, more sustainable future.

HEADLINE: At Con Ed, the Managers Are Tasked With Repairs

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Rhea Chedid contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When dark smoke rose from a manhole outside Trump Tower in Manhattan on Monday afternoon, it looked like a sign of the sort of trouble that Consolidated Edison has dreaded for the last three weeks.
With the temperature hovering near 90 degrees, electrical cables had started to burn beneath the pavement at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, threatening to cut off power along one of the most expensive stretches of real estate in the world. An emergency call went out, but none of Consolidated Edison's 8,000 unionized utility workers could answer it: They have all been locked out of their jobs since July 1.
In their stead came makeshift crews of the company's managers, some of whom had not spliced a high-voltage cable in more than a decade and others who never had. In flame-retardant coveralls, steel-toed boots and hard hats, the more experienced managers, like Michael Melendez, clambered down into the manhole and cut the damaged cables. Those who had held only desk jobs at the company were relegated to aiming flashlights and carrying tools. 
''It's all hands on deck,'' Mr. Melendez said as he identified the managers who formed the crews he was overseeing outside the Armani boutique opposite Trump Tower. One normally spends his days drawing up schedules in an office in East Harlem. Another is a supervisor from Staten Island.
They were among the 5,000 managers Con Ed has deployed to maintain and repair the grid that distributes electricity throughout New York City and parts of Westchester County. They were called into action just hours after a four-year contract with Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America expired at midnight on June 30. But they had already been given some brief training -- or retraining -- sessions.
Rather than risk a strike by the union, Con Ed executives immediately locked out the workers, leaving them without paychecks and, for the first two weeks, without health insurance.
The union members, who have held protests outside Con Ed's headquarters near Union Square, have grown angrier as negotiations toward a new contract have dragged on.
''In dangerous situations our people are up there, they are heroes, and they are being cast aside like an old shoe,'' said John Duffy, national vice president of the union, at a rally in Union Square that was attended by several elected officials, including the city comptroller, John C. Liu, and the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer.
Representatives of the two sides met again on Monday. On Tuesday, Con Ed responded to the union's petition to state utility regulators; the petition demanded an explanation of how the company was providing adequate service to its 3.2 million customers without most of its labor force.
In its response, Con Ed acknowledged that it had deferred some work, like meter reading, but said that its customers were ''receiving the same level and quality of service today as they were receiving before the lockout.''
The biggest obstacles to operating the system safely, Con Ed said, were being created by the locked-out workers. ''Union protesters are intentionally blocking the delivery of equipment needed in our Bensonhurst substation,'' it said, referring to a location in Brooklyn. ''In the meantime, the protesters have blocked fuel deliveries to generators being used to offset the transformer needs. The generators are helping to keep the lights and air-conditioning on in Bergen Beach, Canarsie, Flatlands and Marine Park,'' neighborhoods in Brooklyn.
Con Ed officials said locked-out workers had harassed some of the managers filling in for them, but Mr. Melendez and other managers said their interactions with union members had been cordial. The same could not be said for all New Yorkers.
On Monday afternoon, two men sitting on a stoop on Mercer Street in SoHo spotted Frank McBrien and Jessica Barcco in their white Con Ed hard hats. ''Did you guys settle already?'' one of the men called out.
Mr. McBrien, detached from his office on the East Side to conduct inspections of gas lines during the lockout, shook his head and said no. The stoop-sitter caught on quickly: ''Oh, you guys are managers,'' he said.
''Scabs,'' his friend added.
Mr. McBrien winced a little and headed inside to check out the pipes in a building's basement while monitoring for gas leaks.
''It's not personal towards me,'' Mr. McBrien, 46, said of the union members' feelings. ''I empathize with them. People have wives, kids, mortgages to pay. People just hope this comes to an amicable end.''
Mr. Melendez, a sturdy 48-year-old who lives in Yonkers, suggested that he was unfazed by the remarks of passers-by. ''A couple people go by and boo,'' he said.
The public seems confused about what is happening with the union members, Mr. Melendez said. ''They know they're out, but they think it's a strike and we're scabs,'' he said.
Having been a member of the union for about 14 years before he was promoted into management, he took umbrage at the suggestion that he would take another man's job by choice. ''You have to explain to them that we're not the enemy,'' he said. ''I feel for the guys. To be out of work this much time with this economy is tough.''
The managers have been collecting overtime pay, working 12-hour shifts, six days a week. But the trade-off has meant time away from their families and missed summer vacations. Mr. Melendez said his longer hours have added to his wife's burden in caring for her father, who uses a wheelchair. He also had to cancel an annual two-week July vacation to Aruba, where he owns a time-share, he said.
He said he was proud that the managers had kept the lights and air-conditioners on through a few heat waves so far, but he was not sure how much longer their luck would hold. ''As long as nothing major happens, we can maintain the system,'' he said. ''Obviously the longer it goes, the heat is going to take a toll.''
At 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the load on Con Edison's network hit a high for the year: 12,429 megawatts, only about 5 percent shy of the all-time peak of 13,189 megawatts set on July 22 last year.

HEADLINE: Righting a Highway's Wrongs

BYLINE: By C.J. HUGHES

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- In the 1950s, this city, like others, believed that the best way to get people back from the suburbs was to build more highways.
A result was the Oak Street Connector, a limited-access spur off Interstate 95 leading to the central business district. The thought was to make it easy for suburbanites to drive in and spend money downtown, instead of at new shopping centers on the outskirts.
But like other urban renewal projects from the era, what seemed like a good idea at the time is now considered by many to have been a big mistake.
The highway, part of Route 34, severed the Hill neighborhood from the heart of downtown and hastened the Hill's decline, because nobody wanted to walk across a wide, busy highway to get to the neighborhood, according to city leaders, business owners and residents. This has been a problem for the fortunes of the Hill in general, as well as for Yale University, whose medical, nursing and public health schools and hospital are there, and for the growing medical industry that has sprung up around it in recent years. 
But city officials say help is on the way from Downtown Crossing, a $135 million redevelopment plan that has been years in the making.
Echoing recent efforts by San Francisco, Milwaukee and Boston to alter or remove their highways, Downtown Crossing targets a one-mile, mostly sunken section of the connector running roughly between Orange and College Streets.
Though details are still being worked out, the plan calls for building streets, sidewalks and buildings on platforms above the existing highway. The city's grid in the area would be restored, creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment, and the Hill would be reattached. The highway will have fewer exits into the city and will lead directly into parking garages.
Downtown Crossing would create 10 acres of new, developable property and increase the tax rolls, according to the city's Office of Economic and Business Development, which is overseeing the project.
This summer, the project took a major step closer to reality, although some opposition exists.
In June, Winstanley Enterprises, a Massachusetts-based developer that has been awarded a two-and-a-half-acre parcel where it intends to build a 426,000-square-foot office tower, lined up a major tenant. The tenant, Alexion Pharmaceuticals of nearby Cheshire, will take 325,000 square feet in a 12-year lease, though the rent was not disclosed.
The 11-story building, to be called 100 College Street, has mostly sailed through the city's approval process, which culminates on Aug. 6, when the Board of Alderman will vote on a necessary rezoning.
The project, which includes ground-floor retail and is ringed with plazas, is scheduled to break ground next year, after a $35 million state project to realign the highway is finished. The tower is expected to open in 2015.
Having an anchor tenant is critical in securing financing for the $100 million project. No lenders have committed yet, but Carter Winstanley, a principal of Winstanley Enterprises, said that with an anchor tenant, financing should be easy. Alexion will relocate to 100 College from Cheshire, where 300 employees work in a handful of buildings, though it will keep facilities in Rhode Island and Cambridge, Mass., according to Irving Adler, a spokesman. The company, a global operation with 1,100 employees that did $783 million in business last year, makes Soliris, which treats a rare blood disorder.
It's also a homecoming for Alexion, which was founded in 1992 in New Haven and relocated to Cheshire in 2000.
Sweetening the deal was a $51 million incentive package from the state to help keep the company here. Some of the state loans, grants and tax credits are dependent on Alexion's creating 200 to 300 new jobs by 2017.
Mr. Adler praised the biotech hub emerging in this part of New Haven, adding that ''the move enables us to keep pace with our growth and expand into a state-of-the-art facility.''
Most of Alexion's employees, at least initially, will commute from Cheshire and other suburban towns, meaning they will most likely drive cars into New Haven every morning. While the rezoning for the 100 College development did not require the developer to put in additional parking, there will be a six-story, 850-space parking garage.
Anstress Farwell, president of the New Haven Urban Design League, an advocacy group, criticized the project, saying it would bring hundreds more cars downtown and undermine the pedestrian-focused goals of Downtown Crossing.
The new garage will abut the 2,600-space, five-level Air Rights Garage, which was built in the early 1980s. Ms. Farwell said that would make 100 College feel like history repeating itself, but not in a good way.
Even though Ms. Farwell's group generally supports the idea of stitching New Haven back together -- it proposed an idea similar to Downtown Crossing in 2003 -- it forced a delay of the rezoning vote in May to buy more time to review 100 College's plans, she said.
Ms. Farwell and other critics say that Downtown Crossing doesn't call for enough apartments or the kinds of stores that stay open late enough to create lasting streetfront vitality.
''It's just a worse version of what we dealt with before'' during the 1950s, she said. ''What we really need to change is mobility patterns through this area,'' she added, with more bike lanes and wider sidewalks.
Mr. Winstanley defends his project as just a starting point. ''The goal is to make it as good as we can possibly make it and to serve as a catalyst,'' he said.
In some ways, Winstanley Enterprises has already been a catalyst for New Haven's revitalization.
In 1999, the firm bought Southern New England Telephone's office building on nearby George Street and converted its 527,000 square feet into biotech labs. Today, the building is 95 percent occupied, Mr. Winstanley said.
Others have also tried to improve the area with a biomedical focus. To the west of the Downtown Crossing area, is a string of barren blocks cleared for a highway continuation that never came to pass. In 2004, Pfizer built a 50-bed research center on a half-block site in that area. In 2009, the Smilow Cancer Hospital, a 14-story Yale-affiliated facility, opened nearby. There is also 2 Howe Street, a mixed-use development from the Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation of Boston, which contains stores and 24 housing units for family members of Smilow patients.
In 2010, the Fusco Corporation, a local developer, built the yellow-checkered 2 Park Street on a lot that had been vacant for decades; Smilow has leased the upstairs for 20 years, but three of the four street-level storefronts are vacant.
What's expected to increase demand for stores and restaurants is the opening this summer of the new campus of Gateway Community College on Church Street and the connector, where department stores once stood. The community college will have two joined four-story buildings for 11,000 students, though critics contend they will mostly be commuters who will drive home after class and not add to street life.
Otherwise, the office market in New Haven is tight. The city's vacancy rate was 10.6 percent in the second quarter of 2012, when asking rents were $21.54 a square foot, according to CBRE New England.
That was an improvement on the 13.4 vacancy rate for the same period in 2011, when asking rents were $20.72, as well as the second quarter of 2007, at the market's peak, when the rate was 15.6 percent and rents were $21.11, the data shows.
For Kelly Murphy, the administrator for the city's Economic Development department, 100 College represents a huge accomplishment after years of public meetings and plan revisions. Acknowledging the approach of her urban renewal predecessors, who tended to change landscapes all at once, she pointed out her department's intentionally piecemeal approach with Downtown Crossing.
''We're not looking for a home run to solve all our issues,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Malls' New Pitch: Come for the Experience

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Glimcher Realty Trust, which owns and manages shopping malls, is experimenting with making them Internet-proof. The company concedes that if shoppers can buy something online, they will. So it is trying to fill one of its malls, in Scottsdale, Ariz., with businesses that do more than sell stuff.
There are still clothing-only retailers at the mall, Scottsdale Quarter, but more than half of the stores offer dining or some other experience that cannot be easily replicated on the Web. That has Glimcher executives taking some unconventional approaches to finding suitable tenants -- like testing out laser salons, getting hairstyling lessons and watching movies in a theater that serves food.
Executives in suits descended last year on a prospective tenant in Manhattan, Make Meaning, where they mulled over making ceramics, candles and jewelry as their town cars waited outside. 
While a Scottsdale shopper can buy clothes on the Web, ''she can't go out to lunch with her girlfriends and have a glass of wine and a salad online,'' said Michael P. Glimcher, chairman and chief executive. ''She can't get her hair done online. She can't go and make pottery or soap or a cake online.''
Just about every mall owner in America is looking for ways to compete with the Internet. R. J. Milligan, a real estate analyst for Raymond James, said that developers were slowly adding more service-oriented elements to malls -- for instance, dividing a closed Sears anchor store into multiple cafes.
But Glimcher is pushing the envelope even further than the standard model of restaurants and expanded food courts, he said, with tenants like Make Meaning (a membership store where people make crafts, cakes and other things) and Drybar (a salon with no scissors, just stylists with blow-dryers).
''They've done a good job of getting the right tenants in there,'' Mr. Milligan said.
Scottsdale shoppers can have their hair blown into beachy waves at Drybar, create picture frames at Make Meaning, try a tree pose at Blissful Yoga and grab a kale salad at True Food Kitchen before going to a movie, where they can have drinks and snacks delivered to their reserved seats.
They can also take advantage of in-person-only opportunities at standard retailers, like the so-called booty cam at Industrie Denim, a jeans store, that lets women study their rear view. A Restoration Hardware scheduled to open soon will offer fresh flowers and cups of tea for sale.
''We want to be a place that people go to frequently, more than one time a week,'' said Mr. Glimcher, so the emphasis is on classes and other hands-on experiences.
Scottsdale Quarter opened in 2009 without a bang. Consumers were pulling back on spending and real estate was troubled. Only a handful of the stores were leased.
Glimcher soon realized that traditional retailing would not work by itself, and leasing agents began collecting intelligence on game-changing candidates.
Jacqueline Fitch, a leasing agent, slipped incognito into a Make Meaning in Manhattan one evening and reported back that a group of older women were discussing a book as they made bracelets.
She also visited Los Angeles to evaluate how well Drybar dealt with her curly hair. This type of retailing ''is also a form of hospitality,'' she said, so checking it out in person was important.
Make Meaning and other businesses of its kind do not typically make as much money per visit as apparel stores. Memberships there cost $36, and an average activity costs $24. But, Mr. Glimcher said, because the store offers seven different crafts, some people come back weekly or monthly instead of dropping in once or twice a year.
Higher foot traffic often translates into higher sales per square foot -- Make Meaning says it makes up to $600 a square foot in some stores -- and concept stores like Make Meaning can buoy other business at the mall.
Daniel Nissanoff, Make Meaning's chief executive, said it ''offers people a reason to come into a mall.'' Activities at Make Meaning often have wait lists -- so shoppers have to kill time at the mall -- and visitors must return to pick up fired pottery or glass jewelry, which means an extra mall visit.
Glimcher's revenue is rising again after a big dip during the recession. Its first-quarter sales rose 9 percent to $69.8 million, with the Scottsdale mall a major contributor to the increase. Scottsdale Quarter makes $1,000 per square foot, the highest figure of any Glimcher mall.
Glimcher is now applying lessons learned in Scottsdale to its other malls, which are largely midrange or outlet properties. While Glimcher malls initially consisted of apparel stores and a food court, Mr. Glimcher said, now service- or experience-oriented stores represent 20 percent of the company's portfolio, and that percentage is increasing. At Scottsdale, 30 of the 53 stores offer dining or some other experience in addition to pure retailing.
Because many retailers signed short-term leases in 2009 and 2010, when the economy was highly uncertain, many leases are up for renewal now, and Glimcher is ousting standard stores where it can.
At its Polaris Fashion Place in Columbus, Ohio, for instance, it recently replaced a Gap with an Apple store. At River Valley Mall in Ohio, it replaced a Dollar Tree with Ulta Beauty, a test-it-and-buy-it cosmetics store.
At a New Jersey outlet mall, Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, it ousted a Benetton and brought in a Lego store, which offers Lego-construction classes.
''It's retail Darwinism,'' Mr. Glimcher said.
Rick J. Caruso, the chief executive of Caruso Affiliated, developer of The Grove, an outdoor mall in Los Angeles, said the shift had shoppers rethinking what a mall could be. The Grove features a concierge and the filming of the entertainment show ''Extra.''
''It's not just about shopping -- it's multidimensional; it's a place you can just hang out and go for a stroll,'' he said. ''You're not doing that in a mall.''
Traditional malls were ''intended to put the old Main Street out of business and divert that shopper,'' Mr. Caruso said. ''It's wonderfully ironic that that whole thing has come back around.''
Tanya Gagnon, a creative director of a design firm who lives in Scottsdale, buys most of her clothing from vintage stores and online. But, she said, she still spends a fair amount of time -- and money -- at Scottsdale Quarter.
''You could spend a whole day there,'' she said. ''They have a range of clothing, but I just forget about it for some reason -- I always think of it for restaurants or entertainment.''

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: An Excess of Testing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The common core standards movement seems to be common sense: Our schools should have similar standards, what students should know at each grade. The movement, however, is based on the false assumption that our schools are broken, that ineffective teaching is the problem and that rigorous standards and tests are necessary to improve things. 
The mediocre performance of American students on international tests seems to show that our schools are doing poorly. But students from middle-class homes who attend well-funded schools rank among the best in the world on these tests, which means that teaching is not the problem. The problem is poverty. Our overall scores are unspectacular because so many American children live in poverty (23 percent, ranking us 34th out of 35 ''economically advanced countries'').
Poverty means inadequate nutrition and health care, and little access to books, all associated with lower school achievement. Addressing those needs will increase achievement and better the lives of millions of children.
How can we pay for this? Reduce testing. The common core, adopted by 45 states, demands an astonishing increase in testing, far more than needed and far more than the already excessive amount required by No Child Left Behind.
No Child Left Behind requires tests in math and reading at the end of the school year in grades 3 to 8 and once in high school. The common core will test more subjects and more grade levels, and adds tests given during the year. There may also be pretests in the fall.
The cost will be enormous. New York City plans to spend over half a billion dollars on technology in schools, primarily so that students can take the electronically delivered national tests.
Research shows that increasing testing does not increase achievement. A better investment is protecting children from the effects of poverty, in feeding the animal, not just weighing it.

HEADLINE: At Fiscal Cliff, Anti-Tax Vow Gets New Look

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats -- holding firm against extending tax cuts for the rich -- are proposing a novel way to circumvent the Republican pledge not to vote for any tax increase: Allow all the tax cuts to expire Jan. 1, then vote on a tax cut for the middle class shortly thereafter.
The proposal illustrates the lengths lawmakers are going to in an effort to include new federal revenues in a fix for the ''fiscal cliff,'' the reckoning in January that would come when all Bush-era tax cuts expire and automatic spending cuts to military and domestic programs kick in.
Virtually every Republican in Congress has taken the pledge, pushed by Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, never to vote for a tax increase -- a pledge both parties see as a serious impediment to a tax compromise. But if tax rates snap back to the levels of the Clinton presidency on Jan. 1, any legislation to reinstate some of those tax cuts -- but not all of them -- would be considered a tax cut. 
''Many Republicans are starting to realize something important: On Jan. 1, if we haven't gotten to a deal, Grover Norquist and his pledge are no longer relevant to this conversation,'' Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said this week in a speech at the Brookings Institution. ''We will have a new fiscal and political reality.''
The idea inflamed passions on both sides on Tuesday, when fiscal issues careening toward Congress roiled hearings and deliberations and spurred political recriminations as Republican leaders accused Democrats of steering the economy back into recession.
''Democrats in Congress are now saying that they would rather see taxes go up on every American at the end of the year than let about a million businesses keep what they earn now,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Tuesday. ''This isn't an economic agenda. It's an ideological crusade.''
Democrats accused Republicans of holding the vast majority of the Bush-era tax cuts hostage to the fraction aimed only at the rich. They praised the tough line adopted by the Democratic leadership, which is aligning with President Obama on the tax issue.
''This is all about leverage being on the side of the Democrats,'' said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. ''If Democrats want to use that leverage, we can't blink.''
Lawmakers on both sides are now lamenting the fiscal train wreck that many of them voted to create, a confluence of spending cuts and tax increases that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Tuesday could send the economy into recession.
At the same time, former Vice President Dick Cheney was meeting with Senate and House Republicans, in part to warn them of the dire consequences he sees in $500 billion in automatic military cuts that will begin to hit on Jan. 2. Off Capitol Hill, a broad bipartisan coalition of fiscal hawks, led by the co-chairman of President Obama's 2010 fiscal commission, Erskine B. Bowles, restarted efforts to pressure Washington to reach a ''grand bargain'' on deficit reduction.
But taxes remain a chasm in the Capitol as Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, moved to force votes in the coming days on Democratic tax proposals.
''If you want to join Democrats to protect the middle class and avoid this fiscal cliff that we hear so much about, all you have to do is say yes,'' Mr. Reid said to Republicans. ''Surely you can at least agree that 98 percent of the families in this country shouldn't see their taxes go up.''
Numerically, Republicans and Democrats are not as far apart as the exchanges would suggest. President Obama has proposed allowing tax cuts to lapse on incomes over $250,000, raising the top two income tax brackets, allowing capital gains tax rates for affluent families to rise slightly and letting dividend income be taxed as ordinary income, as it was before 2003. Of the $5 trillion in tax increases that will ensue over 10 years if nothing is done, Mr. Obama's plan would stave off all but $849 billion.
That tax increase on the rich would amount to 0.38 percent of the economy, considerably smaller than the tax increase secured by President Bill Clinton in 1993, which equaled 0.63 percent of the economy, according to White House calculations.
Next week, Senate Democrats will push tax legislation that makes a significant concession to Republicans. It would secure Mr. Obama's tax increases on the rich, but it would tax dividends and capital gains at a 20 percent rate for households that earn more than $250,000. The White House this year proposed allowing dividends to be taxed again at ordinary income rates, a plan that would increase tax rates on dividends to as high as 44.7 percent, from 15 percent, according to a new report by the accounting firm Ernst & Young.
Neither party was interested Tuesday in emphasizing what their proposals had in common. Republicans highlighted Ernst & Young's conclusion that tax increases on the affluent would cost around 710,000 jobs, cut wages and ''have significant adverse economic effects in the long run.'' Democrats pointed to the line in the report that Republicans tended to drop, which said the adverse economic impacts would hit ''when the resulting revenue is used to finance additional government spending.'' The tax increases Democrats want would instead be part of a deficit reduction package.
Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed to a report by the private equity giant Carlyle Group, which suggested that simply extending all the tax cuts and avoiding the automatic spending cuts in January could be more dangerous than letting the fiscal hammer fall. The ''fiscal cliff'' would lower the nation's indebtedness by $7.8 trillion over 10 years and bring the budget nearly to balance by 2016. In contrast, a last-minute deal to punt the deficit issue down the road would send a signal to world markets that the United States government is not willing to confront its red ink.
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee, said the offer to let all the tax cuts lapse, then reinstate most of them days later, was a legitimate way to free Republicans from their no-new-taxes pledge.
But Mr. Norquist, the keeper of the pledge, said the idea ''doesn't pass the laugh test.''
And Republicans likely to work with Democrats on any deficit deal rejected it out of hand. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, called Ms. Murray's suggestion ''a startling comment for a United States senator.''
Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, said, ''That just doesn't sound sensible to me, with all due respect to Patty,'' adding, ''We should be working on this now.''

HEADLINE: Congress Is Told Libor Flaws Persist

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
9:06 p.m. Updated
Federal authorities cast further doubt on Tuesday about the integrity of a key interest rate that is the subject of a growing investigation into wrongdoing at big banks around the globe.
In Congressional testimony, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission expressed concern that banks had manipulated interest rates for their own gain. They also indicated that flaws in the system - which were highlighted in a recent enforcement case against Barclays - persist.
''If these key benchmarks are not based on honest submissions, we all lose,''Gary Gensler, head of the trading commission, which led the investigation into Barclays, said in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
In separate testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he lacked ''full confidence'' in the accuracy of the rate-setting process.
The Fed faces questions itself over whether it should have reined in the rate-manipulation scheme, which took place from at least 2005 to 2010.
Documents released last week show that the New York Fed was well aware of potential problems at Barclays in 2008. At a hearing in London on Tuesday, British authorities said the New York Fed never told them Barclays was breaking the law.
The scrutiny intensified on Tuesday as Representative Randy Neugebauer, chairman of the House subcommittee investigating the Libor scandal, announced plans to seek additional documents from the New York Fed about JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the three American banks involved in setting interest rates.
The concerns center on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, an essential benchmark that affects the cost of borrowing for consumers and corporations. Trillions of dollars in mortgages and other financial products are tied to Libor, which is set daily based on reports from a panel of large banks.
Several government agencies, including authorities in the United States, Canada, Britain and Japan, are examining whether the banks made bogus reports.
Last month, Barclays agreed to settle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department and the Financial Services Authority of Britain for $450 million. The British bank was accused of reporting false rates that both bolstered its profits and projected an overly rosy image of its health during the financial crisis.
''The conduct occurred regularly and was pervasive,'' Mr. Gensler said on Tuesday.
The actions also happened in plain view of regulators.
In 2008, Barclays informed the New York Fed that it was submitting artificially low rates. The concerns were passed on toTimothy F. Geithner, then the chief executive of the regulatory body.
But the New York Fed did not tell other authorities in the United States or Europe about the specific problems at Barclays. Instead, it proposed changes to the rate-setting process. At the time, Mr. Geithner recommended in an e-mail that British officials ''strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure'' and ''eliminate incentive to misreport,'' according to documents released last week.
''At no stage did he or anyone else at the New York Fed raise any concerns with the bank that they had seen any wrongdoing,'' Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, told a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Geithner.
Mr. King said his discussion with Mr. Geithner did not represent a warning sign about potential illegal activity.
''There was no suggestion of fraudulent behavior,'' the British central bank official told Parliament. His colleague Paul Tucker, who also received the e-mail from Mr. Geithner, echoed his statements, saying in testimony that the recommendations ''didn't set off alarm bells.''
Rather, the British central bank passed along the proposed changes to the British Bankers' Association, a trade group that oversees the rate.
In his testimony on Tuesday, Mr. King said that some of the New York Fed's recommendations were included in a Libor review conducted by the trade group.
The British Bankers' Association also sought feedback from the CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange, according to documents provided to The New York Times. In a July 2008 letter, the exchange argued that the plan ''must have teeth'' and ''credibility.''
In late 2008, the British Bankers' Association adopted changes to the Libor process. But neither the regulators nor the trade group put a stop to Barclays' illegal activities, which continued through 2009.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke issued a broad defense of the Fed's actions in 2008 after it learned that banks were misrepresenting interest rates.
''Isn't there a responsibility to alert the customers?'' SenatorJeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Banking Committee, asked Mr. Bernanke. ''If you had it to do over again, would you also be alerting the customers?''
Mr. Bernanke said it was hardly a secret that Libor was losing credibility. During the financial crisis, the media and the markets were swirling with speculation about problems with the rate-setting process. At the time, the Fed was primarily focused on saving Wall Street from collapse.
''The responsibility of the New York Fed was to make sure that the appropriate authorities had the information, which they did,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
The Barclays case was the first to stem from the broader global investigation, which involves more than 10 other banks, including UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland. While much scrutiny has focused on European banks, authorities are also investigating big Wall Street companies like Citigroup and JPMorgan.
Mr. Gensler on Tuesday said his agency ''has and will continue vigorously to use our enforcement and regulatory authorities to protect the public, promote market integrity, and ensure that these benchmarks and other indices are free of manipulative conduct and false information.''
Banks, Mr. Gensler said, ''must not attempt to influence'' Libor. ''It's just wrong and against the law.''
But the problems may remain, say regulators. On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke said the benchmark still lacked credibility.
''It's clear beyond these disclosures that the Libor system is structurally flawed,'' he told lawmakers.
Binyamin Appelbaum contibuted reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rebalancing the Global Economy

BYLINE: By LI CONGJUN. 
Li Congjun is the president of Xinhua News Agency, the official press agency of the People's Republic of China.

 BODY:
Beijing
A JOKE popular in China in recent years tells of an old Chinese woman and an old American woman who meet in heaven. ''Just before I died, I could finally afford to buy a house,'' the Chinese lady says. The American responds, ''Just before I died, I finally paid off my mortgage.''
Though premised on stereotypes of spendthrift Americans and frugal Chinese, the story helps explain how an imbalanced world economy lost its bearings. 
Two dimensions of the crisis distinguish it from past economic disruptions and explain its tenacity. The first is the paradox of credit, which is simultaneously dynamic and destabilizing. The expansion and dominance of global finance opened the gate for faster capital accumulation and material abundance, but at the same time sowed the seeds of crisis. In the United States, relaxed monetary policies and esoteric financial engineering gave consumers easy access to luxuries like bigger homes, better cars and more vacations, even if they had no savings.
A credit surplus in wealthy countries resulted in a production surplus in emerging, export-oriented countries like China and Brazil. These imbalances have had negative effects for both sides. In the West, manufacturing has been hollowing out for decades as industrialists migrate to developing countries, where labor, equipment and materials are cheaper. Moreover, the middle class has shrunk, as the returns of a finance-driven economy have flowed to ''fat cats'' who control the levers of credit. In emerging economies, urbanization and industrialization have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty but have also exacted a heavy toll on the environment.
The second dimension of the crisis is its interconnected nature. The world is not flat; it is more like a rapidly contracting fishbowl. Globalization explains why the thrashing of a small fish like Greece, which represents 2.3 percent of Europe's economic output, has threatened to drown the Continent. It also explains the plight of a goose farmer I got to know in a remote, mountainous part of Anhui Province. Before the crisis, the down from a single goose could be sold for about 13 yuan (about $2), but after the crisis the same amount of down sold for less than 7 yuan. The farmer's son, a migrant worker, was laid off from a factory, after numerous orders from overseas were canceled.
In the 1970s and 1980s, countries like China and India began to reform their economies, while information technology revolutionized production and marketing. But the global boom that resulted, with fast growth and low inflation, cannot be reproduced. The world economy has not found a new source of momentum since the Internet bubble burst in 2000. Instead, financial institutions, governments and consumers tried to achieve prosperity through reckless lending and borrowing (much of it for housing). Now rising labor and resource costs, growing inflation pressure and large sovereign debts have made fiscal and monetary policy less effective.
What can be done? First, we cannot expect neoliberalism -- privatization, deregulation, free trade -- to revive growth. The credit paradox is only narrowly a financial crisis -- it is a crisis of faith, one that summons us to turn away from a capital-centered economy to a human-centered one. Capital cannot be expected to be self-policing. To prevent it from mortgaging humanity's future, governments must reject laissez-faire attitudes. The ''visible hand'' of government is needed to manage the markets, revamp regulatory systems and bridle reckless behavior. Governments should encourage businesses to invest in the ''real'' economy -- to promote technological innovation and job creation rather than speculation and profiteering.
Second, the world's largest economies -- the United States, China, the European Union -- must improve coordination on macroeconomic policies, as well as regulation and trade, and resist the temptation of protectionism.
Third, balance must be restored: between the financial sector and the real economy; between domestic and overseas demand; between developed and developing countries. China has moved to encourage domestic consumption instead of relying solely on exports.
The Great Depression and the Second World War were followed by revolutions in aeronautics, nuclear energy and space exploration. The oil crisis of the 1970s was followed by an information-technology revolution. Only further innovation in science and technology can promote productivity and eventually lead the world out of the current crisis.
While it is crucial for the United States and China to bolster their own development, they also need to strengthen cooperation in trade, investment, finance, infrastructure, technology and other fields. The two economies have become highly interdependent; last year, bilateral trade topped $450 billion.
Frictions are hardly avoidable, but what's important is for the two sides to handle their differences through coordination based on equality and mutual understanding. Only by acknowledging our extreme interdependence will we make the fishbowl effect work for humanity, rather than against it.

HEADLINE: Steinem Presses Speaker To Back Sick-Leave Bill

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The feminist author Gloria Steinem is leading a campaign to pressure Speaker Christine C. Quinn to allow a City Council vote on a bill that would require businesses to give their employees paid sick leave.
Ms. Steinem, a prominent supporter of Ms. Quinn, has signed a letter along with roughly 200 other influential women in politics, labor and public health, urging Ms. Quinn to bring the measure to a vote. But Ms. Quinn replied that she would not do so now.
In an e-mail, Ms. Steinem said that passage of the legislation would have a disproportionate benefit for women, both because they typically shoulder the burden of caring for sick children and because they are overrepresented in low-wage industries where workers often are not paid or are fired for absence. 
''I've seen women lose their jobs, lose their apartments, and spend two years getting their kids back from foster care -- all starting with a sick child,'' Ms. Steinem wrote.
The proposed bill would require businesses with 20 or more workers to give each nine paid sick days a year, in most cases, or at businesses with 5 to 19 workers, five sick days. It has the support of a veto-proof majority in the City Council, but it is opposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and some members of the business community and has proved vexing for Ms. Quinn, a Democrat who is trying to cultivate business support as she prepares to run for mayor next year.
She shelved an earlier version of the bill in 2010, saying that she was concerned that it would threaten the survival of small businesses.
On Tuesday, Ms. Quinn said in a statement that although she saw providing paid sick leave as a worthy goal, ''with the current state of the economy and so many businesses struggling to stay alive, I do not believe it would be wise to implement this policy, in this way, at this time.''
''I stand by the commitment I made more than a year ago -- to continue to meet and discuss the legislation, in the context of the evolving economy, with council leaders'' and supporters of the measure, she added.
In addition to Ms. Steinem, the letter urging a vote on the measure was signed by, among others, Ruth Messinger, a former Manhattan borough president and the 1997 Democratic nominee for mayor; C. Virginia Fields, a former Manhattan borough president; Betsy Gotbaum, a former public advocate; Marjorie Hill, the chief executive officer of Gay Men's Health Crisis; Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers; the novelist Jhumpa Lahiri; and the actress Cynthia Nixon.
San Francisco, Seattle and Washington all have similar legislation, and Connecticut passed a statewide law last year.
Ms. Steinem's outspoken position seems likely to put Ms. Quinn in a particularly uncomfortable position. Ms. Steinem has been a strong supporter of Ms. Quinn's mayoral ambitions, introducing her at a 500-person fund-raiser last fall.
But in her e-mail, Ms. Steinem said that before she gave her support to Ms. Quinn, she had told her that it was conditional on Ms. Quinn's bringing the paid-sick-day bill to a vote.
''She said that discussions were under way about the size of businesses to be covered,'' Ms. Steinem said of their conversation at the time. She added, ''I'm hoping this can be worked out.''
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.

HEADLINE: Modern Capitalism as a Campaign Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Capitalism Debate,'' by David Brooks (column, July 17):
To say that criticizing the financially successful business practices of Mitt Romney is the same as condemning capitalism misses the point. There are many ways to be successful in business. Just because most companies were outsourcing jobs to be successful doesn't mean that there weren't creative alternatives.
A man running to be the leader of a country should be held to a different standard than the chief executive of a corporation. People rightly want to know if he can create jobs and improve the economy for all people, not just for a few shareholders at the expense of American workers. 
BRIAN BROKER Phoenixville, Pa., July 17, 2012
To the Editor:
I agree wholeheartedly with David Brooks's defense of offshoring and outsourcing as constructive elements of modern capitalism. To the extent the Obama campaign thinks those tactics are global problems, it is mistaken.
Modern capitalism, most avidly practiced by Bain Capital and other private equity firms, seeks profits by employing resources around the globe. As Mr. Brooks notes, the results of that quest can be powerful positives: higher standards of living for overseas workers and lower costs for all consumers, especially American consumers.
That is modern capitalism at its ruthless best, producing a net overall global benefit. But make no mistake -- those tactics entail little or no regard for the American workers and communities that suffer in the process. To the extent that the Obama campaign is contrasting that disregard with Mitt Romney's professed love for all things American, the campaign has a legitimate point.
THOMAS R. HITCHNER Chatham, Mass., July 17, 2012
The writer is a retired venture capitalist.
To the Editor:
Despite all their dodges and sophisticated spin, both David Brooks and Mitt Romney fail to explain exactly how outsourcing creates jobs inside the United States, especially in a period of high unemployment.
LYNDON DODDS San Antonio, July 17, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Policy and the Personal,'' by Paul Krugman (column, July 16):
If Mitt Romney is serious about having a chance to become president, he should stop wasting time and his contributors' unlimited millions, and show voters his tax returns from before 2010. If Mr. Romney has nothing to hide, he should release the returns, put the matter behind him and move on with a clear conscience. Doing so, Mr. Romney will gain substantially in the eyes of voters and generate some trust among many who have doubts about him and his personal wealth and work history.
Presidential candidates must be scrutinized closely and carefully, and be willing to undergo a thorough vetting.
PAUL L. WHITELEY Sr. Louisville, Ky., July 16, 2012
To the Editor:
I am not a fan of Mitt Romney, but the attacks on him concerning Bain Capital's outsourcing of jobs seem misguided. If the allegations are true, Mr. Romney was just doing what any prudent businessman would have done under similar circumstances -- maximizing profits for Bain's investors by lowering costs. Thousands of other businesses have done the same in the past couple of decades. This may be callous and inconsiderate behavior, but that is what the capitalist system rewards.
I'm sure that Mr. Romney well knows that the maximization of profits by reducing business costs is a completely different animal from shepherding a national economy out of a lingering recession. Were he not tethered to the Republican Party, he could probably do a better job of improving the economy than President Obama could. It's Mr. Romney's lack of guts to tell the Republican Party that its economic platform is full of baloney (something he well knows is true) that should be attacked.

HEADLINE: The Price the Chinese Pay for Economic Growth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Steven Rattner (''China's Economy, Still Strong,'' column, July 12) writes, ''emotions and knee-jerk skepticism aside ... the economic picture looks rosy, at least to me.'' 
China's growth has come at a fearsome price for the Chinese people. China leads the world in wealth inequality, pollution, corruption, exploitation of its workers, and punishment of intellectuals, minorities, and artists and writers who speak for justice.
Mr. Rattner acknowledges that ''China may be totalitarian''; yet I wonder why the United States spent billions to defeat totalitarianism in the Soviet Union but has for years eagerly invested billions to prop up and legitimize China's totalitarian dictatorship.
Wall Street investors have profited handsomely from the lost American jobs that have gone to Chinese factories, where workers have no rights.
That so many American investors and policy makers defend the Chinese Communist Party sets a morally repugnant double standard that human rights are not universal, that might makes right, and that totalitarianism isn't so bad after all.

HEADLINE: Intel's Income Rises, but Company Warns of Slower Growth

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The world's largest semiconductor maker is getting pounded by poor consumer demand.
Intel on Tuesday lowered its outlook for the second half of the year based on poor retail demand for personal computers powered by the company's chips and slower growth in emerging markets.
There were some bright spots in Intel's earnings report for the second quarter; demand from corporations for PCs and laptops was good, and net income rose slightly, the company said, beating analysts' expectations. 
Paul Otellini, Intel's chief executive, told analysts in a conference call after the quarterly earnings were announced that revenue would be in the ''3 to 5 percent range, versus high single digits'' of earlier projections. As a result, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., plans to slow hiring for the remainder of the year. At the end of June Intel had about 103,000 employees worldwide.
The rise of alternatives like tablet computers and smartphones has also eroded demand for personal computers. Mr. Otellini expressed optimism that sales of ultrabooks, a kind of lightweight laptop computer that Intel has invested in to compete with the new devices, would eventually revive growth.
''We'll see $699 systems'' for ultrabooks in the fall, Mr. Otellini said. ''In a softer selling season these devices become even more attractive.'' While just a few kinds of ultrabooks have appeared in the last few months, Mr. Otellini said there were ''over 140 designs in the pipeline'' for later this year.
Over 40 of these designs, he said, will have touch-sensitive screens similar to Apple's iPad and iPhone, or the Surface tablet recently announced by Microsoft. Intel would also get a boost from the release of the new Windows 8 operating system by Microsoft, he said.
Intel reported that its net income in the quarter ending in June rose to $2.8 billion, or 54 cents a share, from this time last year. Revenue climbed 5 percent, to $13.5 billion. The company appeared to have sacrificed some of its gross profit margin for the higher revenue, however. Gross margins were at 63.4 percent, compared with 64 percent a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts have been lowering their outlook for semiconductor demand. Analysts had expected 52 cents a share and revenue of $13.56 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.
''What's saving them is lowered expectations,'' said Douglas Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''They are performing on their business better than expected, but it is a mixed bag on growth.''
Intel's performance was significantly better than that of its chief competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. This month AMD warned that its second-quarter revenue would decline about 11 percent from the preceding quarter, instead of the 3 percent growth it had earlier projected. AMD said its results, which will be announced Thursday, had been affected by lower sales of consumer devices and slower economic growth in Europe and China.
Intel is also a major supplier of chips for computer servers, which are increasingly used in cloud-based data systems. Intel said its data center sales grew 15 percent from a year ago, to $2.8 billion. Sales to PC makers rose just 3 percent over the quarter, to $8.7 billion.
Unlike many tech companies, Intel continues to invest heavily in research and development. Intel previously said it would spend $18.3 billion in R&D this year, up from a little over $16 billion in 2011, but Stacy J. Smith, Intel's chief financial officer, said that because of the lowered outlook, the company was cutting this year's R&D to $18.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Romney and Obama Resume Economic Attacks, but There Are a Few Diversions

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and PETER BAKER; Trip Gabriel reported from Irwin, and Peter Baker from San Antonio and Dallas.

 BODY:
IRWIN, Pa. -- The argument between Mitt Romney and President Obama over who is better suited to help American workers get back on their feet got personal again on Tuesday, with Mr. Romney saying he was ''ashamed'' of Mr. Obama for giving government loans to well-connected donors.
The overarching dispute is which candidate's view of government might lift a struggling economy: Mr. Romney's belief in lower taxes and fewer regulations, or Mr. Obama's vision of a vital role for government. 
But the policy debate has descended into an angry tit for tat, with accusations of twists and distortions, ever since Mr. Obama began accusing Mr. Romney of shipping American jobs overseas while in the private sector -- a message that appears to be resonating among some swing-state voters.
Mr. Romney, after a long weekend off the campaign trail, came roaring back by accusing the president of ''crony capitalism.'' He cited Fisker Automotive, which received up to $529 million in federal loan guarantees in 2009 to develop hybrid electric cars, some of which were made in Finland, although the Obama administration says the federal money did not go overseas. Among the company's investors is a venture-capital firm whose partners include John Doerr, a major donor to the president.
''I'm ashamed to say we're seeing our president hand out money to the businesses of campaign contributors,'' Mr. Romney said here in Irwin.
But the impact of Mr. Romney's attack was somewhat blunted by distractions from prominent Republicans. First, Representative Ron Paul of Texas called on Mr. Romney to release more of his tax returns, an appeal echoed by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and National Review, the prominent conservative publication.
More troublesome, John H. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor and a stalwart surrogate for Mr. Romney, had to retract a comment after saying Tuesday, ''I wish this president would learn how to be an American.''
Mr. Sununu, speaking during a press call, recognized the gaffe and rephrased his remark during the same call: ''What I thought I said, but what I didn't say, is the president has to learn the American formula for creating business.'' He apologized later on CNN, saying: ''Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words.''
The off-message moments blew a bit of fog over what the Romney campaign had intended to be a coordinated series of sharp attacks on Mr. Obama over free enterprise. Mr. Romney returned to the trail in Pennsylvania with his campaign struggling to regain its footing after several days of withering attacks from the Obama camp about his tenure at Bain Capital and demands that he release more tax returns to illuminate the extent of his investments in offshore accounts.
At a company that provides services to oil and gas drillers here, Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama for suggesting that entrepreneurs owe their success partly to government investments in education and infrastructure.
''The idea to say that Steve Jobs didn't build Apple, that Henry Ford didn't build Ford Motor, that Papa John didn't build Papa John's Pizza,'' he said, ''it is not just foolishness. It's insulting to every entrepreneur, every innovator in America, and it's wrong.''
''I find it extraordinary that a philosophy of that nature would be spoken by a president of the United States,'' he added.
While Mr. Romney was in Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama was in Texas, where he found himself laying out contrasting economic philosophies with another Republican, former President George W. Bush.
Mr. Obama had flown to Mr. Bush's home state to headline four campaign fund-raisers and, in the process, warn the country against returning to the policies of his predecessor. Mr. Bush separately unveiled a book outlining ideas for reinvigorating an economy that has sputtered along under his successor.
The divergent messages were more an accident of geography and happenstance than a result of planning. Aides to each man said his schedule had been set without knowledge of the other's. But the proximity and timing brought into sharp relief the choices facing the country in this fall's election on polarizing issues like taxes, jobs, growth, regulation and free enterprise.
At the first of four fund-raisers in San Antonio and Austin, Mr. Obama told 1,200 supporters that Republicans, led by Mr. Romney, wanted to return to policies that had led to the economic troubles confronting his presidency.
''We spent almost a decade doing what they prescribed,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And how did it turn out? We didn't see greater job growth. We didn't see middle-class security. We saw the opposite. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes, precisely because there were no regulations that were adequate to the kinds of recklessness that was being carried out.''
He added: ''I don't know how you guys operate in your life. But my general rule is if I do something and it doesn't work, I don't go back to doing it.''
The message was similar to one in most of his campaign speeches, but delivering it in Texas highlighted the person he blames.
Hours later, Mr. Bush released ''The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs,'' a book of essays by economists, including five Nobel Prize winners, offering free-market ideas to spur the economy. ''We'll never fix the deficit without growing the private sector,'' he told a crowd of supporters before some of the economists presented their ideas.
Mr. Bush wrote the foreword and offered no assessment of Mr. Obama's record, in keeping with his post-White House practice of not commenting on his successor. The underlying thrust of the book, though, is the notion that the economy has not been repaired in the three and a half years since Mr. Obama took over, and that more robust actions are needed.
The former president proposed a goal of sustained 4 percent annual growth, which would be ambitious for a country whose growth has averaged just over 3 percent a year since 1948 and is currently below 2 percent. ''We're an economy in transition,'' Brendan Miniter, who edited Mr. Bush's book, said in an interview earlier in the day. ''If we don't set the target higher, if we just continue to stumble along, ultimately we're going to pay a pretty stark price.''

HEADLINE: Diplomats for Afghanistan And Pakistan Are Chosen

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
SAN ANTONIO -- President Obama chose veteran diplomats on Tuesday to fill two of the most difficult overseas posts as he seeks to manage an evolving transition in war-torn Afghanistan while repairing relations with neighboring Pakistan after a period of deep friction. 
While Mr. Obama made a campaign swing through Texas, the White House announced that he would nominate James B. Cunningham, deputy envoy in Kabul, to be the new ambassador to Afghanistan. He chose another member of the Kabul embassy staff, Richard G. Olson, who until recently oversaw economic affairs and development, to be the new ambassador to Pakistan.
Mr. Cunningham would succeed Ryan C. Crocker, who is leaving Kabul for health reasons after less than a year in the post, while Mr. Olson would take over in Islamabad for Cameron P. Munter, who is leaving after two years.
If confirmed by the Senate, both men face daunting tasks. Mr. Obama plans to shift the war in Afghanistan increasingly to Afghan forces over the next year and to withdraw most American forces by 2014.
Ties with Pakistan have been strained over American drone strikes in the country's tribal areas, the unilateral American raid into Pakistani territory to kill Osama bin Laden and an American airstrike that mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, and resulted in Pakistan's cutting off supply routes into Afghanistan for seven months in protest. The routes were reopened this month.
Mr. Cunningham previously served as ambassador to Israel, consul general in Hong Kong and deputy representative to the United Nations. Mr. Olson served as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates as well as deputy chief of mission at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

HEADLINE: Texas Counties Fear Residents Will Pay the Price of Perry's Medicaid Rebuff

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Gov. Rick Perry's decision on July 9 to refuse two key provisions of the federal health care law -- the expansion of Medicaid and the creation of a state insurance exchange -- is already being fiercely debated by lawmakers in Austin. But the real impact of the move will be felt far from the Texas Capitol, in the chambers of the commissioners who oversee the state's counties.
In Texas, the burden of paying for the health care of the uninsured falls largely on county residents, whose property taxes help support so-called safety-net hospitals like Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston and University Medical Center of El Paso. Last fiscal year, taxpayers in Houston's Harris County supplied $504 million and those in El Paso County $54 million to maintain and operate the public hospital districts that treated uninsured Texans in the two counties.
Several local leaders, health policy analysts and officials at urban hospitals across the state said Mr. Perry's decision to reject billions of federal dollars that Texas would receive in a Medicaid expansion would hurt county taxpayers and the hospitals they support, forcing them to continue to pick up much of the tab for treatment of the uninsured. 
Last year, the El Paso County Hospital District, which includes University Medical Center, asked county commissioners to raise property taxes to make up for cuts to Medicaid passed by the State Legislature and to address the growing number of uninsured patients. The commissioners, including Daniel R. Haggerty, the lone Republican, approved the tax increase, the first the county had authorized for the hospital district in 22 years. The average increase for homeowners was about $13 a year.
''I understand the governor is probably trying to make a political move here,'' Mr. Haggerty said. ''He hasn't got a clue as to what our situation is and what our problems are. He's saying, 'You guys figure it out.' That's fine. I understand how it works.''
Referring to the California city that voted this month to file for bankruptcy, Mr. Haggerty added, ''I hope we can pull this off without pulling a San Bernardino and saying, 'We're bust.' ''
In San Antonio, George B. Hernandez Jr., the president and chief executive of University Health System, which is financed in part by Bexar County taxpayers and includes University Hospital, used the calculator on his iPhone to talk about the impact of Mr. Perry's decision. The system runs a financial-assistance program called CareLink that subsidizes the costs of health care to the uninsured. Mr. Hernandez said 26,600 CareLink members would qualify for coverage if Medicaid was expanded and would no longer rely on the county subsidies. The annual cost of CareLink is roughly $2,000 per member, so a Medicaid expansion in 2014 would save the system $53.2 million a year.
''There are consequences to it, and the consequences are to local taxpayers,'' Mr. Hernandez said of not expanding Medicaid. ''There's an opportunity for tax relief that we're passing up.''
In rejecting Washington's proposals in an interview on Fox News and in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, the federal secretary of health and human services, Mr. Perry emphasized his philosophic opposition to expanding Medicaid and creating a state exchange, and did not address the financial concerns of county leaders and public hospital officials. The refusal was only the latest example of Mr. Perry's long opposition to what he sees as the overreach of Washington into state affairs. In 2009, he rejected $556 million in federal stimulus money for the state's unemployment insurance program, saying too many strings were attached.
''Every Texan has health care in this state,'' Mr. Perry said on Fox News. ''From the standpoint of being able to have access to health care, every Texan has that. How we pay for it and how we deliver it should be our decision, not some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., that may have never been to Texas a day in their life or, for that matter, in any of the other 49 states, trying to mandate this one-size-fits-all health care.''
Among the states, Texas has the highest uninsured rate, 24 percent, and the second-highest number of uninsured residents, 5.6 million children and adults, according to state and federal health officials.
By expanding Medicaid, the government health-insurance program for low-income and sick people, and by creating an online exchange to help residents and small businesses buy health coverage, Texas would reduce the uninsured rate to 12 percent, or about 2.9 million residents, state health officials said.
The federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid for the first three years, and in the years that followed, Texas would never pay more than 10 percent. The expanded program would cost the state roughly $16 billion over 10 years, not $26 billion as originally estimated, Thomas M. Suehs, the Texas health and human services commissioner, told a state House Appropriations Subcommittee on Thursday. Though the state would receive $100 billion in additional federal money in a Medicaid expansion over that period, Mr. Suehs said he agreed with the governor's position.
''There's enough money in the Medicaid system -- we just don't spend it very wisely,'' he told legislators. ''Let's fix what we currently have first before you debate the issue of what you want to expand and how you want to expand.''
Community health advocates and others criticized the governor's decision as long on talk but short on solutions or alternatives. Mr. Perry and his aides said he had indeed put forward a solution by calling on the federal government to allocate Medicaid financing as block grants so each state could tailor its Medicaid program to the needs of its residents. Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, said that in opposing the expansion of Medicaid, the governor had the concerns of taxpayers in mind.
''The bottom line is that whether at the federal, state or local level, expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would cost billions of tax dollars and increase the burden on hard-working taxpayers,'' she said in a statement. ''States and local governments can't simply print money to cover the cost of this program when the federal government leaves us holding the bag.''
Despite Mr. Perry's rejection of key components of President Obama's health care overhaul, Texas and its residents continue to benefit from various federal programs created by the law.
From August 2010 to March 2012, the federal government paid more than $100 million in claims to about 5,100 Texans in the federally run Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, which provides health insurance to people denied coverage by private insurers because of pre-existing conditions like cancer or diabetes. And nearly two years before Mr. Perry formally turned down the creation of a health exchange, Texas was awarded a $1 million federal grant in 2010 to plan for one.
Texas later returned about $900,000 of that money, state and federal officials said.

HEADLINE: For Now, the Fed Is Doubtful of More Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Tuesday that the Fed was seeking greater clarity about the health of the recovery, suggesting that officials were not ready to approve another round of stimulus.
Mr. Bernanke repeated the Fed's June assessment that economic growth has slowed, and is likely to remain slow. And he renewed his warning that scheduled tax increases and spending cuts would tip the economy back into recession.
Rather than committing to new steps, Mr. Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee that the decision would turn on the judgment of Fed officials about the pace of job growth in the coming months. 
The major issue, he said, is ''whether or not there is in fact a sustained recovery going on in the labor market, or are we stuck in the mud?'' Mr. Bernanke added a wrinkle, saying the central bank ''would certainly want to react against any increase in deflation risk.''
With the unemployment rate stalled above 8 percent and some measures of inflation expectations falling, some analysts read Mr. Bernanke's remarks as indicating action was likely in the coming months. The next meeting of the central bank's top policy committee is late in July.
Major stock market indexes fell immediately after Mr. Bernanke's prepared remarks were made public but gradually rose as he took questions and seemed more open to additional stimulus.
But Mr. Bernanke's cautious language underscored the Fed's reluctance to ride again to the aid of a plodding economy. The central bank has intervened repeatedly to prevent backsliding into recession, and Mr. Bernanke repeated his standard promise to maintain that vigilance. But the Fed has not acted with similar urgency to reduce the persistently high rate of unemployment.
Mr. Bernanke also noted the Fed could take other steps, such as indicating that short-term interest rates would remain near zero beyond the end of 2014.
''We are looking for ways to address the weakness in the economy, should more actually be needed,'' he told the committee.
Mr. Bernanke appears before the House and Senate twice each year to discuss his management of the nation's monetary policy. But the senators showed relatively little interest in that subject, focusing their questions instead on revelations that banks had manipulated Libor, a benchmark interest rate that figures in determining the value of a wide range of financial assets.
''I just wanted to touch briefly on monetary policy before moving on to the Libor scandal,'' Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, in an amusingly frank acknowledgment of the hearing's focus.
In response to questions from members of both parties, Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed had responded properly when it learned of problems with Libor by notifying British regulators, and by offering suggestions for improvements. He said he still lacked ''full confidence'' in the integrity and accuracy of the index because those suggestions had not been followed.
And he spoke favorably of nascent efforts to supplant Libor with benchmarks that are based on an ''observable market rate.''
Mr. Bernanke's economic outlook was tinged by mentions of new signs of a slowdown. He noted new weakness in manufacturing and business spending, areas of strength earlier this year. He also said that ''fiscal strains associated with the crisis in Europe have increased since earlier in the year.''
Inflation has also weakened. The government's index of consumer prices was unchanged in June and rose 1.7 percent over the previous 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. A narrower measure that offers a clearer view of trends, because it excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2 percent in June and 2.2 percent over 12 months.
And the so-called fiscal cliff is looming. The combination of higher taxes and cuts in federal spending set for the end of the year ''would probably knock the economy back into a recession and cost a lot of jobs,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
He again urged Congress to adopt a plan that would limit any short-term changes in fiscal policy, while agreeing on long-term steps to reduce the ''unsustainable'' growth of the federal debt.
''The most effective way that Congress could help to support the economy right now,'' he said in his prepared testimony, ''would be to work to address the nation's fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility of the recovery.''
These problems were sufficient for the Fed to announce a modest expansion in its efforts to stimulate growth after its policy making committee met in June. It said that it would continue to buy long-term Treasury securities until year's end.
Republicans pressed Mr. Bernanke to forswear additional action, warning that new measures would eventually lead to higher inflation and suggesting that the Fed's policies were allowing Congress to delay a reckoning with the federal debt. Mr. Bernanke rejected both arguments. Of standing still to put pressure on Congress, he said dryly, ''I don't think that's my responsibility.''
In a shift from earlier hearings, some Democrats put countervailing pressure on Mr. Bernanke to agree that he should do more. ''I'm afraid the Fed is the only game in town,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''And I would urge you to take whatever actions you think would be appropriate.''
But Mr. Bernanke said only that he took seriously the Fed's dual mandate to maximize employment and control inflation.
He will testify Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.

HEADLINE: Christie's Brashness Blunts Hopes to Join Ticket

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Chris Christie asked for an audience at the Brookings Institution last week, and being one of the nation's most popular and provocative governors, got one.
Before a capacity crowd, he contrasted his commanding executive style with an ''aloof'' president. With his usual blend of bombast, self-deprecation and choreographed frankness, he positioned himself as a master of compromise who could straight-talk Washington out of its partisan torpor.
The appearance was a reminder why some prominent conservatives and Republican donors have been promoting Mr. Christie as the perfect running mate for Mitt Romney. He has a record of fiscal conservatism in a moderate state. His aggressive approach to political combat has excited the Tea Party contingent, but he also has influential allies on Wall Street and in other power centers of the Republican Party. His rumpled, real-guy persona would complement Mr. Romney's wealthy, pressed-jeans image.
Democrats in New Jersey, his home state, mocked his address at Brookings as the ''Tampa Try-Out Tour,'' his audition for a role at the Republican nominating convention later this summer. 
But Mr. Christie's star has faded as a potential vice-presidential pick. As polls show that his bluntness is striking more voters as bullying, Republicans close to Mr. Romney's campaign say that the governor's continued hostile encounters -- including one on the Jersey Shore this month that was caught on video -- have augmented fears that he is too unpredictable and too contentious, turning what was once viewed as a key strength into a drawback.
A decision to pass on Mr. Christie would highlight the more cautious approach Mr. Romney appears to be taking -- by all indications he has been leaning toward measured personalities like Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor, or Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. This may reflect the lessons of the last presidential race, when a Republican running mate who seemed authentic and exciting went rogue.
But if Mr. Christie is not chosen, it would inevitably raise questions about his future in national politics, as it would with the other people who will soon find themselves on a list of almost-contenders.
Mr. Christie, 49, has made clear that not being selected as the vice-presidential nominee, after his public dalliance with running for the top spot on the ballot, would not be the end of his national ambitions -- he has said that he thinks he will be a better candidate in 2016, suggesting that he thinks President Obama will win re-election.
But before then, he will need to balance his courtship of the national spotlight with the less glamorous realities of governing a state that is dogged by high unemployment, large revenue shortfalls and continuing political acrimony. And he must win re-election next year in conditions that are not as favorable to him as they were when he was elected in 2009. As many before him have discovered, a few extra years in office can remove a lot of the shine from a political star.
''This guy changes the nature of how politicians act in this country,'' said Jon M. Bramnick, the leader of the Republican minority in the State Assembly. A trial lawyer and stand-up comic, Mr. Bramnick calls Mr. Christie's delivery and timing ''as close to magical as I've seen.''
''I'm not talking about calling someone an idiot,'' he said, referring to the epithet Mr. Christie has used at least twice publicly. ''But the way he was able to take on special interests in a direct way. He said what he meant and didn't hedge his bets, and people liked it. Politicians have been afraid to be that direct. He made it O.K.''
Only Mr. Romney and Beth Myers, who is leading the search for a running mate, know who is on the shortlist. But the speculation of Mr. Christie, a former United States attorney, as a running mate began almost immediately after his election. It grew in volume after he turned down entreaties to run for president and instead to much fanfare announced that he was supporting Mr. Romney, an endorsement that helped the campaign's courtship of both moderate leaders and conservative activists.
One top adviser to Mr. Romney said that the governor had done ''everything he said he would do for Mitt and more'' since that announcement. This week, Mr. Christie was traveling through six states to raise money for him.
Aides and advisers to Mr. Romney, who acknowledge that he was never going to be the safest choice, privately say that they are troubled by Mr. Christie's temper, calling it unsettling and out of step with Mr. Romney's temperament. (Indeed, some took it as a clear sign that he will not be picked when Ann Romney said in an interview that she expected her famously button-down husband to select a running mate with the ''same personality type.'')
In January, Mr. Christie went on television and urged Mr. Romney to release more of his tax records, just as the candidate was trying to argue he had disclosed enough. Last month, donors at a New York fund-raiser reported that Mr. Romney had been peeved when the governor showed up late to an event where he was supposed to introduce the candidate, leaving Mr. Romney to introduce Mr. Christie instead.
Mr. Christie is not eager to share a spotlight -- during the battle for the Republican nomination, he declined invitations to campaign for Mr. Romney where he would have been on stage with others.
''Nobody doubts that he's a good attack dog,'' said Brad Lawrence, a Democratic media strategist in the state. ''But he is not going to subsume his own brand for anyone else's.''
While his supporters have celebrated his attacks on Democrats, Mr. Christie has drawn criticism for going after average citizens with the same gusto. TMZ.com this month posted a video that captured him taunting a man who had apparently criticized the governor's battles with teachers one evening on the Jersey Shore.
As the man walked away, Mr. Christie, who was eating an ice cream cone, followed him, repeatedly hollering, ''You're a real big shot'' and ''Keep walking,'' until another man put an arm around the governor and led him away.
Pollsters suggest this style hurts him particularly with women. In a Rutgers-Eagleton poll in June, 56 percent of male voters and 45 percent of female voters in New Jersey felt favorably toward the governor, but 45 percent of women viewed him unfavorably.
A Quinnipiac poll released on Tuesday showed the percentage of voters calling him more of a leader than a bully dropping to 50 percent from 54 percent in April, while the percentage of those calling him more of a bully than a leader rose to 45 percent from 39 percent.
Even Republicans in New Jersey acknowledge that Mr. Christie won in 2009 because the Democratic incumbent, Jon S. Corzine, was deeply unpopular.
Once in office, Mr. Christie seized on public resentment about government spending and entitlements to push through changes to public employee benefits, impose a cap on property taxes and end the practice of giving teachers tenure automatically after three years.
In the town-hall-style meetings that have become his preferred method of delivering messages (he has done 88 in 18 months), he boasts of his skill getting a Democrat-led Legislature to buckle. But what is often left out is that the changes were things that had first been proposed by Democrats who were coming in when Mr. Christie took office.
''It's like the guy who catches the little fish, then by the time he's done telling you the story, it's a 60-pound tuna,'' said Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president and a Gloucester County Democrat who initially proposed the pension changes and property tax cap.
The theme of the second half of Mr. Christie's term, ''the New Jersey Comeback,'' is a tougher sell.
New Jersey's unemployment rate is still, at 9.2 percent, higher than the national average. Revenues are at about half of what the governor projected in his budget, leaving open the real possibility of deep budget cuts later in the year. A Standard & Poor's report called Mr. Christie's budget ''structurally unbalanced.''
Democrats, smelling weakness, are trying to grab the mantle of fiscal responsibility, passing legislation that denied a 10 percent income tax cut the governor was seeking unless revenue comes in according to his predictions.
Mr. Christie is ceding nothing, in what seems like a two-front strategy. At home he is attacking Democrats in robocalls and radio advertisements for blocking his tax cuts. Then he goes on television shows and talks like a moderate, about strolling ''the boulevard of compromise.''
His advisers say he will continue to seek national audiences like the one at Brookings. And his relentless brand promotion continues. Two days after the Brookings speech, he shared his list of ''Christie by the numbers'' on Twitter.
YouTube views: 5 million. Twitter followers: 125,820. Facebook likes: 60,755. Questions about running for president/vice president: ''Too many to count.''

HEADLINE: Unions' Past May Hold Key to Their Future

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Organized labor is in free fall. The number of workers who belong to a union has plummeted about 20 percent over the last decade. Only 8 percent of all workers are unionized. And leading labor activists are wringing their hands over the seemingly inevitable death of a movement unable to cope with technological change.
''I see no reason to believe that American trade unionism will so revolutionize itself within a short period of time as to become in the next decade a more potent social force than it has been in the past decade,'' warns one of the nation's foremost economists.
The description sounds like the labor movement today. But the statistics are from 1930. George E. Barnett, president of the American Economic Association, issued the warning at the depth of the Great Depression in 1932. 
Mr. Barnett proved to be quite wrong. A decade after his speech at the group's annual meeting in Cincinnati, one in five American workers belonged to a union. Some 10 years later, organized labor was at the peak of its power.
While it would be naive to invest too much faith in this mistake as a precedent, history offers some clues about how the labor movement -- once again on the mat, pummeled into insignificance by economic forces beyond its control -- might recover its relevance to American workers and society.
Today, fewer than one in 14 private sector workers belongs to a union, half the portion of 15 years ago. Where unions matter most -- fighting for workers' share of the spoils of economic growth -- they lost the battle long ago. Despite soaring worker productivity, the typical American worker takes home today only 2 percent more than a quarter of a century ago, after adjusting for inflation.
Yet while union leaders have spent the last decade fretting, they have been unable to reverse the downward trend.
Partly, this has to do with the diagnosis of the problem. Many union leaders still like to believe that an ideological shift spun the labor movement into a death spiral. Elected in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan set out to destroy obstacles to unfettered markets -- including organized labor -- with ideological assistance from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.
The ideological assault on unions changed workplace norms. In the United States, company executives who had tolerated unions as standard features of the workplace started spending billions to fight them off.
Losing control of the factory floor, unions lost touch with society, too. In the 1950s and '60s, union contracts set a standard that was followed across the economy. Today, they are too weak to be standard-setters. And nonunion workers tend to resent rather than applaud the better pay and benefits of their unionized brethren.
Only about one in five Americans say they trust unions, according to polling by Gallup, the same share that trust banks or big business. And unions' once impressive political clout has been overwhelmed by a wave of corporate money. Their biggest campaign this spring, trying to remove Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin from office after he rolled back collective bargaining rights for state employees, ended last month in ignominious defeat.
But this reading of history misses a fundamental part of the story. Notably, it underplays the impact of globalization, which intensified competition and spurred businesses to slash labor costs. And it ignores technology, which changed the nature of work.
In the 1920s, unions were as unprepared for change as they are today. Dorian T. Warren, a professor of political science at Columbia University, notes that at the turn of the 20th century, guilds were organized around crafts, like carpentry or glass blowing.
This structure gave organized labor enormous power in the economy. Running apprenticeship programs, guilds controlled the supply of labor at the time. But it left labor unions unprepared for the subsequent arrival of large corporations, which hired unskilled workers directly, without the imprimatur of a guild.
When organized labor bounced back in the late 1930s, Mr. Warren observed, it was in a different form, as big, inclusive industrial unions that organized workers at the company level, not by skill. Crucially, the unions understood that part of their job was to ensure that a labor contract would not put a company at a competitive disadvantage. They had to remove wages from competition. That was essential to their success. Otherwise, corporations would fight them to the death.
But no model of labor relations can last forever. This one worked as long as the United States remained largely a closed economy. Unions roughly ensured that working standards improved uniformly across many industrial sectors. If they negotiated higher wages or better working conditions at one airline or car company, others quickly followed -- even nonunion shops, which hoped to appease workers and prevent them from voting for a union.
Yet economic changes upended the pattern again. The new jobs created around the revolution in information technology of the late 20th century did not fit the mold of the corporations of old. New companies relied more on independent contractors and freelance work. The lifelong relationship established between industrial companies and their workers gave way to looser, shorter dalliances.
Perhaps most important, globalization exposed America's industrial-era titans to more intense competition. The emergence of powerful rivals overseas, where labor was cheap and unions scarce, made it more difficult for companies to improve wages and working conditions without becoming less competitive. And corporations, especially new high-tech companies that arose in southern states where labor law made it tougher to organize, turned against unions as albatrosses around their necks.
Unsurprisingly, a majority of unionized workers today are employed by the government, the last sector of the economy that is largely protected from foreign competition. ''We are forced to conclude that a resurgence of labor unions in the private sector in the foreseeable future is unlikely,'' wrote the labor market scholars Henry S. Farber and Bruce Western of Princeton University a decade ago, echoing Mr. Barnett's thoughts 70 years before. And things have only deteriorated for the unions since then.
But if the prospects look grim for the unions of America's industrial era, the precedent of the 1930s -- when workers organized in droves -- offers perhaps a hint of a path for organized labor as the economy works its way forward from the Great Recession, a role that perhaps better fits the nation's corporate makeup.
The future labor movement may have to give up organizing work site by work site. Its biggest political fight in the last few years -- pushing a law to make it easier to organize a workplace -- may be irrelevant. And fighting to create new barriers to foreign competition is probably a lost cause. Instead of negotiating for their members only, unions might do better pulling for better wages and conditions for all workers.
Some scholars, like the economist Richard B. Freeman of the National Bureau of Economic Research, suggest the labor movement could take a page from the AARP's playbook and become a lobbying group. German-like worker councils could discuss workplace issues with management, without negotiating over pay.
Maybe unions don't have to entirely give up collective bargaining but broaden it. A model might be the alliance between the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Domestic Workers Alliance of New York City to push for a bill of rights for nonunionized nannies and maids.
In any event, 80 years from now, labor organizations will probably look as different as our current unions look when compared with the guilds of 80 years ago. Today's strongest unions -- of autoworkers and airline pilots -- could easily be the weakest, decimated by international competition. Unions may well be strongest in hospitals, hotels and other businesses not exposed to international trade.
Union leaders understand this -- to a point. They are slowly beginning to experiment with new models of organization. Time is not on their side, however. If they fail to embrace radical change, in 80 years unions may not be around at all.

HEADLINE: In Trade Deal With Russia, U.S. Plans Sanctions for Human Rights Abuses

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the two decades since the end of the cold war, the United States has extended its economic reach to the far corners of the old Communist world, establishing full-fledged trade ties with the likes of Ukraine, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. Even still-Communist nations like China and Vietnam have been granted full trading status. But not Russia.
That seems about to change. For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, a bipartisan coalition in Congress has agreed to normalize trade relations with Russia, the onetime adversary in the long struggle between capitalism and communism. But at a time of renewed tension with Moscow, lawmakers have decided to grant the status with one large caveat -- that Russian officials be held responsible for human rights abuses. 
Legislation moving through the House and Senate with support from both parties would lift restrictions imposed in the 1970s under the so-called Jackson-Vanik law, permanently establishing normal trade relations with Russia, one of just a handful of nations left in the world still denied them. In doing so, Congress would potentially double Russian-American trade and fulfill a goal that eluded Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
Yet in imposing sanctions for human rights violations, lawmakers are defying not just the Kremlin of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, but also President Obama, who while embracing the normalization of trade lobbied against mixing the issues. In effect, foreign policy experts said, the legislation represents a judgment by Congress that in his effort to repair relations with Moscow, Mr. Obama has not paid enough attention to freedom and democracy.
''Many react against 'giving Putin' something when he misbehaves so badly both on human rights and toward the United States,'' said Anders Aslund, a Russia expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. If the lever of Jackson-Vanik is surrendered, ''the Congress then wants to have it replaced with another lever.''
The Senate Finance Committee will consider the measure on Wednesday, and aides expect a strong bipartisan vote. The issue has taken on urgency because Russia will join the World Trade Organization by the end of summer, and without normal trade status, American firms like Boeing and John Deere will not be able to take advantage of the reduced barriers.
''American businesses win increased market access to Russia without giving up a single thing in return -- no tariff changes, no market concessions, nothing,'' Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said in a statement. To address human rights, he is incorporating a bill known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, named for a Russian lawyer who was arrested and died in prison after investigating official corruption.
In an attempt to press the Soviet Union to allows Jews to leave, Congress enacted the Jackson-Vanik law in 1974. It denied favored trade treatment to Communist countries that hindered freedom of emigration and was named after its Democratic sponsors, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and Representative Charles Vanik of Ohio. Since the Soviet collapse, presidents have lifted the restrictions for Russia each year on the grounds that Moscow had stopped preventing emigration, but none of them could persuade Congress to eliminate the strictures permanently.
That failure had little substantive effect on trade but was a sore point for Russian leaders who bristled at the Jackson-Vanik stigma and what they considered a broken promise. Now that Russia has finally won membership in the World Trade Organization, it will have a tangible effect for the first time because only countries with permanent trade relations qualify for eased W.T.O. trading rules.
''This isn't a gift to Russia,'' Philip H. Gordon, an assistant secretary of state, said in an interview. ''We're doing this for us and our firms.''
Businesses have been lobbying to lift Jackson-Vanik, a move that Mr. Aslund estimates would double annual American exports to Russia to $19 billion in five years.
''Our competitors from every other W.T.O. member country will not hesitate to take market share away from American companies, thus jeopardizing American jobs,'' said Edward Verona, president of the United States-Russia Business Council.
The Magnitsky measure requires the denial of visas and freezing of assets of Russian officials deemed responsible for abuses. The Obama administration lobbied against attaching it to the trade bill, arguing that it had already denied visas for some people tied to Mr. Magnitsky's death.
''We very much share the goals and aims of such legislation,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''We agree with those senators who think Russia hasn't done what's necessary to identify those responsible for Mr. Magnitsky's death, and we share the broader democracy and human rights goals.''
But lawmakers rebuffed the administration and insisted on linking the issues.
''It's frankly a decisive repudiation of the administration's approach to Russia,'' said Randy Scheunemann, a foreign policy adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, in the 2008 presidential election who is now working with Russian opposition figures supporting the Magnitsky bill. The administration ''put human rights beyond the back burner,'' he said.
The administration has privately conceded that the trade and human rights measures will be merged and is trying to massage the language. While some officials once wanted to broaden the sanctions to apply worldwide rather than singling out Russia, the administration has rejected that approach, worried it would complicate relations with nations like China and Saudi Arabia. The Senate bill applies worldwide; a separate House bill applies only to Russia.
Russia has threatened retaliation, and lawmakers from Moscow visited Washington last week to lobby against the sanctions, arguing that Mr. Magnitsky was not the hero his backers suggest, but they won little traction on Capitol Hill. Mr. Magnitsky's mother, Natalia Magnitskaya, responded with a letter denouncing their statements about her son, calling them ''shameful and not deserving of the honorable title of people's representative.''
Vladimir Kara-Murza, a well-known Russian journalist working in Washington, was fired after he supported the Magnitsky bill. Mr. Kara-Murza said his dismissal showed ''how afraid corrupt officials and human rights violators'' in Russia are. ''This bill hits them where it hurts, closing access to their ill-gotten gains in the West,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Sustainability Q & A: Bill McKibben

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: Bill McKibben is considered one of the most important environmentalists in the United States. He talked to Rendezvous about why Rio+20 failed and what must be done now. 

 BODY:
Bill McKibben is an environmental activist, professor, author and the founder of 350.org, an international organization fighting climate change.
In his latest best-selling book, "Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet," he describes how much the planet has already changed and what civilization needs to do now in order to survive.
Mr. McKibben attended Rio+20 - the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development -in June and co-signed a letter critical of the organizers titled "The Rio+20 we don't want."
Q.
 In 1992, 12-year-old Severn Cullis-Suzuki gave a speech at the Rio Earth Summit demanding action on global sustainability from the adults. Twenty years on, did the adults fail her?
A.
 Yep. The first Rio conference was hopeful, but it would have taken real courage from leaders to make that hope real. It would have meant standing up to the fossil fuel industry. Almost none of them turned out to have that courage.
Q.
 What was the single biggest problem with the recent sustainability meeting in Rio?
A.
 No one could make useful commitments because their national capitols remain hostage to the fossil fuel industry. Think about the U.S., which has to supply some leadership if we're going to get anything done. 
Q.
 You reportedly took part in some "unsanctioned" protest action at the meeting? What point were you making?
We (mostly youth) been sitting in for an hour at the UN rio meeting. Security threatening to kick us out.Good energy! #riofail
- Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) June 21, 2012
A.
 That none of us wanted to lend our credibility to the effort by continuing to participate in what's largely become a charade.
Q.
 Many watchers criticized countries for not sending their top leaders to the summit. Is the global economic crisis to blame for a temporary shift in focus, or is this a more systemic long-term sweeping under the rug?
A.
 I fear we weren't doing much even before the economic crisis. I think the UN effort will be a sideshow until we are able to match the power of the coal and oil barons.
Q.
 What was the best thing to come out of the Rio+20 meeting?
A.
 As always, the chance for civil society to come together and plan. The official meetings are pointless but they do provide an excuse to get together. 
Q.
 The Rio meeting was last month. When is the next big event for global sustainability?
A.
 It's already happened - the great American heatwave, which reminded lots of us at what's at stake.

HEADLINE: In Mysore, Keeping Sanskrit Alive on Newsprint

BYLINE: RAKSHA KUMAR


HIGHLIGHT: The world's only Sanskrit-language daily newspaper is in danger of folding. 

 BODY:
In the sleepy old part of Mysore, there is frantic activity at dawn in one small alley, as Sampath and Jayalakshmi Kumar are busy at work. "This might not pay, but it is something I have devoted my life to," said Sampath Kumar, editor of Sudharma, as he stands in front of an old typesetting machine that is used to publish newspapers.
Sudharma, which means "good faith" in Sanskrit, is world's only Sanskrit-language daily newspaper that reports on the affairs of the world. Four pages in all, about 12 inches long, the paper covers a wide range of issues like India's economic policy, politics, sports and weather. Sudharma's circulation is a little under 2,000 copies per day, which go to Sanskrit scholars and students across India and abroad. 
In 1970, when Mr. Kumar's father, Varadaraja Iyengar, wanted to start the newspaper, he was met with resistance from various fronts. Not many people believed that Sanskrit, whose use declined in political and literary circuits in the 12th or the 13th century, had a vocabulary sufficient enough to cover the contemporary and complex activities and developments of each day. Mr. Iyengar took up this challenge by himself. "He just wanted to keep a 'dead' language alive," Mr. Kumar said.
The question people were asking then was a natural one - why attempt to keep a dead language alive? "Sanskrit is an essential tool for anyone who wishes truly to understand India's history over any longer period than the last two or three centuries," said Professor J. L. Brockington, vice president of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies. "A proper understanding of its past is vital for any culture to truly stay alive -- all the more so when, as is the case for India, that past stretches over so long a continuous period."
Mr. Iyengar , who died in 1990, believed that the language was dying because it was not flexible enough to adapt to the changing times, said Nagaraja Rao, who has been the editorial head of Sudharma since its start. "And, therefore, we began simplifying Sanskrit," he said. "We started adapting the language to express the ideas of modern India, what is happening in the elections, change of governments, the accidents on the road, et cetera. We had to invent new words to express new ideas like train, bus, police, democracy et cetera."
Editing the paper takes Sampath Kumar more than five hours a day. He also translates news from other newspapers and tries to source articles from Sanskrit scholars from across the world.
Mr. Kumar's wife, Jayalakshmi, who was also a student of Sanskrit language, is the only other permanent employee. "Enjoying what you do is more important," she said, smiling. "The money will follow on its own."
As for the money, the newspaper barely breaks even on most days, with revenue coming purely from subscribers -- Indian subscribers pay 400 rupees ($7.20) a year, while overseas subscribers pay $50 - and donations, given largely by Sanskrit scholars. Sometimes the paper is solely funded by the Kumars, who produce the newspaper in the basement of their home. The office and the printing press together are smaller than a basketball court.
"The only reason we still continue to publish the paper despite all odds is because people tell us that they are extremely happy about the Language of Gods, or the Deva Bhasha, being brought to the people," said Mr. Rao, "That we are making it Manava Bhasha - Language of the Common Man."
Robert Goldman, a professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, Berkeley, said, "For the readers of Sudharma, having a daily journal of news and culture in Sanskrit is more a matter of pride and pleasure than of necessity. After all, no one actually needs to have his or her daily news reported in Sanskrit as there are many other sources of news in modern regional, national and international languages and, frankly, no one is truly monolingual in Sanskrit anymore."
For now, Sudharma's greatest challenge is to find more readers. "In our estimate, there are more than a 100,000 Sanskrit scholars in India and about a similar number abroad. But we have not been able to cross a few thousand in subscription," laments Mr. Rao. The paper has begun a free online edition that can be accessed by all Sanskrit scholars, without a registration.
"Sanskrit as one of the great classical languages of India is comparable to Greek and Latin for Europe," said Mr. Rao. "The genius of India saw its expression for more than 3,000 years in Sanskrit. And therefore, yesterday, today, and tomorrow, Sanskrit will remain important."

HEADLINE: Can Prediction Markets Show Us the Way?

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: In many cases, prediction markets -- in which participants bet on likely outcomes -- offer a more accurate guide than professional forecasters do, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Recent empirical research shows that prediction markets yield high-quality predictions about future events.
A prediction market is a market in which participants bet on a future event. The outcome of the event determines winners and losers, and pre-event prices in the market reflect participant expectations.
For example, markets on the outcome of the 2012 World Series suggest that the Chicago Cubs have about a 1-in-1,000 chance of winning. Large prediction markets exist for political events, economic statistical releases and corporate events (such as company sales results), to name a few.
Economic reasoning alone is unclear as to the relationship between prices in these markets and the probabilities of the outcome of events they are supposed to predict, and unclear as to whether the markets will be successful in terms of sustaining participation. Ultimately, that's an empirical question, not a matter of economic reasoning.

The efficient-prediction perspective says prediction market prices should be close to the probabilities or expectations of the featured events because market participants receive clear and direct monetary rewards for accurate predictions (winning their bets) and monetary penalties for inaccurate predictions (losing their bets). These penalties and rewards give market participants incentives to gather information and form the best prediction they can.
The efficient-prediction perspective does not say that markets are a flawless crystal ball. For example, the Intrade betting market was saying that the Supreme Court was only 25 percent likely to uphold the mandate portion of the new health-care law, which the court did uphold. That market never said that the ultimate outcome was impossible, just one-third as likely as the alternative.
However, the efficient-prediction perspective presumes that the market exists on a scale large enough to create significant rewards for those with accurate predictions. Another perspective, "no-trade," says prediction market participation will be low, if not zero, because traders suspect that a person would take the opposite side of their trades only because he had superior knowledge about the outcome. A market cannot survive if its only participants are "insider traders."
Paradoxically, a prediction market cannot succeed unless it multitasks - it must serve an additional purpose separate from predictions, so that the participants with information about the outcome have counterparts to take the other side of their trades.
In the case of sports and political markets, that additional purpose is entertainment - people enjoy engaging in the activity and are willing to participate even if their expected profits are zero or negative. These people are participating for various reasons other than prediction.
(It is sometimes said that Las Vegas-type sports-event betting markets, such as the one that produced the odds on the Chicago Cubs, are not pure prediction markets because some participants are bookmakers and others are casual bettors, so the odds do not reflect precisely how the money is bet. But that's my point: successful prediction markets do not consist solely of insider traders).
The entertainment and other nonprediction functions of the market will also be reflected in the market prices, so they no longer solely represent probabilities or accurate expectations. For example, sports fans may enjoy cheering for the home team and in doing so might place more entertainment value on a home-team bet. If so, market prices may reflect not only the home team's probability of winning but also the magnitude of the entertainment value.
The market for United States government bonds offers another example. The prices of those bonds, especially the gaps in prices between bonds with and without inflation-indexed payouts, reflect market expectations about future expectations. But the prices may also reflect changes in the value of other rewards to market participation, such as liquidity or the satisfaction of regulatory requirements.
The relationship between prediction market prices and event probabilities is therefore an empirical question, requiring many events in order to compare market predictions with alternatives. The economists Erik Snowberg, Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz have conducted a number of empirical studies and summarized them in a recent paper. They find that market prices more accurately predict events than do professional forecasters and polls that are often given authority in assessing the likelihood of various outcomes.
In many cases, poll results and professional forecasts offer no information about event outcomes beyond what is already reflected in prediction market prices.

HEADLINE: Olympics: Money Matters

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new report looks at the effects that country income has on medal tallies in specific sports. 

 BODY:
Olympic sports are, at least in theory, supposed to be a meritocracy. Year after year, though, richer countries do better, probably because of some combination of better nutrition and more money to throw at expensive training, among other factors.
Money doesn't affect medal counts in all sports equally, though. That is because some sports are not especially expensive to train for (triathlons, as opposed to sailing), and because country-specific qualities (like culture, demographics or geography) may be more important than income in certain events.
In a new report on the economics of the Olympics, Jos Ursa and Kamakshya Trivedi, two Goldman Sachs analysts, looked at the effects that income has on medal tallies in specific sports, without controlling for country-specific qualities (like Japan's always being good at judo).
The table above refers to total medal counts from about 150 countries over the course of Olympic Games from 1956 to 2008. Analysts looked at a set of variables -- including gross domestic product per capita, the ratio of income to that of the United States, democracy, and whether the country was the host of the Games -- and their relationship with medals awarded. 
The first column shows how closely those variables put together are associated with medals awarded in a particular sport. A higher value in that column represents a stronger influence of these factors. As you can see, the biggest effects are in canoeing, diving, fencing, swimming and table tennis.
The second column shows the impact from an increase in gross domestic product per capita of one standard deviation above its median. With this increase in income, a country could expect to receive 0.5 to 1 more medal per game in events like cycling, judo, rowing and swimming, for example. In some sports, though, this income increase doesn't affect medal counts much, as in weightlifting, diving and rhythmic gymnastics.
Host countries also historically win many more medals than they do when they're not the host: On average over the last 10 Olympic Games, the host country has won 54 percent more medals than it has won in years when it was not the host. The researchers decided to isolate the hosting effect by sport, too.
The third column shows how many more medals a country typically racks up when it hosts the games, all else being equal. Countries typically score unusually well in cycling, gymnastics, rowing, sailing, swimming and wrestling in years when they are the host, gathering 1.5 to 3 additional medals in a single Olympics in each of those sports.
Being the host seems to have little effect on other sports, like triathlons and canoeing. Maybe it's harder for a host country to quickly ramp up investment in training for those sports than it is for other events, for some reason.

HEADLINE: Two Ways of Looking At a Revolution

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Is the sexual revolution more like the French Revolution, or the industrial revolution? 

 BODY:
Here's a striking passage from Jonathan Last's Weekly Standard review of Mary Eberstadt's new critique of the sexual revolution, "Adam and Eve After the Pill":
The sexual revolution unleashed by contraceptive sex, says Eberstadt, rivals the Communist revolution in terms of its influence on the world of the 20th century.
She's almost certainly right. And the comparison of the two revolutions stems not just from the magnitude of their consequences but also from the intellectual reactions to both. Most Western elites spent the Cold War denying the problems of the Communist state, despite all of the horrible evidence. They have taken much the same stance regarding the consequences of the sexual revolution. Which, on balance, have been quite negative.
This is a provocative and highly-debatable analogy, to put it mildly. But it illustrates an important truth, which is that partisans on both sides of the culture wars often tend to think of the sexual revolution as fundamentally a upheaval, in the style of the Russian or the American Revolutions - with Hugh Hefner and Gloria Steinem as its Lenin and Trotsky or Adams and Jefferson (depending on your point of view), "The Feminist Mystique" or maybe "Fear of Flying" as its Communist Manifesto or else its Common Sense, the Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade decisions as its February and October Revolutions or its Lexington and Concord, the Christian Right as its White Russians or its Tories ... well, you get the idea. From the beginning, a great deal of social conservative commentary and activism has had an explicitly counter-revolutionary feel, mixing nostalgia for the ancien regime with a sense that the shift in American values and mores was imposed by a revolutionary vanguard rather than welcomed by the public as a whole, and that a simple regime change at the top (in the courts, in Congress, in Hollywood, etc.) would be enough to restore the older dispensation. By the same token, many of the arguments you hear on the cultural left today - for instance (to pick two striking recent examples), Katie Roiphe demanding that we simply lionize single parenting instead of worrying about its social consequences, or Allison Benedikt urging women to get over their qualms about sex-selective abortion - feel like propaganda written to buck up wavering members of an embattled revolutionary faction, dismissing inconvenient data and even-more-inconvenient moral intuitions lest they give aid and comfort to the enemies of the Cause.
But suppose for a moment that we thought of the sexual revolution as something closer to the industrial revolution instead: A shift that was shaped by books and individual personalities and political movements, certainly, but that was fundamentally driven by economic and technological changes that would have happened even with a different cast of characters and choices.
Read one way, this analogy offers a certain amount of vindication to social liberals, since it suggests an analogy between social conservatives and the 19th century's Luddites or agrarian nostalgists, shaking their fists impotently against changes they were powerless to stop. (At the very least, thinking of the revolution in these terms should give liberals a little more confidence that a hypothetical President Rick Santorum couldn't bring the 1950s back by fiat.)
But the analogy also suggests that the most strident sort of social liberal risks becoming the equivalent of the most doctrinaire 19th century economic liberals, who were so committed to an ideological interpretation of socioeconomic change that they regarded reform or regulation as an unacceptable imposition on the glories of laissez-faire, and a dangerous and backward-looking threat to the prosperity and growth the new order had produced. (I suspect that contemporary defenses of unrestricted abortion as absolutely necessary to female advancement will eventually read like Victorian-era defenses of child labor as absolutely necessary to capitalism.) And it suggests that just as a more balanced view of the industrial revolution managed to acknowledge its benefits while also trying to mitigate its evils, a more balanced view of the sexual revolution would accept some contemporary realities as goods (greater gender equality and workplace opportunities for women, the waning of anti-gay bigotry, etc.) and some as givens, while also recognizing the crying need to address the revolution's excesses, disappointments and nasty side effects.
This stance would be neither the "containment" nor the "rollback" posture implied by Eberstadt's analogy to Communism, but something like what various Victorian reformers offered to their industrializing society: A promise that the changes ushered in by factories and mills and steam engines were not all a package deal, and that certain gains could be preserved even as major evils were addressed. And its vision of success would be meliorist rather than counterrevolutionary. Gradually but steadily, it would pursue a sexual future in which the choice between patriarchy and permissiveness (or between "Father Knows Best" and Lena Dunham's "Girls," if you will) seems as outdated as the choice between Luddism and Gradgrindism looks today.

HEADLINE: So Much for the Safety of a Traveler's Check

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: A piece of history when the euro was born has lost its luster. 

 BODY:
 I was there when the euro began, to the extent that I could be there without ever leaving Times Square, and now I have my own personal euro crisis.
 This is different from the euro crisis that has European leaders bickering and everybody else worrying about an economic Excedrin headache. This has nothing to do with Spain's borrowing costs, Greece's bailout money, Germany's austerity or the International Monetary Fund's warning of a "sizable risk" of deflation. 
 Those are real problems. This is about a traveler's check.
 Eleven European Union nations began using the single currency on Jan. 2, 1999. That was a Saturday. On Jan. 4, the first real workday of the year, I decided to see who was buying traveler's checks at a currency exchange in Times Square. I wrote six paragraphs - 191 words. 
On a lark, I also bought a (EURO)50 traveler's check. It cost $61.50.
 I all but forgot about it as a new century dawned, New York was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, the city went dark in the 2003 blackout and the Mets broke our hearts year after year. The traveler's check ended up in a box in the basement and remained there until a couple of weekends ago, when I did some housecleaning. There it was.
 As investments go, it was not the smartest. The conversion rate was $1.226 on Wednesday afternoon, so my (EURO)50 was worth $61.32, 18 cents less than I had paid. That was less disturbing than the numbers I got from a cost-of-living calculator. It said that $61.50 in 1999 dollars had the purchasing power of $84.71 now. 
But I don't have $84.71. I don't even have $61.32.
Here is why. I decided to cash in the traveler's check. I walked up Broadway in search of the Thomas Cook storefront where I had bought it.
 It is a Travelex now (and a block south of where it was in 1999). Thomas Cook sold its foreign exchange business to Travelex for $631 million in 2000. "They downsized a lot here in New York," Lorenzo Cesare, who was behind the teller's window in 1999, told me later when I tracked him down by phone. "Business wasn't like it was. Before, one person traveling to Europe would buy 10 different currencies. We'd make money on 10 different currencies. Now it was $100 worth of euros, one currency. They let a lot of my staff go, and the management changed above me. It just wasn't the same."
 But cash the traveler's check? The people behind the teller's windows on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday morning said they couldn't. They said they weren't sure why they couldn't, they just couldn't.
 I went to two other currency exchanges in Times Square and a bank branch on Eighth Avenue. The tellers in all three places said they could not cash it, either. (At Travelex, a teller suggested depositing it in a bank account, but he said the money would not be available for several weeks. Calls and e-mails to a Travelex spokeswoman went unanswered.)
 A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said this was a problem for the Federal Reserve; a Fed spokesman said it was a problem for state regulatory authorities because currency exchanges like Travelex are not banks, so they do not fall under the Fed's jurisdiction. The New York State Department of Financial Services said it had jurisdiction over traveler's checks in the state and would look into the matter.
 It was easier to find out what had happened to the two people I had quoted in 1999. Mr. Cesare said he spent a couple of years with another currency company before joining a property management company. He started his own property management operation four years ago and also runs his own real estate office in Middle Village, Queens.
 I also quoted Edward Maher. a baker who lives in Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y. He bought two (EURO)50 traveler's checks that day.
 "I spent the euros with no problem," Mr. Maher said. "I don't remember what countries I went to. Some took euros and some did not. England, that was an issue."
 He said that on more recent trips, he usually used his debit card to buy currency from a cash machine once he landed. 
He also said he wished he had done that on a European trip last year.
"We went to an exchange place rather than an A.T.M.," he said. "I was charged a 20 percent surcharge. It was put on the bill like a tip. I was taking pasta-making lessons. The girl who was teaching us said: 'He ripped you off. you should have called the police.' You live and you learn."

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The financial collapse of 2008, which caused the most serious fiscal crisis for states since the Great Depression, exposed deep-set financial challenges that have been masked by lax budgeting laws and opaque accounting practices, according to a new report by respected budget experts. Mary Williams Walsh and Michael Cooper examine the report by the State Budget Crisis Task Force, which says problems will persist long after the economy rebounds as states confront rising health care costs, underfunded pensions, ignored infrastructure needs, eroding revenues and expected federal budget cuts, according to the report.

        
Senate Democrats are proposing to allow all tax cuts to expire Jan. 1 and vote on a tax cut for the middle class shortly thereafter, Jonathan Weisman reports. Holding firm against extending tax cuts for the rich, the plan is a way to circumvent the Republican pledge not to vote for any tax increases, while illustrating the lengths lawmakers are going to try to include new federal revenues in a fix for the "fiscal cliff."

        
Ashley Parker and Michael Barbaro interviewed those inside and outside the Romney campaign for a glimpse into the scope and depth of the three-month process and intense lobbying that Mr. Romney has faced in the vetting of possible running mates. Mr. Barbaro also reports that Mr. Romney may disclose his vice-presidential pick well ahead of the Republican convention, defying the custom of revealing the nominee closer to the start of the party's gathering.

        
The Romney campaign intended to roll out a coordinated line of attack on the president over free enterprise, but the continued jabs from the Obama campaign about shipping American jobs overseas, coupled with a series of distractions from prominent Republicans, left the impact of Mr. Romney's attack somewhat blunted, Trip Gabriel and Peter Baker write.

        
A move by the Obama administration to give states more latitude in running federal welfare-to-work programs has prompted Republicans to characterize it as a power grab by the executive branch, Rebecca Berg reports. They say it proves that the president and Democrats support providing welfare money without encouraging the recipients to find work.
Around the Web

        
The House Ethics Committee announced Tuesday that it was looking into allegations that Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, used campaign funds for an overseas trip and family parties, The Hill reports.

        
The Hill also describes a "dramatic" difference in President Obama's speeches, now that he is weaning himself off the teleprompter.

        
Everyone from the Honolulu City Council to the governor of Hawaii is on board to wage an underdog campaign against Chicago, hoping to bring President Obama's eventual presidential library to Hawaii, Politico reports. They plan to follow in the footsteps of their fellow statesman, with Reed Dasenbrock, vice chancellor of academic affairs at the University of Hawaii, telling Politico not to count them out just yet - "No one thought in 2004 that he was going to win in 2008."
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama will welcome the Baylor Bears - 2012 N.C.A.A. women's basketball champions - to the White House to congratulate them not only on an undefeated season, but also for their work with the homeless.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Posts $2.5 Billion Profit, but Mortgage Woes Remain

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The bank, the second-largest in the United States after JPMorgan Chase, swung to a profit in the second quarters. But investors are increasing their demands that Bank of America repurchase soured mortgages, arguing they were improperly underwritten and sold to them in the first place. 

 BODY:
7:52 p.m. | Updated 
Despite reporting better-than-expected profits Wednesday, Bank of America continues to have a money pit in its home-loan market.
The bank, the nation's second-largest by assets after JPMorgan Chase, said on Wednesday that it earned $2.5 billion, or 19 cents a share, compared with analysts' projections of 14 cents for the quarter, as its expenses dropped and credit conditions improved.
The housing woes of the last few years are still taking a toll on the bank, however. Investors are increasing their demands that Bank of America repurchase soured mortgages, arguing the mortgages were improperly underwritten and sold in the first place.
 These so-called put-back claims totaled $22.7 billion in the second quarter of 2012, up from $16.1 billion in the first quarter.
Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer, noted that the $22.7 billion figure was more than double the total of such claims in the second quarter of 2011, when they stood at $9.9 billion.
"It's not just that it's going up, it's going up at an accelerated rate," Mr. Kotowski said. "It's hard to know what the ultimate cost will be."
Those concerns help explain why Bank of America's stock sank nearly 5 percent to $7.53 a share on Wednesday, even though profits were better than expected.
The bank also reported some weakness in its revenue. For the second quarter, Bank of America's revenue totaled $22.2 billion, slightly less than expected and below the level in the first quarter of this year.
The result was a sign of the pressures big banks face in expanding their business in a weak economy and with tighter regulations. But Bank of America was able to offset those challenges with savings elsewhere.
And the latest figures stand in sharp contrast to Bank of America's results in the period a year earlier, when huge mortgage-related charges contributed to a loss of $8.8 billion, or 90 cents a share.
The bulk of the losses from soured mortgages comes from Bank of America's disastrous acquisition of Countrywide Financial, a leading subprime lender, in 2008. Bank of America officials say the mortgage defaults stem largely from economic weakness, not failures in terms of how the mortgages were underwritten or packaged and sold to investors.
Bank of America officials add that the bank has nearly $16 billion set aside to cover put-back claims, and also note that the $22 billion figure reflects the total value of the mortgages, not what the bank is likely to have to pay out to investors.
The bank also said that the number of mortgages more than 60 days late declined in the second quarter, a sign of healthier conditions for borrowers.
Overall credit losses in the second quarter dropped to $1.7 billion from $3.25 billion in the period a year earlier, reflecting what the company said were improving credit conditions for businesses and consumers as well as tighter lending standards.
In addition, the bank raised its projected cost-cutting targets under its "New BAC" restructuring initiative, predicting an additional $3 billion in savings by mid-2015.
Bank of America is in the midst of cutting more than 30,000 workers as the initiative goes into effect. As of June 30, its head count was down 3,228, to 275,460. The bank has 12,600 fewer employees than it did a year ago.
Bank of America's results were more straightforward than in recent quarters, when one-time gains and losses made it difficult to gauge the bank's underlying performance.
Also on a positive note, the bank managed to strengthen its balance sheet, which had been a worry of investors last year, when its stock briefly fell below $5 a share.
The company says its Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III agreements now stands at 8.1 percent, putting it ahead of the company's earlier goal of 7.5 percent by the end of 2012.
Strengthening the bank's underlying capital position while slimming down and cutting costs have been prime goals for the chief executive, Brian Moynihan.
"We're starting to see results from the New BAC program," Mr. Moynihan said during a call with analysts on Wednesday. "We continue to have work to do."
Profit was also bolstered by so-called reserve releases, when the bank reverses earlier charges for possible credit losses and adds the savings to the bottom line. In this case, of the $2.5 billion profit in the second quarter, $1.9 billion came from reserve releases.
While it was solidly profitable, the company's global markets unit, which includes much of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, had a drop in revenue and profit from the first quarter and the same period a year ago.
The company attributed the slowdown to the economic problems shaking the euro zone, and the anemic economic environment. The global markets unit earned $462 million, down from $911 million in the second quarter of 2011.
"What was driving earnings were reduced credit losses and lowered expenses but revenue growth remains exceptionally weak," said Shannon Stemm, a banking analyst at Edward Jones & Company.
Ms. Stemm said she was also concerned about rising put-back claims.
Government-controlled mortgage giants like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac want the company to buy back $11 billion in bad mortgages, up from $8.1 billion in the first quarter. Private investors are seeking $8.6 billion in put-backs, up from $4.9 billion. Insurers are demanding an additional $3.1 billion.

HEADLINE: BlackRock Earnings Slip 3%, but Exceed Forecasts

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: BlackRock said on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit fell 3 percent from the same time last year, but the world's biggest money management firm still beat analyst estimates as it grappled with global market turmoil. 

 BODY:
5:16 p.m. | Updated 
Even BlackRock, the big money manager, has had some difficulty grappling with the global market turmoil.
The firm said on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit slipped 3 percent from the period a year ago, to $558 million, excluding some one-time charges. Declines across its sweeping array of stock and bond offerings cut the fees it earned for managing money on behalf of clients.
Yet the profit, which amounted to $3.10 a share, beat the average estimate by analysts of $3.02 a share, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
 On a generally accepted accounting principles basis, the firm earned $554 million. Revenue fell 5 percent, to $2.2 billion.
Besides dwarfing many of its competitors, BlackRock has prided itself on being a skilled navigator of the markets. Given the troubles facing the financial world - Europe's woes, the stagnant American economy - management said the firm was doing well.
"Our earnings were good in a risk-off atmosphere," Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
Shares of BlackRock fell $1.10 Wednesday, to $175.05. They have slipped 2.9 percent over the last 12 months.
Over the years, BlackRock has grown into a behemoth, encompassing a wide array of stock and bond funds, as well as more complex offerings like hedge funds. That breadth makes the firm's results at least a partial reflection of the current state of the global markets.
Given the current conditions, that has led to some bruising results. The firm's assets under management shrank 3 percent during the quarter, to $3.56 trillion, as values declined. And performance fees slipped 18 percent, to $41 million, as stock investments fell in value.
One of the big issues facing BlackRock and many of its peers, Mr. Fink said, is the reluctance of its clients to commit to buying into new holdings. The firm said about $6.2 billion in client money flowed out of stock offerings and alternative investments like hedge funds during the second quarter.
Many investors, from individuals to big pension funds, have moved to the sidelines, compelling the firm to persuade them to open up their wallets again, according to Mr. Fink.
"Our clients are all struggling with this issue," he said. "Some clients don't want to hear it. They're not budging."
Still, BlackRock said that it drew in $3.7 billion worth of new business, as investors piled into fixed-income offerings. Mr. Fink argued, however, that the meager returns that bonds offer in a low interest rate world should not satisfy investors.
One bright spot was its advisory arm, BlackRock Solutions, which advises clients on risk. The division reported a 13 percent rise in revenue, to $131 million, as it took in new work mandates.
The business counsels a broad range of clients, from pension funds to investment firms.
Among its more notable customers is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which BlackRock has been helping wind down the remains of the 2008 financial industry bailouts. During the quarter, BlackRock oversaw the retirement of two special financial vehicles created as part of the government rescues of Bear Stearns and the American International Group.
Mr. Fink said that the greater demand for the firm's services arose from clients' desire to become safer and to know if any potential bombs lurked in their balance sheets.
"People are frightened of risk," he said. "And as regulatory supervision has increased, risk management is becoming more essential."
Mr. Fink added that his firm was "closely following" the investigations into the key banking interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Some BlackRock clients may have been affected by banks' efforts to manipulate the benchmark, he said.

Bank of America Posts $2.5 Billion Profit, Helped by Cost Cuts | Bank of America swung to a profit in the second quarter, helped by lower expenses and better results in its mortgage business.
The bank, the second-largest in the United States after JPMorgan Chase, said on Wednesday that it had earned $2.5 billion, or 19 cents a share, exceeding analyst estimates.
Revenue came in at $22.2 billion, slightly below projections. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn 14 cents a share on revenue of $22.9 billion.

Regulators Say Key Rates Remain Flawed | Federal authorities cast further doubt on Tuesday about the integrity of a benchmark interest rate that is the subject of a growing investigation into wrongdoing at big banks around the globe.
In Congressional testimony, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission expressed concern that banks had manipulated interest rates for their own gain. They also indicated that flaws in the system - which were highlighted in a recent enforcement case against Barclays - persist.
"If these key benchmarks are not based on honest submissions, we all lose," Gary Gensler, head of the trading commission, which led the investigation into Barclays, said in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee.
In separate testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he lacked "full confidence" in the accuracy of the rate-setting process. DealBook

HEADLINE: In Its First Action, Consumer Bureau Takes Aim at Capital One

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday delivered its first enforcement action against the financial industry, fining Capital One for pressuring and misleading more than two million credit card customers. 

 BODY:
9:19 p.m. | Updated 
Capital One, one of the nation's biggest banks, will reimburse $150 million to more than two million customers for selling them credit card products they could not use or did not want, as the nation's new consumer watchdog leveled its first enforcement action against the financial industry.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday hit Capital One with findings that a vendor working for the bank had pressured and deceived card holders into buying products presented as a way to protect them from identity theft and hardships like unemployment or disability.
The regulatory actions, totaling $210 million including fines to authorities, take aim at one of the financial industry's growing profit centers and increasingly controversial practices. Several other banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, were sued in June by the Hawaii attorney general, accused of improperly selling similar so-called add-on products, which consumer advocates typically regard as costly and ineffective.
 "We know these deceptive marketing tactics for credit card add-on products are not unique to a single institution," said Richard Cordray, the director of the consumer bureau. "We expect announcements about other institutions as our ongoing work continues to unfold."
Capital One - known for its catchy television ads that ask, "What's in your wallet?" - did not admit to or deny any of the findings. While it said the wrongdoing had occurred at outside call centers that "did not always adhere to company sales scripts," the bank's president for credit cards, Ryan M. Schneider, acknowledged that the company was "accountable for the actions that vendors take on our behalf."
"We apologize to those customers who were impacted and we are committed to making it right," Mr. Schneider said.
Under the deal with regulators, Capital One must temporarily halt the marketing of certain add-on products and submit to an independent audit. The bank said it thought the refunds, which victims are to begin receiving later this year, would average less than $100 a person.
In a related action, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency required the bank to reimburse customers "harmed by unfair billing practices" that unfolded over a 10-year span, from 2002 to June of last year. The bank, regulators say, billed customers even though it had failed to provide full use of the product.
"Unfair and deceptive practices will not be tolerated," Thomas J. Curry, the comptroller, said on Wednesday.
The regulatory scrutiny comes on the heels of several Wall Street blowups and federal investigations that have stoked the anger of consumers and investors. Last month, Barclays agreed to pay authorities $450 million to settle accusations that it had manipulated a benchmark interest rate, part of a wide-ranging inquiry. JPMorgan Chase is dealing with the fallout from a multibillion-dollar trading debacle.
The Capital One action was the consumer bureau's first effort at flexing its enforcement muscle. A centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the two-year-old bureau is charged with rooting out abuses in areas including mortgages and payday loans.
The action Wednesday suggests that the enforcement arm is emerging as a cornerstone of the agency, which early on faced skepticism over whether it would aggressively police the nation's biggest banks. Mr. Cordray, who previously ran the bureau's enforcement division, said that his agency's investigations would now happen "more steadily."
What is more, the enforcement action will most likely embolden consumers to file class-action lawsuits, according to Stacie E. McGinn, a lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York. "This practice is hardly limited to Capital One," said Richard Golomb, a lawyer in Philadelphia who has brought class-action lawsuits against lenders for payment protection insurance.
That product, which promises to forgive or trim the debts of card holders in the event that they lose their jobs, become disabled or die, became particularly attractive to anxious consumers in the depths of the recession. While costs vary by card issuer, companies typically charge up to 80 cents for every $100 of debt that is insured, lawyers for consumers said.
In addition to deceptively pushing those plans, regulators say, Capital One offered credit monitoring, a feature that came with identity-theft protection and "credit education" for customers with a spotty borrowing history.
In a 30-page order, the consumer bureau outlined how call centers for the bank marketed and sold the products to ineligible unemployed consumers and forced the products without the consumer's consent. In other cases, according to the bureau, the bank employed "high pressure tactics," including misleading customers into thinking the product was free, mandatory and would bolster credit scores.
The bank has run afoul of regulators before. In January, Attorney General Darrell V. McGraw Jr. of West Virginia, reached a $13.5 million agreement with Capital One to settle accusations surrounding its payment protection programs.
The attorney general of Mississippi, Jim Hood, also sued Capital One in June for reportedly "slamming" customers by enrolling them in payment protection programs without their consent and then hitting them with fees.
A top official at the industry trade group the American Bankers Association, Kenneth Clayton, said that for some people "the value of the product is worth the cost. People buy these products for a number of reasons, including peace of mind and knowing they will be protected if certain untimely life events make it difficult to repay their bills."
Capital One, in contrast, has tussled with consumer advocacy groups like the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which has assailed the bank for its subprime and risky lending. About a third of Capital One's credit card portfolio carries the subprime label, defined as loans to borrowers with credit scores below 660, the company said last year.
The coalition led the charge last year against Capital One's bid to take over ING's online banking unit in the United States, saying the deal would create the next too-big-to-fail banking behemoth. The deal, the latest in a string of acquisitions, transformed Capital One into the fifth-largest bank by deposits. Capital One on Wednesday reported that its second-quarter profit dropped 90 percent to $92 million, because of the bank's recent acquisitions.
While the Federal Reserve approved the ING deal, the consent came with some crucial conditions. The Fed, citing consumer complaints and legal actions against the bank, ordered Capital One to bolster its internal controls of lending and debt-collection practices.
In addition to David M. Louie, Hawaii's attorney general, suing seven major banks over what were suspected to be unfair and deceptive sales of credit card add-ons, the Minnesota attorney general, Lori Swanson, sued Discover in June 2010, accusing the credit card company of duping consumers into buying the products.
Jill Amundson, who manages real-estate holdings in Minneapolis, said she was shocked when charges for payment protection insurance started showing up on her Discover card bill in 2008. "I never enrolled and I find it particularly galling because the charges are small so you might miss them," she said. Discover waived the charges once she complained.
A spokeswoman for Discover said the company takes "every customer's concerns seriously" and tries to address them.

HEADLINE: It's Not Exactly Sarah Palin's Alaska

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: While Alaska consistently votes Republican in presidential elections, the state's political instincts are more idiosyncratic than the hyperpartisan image of its most famous governor. 

 BODY:
For 67 days in 2008, Alaska was a leading player in American politics, pulled -- in tow with then-Gov. Sarah Palin -- by the McCain campaign into the national dialogue. 
Ms. Palin -- who had an approval rating of about 80 percent in Alaska when she joined the McCain ticket - brought the state's culture with her, and reporters and pundits were suddenly talking about moose meat and hockey moms. 
Today, Ms. Palin and the Last Frontier are hard to find in political reporting. Ms. Palin is heard from very little beyond her role as a contributor on Fox News. The latest story about Ms. Palin centered on whether she would be invited to speak at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. 
Alaska voters also seem to have moved past the Palin era. An Ivan Moore Research poll in late 2011 found that just 29 percent of registered voters in Alaska had positive feelings about Ms. Palin.
"I have a sense that today she would have a very hard time getting elected here," said Margaret Stock, an adjunct instructor in the department of political science at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
"I don't think she could get elected to anything," said Donald C. Mitchell, who has written extensively about Alaska Natives and Alaska politics.
While no longer enamored with Ms. Palin, Alaska is still a conservative state and Mitt Romney should have little trouble winning its three electoral votes. But the state's political instincts are more nuanced and idiosyncratic than the partisan image of its most famous Republican governor.
Alaska's current senators do not fit the Palin mold. The state's senior senator, Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who supports abortion rights, lost the 2010 Republican primary to a Tea Party favorite, Joe Miller. But Ms. Murkowski went on to run in the general election as a write-in candidate, ultimately defeating Mr. Miller, who was endorsed by Ms. Palin. 
The state's junior senator is Mark Begich, a Democrat (yes, a Democrat).1
Among the state's most prominent elected officials, Sean Parnell, Alaska's governor, may be the closest to Ms. Palin politically. "We have a governor who is following many of the same policies [as Ms. Palin]," said Mead Tredwell, Alaska's lieutenant governor, "but he is not a lighting rod."
Over all, Alaska's electorate, although certainly right of center, is difficult to pigeonhole. "I wouldn't say we're a hard-core Republican state," Ms. Stock said, "there are issues where Lisa Murkowski has completely broken with the Republican Party, and Alaskans are happy about that." 
More than half of the state's residents live in and around Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula. There are pockets of liberal voters, but it's a mostly Republican area, and Anchorage is a mostly conservative city, with a large number of evangelical Christians. Forty miles to the north is the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. It is one of the most socially conservative areas of the state and is heavily evangelical.
A little more than one-tenth of Alaskans live in Fairbanks and its suburbs. Fairbanks has a Democratic constituency at its city's core, but beyond that, it's overwhelmingly conservative, and perhaps the most libertarian region in one of the most libertarian states. The Tea Party and its small government message have broad support in Fairbanks, the Mat-Su Valley and Alaska generally. Since statehood in 1959, the federal government has had more control over Alaska than most states, particularly over how to use its energy resources, which has prompted some backlash. 
"Alaska has a fairly strong libertarian streak, a strong limited-government streak," Mr. Tredwell said.
Slightly more than 10 percent of residents live in southeast Alaska, in the area around Juneau. Victor Fischer, an author and former professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, said the area is generally more Democratic and Republicans in the region are closer to the ideological center.
The rest of the state is barely inhabited, with a smattering of small towns. And there are large swathes of land that are completely uninhabited. About half the state's Alaska Native population, 2 which is 15 percent of the state, lives outside the big population centers. Alaska Natives lean Democratic, Mr. Fischer said.
The Bottom Line
Alaska's quirks and contradictions make the state difficult to characterize politically. Although Alaska has a strong libertarian streak, it is very dependent on federal largess. "Alaskans are on the dole," Ms. Stock said.
The United States military has a major presence in the state, with bases near Anchorage and Fairbanks. Roughly 14 percent of Alaska residents are veterans. But Alaska is also the second youngest state in the country. 
The state's economy also has internal conflicts. The four biggest employers in Alaska are the oil, fishing and tourism industries and government. Interest groups in each industry often find themselves working at cross purposes, particularly oil and fishing.
And with just over 720,000 residents, Alaska has less than a quarter of 1 percent of the nation's population, yet it covers more than a sixth of all its land. Alaskans are mostly clustered in the cities of Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau, and so in a giant state, candidates for political office still practice retail politics, Mr. Mitchell said. The personality of each candidate can have a significant influence on how people vote, since many of them actually meet the candidates.
The 2012 presidential contest in Alaska is unlikely to carry much suspense. Mr. Romney has a 99 percent chance of carrying the state, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. But Alaska's consistent leanings in presidential contests, as well as Ms. Palin's partisan politics, belie a more shades-of-gray conservatism on the ground.
Look no further than the period just before Ms. Palin was plucked out of northern obscurity: In early 2008, polls showed John McCain's margin over President Obama in Alaska in only the single digits. 
And Ms. Palin herself was less partisan. She worked with Democrats in the state legislature to raise taxes on oil companies. She created a sub-cabinet team to address climate change. And although she personally supported it, Ms. Palin vetoed a bill that would have barred same-sex couples from receiving state benefits, saying it was unconstitutional.
"She was very progressive in many, many ways," Mr. Fischer said.
1: Mr. Begich won election in 2008, defeating former Senator Ted Stevens, who was convicted of concealing extravagant gifts before the election. The conviction was later thrown out because of prosecutorial misconduct.
2: Alaska is relatively diverse. Besides the Alaska Native community, the state is 6 percent Hispanic, 6 percent Asian and 4 percent black, according to Census Bureau estimates for 2011.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Blankfein Backs Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: EDWARD WYATT


HIGHLIGHT: At the Economic Club in Washington, the Goldman Sachs chief discusses regulation, the federal budget -- and his interest in a future government post (hint, hint). 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Many politicians have taken aim at Lloyd Blankfein in this town since the 2008 financial crisis. And the bank he leads, Goldman Sachs, has been vilified as a contributor to the housing bubble and a beneficiary of taxpayer largesse.
But given the chance on Wednesday to fire back before a sympathetic audience - the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. - he demurred. Instead, he said that the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul did more good than bad. He also urged Congressional leaders and President Obama to reach a compromise on the "fiscal cliff" issues that face the country before year-end.
"If I could push a button and eliminate Dodd-Frank would I do it? No, I would not," Mr. Blankfein said, in an interview conducted David Rubenstein, president of the Economic Club and a co-founder of the Carlyle Group.
 "The vast bulk of it is good," Mr. Blankfein said, although "some parts go too far." Asked specifically about the Volcker Rule, which bans proprietary trading by federally insured banks, he said "it addresses things that were not the problem" in the crisis that led to the recession.
Mr. Blankfein indirectly criticized others in the banking industry for the failures that led to the Libor rate-rigging investigations. "I think the biggest impact is once more undermining the integrity of the system that has already been undermined so substantially," he said.
The financial sector had "a big hole to dig out of" to regain the trust of consumers after the financial crisis, he added, "and now it's that much deeper."
The discussion also turned over the debate on federal budget issues. Asked if would extend the Bush-era tax cuts, Mr. Blankfein said any solution is better than none.
"I would almost capitulate to either side rather than have these things go on," he said. "When you're dealing with rates, you can split differences."
But he warned Republicans and Democrats against "backing yourself into a corner and saying 'I cannot compromise,' " warning of the dangers of ultimatums.
In terms of the global economy, Mr. Blankfein said he believed the euro would survive, but worried about the consequences if it collapsed.
"I think that there is a not-insignificant possibility that there could be an unraveling," he said, "but I really don't think it will happen." He cited the "absolute commitment" of wealthier states in Europe as well as the desire of "peripheral states" not to create additional turmoil.
He was optimistic about the long-term prospects of emerging markets like Russia, China and Brazil, given the "very high rates of growth" that they are likely to enjoy over the next 10 years. "We are bullish on all these countries for the long term, but maybe more cautious for the short term."
Mr. Blankfein did not rule out working in government after his tenure as the chief of Goldman is over. "I have aspirations to be desired," he said eliciting laughter from the several hundred attendees. "By any president; I didn't mean to limit it to the United States."

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Advances Trade Bill With Russia

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate Finance Committee advanced a measure to normalize trade relations with Russia for the first time since the Soviet Union's fall, while also sanctioning officials implicated in human rights abuses. 

 BODY:
A Senate committee advanced a measure on Wednesday to normalize trade relations with Russia for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union while also sanctioning officials implicated in human rights abuses.
With the measure passed in the Senate Finance Committee on a unanimous vote, lawmakers dispensed with two decades of resistance to lifting cold war-era restrictions under the so-called Jackson-Vanik law. But senators insisted on the human rights sanctions to send a message to President Vladimir V. Putin as Moscow under his new term cracks down on dissent.
The trade move has been a priority of President Obama's as he seeks to improve Russian-American relations, but his administration unsuccessfully lobbied against adding the sanctions, arguing that it was already taking action on human rights. The sanctions have provoked deep anger in Moscow at a time when Mr. Obama has been seeking help from Mr. Putin in resolving the crisis in Syria.
Russian lawmakers visited Washington last week to lobby against the sanctions, and on Tuesday, Moscow repeated its plan to respond tit for tat.
"There is a whole range of situations in the U.S. where senior and other officials of this country's ministries and agencies are responsible for systematic and severe human rights violations," Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, told the Interfax news agency.
The move to lift Jackson-Vanik comes as Russia is slated to join the World Trade Organization by the end of summer. Only countries that have permanent normal trade relations can take advantage of the lower trade barriers that come with W.T.O. membership so American businesses have pushed for normalization. One study estimated that American exports would double to $19 billion within five years as a result.
Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said the legislation would "help create more American jobs and ensure American businesses stay competitive worldwide." He added that he remained "deeply concerned about other aspects of Russia's international activities" and thought the sanctions would be important.
Russia is one of very few countries that still do not have such trade status with the United States, which has already normalized trade relations with former communist countries like Ukraine, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, and even with communist-run nations like China and Vietnam. 
But American lawmakers have been reluctant to take action while Mr. Putin has moved against protesters and others hostile to his rule. The solution they came up with was the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, named for a Russian lawyer who was arrested and died in prison after investigating official corruption.
The Magnitsky measure requires that those responsible for human rights violations be denied visas and have their assets frozen. The State Department has already denied visas for some officials implicated in Mr. Magnitsky's death. The Senate bill expanded the sanctions to apply worldwide.
A House committee has passed another version of the Magnitsky legislation applied just to Russia, but the Jackson-Vanik repeal has lingered. A Senate aide said Wednesday's action may put pressure on the House to take action. Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who leads the Finance Committee, said his goal was to pass the legislation before Russian W.T.O. membership takes effect to avoid ill effects for American businesses.

HEADLINE: Bain Never Left Romney

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The Candidate can neither escape nor defend his career. 

 BODY:
The two presidential campaigns are still arguing about when Mitt Romney left Bain Capital, but from a political perspective the date really doesn't matter, because Bain never left Mitt Romney. The company's business practices, before and after his departure, will trail him wherever he goes, and now they have turned up in the northern Illinois city of Freeport. 
There's a plant in Freeport that makes sensors and controls for cars and airplanes. It's owned by Sensata Technologies, a company that Bain bought in 2006, somewhere between four and seven years after Mr. Romney left the company. Last year, Sensata announced that it was moving the plant to China at the end of 2012 and laying off all 170 workers, and now those workers are asking Mr. Romney to intervene with his colleagues to save their jobs.
"If he wanted to, all he needs to do is call up the management of Bain Capital and say, 'Look, don't do this,' " one worker, Tom Gaulrapp, told Reuters.

Mr. Romney had nothing to do with that decision. It would be troubling to learn that the candidate still had such power over the company and was willing to exercise it. The workers, obviously desperate, are hoping that the campaign's need to avoid bad publicity might help them.
Nonetheless, Mr. Romney remains deeply tied to business decisions like this. As Bain's founder, he established its business model, which is to wring the maximum efficiency from a company for the benefit of Bain's investors, even if that means closing plants, shipping jobs to China, and laying off American workers. That's how private equity often works, and Bain has done it many times before, sometimes to the benefit of a company's workers, and sometimes to their detriment.
When Bain first led a buyout of Sensata, in fact, it laid off hundreds of American workers and sent their jobs offshore. As the Times reported, the Labor Department spent $780,000 retraining some of the laid-off employees.
In addition, Mr. Romney's generous retirement agreement ensures that he continues to profit from the deals and decisions that Bain makes. He owns about $8 million worth of Bain funds that hold 51 percent of Sensata's shares. If Sensata saves money by closing the Freeport plant, that could add money to Mr. Romney's trust accounts, now or after the election.
Many conservatives want Mr. Romney to make a full-throated defense of these practices, and hope he explains to Americans that plant closings and offshoring are a natural part of capitalism and can have long-term positive effects for the economy.
But Mr. Romney clearly feels he can't do that, because the political effect of defending layoffs would be toxic. That's especially true because his entire campaign is built around accusing President Obama of not creating enough American jobs.
As on so many issues, he is trapped between his past and his politics, unable to defend his career and unable to escape it.

HEADLINE: With a Little Theater, Romney Uses Obama's Words Against Him

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: In Ohio, Mitt Romney used a remark by the president to argue that he is out of touch with how the economy works. 

 BODY:
BOWLING GREEN, Ohio -- Mitt Romney returned with relish on Wednesday to President Obama's "you didn't build that" remark about businesses, which Mr. Romney framed as evidence the president was out of touch with how the economy works and jobs are created. 
The phrase "really reveals what he thinks about our country, about our people, about free enterprise, about freedom, about individual initiative, about America,'' Mr. Romney told supporters at a town-hall-style event here. 
Mr. Obama, speaking Friday at a rally in Virginia, was making a point that entrepreneurs owe their success in part to government investments in education and infrastructure. "If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help,'' he said. "There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive.''
His next awkwardly expressed line has provided a giant opening for Mr. Romney to claim that the president has no appreciation of business. 
"I just want to say it exactly as he said it,'' Mr. Romney said, quoting the president: "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.''
Mr. Romney asked everyone in the room who started or ran a business to stand. Some 30 to 40 people did so, many holding signs that read "I opened my own business'' and "I created a business. Not the government.'' 
"I know that you recognize a lot of people helped you in that business,'' Mr. Romney told them. "Perhaps the banks. Investors. There's no question your mom and dad, your school teacher, the people who provide roads, the fire and police. But let me ask you this, did you build your business? If you did, raise your hand?''
Many hands went up. "Take that, Mr. President,'' Mr. Romney said. "This is what's happening in this country. These people are entrepreneurs.''
It was pointed political theater, bringing Mr. Romney one of many clamorous ovations, though it was not quite as spontaneous as it appeared. Some people holding signs said later that they had been provided by the campaign. Wayne Michaels, a retired orthodontist from Bowling Green, said he had been handed his sign reading "I Opened My Own Business" as he arrived. 
Nonetheless, Mr. Michaels certainly agreed with its sentiment and with Mr. Romney. "I built an orthopedic practice,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Muddy Waters Deals Blow to a Chinese Education Company

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Shares in the New Oriental Education and Technology Group, a Chinese company listed in the United States, plunged 35 percent on Wednesday after the Muddy Waters research firm accused it of being a fraud. 

 BODY:
It has surely been one of the roughest weeks that New Oriental Education and Technology Group has ever experienced.
Shares in the Chinese company, which are listed in the United States, plunged 35 percent on Wednesday after a critical analyst note by the Muddy Waters research firm accused it of being a fraud. Not known for shying away from strong viewpoints, Muddy Waters titled its report "Magna Cum Fraude."
That follows a disclosure by New Oriental on Tuesday that it is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices, another revelation that spooked investors.
All told, shares in New Oriental have plummeted almost 58 percent this week on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $9.64 on Wednesday.
The company, which operates schools in China, was among a wave of companies that did business primarily in China but sold shares in the United States to attract new sources of capital. American investors saw the companies as an easy way to tap into the explosive growth of the Chinese economy.
But many of these companies have run into problems, the most serious of which involve accusations of fraud. Perhaps the most notable is the Sino-Forest Corporation, a Chinese tree plantation company that Muddy Waters accused of being a giant Ponzi scheme. Sino-Forest filed for bankruptcy in Canada, where its shares were listed.
In New Oriental, the tough-talking chief of Muddy Waters, Carson C. Block, has found a new target. Mr. Block wrote in the note that while the company had posted an astonishing 392 percent growth in revenue since going public in 2006, its financial statements for at least two years appeared to be fraudulent.
In particular, Mr. Block wrote that New Oriental was lying about the nature of its franchising operations, arguing that the company's chief executive had denied the existence of what the report said was an extensive business.
What Mr. Block has accused New Oriental of doing is using fees from its franchises to inflate the cash levels on its balance sheet in a bid to persuade its auditors to give it a clean bill of health. He added that another research firm, OLP Global, had accused the company of fraud as well.
For its part, New Oriental disclosed the S.E.C. inquiry in its latest earnings report. The company described the investigation as looking into whether some of its subsidiaries were improperly consolidated onto its own balance sheet.
Mr. Block wrote in his note, referring to New Oriental's ticker symbol, EDU: "We believe that as a result of our exposure of these problems with EDU's reporting, EDU will restate historical results - likely significantly; and, that its auditor will resign."

HEADLINE: Scrutiny Intensifies on Collusion in Rate Inquiry

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators are looking whether a Barclays trader in Europe worked with counterparts at Cr&#233;dit Agricole, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale to manipulate interest rates. 

 BODY:
 While much of the scrutiny surrounding interest rate manipulation has centered on Barclays, regulators have said that traders at the big British bank colluded with rivals to influence a key benchmark.
As part of a three-year scheme, a senior Barclays trader in Europe worked with counterparts at Crdit Agricole, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Socit Gnrale, according to people with knowledge of the matter who could not speak publicly because of the investigation. Regulators are examining whether at least one other bank was involved, one of the people said.
In an effort to bolster their profits, the traders collaborated to push interest rates up or down, according to regulatory documents. By doing so, they aimed to eke out extra gains on their trades or limit losses. In its complaint against Barclays, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission described the bank's trader as having "orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks" to profit on their portfolios.
 In June, Barclays paid $450 million to settle its case with the commission, the Justice Department and the Financial Services Authority of Britain. British and American authorities accused the bank of submitting false rates from 2005 through 2009. Regulators have also conducted investigations of others involved in the scheme.
As the rate-manipulation scandal spreads to other banks, the fallout could have major ramifications for the financial industry. Civil and criminal authorities around the world are investigating, and lawmakers in the United States have started their own inquiries. The civil and criminal actions, as well as private lawsuits, could cost the banks tens of billions of dollars.
The Barclays case centers on key benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and the Euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. Such rates are used to determine the borrowing costs for consumers and corporations. The senior trader at Barclays who worked with the four European banks specifically tried to manipulate Euribor, according to regulators.
The Barclays case was the first to emerge from the multiyear investigation, which has also touched some of the biggest banks on Wall Street. Authorities in the United States, Britain, Japan and elsewhere are also looking into the potential involvement of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and UBS. The Financial Times previously reported the names of the four European banks that worked with the Barclays trader.
The broad investigation has prompted outrage from lawmakers in Washington and London. In recent weeks, British central bankers and regulators testified to Parliament about their role in the rate-manipulation scandal. In the United States, politicians are asking why regulators did not stop the illegal activities, even though regulators knew about potential problems as far back as 2007.
In 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggested changes to the process, after learning that Barclays reported artificially low rates, according to documents. The regulator then shared those recommendations with the Bank of England, the British central bank. But the New York Fed did not end the rate manipulation at Barclays.
Top central bank officials are now signaling a willingness to change the system.
On Wednesday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, said he and other central bank chiefs would discuss ways of improving Libor, or even replacing it, when they are scheduled to meet on Sept. 17.
"In terms of alternatives, there is an attraction to moving toward, obviously, market-based rates if possible," Mr. Carney said at a news conference. Mr. Carney currently heads the Financial Stability Board, a body consisting of central banks and finance ministries that was set up in 2009 to coordinate global financial regulation.
Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, sent a letter on Wednesday to central bank chiefs inviting them to discuss Libor reforms at another meeting scheduled for September. The Bank of England did not respond to a request for comment. Jeremy Harrison, a Bank of Canada spokesman, confirmed the existence of Mr. King's letter and its purpose.
The United States Congress is also delving into the matter, as lawmakers question why the rate-setting process was not better policed. 
Representative Randy Neugebauer, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee investigating Libor, is seeking documents from the New York Fed about JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the three American banks involved in setting the rate. Last week, Mr. Neugebauer collected transcripts from at least a dozen phone calls in 2007 and 2008 between New York Fed officials and executives at Barclays.
The House committee has also homed in on Barclays. On Monday, Congressional staff will receive a briefing about Libor from the general counsel of Barclays in America and its chief lobbyist, according to a government official.
Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: The Endless Summer

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We may look back upon 2012 as the year in which climate change began to wreak serious havoc, yet we hear almost no conversation about changing policy or behavior. 

 BODY:
Here's what American exceptionalism means now: on a per-capita basis, we either lead or come close to leading the world in consumption of resources, production of pollutants and a profound unwillingness to do anything about it. We may look back upon this year as the one in which climate change began to wreak serious havoc, yet we hear almost no conversation about changing policy or behavior. President Obama has done nicely in raising fuel averages for automobiles, but he came into office promising much more, and Mitt Romney promises even less. (There was a time he supported cap and trade.)
It has been well over 100 years since the phenomenon called the greenhouse effect was identified, 24 years since the steamy summer of '88, when many of us first took notice, and, incredibly, 15 years since the Kyoto Protocol. That agreement stipulated that signatories would annually reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and was ratified (and even acted upon) by almost every country in the world, including every industrialized nation but one. That would be the United States. Now exceptionalism. (Bill Clinton signed Kyoto; George W. Bush, despite an election pledge, repudiated it.)
The climate has changed, and the only remaining questions may well be: a) how bad will things get, and b) how long will it be before we wake up to it. The only sane people who don't see this as a problem are those whose profitability depends on the status quo, people of money and power like Romney ("we don't know what's causing climate change"), most of his party, and Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman, who called the effects of climate change "manageable."
Which I suppose they are, as long as you're wealthy and able to move around at will. But it's not manageable to the corn farmers losing their crops (many are just chopping them down), the ranchers selling off their cattle, the thousands of people in Colorado burned out of their homes in fires caused by the worst drought since 1956 or those who will lose their homes or jobs to fire, flood, drought or whatever in coming years. How will they "manage"?
All of this is the tip of the iceberg, and the iceberg is, of course, melting. As Bill McKibben points out in a piece to be published in Rolling Stone on Friday, not only was May the warmest on record for the Northern Hemisphere, not only was it "the 327th consecutive month in which the temperature of the entire globe exceeded the 20th-century average," but it was also followed by a June in which some 3,200 heat records were broken in the United States.
The first page alone of the Rolling Stone article will scare the pants off you, but the chorus needs to grow bigger, louder and stronger. That's why the forthcoming book (due July 24) from Climate Central, "Global Weirdness," is so welcome. "Global Weirdness," which explains climate change in simple, easy-to-understand language and ultrashort chapters, is intentionally calm because, says Michael Lemonick, one of the authors: "Some people respond well to 'Big trouble is coming and we must do something immediately,' but others are overwhelmed and just turn off. We believe that if you look at all the available evidence it's clear we're pushing the earth into a regime where it hasn't been before, and the effects could well be disastrous."
The time to avoid calamitous effects has likely passed. This doesn't mean the situation is hopeless, but the longer we wait to curb emissions, the worse and longer-lasting the effects. Climate Central's projections show that the biggest cities in Florida, and a great deal of the Northeast coastline (including New York City), will be underwater by 2100, when almost everyone now alive will have "managed" to leave the scene. Of course, the calamities won't be limited to North America, nor is 2100 some magical expiration date; the end isn't in sight.
Only reducing carbon emissions can keep matters from becoming worse. Thus the argument for a tax on carbon has never been stronger, but neither has the power of the energy companies to compel legislative paralysis on this issue. The way to a carbon tax is through Congress and the White House, but installing a responsible Congress means campaign-finance reform, another challenge of which Americans are aware but clueless about how to address. But feelings of helplessness are practically un-American: we have the opportunity to demand principled and independent leadership, if we will only try.
It was just about a year ago that we saw the beginnings of what is now called the Occupy movement. And although income inequality has hardly been "solved," it's a bigger part of the conversation now, and that may well spell Romney's downfall. A similar movement - one that, as McKibben told me, "identifies the fossil fuel industry as the real enemy in the climate fight, which is ultimately a moral battle" - could possibly get things moving. If we can force our next president to turn his attention to a problem that may well dwarf the economy in scale, perhaps American exceptionalism will come to mean leadership in the right direction.

HEADLINE: From Victim to Vicious

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: The Romney campaign appears to be planning to shake the Etch A Sketch again and this time draw an angry face. 

 BODY:
Presidential campaigns are protracted affairs that require candidates to deftly manage the seesaws of hopes and fears, enthusiasm and foreboding, aggression and equanimity, momentum and wanderings.
Not only has the Romney campaign not been on top of this lately, it has been crushed beneath the boards.
Romney has an exceedingly simple pitch: I have the necessary business background to rescue the weak economy.
There are few specifics and he rarely wanders far afield of that point. But oddly, his campaign seems to have been caught completely by surprise that the president would put up a full-throated fight to keep his job. It seemed unprepared for even the most obvious lines of attack, like the inconsistencies in Romney's business career and the mystery surrounding his income. It seemed incapable of fighting back with a coherent and convincing argument that didn't sound like the trumped-up utterances of desperation.
Romney's simple line of attack has been replaced with a defense of confusing obfuscation.
He's struggling to change the subject, by any means.
Romney's first response to recent questions about his wealth was an odd one: he embraced victimization. He claimed to be a victim of Obama's aggressive, out-of-control campaign. But whining is a sign of weakness. For Romney, it didn't work out so well.
So now the Romney campaign appears to be planning to shake the Etch A Sketch again and this time draw an angry face.
Buzzfeed, quoting an unnamed Romney campaign adviser, reported Wednesday:
"I mean, this is a guy who admitted to cocaine use, had a sweetheart deal with his house in Chicago, and was associated and worked with Rod Blagojevich to get Valerie Jarrett appointed to the Senate," the adviser said. "The bottom line is there'll be counterattacks."
The reference to Obama's past drug use seems to suggest that the former New Hampshire governor John Sununu wasn't going off-script after all when he dinged the president for spending "his early years in Hawaii smoking something" during a Tuesday morning Fox News appearance.
Returning fire with personal attacks on Obama offers both emotional satisfaction to Romney and many Republicans, and an answer of sorts to relentless Democratic attacks on Romney's time as an executive.
But this is a tricky proposition for Romney and may just be the briar patch that Obama wants to be thrown into. While there are legitimate concerns about whether Romney has been upfront and transparent with voters, personal attacks on a personally popular president may very well backfire.
A May ABC News/Washington Post poll asked: Regardless of who you may support, who do you think has the better personal character to serve as president? Fifty-two percent said Obama; only 38 percent said Romney.
Conservative complaints notwithstanding, most of the personal issues about Obama have been explored and the electorate has made its peace with them. That's in part because, in cases like the drug use, Obama made the admissions himself.
And Americans do not really seem to want to hold school behavior against candidates. The same ABC News/Washington Post found that three-quarters of Americans "say it's unfair to bring up things a political candidate did in high school."
That said, there is presumably a difference here between mistakes admitted and regretted versus those denied. Recall the allegations that young Mitt was a bully?
Buzzfeed's Zeke Miller reported Wednesday that 
Democrats are celebrating the Romney campaign's stated plans to reintroduce President Barack Obama's cocaine use as a campaign issue, calling it a sign of a flailing campaign.
And that strategy isn't likely to alleviate the problem that Romney's cleavage from Bain remains confusing, and a cloud of suspicion hangs over him as long as he refuses to release more income tax returns. And now that a chorus of prominent Republicans seems to have turned on him, the issues surrounding Romney's finances have gained even more weight.
As Talking Points Memo put it Wednesday:
Enough Republicans have now called on Mitt Romney to release more of his tax returns that it's starting to become notable when a prominent Republican urge the party's nominee to reveal more information.
Whether a Mitt the Vicious will be more effective than Mitt the Victim at shifting attention away from the 1,500-pound dressage horse in the room remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: Aiming for Romney, Democrats Push for Disclosure of Offshore Accounts

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Senators urge support for legislation that would require candidates for federal office, members of Congress and others to list any financial interest they hold in foreign tax havens. 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats intensified their campaign to pressure Mitt Romney to release more information about his finances with a push for legislation requiring candidates for federal office to disclose holdings in foreign tax havens.
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the majority whip, and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, took to the floor to urge support for the Financial Disclosure to Reduce Tax Haven Abuse Act. The legislation, which was introduced in March, would broaden federal ethics law to require candidates for federal office, members of Congress and certain federal employees to file disclosure forms listing any financial interest they or their spouses hold in an offshore account in countries considered tax havens by the Treasury Department, such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.
Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Levin's older brother, is preparing similar legislation that would require presidential candidates to release at least 10 years of tax returns and disclosures of overseas accounts and other financial transactions.
Senator Levin, who has crusaded against offshore tax havens for more than a decade as a member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, insisted that this latest effort was part of a "long, long battle" to crack down on financial abuse by tax dodgers. He said offshore tax havens cost taxpayers $100 billion a year, citing a 2006 report, money that could go to federal programs or to pay down the federal deficit.
"These tax havens have been a pervasive problem for our Treasury and for our economy and for our security," he said. "And we can stop them."

He added that stopping tax haven abuse was not a partisan issue. In 2007, with then-Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, he proposed similar legislation. Then-Senator Barack Obama also supported the measure, he said.
But in a meeting with reporters after their floor speeches, Mr. Durbin made it clear that the move was inspired by Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
"My research suggests Mitt Romney is the first presidential candidate in American history with a Swiss bank account," Mr. Durbin said. "And obviously this has been a topic, as well as his use of these tax havens and shelters. He has also failed to disclose income tax returns to the same level of previous presidential candidates over the last 36 years. And it raises questions."
In his floor speech, Mr. Durbin posited that there were only two reasons an American would have money in an offshore tax haven: to hide wealth or to invest in a currency believed to be stronger than the United States dollar.
"We shouldn't have a political system where a candidate can claim to champion working people, while that same person is secretly betting against America through tax avoidance and tax haven abuse," he said.
The lawmakers said they would not offer the bill as a piece of standalone legislation because it would eat up a week of the Senate's dwindling time. Instead, they plan to offer it as an amendment to a larger unrelated bill.
Legislation is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled House. But Democrats control the Senate, where they could be able to force Republicans to choose between three unsavory options: to vote with Democrats for the bill, to vote in favor of tax havens, or to filibuster the bill.
Mr. Romney has so far resisted releasing several more years of financial information, despite calls from Democrats and Republicans. He has said he does not wish to have his finances distract from the focus on President Obama's failures.

HEADLINE: Facing Foreclosure After 50

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
MABLETON, Ga. -- Roy Johnson fell so far behind on his $1,000-per-month mortgage payments that last year he allowed the redbrick, three-bedroom ranch he had owned since 1963 to lapse into foreclosure.
''I couldn't pay it any longer,'' he said. ''One day, I woke up and said, 'Hell, I'm through with it. I'm walking away from the house.' '' 
That decision swept Mr. Johnson, 79, into a rapidly expanding demographic: older Americans who have lost their homes in the Great Recession. As he hauled his belongings by pickup truck from this Atlanta suburb and moved into his daughter's basement, Mr. Johnson became one of the one and a half million Americans over the age of 50 who lost their houses to foreclosure between 2007 and 2011. Of those, the highest foreclosure rate was for homeowners over 75.
Once viewed as the most fiscally stable age group, older people are flailing. On Wednesday, AARP released what it described as the most comprehensive analysis yet of why the foreclosure crisis struck so many Americans in their retirement years. The report found that while people under 50 are the group most likely to face foreclosure, the risk of ''serious delinquency'' on mortgages has grown fastest for people over 50.
While the study classified even baby boomers as ''older Americans,'' its most dire findings were for the oldest group. Among people over 75, the foreclosure rate grew more than eightfold from 2007 to 2011, to 3 percent of that group of homeowners, the report found.
''Despite the perception that older Americans are more housing secure than younger people, millions of older Americans are carrying more mortgage debt than ever before, and more than three million are at risk of losing their homes,'' the report found. ''As the mortgage crisis continues, millions of older Americans are struggling to maintain their financial security.''
The report was based on nationwide loan data that covered a five-year span. The profile of those facing foreclosure has changed since 2007. As the average age and wealth of those people rise, their foreclosures are less likely to involve high-interest loans. In fact, most foreclosures are now the result of prime loans rather than subprime ones, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Instead, older Americans are losing their homes because of pension cuts, rising medical costs, shrinking stock portfolios and falling property values, according to Debra Whitman, AARP's executive vice president for policy. They are also not saving enough money. Half of households whose head is between 65 and 74 have no money in retirement accounts, according to the Federal Reserve.
At CredAbility, an Atlanta-based credit counseling agency, the average age of callers needing help has risen to 49 from 43 in recent years. Scott Scredon, a spokesman for the agency, said most older Americans facing foreclosure are frugal but are unable to live on fixed incomes with the rising cost of living.
''When we think of foreclosures, we think of someone who was a little reckless and spent beyond their means,'' he said. ''The older the person, the less likely that is to be the case.''
Foreclosures create unique challenges for older people, Ms. Whitman said. They are less able to find new jobs and more vulnerable to becoming homeless, analysts say.
In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Charlotte Orton's three-bedroom apartment has been under foreclosure for four months. Since losing her job as a real estate agent, Ms. Orton's only source of income has been Social Security payments of $1,200 per month.
If she is evicted, Ms. Orton, 69, who has no family members in Florida, says she does not know where she will live.
''This is the lowest point in my entire life,'' she said. ''If I were in my 30s, it would be easier to get employment. But all they want to know is what your recent experience is, and the real estate market has collapsed.''
Other older foreclosure victims have managed to negotiate with banks to stay in their houses. Josephine Tolbert, 76, was temporarily evicted from her house in San Francisco for two weeks. Protesters from the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment staged a sit-in at Bank of America, and eventually Ms. Tolbert was able to renegotiate her loan.
''At my age, I don't know what I would have done,'' she said. ''But let me tell you, it was a fight.''
Selling houses is also a challenge for many older people. The value of real estate has collapsed, especially in wealthy suburbs of Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago and other sprawling metropolitan areas.
For Mr. Johnson, it was painful to watch the house he built 48 years earlier sell for only $33,000 at auction last year.
Now he lives in what his 55-year-old daughter calls his ''man cave'' in her basement. It is an hour away from his old house. Although Mr. Johnson is grateful to have been helped by a relative, he misses having space for all of his belongings and the tree from which he made pear preserves.
''I planned to die in that house,'' he said. ''But I guess it won't work out that way.''

HEADLINE: Unused Traveler's Check Spurs a 50-Euro Crisis

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
-I was there when the euro began, to the extent that I could be there without ever leaving Times Square, and now I have my own personal euro crisis.
-This is different from the euro crisis that has European leaders bickering and everybody else worrying about an economic Excedrin headache. This has nothing to do with Spain's borrowing costs, Greece's bailout money, Germany's austerity or the International Monetary Fund's warning of a ''sizable risk'' of deflation.
-Those are real problems. This is about a traveler's check. 
-Eleven European Union nations began using the single currency on Jan. 2, 1999. That was a Saturday. On Jan. 4, the first real workday of the year, I decided to see who was buying traveler's checks at a currency exchange in Times Square. I wrote six paragraphs - 191 words.
On a lark, I also bought a 50 traveler's check. It cost $61.50.
-I all but forgot about it as a new century dawned, New York was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, the city went dark in the 2003 blackout and the Mets broke our hearts year after year. The traveler's check ended up in a box in the basement and remained there until a couple of weekends ago, when I did some housecleaning. There it was.
-As investments go, it was not the smartest. The conversion rate was $1.226 on Wednesday afternoon, so my 50 was worth $61.32, 18 cents less than I had paid. That was less disturbing than the numbers I got from a cost-of-living calculator. It said that $61.50 in 1999 dollars had the purchasing power of $84.71 now.
But I don't have $84.71. I don't even have $61.32.
Here is why. I decided to cash in the traveler's check. I walked up Broadway in search of the Thomas Cook storefront where I had bought it.
-It is a Travelex now (and a block south of where it was in 1999). Thomas Cook sold its foreign exchange business to Travelex for $631 million in 2000. ''They downsized a lot here in New York,'' Lorenzo Cesare, who was behind the teller's window in 1999, told me later when I tracked him down by phone. ''Business wasn't like it was. Before, one person traveling to Europe would buy 10 different currencies. We'd make money on 10 different currencies. Now it was $100 worth of euros, one currency. They let a lot of my staff go, and the management changed above me. It just wasn't the same.''
-But cash the traveler's check? The people behind the teller's windows on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday morning said they couldn't. They said they weren't sure why they couldn't, they just couldn't.
-I went to two other currency exchanges in Times Square and a bank branch on Eighth Avenue. The tellers in all three places said they could not cash it, either. (At Travelex, a teller suggested depositing it in a bank account, but he said the money would not be available for several weeks. Calls and e-mails to a Travelex spokeswoman went unanswered.)
-A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said this was a problem for the Federal Reserve; a Fed spokesman said it was a problem for state regulatory authorities because currency exchanges like Travelex are not banks, so they do not fall under the Fed's jurisdiction. The New York State Department of Financial Services said it had jurisdiction over traveler's checks in the state and would look into the matter.
-It was easier to find out what had happened to the two people I had quoted in 1999. Mr. Cesare said he spent a couple of years with another currency company before joining a property management company. He started his own property management operation four years ago and also runs his own real estate office in Middle Village, Queens.
-I also quoted Edward Maher, a baker who lives in Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y. He bought two 50 traveler's checks that day.
-''I spent the euros with no problem,'' Mr. Maher said. ''I don't remember what countries I went to. Some took euros and some did not. England, that was an issue.''
-He said that on more recent trips, he usually used his debit card to buy currency from a cash machine once he landed.
He also said he wished he had done that on a European trip last year.
''We went to an exchange place rather than an A.T.M.,'' he said. ''I was charged a 20 percent surcharge. It was put on the bill like a tip. I was taking pasta-making lessons. The girl who was teaching us said: 'He ripped you off. You should have called the police.' You live and you learn.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Uncomfortable Accounting

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN

 BODY:
NOVI, Mich. -- For weeks, John and Kathy Matthews have agonized over the choice: accept $818,000 in a lump sum from General Motors to buy out Mr. Matthews's pension or keep collecting a check of $4,854 a month.
They have consulted nearly a dozen financial advisers, spent countless hours on the Internet, discussed scores of possible outcomes, and lost a ton of sleep. And with the deadline to decide on Friday, they still don't know what they will do.
''It's not an easy decision because we don't know how long we're going to live,'' said Mr. Matthews, 63, in an interview with his wife at their airy condominium in this suburb west of Detroit.
G.M. has made similar offers to about 42,000 of its 118,000 former white-collar employees and surviving spouses. Those who decide to keep the monthly check will be switched to an annuity provided by Prudential Insurance. Those who take the lump sum will be saying goodbye to G.M.'s financial embrace forever. 
G.M. said the change would eliminate $26 billion of its $134 billion in worldwide pension obligations. The automaker's global pension plan is underfunded by about $25 billion, which has been a cloud over the company's finances.
Some said the pension change was a cultural shift for an automaker whose hefty pay and benefits earned it the nickname Generous Motors.
''Those were the old days,'' said David Cole, president emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., whose father was a top G.M. executive. ''Everybody is trying to run leaner now, and G.M. is not unique.''
The Ford Motor Company said it would make its own buyout offer to its 98,000 retired salaried workers later this summer. And G.M. has said it might discuss pension buyouts for its 400,000 hourly retirees and surviving spouses with their union, the United Automobile Workers.
For the auto companies, the financial impact is largely the same, whatever each retiree decides. The lump sums are calculated using a formula from the federal government that takes into account each retiree's monthly pension and life expectancy.
But for the retirees, the choice has prompted deep, often uncomfortable, consideration of both their personal finances and their own mortality.
''I've got members who get two hours sleep, are crabby and being treated for ulcers,'' Wayne Williamson, treasurer and secretary for the General Motors Retirees Association, said recently. ''And it's not just the annuity, but the short length of time they have to make a lifetime decision.''
Mr. Matthews, a former engineering manager at the Technical Center in Warren, Mich., who retired in 2008 after 41 years, meets weekly at a diner with a coterie of retired colleagues, and the pension choice has dominated recent conversation.
Mr. Matthews said most of his friends were leaning toward the monthly checks. But for him, the calculation was not so simple.
Although G.M. won't put it quite so directly, by Mr. Matthews's math, the company predicted that he would live for another 21 years and used that estimate to come up with the $818,000 offer.
In addition to his pension check, Mr. Matthews receives Social Security, and he also has an individual retirement account. Mrs. Matthews, 62, works part time at a hospital as a registered nurse, and has a home-based business selling nutritional products. When she retires at 66, she will not receive a pension.
The couple has no mortgage or car payments, although both of them have had surgery in the last year, incurring $6,000 in out-of-pocket costs.
They figured that if they earned a return of more than 4 percent a year from investing the lump sum, they would do better than the monthly pension check.
The bigger worry for them was their estate. Whereas funds from a lump sum could be left to their three children and two grandchildren, pensions cannot be inherited.
''We know that if we go down in a plane crash, the kids would get the lump sum,'' Mr. Matthews said.
His wife brought to the dining table a framed photo of their children. ''It's just extremely difficult,'' said Kathy Matthews. ''When you look at this last recession, well, we don't know what the future holds.''
Jim Shepherd, president of the retiree association, said some members were taking the pension changes personally. ''People are saying they feel like G.M. is divorcing them,'' he said.
Mr. Shepherd, who had been a G.M. fleet account executive in Northern California, said the average lump sum offer was about $500,000. He said he could not predict which option most members would choose, although he had decided to stick with his monthly check of about $4,000.
Dave Roman, a G.M. spokesman, declined to discuss how many people had already decided or what the tally for each option was so far.
In June, General Motors held 75 informational meetings attended by about 10,000 retiree club members across the country, he said. The manufacturer also held at least two conference calls with club presidents.
G.M. said that by default, retirees would continue to get monthly pension checks. If they opt for the lump sum by Friday's deadline, they will have until Aug. 23 to change their choice.
Christopher Frayne, a portfolio manager for Sigma Investment Counselors in Southfield, Mich., said he had advised up to 80 percent of clients who were grappling with G.M.'s offer to continue their pension checks.
''To take that lump sum and recreate that income with interest rates this low, that's hard to do,'' he said.
But Don Tanner decided to take the plunge, exchanging monthly checks of close to $5,000 for a lump sum of about $1 million. ''It's the freedom of knowing I have the money, and that it's my money and that I have control of it,'' said Mr. Tanner, who moved to Atlanta after retiring in 2007 as an engineer in Warren.
He said he would invest a portion of the lump sum and put some in certificates of deposit. ''I figured that in the market, I can get around 6 percent on investments,'' said Mr. Tanner, 65. His wife, a human resources representative, will retire in three years with a 401(k) plan.
The prospect of passing something on to his two children and six grandchildren was key to his decision, said Mr. Tanner, who is in good health and will begin to draw Social Security this year.
For retirees who stick with the monthly check, the Prudential annuity will not be guaranteed by the federal government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the way that G.M. pensions are. But Dylan Tyson, head of pension risk transfer at Prudential, said: ''Prudential is exceptionally strong. We're good at this.''
James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, said what General Motors was doing was no surprise.
''Companies are going away from traditional defined-benefit plans,'' Mr. Klein said. ''This is just a different way of meeting obligations.''
New federal pension rules that went into effect this year make pension buyouts less costly to companies, so other companies may follow the lead of G.M. and Ford and offer lump sums. Chrysler, however, has said it has no plans to offer buyouts.
Among G.M. retirees, not everyone is going through the same kind of angst as the Matthews family. Janine Fruehan, who retired in 2009 as manager of communications for product quality and safety at G.M.'s Technical Center, said she planned to refuse the lump-sum offer.
''It seems like a lot of money at first, but I need stability,'' said Ms. Fruehan, 58, who is single and has no heirs to worry about. ''My biggest thing was outliving the money.''
Ms. Fruehan, who is a member of G.M.'s Retiree Advisory Council, which helps guide the company's retiree initiatives, said she hoped to avoid using Social Security when she first became eligible and instead live off her pension payments and other investments. She also is an independent, home-based consultant for a high-end fashion firm.
''The lump sum is a big opportunity, but everybody's different,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Wood, Mortar, Magic

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
WEST CHAZY, N.Y.
THE dumbest robins in New York State live on a ledge outside Rob Roy's kitchen window. Or at least they would like to roost there. On a recent Monday morning, Mr. Roy, 65, and his wife, Jaki, 63, were marveling at one robin's utter ineptitude.
''I've been trying to step over the stuff from the nest,'' Mrs. Roy said, pointing to a scattering of grass, twigs and feathers on the doormat.
Mr. Roy, who by his own account does not suffer fools, was less sympathetic. 
''Those birds are even crazier than they were last year,'' he said.
He seemed inclined to stomp outside and show them how to do the job right. The Roys, after all, built their unusual house out of much the same stuff: sticks and mortar. And for 30 years, the couple have been writing and lecturing on the craft at their Earthwood Building School here, a dozen miles both west of Lake Champlain and south of the Canadian border.
Their particular -- and, frankly, peculiar -- building method is called cordwood masonry. And in a three-day workshop over Labor Day weekend, they will again demonstrate its earthy alchemy. That is, how to create a masonry wall with short lengths of exposed wood in place of the usual brick or stone.
But where puzzling out a stone wall can be as challenging as the Saturday crossword, laying lengths of lumber in a pile is more like the word search in TV Guide. As Mr. Roy said, ''If you can stack wood, you can build a cordwood house.''
Since the Roys first helped lead a cordwood revival in the 1970s, the couple have contended that the practice is suited to all types of people: low-income landowners and vacation-home dreamers, energy-efficiency fanatics and latter-day back-to-the-landers.
As one DIY homebuilder joked, ''If you asked Rob Roy what they should build the next space shuttle out of, he'd say cordwood.''
Granted, these are country houses. A cordwood wall looks the same inside and out: the logs go all the way through. And with their shaggy green roofs, cozy dimensions and folksy finishes, cordwood homes belong not in Bilbao, but in the shire of Bilbo Baggins.
Yet even a heap of firewood can have its own aesthetic, said Ronald Rael, an assistant professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of a book and Web site titled ''Earth Architecture.'' On the Colorado cattle ranch where Mr. Rael grew up, ''My grandfather was a stickler on stacking wood in a very correct way,'' he recalled. ''It was a form of making architecture.''
Cordwood masonry is a logical extension of that discipline, he said: ''somewhere between a log cabin and wood pile.''
For most cordwood practitioners, Mr. Roy said, ''it's a means of building the kind of house they want for an affordable price.'' If you can manage the labor yourself, and shop for supplies in the Dumpster, a new cordwood home can be built for just $20 a square foot, he said. That's a quarter of the average sticker price for a new contractor-built home, based on recent census figures.
Mr. Roy's proselytizing aside, something about the look and economy of cordwood seems to be making a few new converts. Census data indicate that owner-built housing starts dropped steeply during the endless recession. Yet attendance at the Earthwood school has doubled in the last year, to 40.
There may be 200 to 300 cordwood homes and outbuildings currently in construction (and another 1,500 completed) across North America, said Richard Flatau, who wrote the new book ''Cordwood Construction: Best Practices'' and runs workshops and a Web site about the subject.
''When the economy is good, we get a lot less traffic,'' Mr. Flatau said from his home -- his cordwood home, of course -- in Merrill, Wis. ''When the economy is down and people are struggling to get work and make ends meet, cordwood picks up.''
CORDWOOD masonry has been called a lot of things over the years: log butt, stovewood, stackwall, even ''Depression building,'' among a few old-timers on the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. William H. Tishler, a professor emeritus of landscape architecture at the University of Wisconsin, has traced some of the earliest cordwood structures back to the hardscrabble settlements of the mid-to-late 19th century.
Traditional log cabins and timber-framed dwellings required ''extensive lengths of straight, high-quality timber,'' Mr. Tishler wrote in the opening chapter of ''Cordwood Building: The State of the Art,'' a collection of articles edited by Mr. Roy. By contrast, the material for a cordwood house (or a chicken coop, for that matter), could come from skinny, second-growth lumber, even fire-charred forests.
The professor searched for the origins of the building method in Scandinavia, Germany and Canada before concluding that the best place to find old cordwood is probably Door County, Wis.
Nick Hylla, who lives in Custer -- in ''the bull's-eye center of Wisconsin,'' he said -- thinks about cordwood's mysterious origins in terms of natural history. The glaciers that trudged across the Niagara Escarpment, he said, left behind a giant limestone ridge: the material for lime putty mortar. And the north woods teemed with white cedar.
This theory is fitting, to the extent that cordwood building can seem to progress in geologic time. Mr. Hylla and his wife, Anne, milled their own lumber on the property, which is part of a 40-acre permaculture farmstead covered with fruit and nut trees and culinary mushrooms. And they raised the kind of honest, sturdy timber frame that has been out of fashion since a two-by-four actually measured two-by-four.
Yet Mr. Hylla, 36, is also the executive director of the Midwest Renewable Energy Association, a nonprofit group that holds an annual alternative-building expo. And so he mated this old-fashioned skeleton to modern mitochondria: a solar space-heating system, with a two-and-a-half-foot sand bed that stores warmth beneath the floor. The result, in a climate in which long johns count as lingerie, is an energy bill of just $20 a month.
''Our goal was to build a house that would last 1,000 years,'' Mr. Hylla said, which assumes they'll be done by then. Mr. Flatau, the cordwood expert, led two workshops on the farm. And Ms. Hylla, who works at the local food co-op, plied volunteers with buttermilk biscuits and ale.
It might seem an act of faith (or desperation) to have amateurs and strangers determine the look of your bedroom. But Ms. Hylla, 35, has adopted a Zen detachment about the results. After laying enough log ends, she concluded, ''I find you don't look much at the walls anyway.''
YOU could say that Mr. Roy wrote the book on modern cordwood. Except it's actually more like five books and a dozen-odd articles for ''Mother Earth News'' and ''BackHome'' magazine.
The search for more cordwood projects to write about (and to assign in workshops) has led Mr. Roy to build prolifically. Over the years, he has erected three homes in West Chazy, a vacation cabin on nearby Chateaugay Lake and then, on the current property, three guest cottages, a library, a dining hall, an office, a garage, a sauna and something he calls ''a hermit's hut.'' To the extent that the Roys cannot be in all these outbuildings at once, at any given moment most stand uninhabited. (Picture a fairy tale duchy whose serfs have decamped to milk unicorns.)
Yet the home the Roys have occupied since 1981, Earthwood, is a true showpiece of the back-to-the-land building movement.
The round shape maximizes space. In place of a center pillar, they lodged a 23-ton stone masonry stove. It's a massive radiator in the winter and a heat sink in the summer. They dug into a hill to shelter the bottom floor and planted a green roof to cool the second story. A stationary bike pressurizes the water system, which feeds the upstairs kitchen and bathroom (a novelty that, astonishingly, never caught on).
In a sense, though, the beauty of the home is skin deep. The Roys bundled the house in cordwood masonry walls made from salvaged cedar rail. But far more important than the insulation value of the 16-inch logs, Mr. Roy explained, are the tons of masonry and sawdust infill. This mass buffers the temperature inside, from day to day and even week to week.
Thirty years later, the home might appear a little like a time capsule, or a movie set for a forgotten John Sayles film. Except that this summer, Mr. Roy and his younger son are building a 20-sided cordwood home in much the same style.
The best way to explain cordwood masonry is to do it. So Mr. Roy figured he might as well stir up a small batch of mortar and lay a few logs in the wall. A steady rain was falling, what Mr. Roy optimistically called ''a Scotch mist.'' He agitated the mixture with a mortar hoe, mumbling disagreeably as he worked.
''This is way too wet,'' he said, squeezing a handful of gray goop.
The wood, sitting beneath a tarp, had been stripped of its bark and left to dry for a year. Green lumber would contract, pulling away from the mortar and leaving air gaps. So-called hardwoods, like oak or maple, would shrink most of all.
''Northern white cedar is a first choice,'' Mr. Roy said. That would be the stuff for this house. ''White pine and spruce are also good choices.''
He placed a glop of mortar on top of a log halfway up the wall: first on the outside plane, then on the inside. In the middle, he sprinkled dry sawdust spiced with a little lime. The result was a kind of mortar-sawdust-mortar hoagie.
Someone with an artistic eye -- that would be Mrs. Roy -- could insert a bottle in the wall for a skylight effect. During the pointing, or finishing, ''you can put in glass beads,'' she said.
''Or seashells,'' Mr. Roy said
''Shards of mirror,'' she said.
''It can get too funky,'' Mr. Roy said.
For now, having laid a half-dozen logs, he had seen enough of the rain and the soggy mortar.
''Cordwood can be very forgiving,'' he said, quoting an old colleague. ''But it won't forgive stupidity.''
TOBY CRAWLEY and Maria Muscarella tried to follow the Earthwood blueprint when they built a cordwood homestead on 25 hilly acres northwest of Asheville, N.C. In fact, they roughly modeled the outside of their home on the Roys', which Mr. Crawley visited in 2006 during a weeklong workshop. Immediately after he returned, he started cutting and splitting the local tulip poplar with a chain saw and maul.
Mr. Crawley, 38, is comfortable with math: he works as a software engineer. But the angles of a 16-sided home proved to be far from intuitive.
Ms. Muscarella, 38, said, ''There's a crazy amount of geometry that went into this house.'' Mr. Crawley added, ''If I had more building experience, I think I would have realized the difficulty of that.''
Ms. Muscarella is a nurse and herbalist, and at the time she was planning to home-school their daughter, Kaia. So they set what they hoped would be a modest but realistic budget of $60,000.
''It was what we had in the bank from selling a house,'' she said.
''We blew past that real fast,'' Mr. Crawley said.
He went back to work full time. And yet the building somehow got done in just 15 months. (''We were counting,'' Ms. Muscarella said.) Friends turned up for cordwood work parties; any excuse, from a solstice to a wedding anniversary, would do. Their names went on slips of paper, now sealed inside bottles in the wall.
The couple's daughter grew fond of the hubbub. After a formative year with a sawdust bucket, ''she didn't want to use a flush toilet,'' Ms. Muscarella said. ''It made too much noise.''
Four years later, Mr. Crawley is starting to see past the mistakes.
''The very first rafter I put up, I dropped on my head,'' he said. ''And I know exactly which one it is.''
In the end, though, he loves the look of the cordwood. Even if it is ''a dust and spider-web collector,'' he said.
''It's really good for hanging children's art,'' Ms. Muscarella added.
The plural is deliberate: the month after the hammers and chain saws fell silent, the couple conceived their second child.
''I had my son in the bedroom,'' she said, a charmed memory that now belongs to the new home.
If you can bring a cordwood house into the world, giving birth is easy.

HEADLINE: Detroit Mayor Confirms Cuts To Workers' Pay and Benefits

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
Over the objections of union leaders and a majority of City Council members, the City of Detroit is cutting the pay and toughening work rules for many of its unionized workers, Mayor Dave Bing said on Wednesday. 
The move, aimed at saving $102 million a year in a city so financially troubled that its leaders announced this year that it was at risk of running out of cash entirely, is perhaps the most significant result so far of Detroit's reluctant decision to allow formal state oversight of its finances. Under a deal that the city entered into in April in order to prevent an outside, emergency manager from taking control of the city, sharp cuts in new contracts for workers were permitted, with or without union approval.
''This is a tough day for me, a tough day for city workers and a tough day for all of Detroit,'' Mayor Bing said, announcing 10 percent wage cuts that will affect many of the city's nearly 50 unions. Among the city's financial problems -- which include long-term debts of $12 billion -- was its annually spending $150 million beyond its means, then borrowing millions more to cover the shortfall, Mr. Bing said. ''Without action, the city will shut down,'' he said.
For City Council members, the result was a sign of their newfound weakness: The Council voted 5-to-4 on Tuesday to reject the cuts to workers' pay and benefits, but the rejection was trumped by approval from the administration and an advisory board, appointed by state and city officials as part of Michigan's broad oversight powers.
Union leaders, many of whom had negotiated with Mr. Bing's administration months ago and said they had reached tentative deals, including sacrifices from workers in pay and benefits, only to have them swept aside, were furious.
According to Mr. Bing's office, city employees face pay cuts, a shift from rules of seniority for transfers and promotions, a reduction in additional pay for afternoon and nighttime shift work, an end to supplemental unemployment benefits beyond legal requirements, and more. About 11,000 people work for the City of Detroit, a number that officials expect to cut by nearly 1,000 by the end of 2012.
''This isn't about all this other stuff they're saying -- it all goes to one goal,'' said Ed McNeil, a local council official for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ''The real goal is to get rid of union employees, to gut the union contracts.''

HEADLINE: BlackRock Earnings Slip 3%, but Exceed Forecasts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
5:16 p.m. Updated
Even BlackRock, the big money manager, has had some difficulty grappling with the global market turmoil.
The firm said on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit slipped 3 percent from the period a year ago, to $558 million, excluding some one-time charges. Declines across its sweeping array of stock and bond offerings cut the fees it earned for managing money on behalf of clients.
Yet the profit, which amounted to $3.10 a share, beat the average estimate by analysts of $3.02 a share, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. 
On a generally accepted accounting principles basis, the firm earned $554 million. Revenue fell 5 percent, to $2.2 billion.
Besides dwarfing many of its competitors, BlackRock has prided itself on being a skilled navigator of the markets. Given the troubles facing the financial world - Europe's woes, the stagnant American economy - management said the firm was doing well.
''Our earnings were good in a risk-off atmosphere,'' Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
Shares of BlackRock fell $1.10 Wednesday, to $175.05. They have slipped 2.9 percent over the last 12 months.
Over the years, BlackRock has grown into a behemoth, encompassing a wide array of stock and bond funds, as well as more complex offerings like hedge funds. That breadth makes the firm's results at least a partial reflection of the current state of the global markets.
Given the current conditions, that has led to some bruising results. The firm's assets under management shrank 3 percent during the quarter, to $3.56 trillion, as values declined. And performance fees slipped 18 percent, to $41 million, as stock investments fell in value.
One of the big issues facing BlackRock and many of its peers, Mr. Fink said, is the reluctance of its clients to commit to buying into new holdings. The firm said about $6.2 billion in client money flowed out of stock offerings and alternative investments like hedge funds during the second quarter.
Many investors, from individuals to big pension funds, have moved to the sidelines, compelling the firm to persuade them to open up their wallets again, according to Mr. Fink.
''Our clients are all struggling with this issue,'' he said. ''Some clients don't want to hear it. They're not budging.''
Still, BlackRock said that it drew in $3.7 billion worth of new business, as investors piled into fixed-income offerings. Mr. Fink argued, however, that the meager returns that bonds offer in a low interest rate world should not satisfy investors.
One bright spot was its advisory arm, BlackRock Solutions, which advises clients on risk. The division reported a 13 percent rise in revenue, to $131 million, as it took in new work mandates.
The business counsels a broad range of clients, from pension funds to investment firms.
Among its more notable customers is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which BlackRock has been helping wind down the remains of the 2008 financial industry bailouts. During the quarter, BlackRock oversaw the retirement of two special financial vehicles created as part of the government rescues of Bear Stearns and the American International Group.
Mr. Fink said that the greater demand for the firm's services arose from clients' desire to become safer and to know if any potential bombs lurked in their balance sheets.
''People are frightened of risk,'' he said. ''And as regulatory supervision has increased, risk management is becoming more essential.''
Mr. Fink added that his firm was ''closely following'' the investigations into the key banking interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Some BlackRock clients may have been affected by banks' efforts to manipulate the benchmark, he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Are Up, but Building Permits Decline

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Builders began work on the most new homes in June in well over three years, providing some support to an economy that has shown worrisome signs of cooling. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that housing starts rose 6.9 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 760,000 units -- the highest rate since October 2008.
''Housing is clearly in recovery mode, although the sector is much less important than it used to be,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics.
The housing market, which collapsed during the 2007-9 recession, has shown signs of strength this year, although it remains hobbled by a glut of unsold homes. But since it makes up a smaller share of the economy than it did before the recession, it can provide only a limited lift to the broader recovery.
In a cautionary sign for the housing sector, new permits for building homes dropped 3.7 percent, to a 755,000 unit pace.
The Commerce Department said groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest portion of the market, rose 4.7 percent, while starts for the more volatile multifamily homes segment rose 12.8 percent.
On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home mortgages jumped last week on a surge in demand for refinancing as interest rates for 30-year mortgages fell to a record low.
Other data in recent weeks has shown a sharp increase in signed contracts for home purchases in May, as well as rising home prices.
''Housing continues to be the one sector of the U.S. economy that is outperforming expectations,'' said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays.
Housing starts in June were above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 745,000-unit rate, and readings for April and May were revised higher.
Still, the broader American economy has looked weaker as of late. If the recovery failed and the country tipped back into recession, housing would also suffer.

 BODY:
KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. -- Almost since the Bureau of Reclamation first began plumbing the Klamath River in 1906, creating a vast and fertile farming region out of arid southeastern Oregon and northeastern California, people have fought over what the river provides: water for farming, water to preserve one of the West Coast's largest salmon runs and a source of hydroelectric power.
Then, suddenly, a truce was announced. In February 2010, after five years of confidential negotiation, an unlikely alliance of American Indian tribes, environmentalists, farmers, fishermen, governors and the federal government signed the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement.
The agreement was hailed as evidence of a new era in the West in which bitter divisions over natural resources could be bridged. Within a decade, it dictated, four dams would come down, enabling much of the river to flow freely and its once-mighty run of salmon to return. At the same time, farmers would be assured of water for their crops and affordable power. And Indian tribes would regain land lost decades ago. 
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he had expected Congress to act that year to approve the agreement, known as the K.B.R.A., and to begin appropriating the more than $1 billion to carry out what he called ''the largest river restoration project in the world.''
Yet more than two years later, that has not happened, and it is unclear when, if ever, the agreement will be enacted.
A month after it was announced, seven people gathered at Jack Charlton's machine shop south of downtown Klamath Falls and formed the Klamath County Tea Party Patriots. Four of them were farmers wary of losing their water. One was Mr. Charlton, who fixed their equipment. Mr. Charlton recalled the anger and worry in the room that night. Many felt the government was more worried about endangered fish than endangered farmers.
''It was like, 'Where have I been?' '' he said. '' 'Have I been asleep all these years?' The last thing that they want to take away is our water.''
The Tea Party Patriots became a local political force, eventually paralyzing the high-powered deal by defeating many of the local officials who supported it, including all three Klamath County commissioners, and sending a signal to Congress that it lacks enough grass-roots support.
The restoration deal ''is not going to go anywhere at all,'' said Tom Mallams, a farmer and newly elected county commissioner who, with Tea Party backing, unseated a 15-year incumbent. ''It's slowly dying on the vine.''
The fight over the Klamath reached a heated peak in 2001 when a severe drought prompted federal water managers to shut off irrigation to ensure enough water for endangered fish. The next year, Vice President Dick Cheney came to the aid of angry farmers, making sure irrigation was not cut off again.
That summer, 70,000 salmon died. Several years later, commercial salmon fishing on the West Coast was shut down in part because of the decline of salmon populations in the Klamath. Scientific research indicated that removing the dams was the best way to save the salmon run.
But without the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement or another brokered alternative, the Klamath will remain at the mercy of the courts and the powerful legal forces that various groups invoked there, including the Endangered Species Act, tribal rights and Western water law. Environmentalists, tribes and fishermen who support the agreement cite the Endangered Species Act to argue for removing the dams. Farmers and others generally opposed to the agreement cite generations-old water claims made with the Bureau of Reclamation.
The deal's supporters, particularly environmentalists most adamant about removing the dams, say more court fights are inevitable if the deal is not confirmed by Congress -- regardless of local political developments.
Tribes in both states have claimed the management of the river violates their 19th-century treaty rights to fish, gather and hunt. Fear and self-preservation prompted the talks that led to the agreement, in light of more droughts being predicted, tribal water rights gaining momentum in court and the power company that owns the dams worrying about its prospects for relicensing. Nearly all of the more than two dozen parties involved compromised their interests to reach a consensus.
For irrigators like Tracey Liskey, a third-generation farmer who supported the agreement -- and just lost a race for state representative -- the K.B.R.A. promised a version of stability: a reliable though not ideal amount of water they could count on to get their alfalfa, hay and other crops through the dry summer. At the other end of the river, where it meets the Pacific in California, some tribes and commercial fishermen supported the agreement because it offered more security that river flows would not fall below what it takes to maintain a healthy salmon habitat.
The power company, PacifiCorp, agreed to the deal when it became clear that relicensing the dams would be more expensive and more trying than removing them. And while some tribes rejected the agreement, most believed it offered them a way to remove the dams and restore the river. A group of three called the Klamath Tribes agreed to give up some control of the water to regain tens of thousands of acres for timber production that they had relinquished decades earlier.
The Klamath Tribes have recently received favorable rulings in state administrative courts on lawsuits they first filed in the 1970s to gain control of the water upstream. If the tribes eventually win -- a decision is due late this year -- opponents of the agreement could find themselves wishing they had been more supportive. ''It's about economies, and the Klamath Tribes' economy is just as important as anyone else's economy,'' said Jeff Mitchell, a member of the Klamath tribal council who has been central to negotiations for the agreement.
Mr. Mallams and some of the agreement's other most vocal opponents do not draw water directly from the irrigation system, but they benefit from it in other ways, including from the affordable power supply the dams have provided. They frequently accuse supporters of the agreement of wanting to remove the Klamath dams as part of an environmental campaign to remove much larger dams on the Columbia River that provide the backbone of the power supply in the Northwest.
Mr. Salazar said in an interview that he remained optimistic that Congress would eventually approve the deal. Some supporters say opponents are stirring division with no clear agenda.
''I always refer to us as the radical middle because there's nothing radical in the Klamath about fighting over water,'' said Craig Tucker, the Klamath coordinator for the Karuk Tribe of Northern California and a supporter of the 2010 agreement. ''What's radical is learning how to share.''

HEADLINE: Planning a March, and Envisioning a Movement, to Unite Low-Wage Workers

BYLINE: By AARON EDWARDS

 BODY:
The 25-cent raise was not nearly enough.
For six years, Julio Najera, 30, had earned $7.25 an hour working at a Key Food supermarket in Brooklyn, a wage that was bumped up to $7.50 a few weeks ago. He puts in 54-hour weeks in the store's dairy department. Even though he is paid overtime, it is still a struggle for him to support himself -- and his wife and son, who live in Honduras.
''I'm fighting for them,'' he said, adding, ''I am working to maintain myself here and my family there. We can't live with what we make.'' 
Prince Jackson, 54, is in a similar position. He works 40 hours a week for $8 an hour as a security guard at Kennedy International Airport. He is on the graveyard shift, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Low-wage workers like himself, he said, are ''the real nuts and bolts of what it takes to run an airline.''
''I see these people every night,'' he continued. ''We're underpaid, and we're overworked.''
Labor organizers in New York City are embarking on an effort to bring together people like Mr. Najera and Mr. Jackson -- workers who, though their jobs are distinctly different, share the economic challenge of living on modest wages and in sometimes poor conditions.
With the economy teetering, workers represented by different unions have spent the past year laying the foundation for an aggressive lobbying campaign to highlight concerns about low wages, the widening income gap and the overall workplace struggles faced by many New Yorkers.
They plan to promote their efforts on Tuesday, with a march from Herald Square to Union Square.
But beyond the march, organizers envision a future where grocery-store baggers stand alongside clergy members and electricians and where retail workers help fledging supermarket unions negotiate their first contract agreements.
''Imagine when the rich bosses come in from the airport after they drop their children off with the domestic workers and they've had their limos washed and their laundry pressed and they have reservations at the best restaurant and they've had groceries delivered,'' said Bertha Lewis, a former chief executive of Acorn, at a meeting last week of low-wage workers in Manhattan where the coming march was discussed. ''Every single sector, imagine thousands of people coming in from every direction.''
The planning meeting, organized by United NY, a coalition of workers across New York City, was held in a boardroom with one large executive-style table at its center. Instead of chief executives and other top officials, the seats were occupied by low-wage workers.
At the meeting, representatives from different organizations took turns complaining about labor abuse, low wages, lack of paid vacation time and wage theft. At the head of the table, a moderator jotted down notes and recorded what each representative said.
''So, what are your strategies going to be? '' she said. ''How can the airport workers help the grocery store workers?''
With an interpreter standing by, attendees sat wearing headphones to understand both Spanish and English speakers. Many of them shared the same qualms.
''We need to collectively put our fights together,'' said Camille Rivera, executive director of United NY. ''Workers don't want to live in a penthouse or to drive in a limo. They want to be able to provide for their families and have a decent wage.''
The minimum-wage battle has raged at the federal and state level. Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Illinois, has proposed legislation that would increase the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour from $7.25. Proponents of a higher minimum wage point to the country's crippled economy, and argue that paying workers more would help inject cash back into the economy. In Albany, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has advocated raising the minimum-wage increase in New York State to $8.50 an hour from $7.25, but Mr. Silver's bill has since been stalled by similar partisan opposition.
Historically, the city's labor unions have worked mostly independently, particularly on matters related to contract negotiations. About 8,000 Consolidated Edison workers were locked out on July 1 after negotiations between the union and the company collapsed.
And in Brooklyn, supermarket workers voted on June 29 to join Local 338 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union -- a contentious move that has sparked racial tensions, pitting primarily Latino workers against South Korean store owners. The retail union plans to take part in Tuesday's demonstration.
The campaign to organize low-wage workers is meant to focus on specific policies, unlike the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has been much more amorphous, said the Rev. Raymond Rufen-Blanchette, executive chairman of the Clergy Campaign for Social and Economic Justice. Bringing together different unions will give the group more muscle, he said.
Clergy members have been an integral part of United NY's efforts since many have seen firsthand the struggles faced by members of their congregations.
''I'm sick of protests,'' Mr. Rufen-Blanchette said. ''It's always a one-shot deal. When it comes to grass-roots movements, we have to get involved in electoral politics. This is the institutionalization of all the issues that Occupy brought forward. If we are successful, this is going to be something that is going to go for years and years.''

HEADLINE: Years of Unraveling, Then Bankruptcy for a City

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
STOCKTON, Calif. -- This inland port on the San Joaquin River recently became the largest city in the country to declare bankruptcy, but evidence of its unraveling has been mounting for years.
It is visible in the rising domestic violence rates, booming private security businesses and a seemingly unstoppable stream of foreclosures. And it can be seen in smaller form too -- at a struggling pinata shop, on the once-yellow fire hydrants faded to gray, in a case of stolen koi.
''The police don't respond to anything unless there's blood involved,'' said Marlene Hinson, 51, who, after living here for 22 years without incident, was burglarized three times in four months, including the fish theft from her pond in a neighborhood of lush lawns and towering shade trees.
Even as some parts of the country are tentatively emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, this city cannot seem to find solid ground. 
While 50 miles to the north, in Sacramento, a bankruptcy judge and lawyers for Stockton and its 18 creditors have begun to sort out who owes what to whom, Stockton's 292,000 residents have been left trying to hold together some semblance of order and respect for themselves.
The indignities have piled up and compounded in ways few could have imagined. After housing prices shot up in the early 2000s, when commuters from the San Francisco Bay area bought and built up homes here, the median home price plummeted by more than 60 percent in the last five years. In the first half of this year, the city had the highest foreclosure rate of any in the country, according to RealtyTrac, a company that collects foreclosure data. While it has come down a few points in recent months, for the last few years the unemployment rate hovered around 17 percent, nearly double the national average.
While Stockton's bankruptcy troubles can be traced in part to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent erosion of the city's tax base, for years city leaders also mismanaged and overspent funds, pushing the city into financial peril, analysts and current city officials say. Stockton cannot afford the $417 million it owes for retiree health benefits, city officials say, and this year a bank repossessed city-owned parking garages and a $40 million building the city had bought with plans for an upgraded City Hall.
Since 2009, the city has cut 25 percent of its police officers, 30 percent of its Fire Department and over 40 percent of all other city employees. And while the Police Department has started hiring again, much ground has already been lost. Last year, there were 58 homicides here, a record. Halfway through 2012, there have already been 35. Other cities across the state are also teetering. On Wednesday, city leaders in San Bernardino, Calif., were set to vote on a fiscal emergency declaration, which would allow the city to file for bankruptcy within 30 days.
After the three burglaries, Ms. Hinson and her husband, John Hinson, 68, a retired city finance director, installed an alarm system, video cameras and a locking gate at their home. But when the alarm goes off, which it has on several occasions, they say the police do not come. ''They used to serve and protect, but now they can't protect us anymore,'' said Ms. Hinson, who works for a company that manages homeowner associations. ''We have to protect ourselves.''
To that end, the Hinsons joined their neighborhood watch group and have started patrolling the city park adjoining their house. Stockton now has about 100 neighborhood watch groups, and more are forming all the time as concern over rising crime spreads, according to police officials.
Some predict the city will see a boom in self-policing efforts similar to the one that occurred in nearby Vallejo, which experienced a 40-fold increase in neighborhood watch groups since it filed for bankruptcy in 2008.
Cuts at the Stockton Police Department have improved the fortunes of private security companies. Delta Hawkeye Security Services, the largest private security company in the city, has seen an 80 percent increase in business since 2009, according to Ron Cancio, the company's manager. Homeowner associations, landlords and businesses hire officers for $18 to $25 an hour (with or without a gun) to do work that until recently was done by city police.
''People call us before they call the police because we respond quicker,'' Mr. Cancio said.
This year, the increase in crime and clients prompted Delta Hawkeye to have 10 of its 75 officers certified to carry firearms and Tasers. The company intends to triple the number of armed officers by next summer, Mr. Cancio said.
Darien Wilson, 19, carries a gun during his graveyard shift, while he zigzags around town in his company-issued Hyundai, checking on dozens of foreclosed houses and responding to everything from domestic violence calls to reports of fistfights. If he sees a violent crime in progress, he calls the police. But he also uses his Taser and pepper spray and can handcuff people until the police arrive. He says most often the sight of an armed officer sends people running.
''Not very many 19-year-olds can say they're armed and working security on the streets of one of the most dangerous cities in America,'' Mr. Wilson said.
While the city's financial morass has allowed Mr. Wilson's ilk more responsibility and swagger, it has left a multitude of others in need of refuge, a roof and a hot meal.
In 2008, 716 battered women received counseling at the Women's Center Youth & Family Services, a nonprofit here serving victims of domestic violence. Last year that number had jumped to 3,347. The center's shelters are over-capacity, said Joelle Gomez, the center's executive director. ''We've never seen anything like the increases we've seen in the last four to five years in calls to our helplines, our emergency shelter, counseling services and requests for restraining orders,'' Ms. Gomez added. They also arrive more brutalized. ''The nature of the domestic violence that is occurring is more violent than we've seen before,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''People have lost their sense of hope and stability, and with that comes a lot of anger.''
The city's homeless shelters are operating at 125 percent capacity and have been since 2009 when foreclosures left many, particularly renters, with nowhere to go, said John Reynolds, executive director of Stockton Shelter for the Homeless, a nonprofit with multiple shelters throughout city.
The hardships here are hardly limited to those already at the margins of poverty. The women's shelter has seen more middle- and upper-middle-class battered women. ''These days almost every person I see has been through foreclosure or their mortgages are seriously underwater,'' said Timothy Miller, a psychologist who has served wealthier Stocktonians for 30 years. ''People feel absolutely crushed by that pressure.''
Even the city's cats, dogs and parakeets have become orphans of economic adversity. Officials at the Delta Humane Society & S.P.C.A. said the shelter was 60 percent over capacity, forced to turn away those who try to drop pets off they cannot afford, or animals that, along with their owners, lost homes to foreclosure.
''People are dropping off boxes of kittens at the gate during the night,'' said Patrice Davidson, the executive director. ''We've got kittens in the bathroom and cat cages in the lobby.''
Stocktonians disagree on whether bankruptcy will, in the end, help or harm their city. Some say Chapter 9 is a stain the city will never be rid of while others swear it is the last chance to crawl back from insolvency and tough luck.
Regardless of where they fall on that spectrum, many residents' misfortunes track with the city's own.
Yuri Campos's grandparents first arrived here as farm workers from Mexico 50 years ago. As the city grew from an agricultural town into what was, until recently, a rapidly expanding exurb, Ms. Campos' family grew with it. She bought a house, had a son and opened a shop called Party Barn specializing in handmade pinatas. But these days few here have the means, or the will, for parties.
As the city stumbled into financial ruin, Ms. Campos, 30, and her family fell with it. By last November, the bank had foreclosed on her house and the homes of three other family members in town.
Ms. Campos started looking at rental listings in Southern California cities like Oxnard and Long Beach. One of her aunts decamped for Arizona.
Then in March, Ms. Campos was at a bar when a fight broke out and a man was shot and killed. When she tried to contact the police with information about what happened, she says no one at the Police Department would meet with her or call her back.
By the end of June, the city's bankruptcy made national headlines and for the first time in her life, Ms. Campos began to feel something akin to shame.
''People will ask me, 'Where are you from?' '' she said. ''Sometime I hesitate to say. I just feel like they'll think I'm a violent person. They'll look at me like I might hurt them.''

HEADLINE: Despite Stronger Financial System, Report Cites Threats to U.S. Market Stability

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The biggest threats to American financial markets' stability include uncertainty about the euro zone nations, the ''fiscal cliff'' that the United States faces at year-end, and continued weakness in housing, a panel of federal regulators said Wednesday.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council -- created as part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory act and made up of regulatory chiefs from the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies -- included the assessment in its annual report to Congress. 
Cybersecurity is still a threat, the council said, as is the possibility that large financial institutions might have concentrated exposures or complex trading strategies that could result in big losses because of a change in short-term interest rates.
''Thanks in part to progress on financial reform, the U.S. financial system is stronger and better able to absorb shocks than was the case even a year ago,'' the report said. But ''threats to financial stability, like threats to national security, are always present even if they are not always easy to discern in advance.''
The council also designated eight financial market utilities as ''systemically important,'' subjecting them to stricter oversight.
Most of the entities are clearing agencies, which facilitate the confirmation and settlement of trades of financial instruments and the transfer of funds underlying the trade.
The financial market utilities are one of three groups that the council will designate as ''systemically important.'' The other groups, whose members have not yet been designated, are financial institutions -- mainly banks -- and nonbank financial companies. The council is in the process of identifying those members.
Half of the market utilities group consists of entities overseen by the S.E.C.: the Depository Trust Company, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Options Clearing Corporation.
Two others are overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and ICE Clear Credit, which provides clearing services for credit-default swaps. And two are primarily regulated by the Fed, the Clearing House Payments Company, which operates the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, and CLS Bank International, which provides settlement services for foreign-exchange transactions.
The firms were selected unanimously at a closed meeting of the council on Wednesday.
At an open session, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary and council chairman, said significant work remained to be done.
Among the priorities, he said, are additional reforms both for money market funds and for the tri-party repo market, where securities dealers finance their portfolios through repurchase agreements. The S.E.C. has been studying money market reforms for more than a year, and is expected soon to recommend regulations that it hopes will make the funds less vulnerable to an investor run if a fund has significant losses.
The council also called for greater customer protection standards and segregation of customer assets, problems that came to light with the recent failures of MF Global and Peregrine Financial Group.
Fixing ''the broken housing finance system'' is also a priority, Mr. Geithner said, as is a tightening of mortgage servicing standards. In a nod to JPMorgan Chase's losses earlier this year, the council called for financial institutions to have independent risk-management structures that ''establish clear accountability for failures of risk management.''
High-speed trading deserves attention, the council said. It called for the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. to consider adopting regulations and ''risk-management standards for exchanges, clearing firms and other market participants that are relevant for a high-speed trading environment.''
The council identified the euro zone as perhaps the biggest threat to the nation's financial stability. While noting that the direct net exposures of large American banks to volatile European states are ''small relative to capital,'' it offered a stern warning: ''A systemic crisis in Europe, in which contagion and spillover effects spread widely among euro area countries and markets, represents a significant risk for U.S. institutions.''
In addition, the so-called fiscal cliff -- which includes the expiration of individual tax cuts and extended unemployment benefits, as well as spending cuts mandated by the Budget Control Act -- ''represents a threat to the recovery and financial stability if not addressed,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Maine Debate Hints at Rift On Medicaid After Ruling

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and ROBERT PEAR; Abby Goodnough reported from Augusta, and Robert Pear from Washington.

 BODY:
AUGUSTA, Me. -- As some Republican governors declare that they will not expand Medicaid under the national health care law, Gov. Paul R. LePage is going a step further. In what could lead to a direct confrontation with the Obama administration, he is planning to cut thousands of people from Maine's Medicaid rolls, arguing that the recent Supreme Court ruling on the law gives him license to do so.
Mr. LePage, a Republican, says the ruling gave states leeway to tighten eligibility for Medicaid, the joint state-federal program that provides health care to low-income and disabled people. Federal officials insist that while the ruling allowed states to opt out of a planned expansion of Medicaid, it left intact all other aspects of the law affecting the program. 
''The court's decision did not affect other provisions of the law,'' Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said in a letter to all governors last week.
The debate here may presage political and legal conflicts between the federal government and other states as they grapple with implications of the Supreme Court decision.
Ever since the law was enacted in 2010, governors of both parties have complained about its requirement to maintain Medicaid eligibility levels, saying it has hamstrung their efforts to balance budgets during a period of excruciating economic pressures. But the federal government has generally not relented on the so-called maintenance-of-effort requirement.
Before last month's ruling, Mr. LePage had planned to seek a federal waiver to remove more than 20,000 people from MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program. But he now says that the ruling made a waiver unnecessary.
''Maine believes the Supreme Court decision confirms that states have the flexibility to manage their Medicaid program without risking the loss of federal funds,'' Adrienne Bennett, Mr. LePage's spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
Brenda Kielty, a special assistant in the Maine attorney general's office, declined to explain the state's interpretation of the ruling. She said that instead of a waiver, the state would seek permission from the federal Department of Health and Human Services to amend its Medicaid plan, a step typically used for more routine changes.
Ms. Bennett said Mr. LePage was not available for an interview. But last week, Mr. LePage told WCSH-TV that if the federal government insisted that the state seek a waiver, there was ''no question'' he would take legal action.
''This is long from being over,'' he said at the time.
Officials in some other states share Mr. LePage's view.
Dennis G. Smith, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the requirement for states to maintain Medicaid eligibility standards was ''called into question'' as a result of the Supreme Court decision.
In its ruling, the Supreme Court accepted an argument by 26 states that they were being coerced into a new Medicaid program that would cover all people under the age of 65 with incomes less than or equal to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said Congress had put ''a gun to the head'' of states by requiring them to expand Medicaid or risk the loss of all federal Medicaid money.
That logic, Mr. Smith said, would seemingly also prevent the federal government from coercing states to keep current eligibility standards.
It would be wrong to assume states will now sharply cut Medicaid eligibility, Mr. Smith added. But he said the court decision strengthened the hand of states as they seek more tools to manage the costly program.
''States will look at this as leverage to bring the administration back to the table,'' he said.
Federal officials said that since President Obama signed the health care law in March 2010, they had not granted waivers formally exempting states from the maintenance of effort requirement. But in several cases, they have allowed states to make cutbacks.
Arizona was already operating its Medicaid program under a waiver. The Obama administration allowed the state to change its program, freezing enrollment for childless adults, after the waiver expired last September. In April, the administration allowed Wisconsin to start charging monthly premiums to some Medicaid beneficiaries and to deny coverage to others who had access to affordable employer-sponsored health insurance.
The United States House of Representatives passed legislation in May to repeal the maintenance-of-effort requirement. Republican senators have introduced a similar proposal, but it appears to have little chance of approval.
Several law professors said the Obama administration appeared to be on solid ground in refusing to let states tighten eligibility standards.
''I do not think Maine can do what it wants to do,'' said Professor Nicole Huberfeld, an expert on health law at the University of Kentucky.
Mr. LePage wants to eliminate Medicaid coverage for nearly 15,000 parents with incomes that fall between the federal poverty level ($23,050 for a family of four) and 133 percent of that level ($30,657 for a family of four). He is also planning to remove from the rolls about 6,150 19- and 20-year-olds with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty level, and to tighten eligibility limits in programs that help elderly and disabled people pay for prescription drugs and health care.
The state is already in the process of dropping from its Medicaid rolls about 14,000 parents who earn between 133 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Maine apparently did not need a waiver to do that. Under the law, the maintenance-of-effort requirement does not apply to that population if a state certifies to the federal government that it has or expects to have a budget deficit.
Mr. LePage is an outspoken critic of the health care law. He recently ignited controversy when, in criticizing the law's requirement that most Americans carry health insurance starting in 2014 or pay a tax penalty, he compared the Internal Revenue Service to the Gestapo.
He apologized in a radio address last week, but added, ''Americans should not be forced into something they don't want to do.''

HEADLINE: In Its First Action, Consumer Bureau Takes Aim at Capital One

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
9:19 p.m. Updated
Capital One, one of the nation's biggest banks, will reimburse $150 million to more than two million customers for selling them credit card products they could not use or did not want, as the nation's new consumer watchdog leveled its first enforcement action against the financial industry.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday hit Capital One with findings that a vendor working for the bank had pressured and deceived card holders into buying products presented as a way to protect them from identity theft and hardships like unemployment or disability.
The regulatory actions, totaling $210 million including fines to authorities, take aim at one of the financial industry's growing profit centers and increasingly controversial practices. Several other banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, were sued in June by the Hawaii attorney general, accused of improperly selling similar so-called add-on products, which consumer advocates typically regard as costly and ineffective. 
''We know these deceptive marketing tactics for credit card add-on products are not unique to a single institution,'' said Richard Cordray, the director of the consumer bureau. ''We expect announcements about other institutions as our ongoing work continues to unfold.''
Capital One - known for its catchy television ads that ask, ''What's in your wallet?'' - did not admit to or deny any of the findings. While it said the wrongdoing had occurred at outside call centers that ''did not always adhere to company sales scripts,'' the bank's president for credit cards, Ryan M. Schneider, acknowledged that the company was ''accountable for the actions that vendors take on our behalf.''
''We apologize to those customers who were impacted and we are committed to making it right,'' Mr. Schneider said.
Under the deal with regulators, Capital One must temporarily halt the marketing of certain add-on products and submit to an independent audit. The bank said it thought the refunds, which victims are to begin receiving later this year, would average less than $100 a person.
In a related action, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency required the bank to reimburse customers ''harmed by unfair billing practices'' that unfolded over a 10-year span, from 2002 to June of last year. The bank, regulators say, billed customers even though it had failed to provide full use of the product.
''Unfair and deceptive practices will not be tolerated,'' Thomas J. Curry, the comptroller, said on Wednesday.
The regulatory scrutiny comes on the heels of several Wall Street blowups and federal investigations that have stoked the anger of consumers and investors. Last month, Barclays agreed to pay authorities $450 million to settle accusations that it had manipulated a benchmark interest rate, part of a wide-ranging inquiry. JPMorgan Chase is dealing with the fallout from a multibillion-dollar trading debacle.
The Capital One action was the consumer bureau's first effort at flexing its enforcement muscle. A centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the two-year-old bureau is charged with rooting out abuses in areas including mortgages and payday loans.
The action Wednesday suggests that the enforcement arm is emerging as a cornerstone of the agency, which early on faced skepticism over whether it would aggressively police the nation's biggest banks. Mr. Cordray, who previously ran the bureau's enforcement division, said that his agency's investigations would now happen ''more steadily.''
What is more, the enforcement action will most likely embolden consumers to file class-action lawsuits, according to Stacie E. McGinn, a lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York. ''This practice is hardly limited to Capital One,'' said Richard Golomb, a lawyer in Philadelphia who has brought class-action lawsuits against lenders for payment protection insurance.
That product, which promises to forgive or trim the debts of card holders in the event that they lose their jobs, become disabled or die, became particularly attractive to anxious consumers in the depths of the recession. While costs vary by card issuer, companies typically charge up to 80 cents for every $100 of debt that is insured, lawyers for consumers said.
In addition to deceptively pushing those plans, regulators say, Capital One offered credit monitoring, a feature that came with identity-theft protection and ''credit education'' for customers with a spotty borrowing history.
In a 30-page order, the consumer bureau outlined how call centers for the bank marketed and sold the products to ineligible unemployed consumers and forced the products without the consumer's consent. In other cases, according to the bureau, the bank employed ''high pressure tactics,'' including misleading customers into thinking the product was free, mandatory and would bolster credit scores.
The bank has run afoul of regulators before. In January, Attorney General Darrell V. McGraw Jr. of West Virginia, reached a $13.5 million agreement with Capital One to settle accusations surrounding its payment protection programs.
The attorney general of Mississippi, Jim Hood, also sued Capital One in June for reportedly ''slamming'' customers by enrolling them in payment protection programs without their consent and then hitting them with fees.
A top official at the industry trade group the American Bankers Association, Kenneth Clayton, said that for some people ''the value of the product is worth the cost. People buy these products for a number of reasons, including peace of mind and knowing they will be protected if certain untimely life events make it difficult to repay their bills.''
Capital One, in contrast, has tussled with consumer advocacy groups like the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which has assailed the bank for its subprime and risky lending. About a third of Capital One's credit card portfolio carries the subprime label, defined as loans to borrowers with credit scores below 660, the company said last year.
The coalition led the charge last year against Capital One's bid to take over ING's online banking unit in the United States, saying the deal would create the next too-big-to-fail banking behemoth. The deal, the latest in a string of acquisitions, transformed Capital One into the fifth-largest bank by deposits. Capital One on Wednesday reported that its second-quarter profit dropped 90 percent to $92 million, because of the bank's recent acquisitions.
While the Federal Reserve approved the ING deal, the consent came with some crucial conditions. The Fed, citing consumer complaints and legal actions against the bank, ordered Capital One to bolster its internal controls of lending and debt-collection practices.
In addition to David M. Louie, Hawaii's attorney general, suing seven major banks over what were suspected to be unfair and deceptive sales of credit card add-ons, the Minnesota attorney general, Lori Swanson, sued Discover in June 2010, accusing the credit card company of duping consumers into buying the products.
Jill Amundson, who manages real-estate holdings in Minneapolis, said she was shocked when charges for payment protection insurance started showing up on her Discover card bill in 2008. ''I never enrolled and I find it particularly galling because the charges are small so you might miss them,'' she said. Discover waived the charges once she complained.
A spokeswoman for Discover said the company takes ''every customer's concerns seriously'' and tries to address them.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tiny Concrete Jungles

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
SIXTY-SIX square feet is certainly bigger than a window box, but it is, perhaps, smaller than some fire escapes.
Yet the dimensions of this narrow outdoor room, which sits outside a garret-like apartment on top of a Brooklyn brownstone, are ample enough to support a tangle of roses, lilies and anemones, along with clematis, heliotrope and creeping jenny, strawberries, figs and herbs, mint and echinacea, two lanky humans and a large, irritable black cat. Also, a table for two and a brazier for cooking.
One hot, bright evening recently, Marie Viljoen and Vincent Mounier sidled this way and that on their terrace (she is 5-foot-11 and he is 6-foot-2), offering gin infused with red currants and topped off with beach-plum liqueur or water with basil, mint and lemon. And what about a loquat? 
On the table, there were roses in a jelly jar and Estorbo, the cat. Like the riot of plants outside, Ms. Viljoen, 42, and Mr. Mounier, 48, would appear to be thriving in their tiny habitat (their two-room apartment is just under 400 square feet). Eight years ago, when she was single, and hankering for a garden, Ms. Viljoen, an opera singer turned garden designer, moved into this apartment (rent, $1,900) because she knew what she could make of its outdoor room, which was then an empty, leaky masonry box.
As the micro-pad continues to work its way through the news cycle, following Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's challenge to developers to design 300-square-foot micro-units for a city-owned plot on East 27th Street, it is worth noting that in New York City, tiny apartments have been a housing staple for at least a century, their constraints and quirks part of the price of admission here.
And living well in them has long been celebrated, in a literary tradition that includes the essays of the late Laurie Colwin, the domestic miniaturist, who elegized her one-room Greenwich Village apartment, just ''a little larger than the Columbia Encyclopedia,'' and the meals she made there on a hot plate. (Ms. Colwin would recognize a kindred spirit in Ms. Viljoen, whose literate, lovely blog, 66 Square Feet, is a memoir told in meals. What Ms. Colwin might have made of the Internet is another story entirely.)
Many New Yorkers continue to endure their cramped spaces because they come with another prize: outdoor space. As the photographer Alex MacLean showed in ''Up on the Roof: New York's Hidden Skyline Spaces,'' a new book with images shot from the bubble of a helicopter, that urban greenery takes multifarious forms. The bright patches of green -- proof of life, aloft! -- that fleck the gray aerial grid will take your breath away.
What follows are tales of two of the city's tiny gardens, and how they grew.
THE ACCIDENTAL GARDENER
Alejandro Aguilar has developed a 12-step program for those who dwell in micro-pads. The first step: ''Admit you live in a small space. Deal with it.''
Mr. Aguilar, a 48-year-old designer from Honduras, has been dealing with tiny spaces for more than a decade, ever since he moved into a 184-square-foot apartment on the Lower East Side and carved out a specialty as a wrangler of tiny homes after having puzzled out his own.
He has taught classes in small-space living at the continuing-education school at Hunter College. He is an expert at excision, exhorting students and clients to prune unwieldy, unused possessions and bad habits. (Mr. Aguilar allows himself no more than six pairs of shoes, one jacket, one change of sheets and four towels.) He eschews free-standing furniture for built-ins.
But in 2006, when the rent on his own micro-pad rose to $1,200 from $800 and the landlord began charging for electricity, which averaged an alarming $250 a month, Mr. Aguilar left Manhattan and became the third roommate in a three-bedroom apartment in a rowhouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. (Before that, there was an unhappy rental in the South Bronx, but that is another story.) Since he was the third and most recent roommate, he drew the smallest, worst room, next to the kitchen. It looked out on a grubby tar roof walled in on three sides by his own building and the two that flanked it.
In his 10-by-12-foot room, which he rents for $1,000, Mr. Aguilar constructed a storage and living system of built-ins, curtains, mirrors and lighting, drastically altering the feeling and functionality of the space. Then he tackled the roof.
In May 2010, he laid down a deck with timber he cut in varying lengths to make a pattern like a Mondrian painting. He built one raised bed, then another. He hung containers up the wall, proceeding vertically, as he had in his bedroom. He worked instinctively, making assemblages that pleased him visually, buying plants for their color and shape, and learning the names as he went along.
He planted a dogwood, a plum tree and lilac bushes. He put begonias in tiny containers that fit together like a puzzle, so the begonias wouldn't grow any bigger. He planted vines like moonflower and grapes, roses and clematis. And as they began to climb, he built a ladder for them out of metal sign holders (in the winter when the leaves are gone, the grid they form looks like a Mondrian painting as well).
When the vines reached an upstairs neighbor's window, he wove a net of twine and threw it down from the roof, so the vines could latch onto it and skirt the windows above.
All in, he has planted more than 300 plants (and spent about $8,000), a tally that does not include the seeds from a wildflower mix he tipped into a planter last May, the progeny of which is now waist high.
As a child, Mr. Aguilar said, he learned early on to fit in, to take up as little space as possible, to be nearly invisible. He came to this country at age 9 to be treated for a brain tumor and lived on Long Island with a series of aunts and their families, whom he barely knew. He grew estranged from his parents.
In six years, he moved six times and attended six schools, graduating early to study biochemistry at the University at Buffalo, though he eventually dropped out. His professional life as a designer can be summed up by the manifesto ''do more with less.''
But his garden, as abundant as a tropical jungle, is in opposition to these principles, a corrective to a lifetime of restraint.
A BIG ENOUGH PATCH OF HAPPINESS
''Ask for what you want. Then stick around.'' That is one of the posts on the blog Ms. Viljoen began in May 2007 as a place to stretch out as a writer and photographer.
The blog form was just right for recording her enthusiasms, as she put it, for the minute changes that occur in a garden, like the opening of a rose. It also gave her a way to communicate with her mother back home in Cape Town, over their shared interest in gardening.
But that particular post was no floral reference. It was the epigraph to her first meeting with Mr. Mounier, with whom she had been corresponding for a few months, blog to blog, as it were. He was a photographer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and she was interested in a photographic technique that he practiced. Googling it, she came upon his blog, which had an inscrutable name, Coriolistic Anachronisms, but lucid essays about his craft.
After a month or so of trading increasingly epic comments and e-mails with Ms. Viljoen, Mr. Mounier wrote that if she lived in his city, he would love to take her out for a cup of coffee. She challenged him to do so. In September of that year, he flew in for their first date, a cup of coffee at the Newark airport. Ms. Viljoen's post that day was pictorial, a photograph of fireworks.
By January, they were married at her parents' house in Cape Town. ''We had rather a good day on Thursday,'' she wrote with typical economy.
Ms. Viljoen's first career was onstage. She had been an opera singer, living in Washington and New York City, and singing in Europe, when she contracted whooping cough in 2000, ending her career. (At 16, when her high school classmates were receiving their pertussis boosters, she hid in the bathroom.)
Looking for another way to pay the rent, she walked into the Chelsea Garden Center and asked for a job. She grew up gardening, so she knew a lot about plants, but not much, she said, about those in this time zone.
Before long, though, she was designing gardens, including a multilevel extravaganza for Anderson Cooper. She also adopted Estorbo, the shop cat, because his jaw was broken and he needed care. Eventually she graduated to a job as the head designer of a company called Holly, Wood & Vine, but in 2009, during the first wallop of the recession, she was let go, a traumatic event that nonetheless jump-started another career, as a garden writer.
With lush photographs and spare prose, Ms. Viljoen has used 66 Square Feet to record her life as a gardener, a cook and an urban forager, harvesting mushrooms from Green-Wood Cemetery, beach plums from Jamaica Bay and century-old glass bottles from the dump at Dead Horse Bay, as well as plucking condoms from Prospect Park, a group endeavor she called the Prospect Park Litter Mob, and built a blog around, before throwing out her rubber gloves last spring (that blog's mandate: carpe condom).
Meanwhile, 66 Square Feet has slowly gained an avid following, which resulted in an article in Martha Stewart Living and, later, a book deal. Out in 2013, ''66 Square Feet'' is a diary in recipes that progresses seasonally, the sum of which Ms. Viljoen describes as ''an edible love letter to living in a tiny space in an enormous city.'' Though truth be told, she and Mr. Mounier hope they will not be living in such a small space forever.
Out on the terrace last week, the light was honey-colored and horizontal. As Estorbo tried halfheartedly to scratch one visitor, Ms. Viljoen ducked under a door jamb to offer another visitor a second glass of red currant gin.
''I think two people can live well no matter what and no matter where,'' she said. ''The idea is to take pleasure in life, and be willing to be pleased.''

HEADLINE: Are Liberal Christians Becoming Rare?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Can Liberal Christianity Be Saved?,'' by Ross Douthat (column, July 15):
As an Episcopal priest, I am concerned not that ''liberal Christianity'' be saved but that authentic Christianity be practiced.
The ''conservative'' churches that seem to be flourishing today often conjoin the flag and the cross, operate racially and economically segregated schools, oppose government programs that help the poor, and deny both scientific learning and biblical scholarship. 
There has indeed been a lot of foolishness in the Episcopal Church, much of it an outgrowth of the '60s, as Mr. Douthat rightly says. And while we Episcopalians are certainly smaller and, dare I say, humbler than before, we have greater lay participation and more generous giving today than even in the benchmark days of the 1950s.
An authentic church for the future will of course be both liberal and conservative, progressive and traditional. That is what the Episcopal Church has been at our best, and that is what we shall be in the years to come as we promote a way of life that models freedom as loving service to God and neighbor.
(Rev.) BRUCE M. SHIPMAN Groton, Conn., July 15, 2012
To the Editor:
If liberal Christianity is defined as doing anything to adapt to the culture, I'd be glad to pray over its grave. But that's neither the church I serve nor the diocese I lead.
The Episcopal Church is one of many mainline denominations, part of America's ecclesiastical landscape since the beginning of our country. At times, each denomination has reflected an institutional arrogance, assuming that people will know and find us because we've been around so long.
My predecessor, Bishop John Shelby Spong, addressed this arrogance by challenging Christians to think critically and become more biblically literate.
In the Diocese of Newark of the Episcopal Church, we answer the charge to respect the dignity of every human being by advocating for the rights of women, gays and lesbians, and people of color. We live out our ministries locally, expanding them to meet new needs, like offering ''ashes to go'' to commuters and worship services for children with special needs and their families.
As we engage the world and its unofficial religion of instant gratification, it becomes more important for us to be grounded in faith, committed in spiritual practice, and audaciously witnessing to the Gospel. The mainline dimension of our church may be dying. Requiescat in pace. But what's emerging is transforming lives. I invite Mr. Douthat to come see.
(Rt. Rev.) MARK M. BECKWITH Bishop, Episcopal Diocese of Newark Newark, July 17, 2012
To the Editor:
Ross Douthat brought up every salient point about the Episcopal Church's demise. Many of us orthodox Episcopalians have been saddened by this catastrophe, and yet we remain deeply puzzled. We can't figure out why church leaders, as Mr. Douthat says, ''have a weird self-righteousness about their looming extinction.''
The reason the beautiful, once-staid Episcopal churches are closing and emptying out is that one can get the same teaching at the neighborhood Starbucks or yoga class. So why bother to go to both?
LESLIE G. MARSHALL Carlsbad, Calif., July 15, 2012
To the Editor:
Although I'm usually not politically or theologically on the same page as Ross Douthat, he hits the nail right on the head regarding the demise, however unfortunate, of liberal Christianity.
Perhaps that longing for identity, clarity of purpose, belief and transcendent, awe-inspiring liturgy is why the Latin Mass congregation at the local Catholic parish has tripled in attendance, not owing to white-haired folks like me, though some are present. I'm surprised at the numbers of the 20- and 30-somethings.
And perhaps that longing is evident in the fact that certain traditional, habit-wearing orders of nuns, like some Dominican congregations and others, are attracting younger members by the dozens and aren't dying out but in fact are growing.
We're not in 1968 anymore, and at 65, I can testify to that.
STEVEN GIOVANGELO Indianapolis, July 15, 2012
The writer, who was raised Roman Catholic, is a retired Episcopal priest.
To the Editor:
Putting the cart before the horse, Ross Douthat apparently believes that Rome's investigation of progressive nuns was essential, for without it, ''the orders in question were likely to disappear.''
Most educated young women today -- and many others for nearly 50 years -- have simply found it impossible to even consider becoming a Catholic sister. They are repelled by the Catholic hierarchy's attitude toward women -- its general disregard, lack of collegiality and suspicion.
SUELLEN HOY Highland Park, Ill., July 16, 2012

HEADLINE: Rate Inquiry Focus Turns To Possible Collusion

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
While much of the scrutiny surrounding interest rate manipulation has centered on Barclays, regulators have said that traders at the big British bank colluded with rivals to influence a key benchmark.
As part of a three-year scheme, a senior Barclays trader in Europe worked with counterparts at Credit Agricole, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale, according to people with knowledge of the matter who could not speak publicly because of the investigation. Regulators are examining whether at least one other bank was involved, one of the people said.
In an effort to bolster their profits, the traders collaborated to push interest rates up or down, according to regulatory documents. By doing so, they aimed to eke out extra gains on their trades or limit losses. In its complaint against Barclays, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission described the bank's trader as having ''orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks'' to profit on their portfolios. 
In June, Barclays paid $450 million to settle its case with the commission, the Justice Department and the Financial Services Authority of Britain. British and American authorities accused the bank of submitting false rates from 2005 through 2009. Regulators have also conducted investigations of others involved in the scheme.
As the rate-manipulation scandal spreads to other banks, the fallout could have major ramifications for the financial industry. Civil and criminal authorities around the world are investigating, and lawmakers in the United States have started their own inquiries. The civil and criminal actions, as well as private lawsuits, could cost the banks tens of billions of dollars.
The Barclays case centers on key benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and the Euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. Such rates are used to determine the borrowing costs for consumers and corporations. The senior trader at Barclays who worked with the four European banks specifically tried to manipulate Euribor, according to regulators.
The Barclays case was the first to emerge from the multiyear investigation, which has also touched some of the biggest banks on Wall Street. Authorities in the United States, Britain, Japan and elsewhere are also looking into the potential involvement of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and UBS. The Financial Times previously reported the names of the four European banks that worked with the Barclays trader.
The broad investigation has prompted outrage from lawmakers in Washington and London. In recent weeks, British central bankers and regulators testified to Parliament about their role in the rate-manipulation scandal. In the United States, politicians are asking why regulators did not stop the illegal activities, even though regulators knew about potential problems as far back as 2007.
In 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggested changes to the process, after learning that Barclays reported artificially low rates, according to documents. The regulator then shared those recommendations with the Bank of England, the British central bank. But the New York Fed did not end the rate manipulation at Barclays.
Top central bank officials are now signaling a willingness to change the system.
On Wednesday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, said he and other central bank chiefs would discuss ways of improving Libor, or even replacing it, when they are scheduled to meet on Sept. 17.
''In terms of alternatives, there is an attraction to moving toward, obviously, market-based rates if possible,'' Mr. Carney said at a news conference. Mr. Carney currently heads the Financial Stability Board, a body consisting of central banks and finance ministries that was set up in 2009 to coordinate global financial regulation.
Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, sent a letter on Wednesday to central bank chiefs inviting them to discuss Libor reforms at another meeting scheduled for September. The Bank of England did not respond to a request for comment. Jeremy Harrison, a Bank of Canada spokesman, confirmed the existence of Mr. King's letter and its purpose.
The United States Congress is also delving into the matter, as lawmakers question why the rate-setting process was not better policed.
Representative Randy Neugebauer, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee investigating Libor, is seeking documents from the New York Fed about JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the three American banks involved in setting the rate. Last week, Mr. Neugebauer collected transcripts from at least a dozen phone calls in 2007 and 2008 between New York Fed officials and executives at Barclays.
The House committee has also homed in on Barclays. On Monday, Congressional staff will receive a briefing about Libor from the general counsel of Barclays in America and its chief lobbyist, according to a government official.
Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Citing Deflation, I.M.F. Asks Europe Central Bank to Buy More Sovereign Debt

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The International Monetary Fund, warning of ''a sizable risk'' that some euro zone countries could suffer a debilitating decline in prices, called on Wednesday for the European Central Bank to pump money into the region's economy by buying huge volumes of government bonds.
Such bond buying, which the Federal Reserve has undertaken in recent years to stimulate the United States economy, is a move the central bank has resisted, one that would probably outrage the fiscal disciplinarians of Germany.
And it is unclear whether the I.M.F.'s public push for big spending by the central bank will make it more or less likely for the bank's president, Mario Draghi, to act. He, like any central banker, wants to appear immune to outside pressure. 
But the I.M.F. is well respected, and its warning of deflation, a destructive plunge in prices, could help give the central bank the economic rationale to use the stimulus of buying billions of euros in government bonds.
In a report critical of euro zone policy, the I.M.F. said that there was a 25 percent risk of consumer price deflation before 2014 and that the danger was greatest in countries, like Italy, where growth was slow and the government was counting on tax increases to reduce its huge debt.
''A deeper euro area crisis would have substantial global implications,'' the I.M.F. said in its report, which also warned of other possible shocks to the euro currency bloc, including the failure of a big bank.
The central bank did not comment on the fund's report.
Deflation is typically a feature of severe economic decline and soaring joblessness that far outweighs any benefit to consumers from falling prices. A downward price spiral would make it harder for countries like Greece, Italy and Spain to control government debt, the fund said, because falling prices and wages would further depress tax receipts.
Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy has been a leading proponent of government bond buying by the central bank. Spanish leaders have been pleading with the bank to buy their bonds and hold down borrowing costs.
The central bank has spent 212 billion euros, or $260 billion, at the current exchange rate, buying government bonds since 2010, but has resisted calls for it to mimic the much larger purchases by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed has made two rounds of purchases, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. Many economists say this quantitative easing is a reason the United States economy recovered from the crisis faster than most of its European counterparts.
Richard Barwell, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, doubted that the central bank would follow the monetary fund's advice without evidence of deflation throughout the euro zone. ''I think they would view it as being counterproductive,'' he said. ''It would be alleviating all pressure on policy makers to solve the underlying cause of the problem.''
But fund officials framed their call for big bond purchases as a way for the central bank to maintain its control over interest rates and contain borrowing costs for troubled countries.
''It is an essential part of the E.C.B. fulfilling its mandate,'' Helge Berger, an adviser in the fund's European department, said during a conference call Wednesday with reporters.
Quantitative easing is how central banks stimulate the economy when they have already pushed interest rates as low as they can go. This month, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate below 1 percent for the first time, to 0.75 percent. But quantitative easing is opposed by Germany, the biggest contributor to the bank, because it would amount to the use of the central bank to finance governments. And German sentiment carries weight with the bank, which is reluctant to further divide the euro zone.
Mr. Draghi has given no clear signals that the bank is seriously considering quantitative easing or other measures. But on Tuesday, at a meeting here with Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, Mr. Draghi tentatively addressed a widespread concern that central bank bond buying hurts more than it helps. For instance, it could make the central bank a senior creditor over other bond buyers, who would then be at greater risk if a government defaulted on its bonds.
This year, when the central bank, I.M.F. and European Union agreed to another rescue of Greece, the bank would not share in the losses that private investors were required to take on their Greek bonds. That position inadvertently increased the perceived risk of other governments' bonds, by signaling that private investors would be last to collect in case of future losses.
But Mr. Draghi, at his meeting with Mr. Noonan, apparently indicated that the central bank was reconsidering its insistence that it rank above private investors when it holds a government's bonds. ''Mr. Draghi noted that the question of burden sharing with senior bond holders is evolving at the European level,'' the bank said in a statement later.
The fund's warning about deflation was part of a report on euro zone policies in which the fund again criticized European leaders' handling of the euro crisis. ''The deepening of the crisis suggests that its root causes remain unaddressed,'' the report said. It faulted what it said was a lack of ''ambitious policies to restore strong and balanced growth across the euro area.''
''The viability of the monetary union itself'' is in doubt, the fund said. It praised progress by European leaders in recent weeks on creating a banking union with a central regulator -- based at the E.C.B. -- which it said would help prevent national regulators from pursuing policies designed to protect their banks at the expense of those of other countries.
Common bank supervision ''allows banks to be guided by European or euro area considerations,'' Mahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the fund's European department, said during the conference call.
But the fund said that euro zone countries needed to go further, eventually issuing common debt and ceding some authority over their national finances. Germany and some other countries remain firmly opposed to common debt, so-called euro bonds, unless they have more control over spending by other euro zone countries. France and other countries favor euro bonds but have not been willing to give up control over their own budgets.
The fund acknowledged that it would take time to build a more durable currency union and said that central bank action was needed in the meantime.
''Monetary policy can play a role in easing the transition until structural reforms become effective,'' the fund said. ''Because inflation is low and falling, the E.C.B. has room for lowering rates, and deploying additional unconventional measures would relieve severe stress in some markets.''
In a response to the report on behalf of European Union institutions, Ambroise Fayolle, who represents France on the executive board of the fund, said that officials were ''in broad agreement'' with the fund's conclusions. He highlighted the progress that European leaders had made to impose more spending discipline on one another and strengthen the banking system.
''The authorities reiterate their resolve to take all the necessary actions to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area,'' he said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Borough President Questions Chelsea Market Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
A much-debated proposal to build above Chelsea Market has hit another obstacle, in the form of Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, who plans to recommend on Thursday that the project be vetoed unless it is significantly scaled back.
Mr. Stringer's position, although not binding, is particularly significant because he is a likely candidate for mayor next year, and one of his probable chief rivals, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, is trapped between neighborhood activists who want her to kill the project and business leaders who want her to approve it. 
Jamestown Properties, the owner of Chelsea Market, has sought to add two structures atop the building, which houses a popular upscale food court that has become a destination for gourmands and tourists. The building, which abuts the High Line, is in a corner of Chelsea that is rapidly changing, and Jamestown has proposed adding an eight-story, 240,000-square-foot office tower along 10th Avenue, and an 11-story, 90,000-square-foot hotel along Ninth Avenue to the existing structure.
But in an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Stringer said he would recommend that the developers abandon the 10th Avenue expansion and increase the size of the Ninth Avenue one. He said he was concerned that the height and bulk of the proposed office tower -- which at one time had been envisioned as a gleaming glass cube -- would not fit in with the neighborhood.
''The reason I'm saying no is they didn't meet the standard to becoming a part of the community,'' Mr. Stringer said. ''They have to coexist with that community, not overwhelm it.''
The proposal will next be considered by the city's Planning Commission, before heading to the office of Ms. Quinn, who, as the councilwoman representing Chelsea, can reject any local project that requires zoning waivers.
Ms. Quinn declined to comment on Mr. Stringer's concerns; her spokesman said she does not comment on land-use issues that have not yet crossed her desk.
But she is well aware that the proposal pits important political allies -- including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, construction unions and the real estate industry, who view the project as an economic engine -- against some of her longtime constituents, who believe the project is too big and could set a troubling zoning precedent.
Mr. Stringer said he sought to balance economic growth and the need for more office space for the growing high-tech sector against his conclusion that ''the local community deserves equal protection.'' He suggested, as well, that he is willing to consider a compromise in the form of a 20 percent height reduction along 10th Avenue, as Community Board 4 recommended last month.
Mr. Stringer said he also wanted assurances that Chelsea Market would not be torn down for future development; that the community would have input into the design of any expansion; that the developer would consider setting aside money for moderate-income housing in the area; and that the market's ground floor would retain its mix of retail, food and even public art.
''It's not about politics,'' he said. ''It's really about what's possible from an urban-planning perspective.''
A spokesman for Jamestown Properties, Lee Silberstein, said that he had not seen Mr. Stringer's recommendation, but said the developer had already made concessions, including abandoning the idea of a hotel in one of the proposed new towers, which some residents specifically opposed.
''The expansion of Chelsea Market will create some 1,200 jobs by providing much-needed room for rapidly expanding technology and media companies to grow,'' he said. ''The expansion will be achieved without relocating existing tenants or any public subsidy, and will in fact generate some $7 million of new tax revenue annually as well as nearly $20 million to benefit the High Line. We will continue to make the case that the expansion should be viewed favorably as we move through the review and approval process.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Says Fed Action Could Hurt Economy

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans pressed the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Wednesday to forswear additional actions to stimulate growth, warning that the results would be counterproductive.
Mr. Bernanke avoided commitments during two days of Congressional testimony, but he told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the Fed was prepared to expand its efforts if it concluded that job growth had stalled.
Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee, which hosted Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday, wasted little time in responding. 
They questioned whether the Fed's existing efforts were bolstering growth and suggested any benefits had been exhausted. They fretted that the Fed was seeding higher inflation and postponing a necessary reckoning with the federal debt.
''The truth is the Federal Reserve cannot rescue Americans from the consequences of failed economic and regulatory policies passed by Congress and signed by the president,'' said the committee chairman, Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama.
Democrats made no countervailing effort to convince Mr. Bernanke that he should take additional action, instead congratulating the Fed chairman in the manner of people confident that they were speaking to an ally.
''I want to thank you for your steadfast commitment to taking action as you deem appropriate,'' said Representative Michael E. Capuano, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Said Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, ''I would like to yield most of my time to you'' to speak about the Fed's successes.
Representative John Carney, Democrat of Delaware, asked, ''The Fed is doing everything it can to address the unemployment part of your mandate, is that correct?''
Mr. Bernanke paused a moment before responding that the Fed ''certainly'' could do more, and was considering whether it should.
''We are very committed to ensuring, or at least doing all we can to ensure, that we continue to make progress on unemployment,'' he said earlier in the hearing.
The three hours of testimony provided little clarity about what the Fed's policy-making committee would do at its next scheduled meeting July 31 and Aug. 1. Mr. Bernanke said Tuesday that the Fed remained uncertain about the economy, which appears to be growing slowly -- recovering from crisis, but not at a rapid enough pace to reduce persistent unemployment.
The Fed's beige book survey of regional business conditions, published Wednesday, reported ''modest to moderate'' growth in late June and early July. The regional reports were weaker in aggregate than the last report in early June.
While the Fed has responded vigorously to any sign that the economy is slipping back toward recession, it has hesitated to address the current malaise.
Sandra Pianalto, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, noted Tuesday that taking additional action carried significant risks, including the possibility that the Fed could disrupt the function of financial markets by soaking up too large a share of Treasury securities or other financial assets.
She also noted the Fed's limited power. ''Monetary policy cannot directly control the unemployment rate; it can only foster conditions in financial markets that are conducive to growth and a lower unemployment rate,'' she said.
Republicans embroidered this theme on Wednesday.
Noting that ''we have seen the greatest monetary stimulus in the history of our country,'' and that the economy was still just muddling along, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, asked Mr. Bernanke why he believed that additional measures would produce better results.
''There are limits to what monetary policy can achieve,'' Mr. Hensarling said.
Mr. Bernanke responded that monetary policy ''is not a panacea,'' but he said that the Fed had succeeded in reducing borrowing costs, and that he was confident that the Fed retained the power to further reduce interest rates.
Mr. Bernanke did rule out one form of new action, the idea that the Fed could bolster growth by temporarily encouraging a higher rate of inflation.
Under questioning by Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, Mr. Bernanke offered about as clear a rejection of such a policy as is ever heard from a central banker.
''I don't think, first, that we could do that without losing control of the inflation process,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
''Secondly,'' he continued, ''I'm very skeptical that it would increase confidence among businesses and households and increase economic activity. I think it would create a lot of problems in financial markets as well.''
''And so,'' he concluded, ''I don't think that's a strategy that has a lot of support on the Federal Open Market Committee.''

HEADLINE: Philosophic Clash Over Government's Role Highlights Parties' Divide

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Bowling Green, Ohio.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It took only a few days for it to become a favorite Republican talking point. President Obama told an audience that ''if you've got a business, you didn't build that; somebody else made that happen.''
Suddenly his critics had proof that he does not believe in individual success or the free market. Mitt Romney scrapped much of his stump speech on Wednesday to focus on the line and sent surrogates to reinforce the point. Mr. Obama's aides said he was taken out of context, that he was referring to the value of public structures like bridges and roads in the nation's commerce. 
Either way, putting aside the predictable partisan cross-fire and the inevitable Internet-fueled distortions, even in proper context the president's remarks crystallize a profound disagreement that defines this year's campaign. More perhaps than any presidential contest in years, the choice between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney presents voters with starkly different philosophies about the role of government in American society.
Read in total, Mr. Obama's comments make clear that he celebrates individual achievement and free enterprise while believing that they are bolstered by collective investment. At its core, the president's argument is that the every-man-for-himself ethos he attributes to his opponents does not work. Instead, he advances a we're-in-this-together creed born out of his days as a community activist. It is this belief that to him justifies government programs as necessary for American progress at a time when that is not fashionable.
Mr. Romney, for his part, has also been a believer in activist government at times, certainly when he was governor of Massachusetts and enacted a pioneering plan to expand health care coverage. But the lifelong entrepreneur in him hears words like Mr. Obama's as a repudiation of the storied American tradition of rugged individualism and the self-made man. While he is pressing an argument as part of his campaign, he also reflects a deep strain in America that eschews the sort of communitarian doctrine espoused by the president.
''America has historically swung between an emphasis on individualism and an emphasis on community,'' said Robert D. Putnam, a Harvard University professor who has written books on the role of community in America. ''It may not feel like we're having this big philosophical debate, but underneath, I think that really is what's at stake.''
Professor Putnam, who got to know Mr. Obama during seminar retreats more than a decade ago where these issues were discussed, said individualism had dominated the national mood for much of the last 40 years. ''This is a big swing of the historical pendulum, and he'd like to be involved in beginning the swing back the other direction,'' he said of Mr. Obama.
But those on the other side said the president's remarks were revealing because by arguing that the state or society had a role in creating individual success, they believe he is justifying the government's taking a share. Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Obama's philosophy had driven Mr. Romney's countervailing approach.
''Obama really has become the argument for redistribution, the argument for statism,'' said Mr. Hassett, who has advised George W. Bush, John McCain and now Mr. Romney. ''And so that's shaped his opposition.''
Mr. Obama's remarks reflect sentiments he expressed in a speech in Osawatomie, Kan., last December, previewing what he saw as themes of the campaign. They also resemble similar thoughts articulated by Elizabeth Warren, the hero of liberals who is running for the Senate in Massachusetts.
Mr. Obama's latest comments came on Friday night in a fire station in Roanoke, Va. ''Look,'' he told supporters, ''if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, 'Well, it must be because I was just so smart.' There are a lot of smart people out there. 'It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.' Let me tell you something, there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.
''If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.
''The point is, that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.''
Within days, critics took notice, and the remarks became fodder for discussion on Fox News and in outlets like National Review. By Wednesday, Mr. Romney made it his topic for the day.
The phrase ''really reveals what he thinks about our country, about our people, about free enterprise, about freedom, about individual initiative, about America,'' Mr. Romney told supporters in Bowling Green, Ohio. He asked those who started or ran a business to stand. Some 30 to 40 people did, many holding signs reading, ''I created a business. Not the government'' or ''I opened my own business.''
''I know that you recognize a lot of people helped you in that business,'' Mr. Romney told them. ''Perhaps the banks. Investors. There's no question your mom and dad, your schoolteacher, the people who provide roads, the fire and police. But let me ask you this: Did you build your business? If you did, raise your hand.''
Many hands went up. ''Take that, Mr. President,'' Mr. Romney said.
David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said in an interview that the president considers individual initiative ''the principal driver in one's success'' but ''it's also true there are things we do as a country that contribute to that.''
For Mr. Obama, he said, this is nothing new. ''This isn't a revelation,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''This is a fundamental article of faith.''
And a fundamental point of contention to be resolved, however temporarily, in November.

HEADLINE: Rebels Hone Explosives Skills to Even the Odds

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

 BODY:
ANTAKYA, Turkey -- The lethal attack on Wednesday on President Bashar al-Assad's senior security chiefs aligned neatly with a tactical shift that had changed the direction of Syria's long conflict: the opposition fighters' swift and successful adoption of makeshift bombs.
Bombs have been in rebel use since violence intensified in Syria in late 2011. But since midspring, anti-Assad fighters have become bolder and sharply more effective with their use, and not only in what is apparently their hand in the assassinations in Damascus.
Improvised bombs have steadily become the most punishing weapon in the otherwise underequipped rebels' arsenal, repeatedly destroying Syria's main battle tanks, halting army convoys and inflicting heavy casualties on government ground operations in areas where armed resistance is strong, Western analysts and rebel field commanders and fighters said.
In this way, even as the anti-Assad fighters have appealed for international intervention and other forms of material and military support, local fighters have created their own informal buffer zones, pockets of the Syrian countryside that are now largely free of government ground troops. 
''The bomb is not only essential, it is a main part of our success,'' said a former Syrian Army artillery major, who called himself Abu Akhmed and leads a fighting group in Idlib, a northern Syrian province, in a meeting in a house in this Turkish city crowded with fighters.
''When you think of why we are improving and getting stronger, it is not because more weapons are coming in from outside,'' he added. ''The main reason is because we are becoming more organized, and because of our bombs.''
The bombs that Abu Akhmed described, known in Western military jargon as improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s, have done more than kill Syrian soldiers and deny the Syrian Army access to Syrian terrain.
The weapon that has long been championed in the popular imagination and public discourse of underground fighters as a means to kill or drive off foreign occupiers -- whether Russians in Chechnya or Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan -- has been turned against a standing Arab army by its own people.
The shift happened subtly. Joseph Holliday, a former American Army intelligence officer who is now an analyst covering Syria for the Institute of the Study of War, in Washington, said the changes were not in the rate of attacks, but in a rapidly evolving prowess.
''The percentage of I.E.D. attacks compared to overall rebel activity has not increased in a statistically significant way,'' Mr. Holliday wrote by e-mail, just hours before the assassinations in Damascus. ''What has increased is the percentage of effective attacks.''
But, he added, ''what has increased the most, and this has been the hardest thing to put a finger on through open source research, is the number of what U.S. military might call 'catastrophic' I.E.D. attacks.''
By that he meant bombs that destroyed heavily armored tanks, or caused large numbers of casualties.
Although precise casualty estimates are impossible to obtain, one senior Obama administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under administration practice said that by June the Syrian military was suffering an average of 20 dead soldiers a day in various types of attacks, and several times that number of wounded. This would be a significant drain on a force already suffering from defections and now trying to suppress an escalating guerrilla conflict by conventional means.
The exact means by which anti-Assad fighters have improved their manufacture and use of bombs, and who trained them, is not clear.
Mr. Holliday said the capability ''comes in part from the expertise of Syrian insurgents who learned bomb-making while fighting U.S. troops in eastern Iraq.''
An American official who follows the fighting in Syria and spoke on the condition of anonymity noted another example of turnabout. Some of the expertise, the official said, appeared to have been derived from the very trainers in explosives, who were formerly in Syrian intelligence or under its tutelage, with which Syria for decades exported bomb-making and other lethal skills to groups it sponsored in neighboring states.
The official also said the United States government strongly suspected the use of explosively formed penetrators, or E.F.P.'s, bombs with a shaped charge that can penetrate tank armor and that have often been associated with Iran. The official said that the number of these bombs in use was very small, and that the technology for making them was widespread enough that their presence did not indicate Iranian support for the rebels, who are seeking the ouster of an Iranian ally.
One anti-Assad fighter also here in Turkey described a course this spring on explosives that he said was taught in Istanbul by Islamists. In an account that could not be verified, he said fellow fighters who attended told him that its instruction did not go much beyond what the fighters had learned themselves (he said he had not attended himself). ''Basically they taught the guys the same things they know,'' he said. ''Just how to do it safer.''
But many fighters and commanders from Idlib, Hama and Aleppo who were interviewed over the past week spoke of their success with bombs in a different way.
Sensitive to being compared to groups that have detonated bombs indiscriminately, they said that they were fighters using the only tools they had to succeed, and that they aimed at only military targets. They said the uptick in their success was a result not of outside help, but of local trial and error, and in some cases, they were forced into the experience by economics.
With prices of guns and ammunition soaring, they noted, bombs could be made with cheaper materials, giving fighters with limited means or limited access to traditional infantry arms an inexpensive way to fight.
One example was telling: A single rifle cartridge, they said, can cost up to $4, often more than the price of a single blasting cap, the primary explosive used to detonate a makeshift bomb's main charge. (Multiple fighters and commanders in the past week said factory-grade electric blasting caps were available for $1.50 to $3 each, with most costing about $2.)
Another commander who also used the name Abu Akhmed said he bought blasting caps and then made the main explosive charges himself using urea-based fertilizer, sugar and sulfur, among other things, part of recipes fighters took from the Internet and circulated between rebel fighting groups. It took time, he said, to master the skill: ''Once when I was making a bomb, I burned part of my house.''
The fighters also said they had learned many ways to explode their bombs, including via a direct electrical wire connection or remotely via a radio or cellphone signal.
Anti-Assad commanders credited the bombs with helping to change the fighters' psychological experience of the battle against their government. Many rebel fighters, who said they were once afraid of government forces, now said they saw government ground operations as opportunities to kill Syrian troops along the roads, weaken the government and frustrate the army -- a shift that emboldened them and engendered confidence.
Now, they said, it is the Syrian Army troops who are afraid, at least when they leave their garrisons and bases, and it is the rebels who sometimes feel like hunters.
''You don't see trucks any more, soldiers riding in trucks'' in the northern countryside, another fighter said. ''The last time we saw trucks, everybody was excited.''

HEADLINE: Permanent Tax Holiday

 BODY:
A common election-season complaint is that candidates spend too much time attacking each other and too little discussing issues. That was not the case this week on the question of how to tax American multinational corporations on their foreign earnings. 
President Obama raised the issue at a town-hall meeting in Ohio, discussing his proposals for tax credits for manufacturers in the United States to encourage the creation of new jobs. He said this was greatly preferable to Mitt Romney's support for a so-called territorial tax system, in which the overseas profits of American corporations would escape United States taxation altogether.
It's not surpring that large multinational corporations strongly support a territorial tax system, which, they say, would make them more competitive with foreign rivals. What they don't say, and what Mr. Obama stressed, is that eliminating federal taxes on foreign profits would create a powerful incentive for companies to shift even more jobs and investment overseas -- the opposite of what the economy needs.
Mr. Romney's response essentially consisted of a non sequitur. His campaign accused Mr. Obama of ''crony capitalism'' that uses government resources to reward campaign donors. Republicans pointed out that members of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness had supported a territorial tax system, which is true, but they failed to note that the council members who endorsed the idea are corporate executives whose multinational firms would benefit from the lower taxes.
They further noted that Mr. Obama's bipartisan deficit reduction commission had supported a shift to a territorial system. That's partly true. Some commission members supported the elimination of corporate taxes on American companies' foreign profits, but the panel never issued an official report.
It seems highly unlikely that the American public would support a system that eliminates taxes on American companies' foreign earnings. Under the current corporate tax code, taxes on foreign profits of American firms are deferred until the companies bring the money back to America. Upon repatriation, the profits are taxed, but with a credit given for any foreign taxes paid on the profits, so there is no double taxation.
If anything, the current code is too generous. A territorial system would be an even bigger giveaway, endangering the budget while rewarding companies for offshoring jobs and investments.
The corporate tax system needs reform, to raise more revenue, more fairly. The territorial tax system does not meet those criteria.

HEADLINE: Romney Steadfast in the Face of Growing Calls to Release More Tax Returns

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and TRIP GABRIEL; Michael D. Shear reported from New York, and Trip Gabriel from Bowling Green, Ohio.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has said it every way he can: he is not releasing any more of his tax returns.
Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, is facing millions of dollars in searing ads from President Obama and a rising chorus from puzzled Republicans, urging him to reveal more of his financial history.
But with each answer he gives, Mr. Romney seems more determined than ever that voters will not see any of his tax history before 2010. 
''In the political environment that exists today, the opposition research of the Obama campaign is looking for anything they can use to distract from the failure of the president to reignite our economy,'' Mr. Romney told National Review on Tuesday, explaining his opposition to a broader release of his tax data. ''And I'm simply not enthusiastic about giving them hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about.''
That followed an equally emphatic statement on Friday, when Mr. Romney brushed aside calls for him to make public more than the 2010 returns he has released and the 2011 documents that he has said are coming soon.
''Those are the two years people are going to have, and that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview on CNN.
The definitive nature of Mr. Romney's statements appears to have all but shut down any public contemplation from his close advisers of whether he might reconsider. Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, declined to talk about internal discussions on the issue, but made clear who was in charge.
''I would point you to the governor's statements,'' Mr. Madden said. ''That guides the campaign's position.''
Another senior adviser to the campaign said on Wednesday that he had ''heard of no division in the inner circle on this.''
''He is determined not to release more, and they support him,'' the adviser, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said of Mr. Romney and his aides. ''Plus, there is no evidence that voters care about this. They think they know enough about Mitt Romney's finances.''
But that answer has not satisfied a growing number of Republicans who have said Mr. Romney's refusal threatens to do him lasting political damage as he nears the final stage of the presidential campaign.
On Tuesday, the editors of National Review wrote that the campaign was ''playing into the president's hands'' and predicted that Mr. Romney would eventually have to give in. ''The only question is whether he releases more returns now, or later -- after playing more defense on the issue and sustaining more hits,'' they wrote. ''There will surely be a press feeding frenzy over new returns, but better to weather it in the middle of July.''
In the last several days, similar calls have come from Republican pundits and governors, and from some of Mr. Romney's former rivals for the party's nomination.
''Politically, I think that would help him,'' Representative Ron Paul of Texas told Politico. ''In the scheme of things politically, you know, it looks like releasing tax returns is what the people want.''
The New Hampshire party chairman, Wayne MacDonald, said in an interview on Wednesday, ''Certainly, I don't think Mitt Romney has anything to hide, and probably the best thing to do is to eliminate any chance'' of giving Democrats an issue.
In the swing state of Ohio, where Mr. Romney campaigned Wednesday, his supporters suggested that Democrats were trying to create a diversion from bad economic news.
''I'm trying to figure out why that is so important other than the opposition can't find enough to their satisfaction to try to belittle Mr. Romney and Republicans,'' said Rick Miller, a sales manager for a food company who turned out for a Romney rally in Bowling Green, Ohio.
But Alvin Stephens, a marketing student in Bowling Green, dismissed Mr. Romney's argument that his tax matters and the source of his wealth are private.
''It's his business, but it's also our business, too, because we're going to be trusting him with everything we are as a people,'' Mr. Stephens said. ''It would be nice to know why isn't all his money in the United States. Why aren't all of his investments staying in the United States paying for jobs in the United States?''
Mr. Romney's hard-and-fast refusals to release more tax data have helped energize the Democratic attacks. Mr. Obama's Chicago-based campaign is continuing to hammer him with new television ads, Web videos and commentary from surrogates.
The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday released a video making fun of Mr. Romney by juxtaposing his statements on his tax returns with images of a man in a top hat riding a horse in dressage, or horse ballet.
''Do we really want a president who dances around the issues?'' the video asks.
Mr. Romney's campaign has sought to change the subject, accusing the Democrats of going on the attack because of what it said were the failed economic policies of Mr. Obama's administration.
Mr. Madden said it was enough that Mr. Romney had disclosed personal financial information ''beyond what the law requires.''
''What's important to voters is the state of the economy and who's going to fix it,'' he said. ''What they really want is a focus on the issues. That's where the governor is focused.''

HEADLINE: Economic Fears Hurting Obama, Poll Indicates

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Declining confidence in the nation's economic prospects appears to be the most powerful force influencing voters as the presidential election gears up, undercutting key areas of support for President Obama and helping give his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, an advantage on the question of who would better handle the nation's economic challenges, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Despite months of negative advertising from Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies seeking to further define Mr. Romney as out of touch with the middle class and representative of wealthy interests, the poll shows little evidence of any substantial nationwide shift in attitudes about Mr. Romney.
But with job growth tailing off since spring and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, wondering aloud whether the labor market is ''stuck in the mud,'' the poll showed a significant shift in opinion about Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, with 39 percent now saying they approved and 55 percent saying they disapproved. 
In the Times/CBS poll in April, when the economy seemed to have momentum, 44 percent approved and 48 percent disapproved.
The new poll shows that the race remains essentially tied, notwithstanding all of the Washington chatter suggesting that Mr. Romney's campaign has seemed off-kilter amid attacks on his tenure at Bain Capital and his unwillingness to release more of his tax returns. Forty-five percent say they would vote for Mr. Romney if the election were held now and 43 percent say they would vote for Mr. Obama.
When undecided voters who lean toward a particular candidate are included, Mr. Romney has 47 percent to Mr. Obama's 46 percent.
Both results are within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. But it is the first time Mr. Romney has shown a numeric edge in the Times/CBS poll since he emerged from the primaries as the presumptive nominee. Mr. Obama had a three-point advantage in March. The two were each favored by 46 percent in April.
The poll, conducted between July 11 and 16 and including 982 registered voters, is reflective of the national mood, not the views of voters in the handful of swing states most likely to decide the outcome -- and where most of the campaign advertising war is being waged.
Some polls suggest that the attacks are affecting perceptions in some battleground states. For instance, surveys last month by Quinnipiac University in Ohio and Pennsylvania -- where millions of dollars in TV advertising is being spent -- showed Mr. Obama with leads over Mr. Romney in both states.
But the Times/CBS poll nonetheless underscores a national trendline in which the economy remains the dominant force in the campaign, regardless of outside events like the Supreme Court ruling on Mr. Obama's health care law or the daily sticks-and-stones of the trail.
In a reversal from the Times/CBS Poll in April, more Americans say they disapprove of the way Mr. Obama is handling his job, 46 percent, than say they approve of it, 44 percent, although the difference is within the poll's margin of sampling error.
Yet there are some hopeful glimmers for Mr. Obama, who is viewed in this poll as the advocate for the middle class. For instance, just over half of the voters said that his policies were improving the economic picture now (17 percent) or would in the future (34 percent).
And he maintains an advantage over Mr. Romney when it comes to the question of whether he cares a lot or some about the problems of everyday Americans -- 63 percent said he did, compared with 55 percent who said the same of Mr. Romney.
A plurality of Americans, 49 percent, agree with Mr. Obama's assertion that the Bush-era tax cuts should continue on adjusted gross annual income of $250,000 and less. More than a quarter say the cuts should stay in place for all income groups; 17 percent say they should expire altogether.
Mr. Romney has ample challenges, too, with the poll showing that he has yet to build up a positive image of his own as Mr. Obama seeks to build a negative one for him.
While more than half of Mr. Obama's voters said they strongly supported him, fewer than a third of Mr. Romney's said the same about him. More than a third of his voters said they were voting for him because of their dislike for Mr. Obama, while fewer than 10 percent of Mr. Obama's supporters said they would vote for him out of dislike for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney continues to be dogged by the notion that he is disconnected from the middle class. More than half of the voters said his policies would favor the rich.
Mr. Obama's campaign and its allies at the ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action have sought to stoke those views of Mr. Romney, through television advertisements criticizing his tenure at the investment firm Bain Capital.
Six in 10 voters surveyed said Mr. Romney's experience at Bain would not affect their vote, though other polls in swing states have indicated that the ads are influencing perceptions about his business experience.
Republicans have met Mr. Obama's attacks with countercharges portraying him as a typical politician who has abandoned his former mantra of ''hope and change.'' And 58 percent of those surveyed said that he had not delivered on his 2008 campaign pledge for change.
''Obama promised a lot of promises, and he failed at every one of them without exception,'' Jerry Taylor of Yerington, Nev., said in a follow-up interview to the poll. He voted for Mr. Obama four years ago but says he now plans to vote for Mr. Romney. ''Words are cheap, but deeds are precious.''
The poll includes a drop in Mr. Obama's favorability ratings, with 36 percent saying they viewed him favorably and 48 percent saying they did not. In April, 42 percent expressed a favorable opinion of him and 45 percent an unfavorable one.
But that change may have been affected by a reordering of this particular set of questions, which at this point in general election cycles are typically placed near the top of the survey. During the primary season, the questions about favorability were placed lower on the survey after queries about presidential job approval and other topics.
As the focus of the campaign trail shifts to speculation over Mr. Romney's choice of a running mate, only a quarter of voters say that choice matters a lot to their decision for November. Far more important, those surveyed said, are issues like the economy and jobs, health care, taxes, the deficit and national security -- most of them areas in which Mr. Romney is roughly tied or has an advantage in the poll.
Voters gave Mr. Obama an advantage when it came to foreign policy and social issues.
Asked which candidate they believed would do a better job handling the economy and unemployment, 49 percent said Mr. Romney, 41 percent Mr. Obama.
The drop in Mr. Obama's economic approval ratings is consistent with a downturn in the percentage of Americans who believe the economy is getting better. While 33 percent said they saw improvement in April, 24 percent say they do now.
Nearly half of voters say the current economic plight stems from the policies of Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, which most voters expect Mr. Romney would return to.

HEADLINE: Small Business And Taxation

BYLINE: By GENE MARKS

 BODY:
In a recent blog post, Jared Bernstein, the former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now a senior fellow at a Washington research group, argued that Americans are not as overtaxed as some may think. I decided to follow up with Mr. Bernstein to ask him about small businesses and taxes. 
I assured him that many small-business owners -- particularly those making more than $250,000 per year -- feel that increasing their taxes will take away cash that they could use to invest, hire people and grow their businesses. I asked him if he agreed.
''Of course it's often a burden on a business -- or a household, or a dog or a cat -- to increase their tax payments,'' he said. ''And smaller businesses have less insulation -- typically less cash reserves, less access to credit markets or export markets -- from such increases. But there are two key issues that are overlooked.
''First, remember, it's only the income above the $250,000 threshold that's facing a higher tax rate. If your business income -- and we're mostly talking pass-throughs here -- is $255,000, it's not that whole sum that faces the higher rate, it's the $5,000 above $250,000. So if the top rate goes from 35 percent to about 40 percent, which is what's on the table, that's $250 in new taxes.
''Second, as my blog post emphasized, in historical terms, households and businesses are paying less in taxes than they have in decades. I'm sure it doesn't feel that way -- this remains a tough economy. And I'm sure there are exceptions. But the data are very clear on this point.
''Finally, let's not forget that we're talking about less than 3 percent of small businesses here, so I'm not sure about your framing of the question: many small businesses.''

HEADLINE: Bombing in Damascus Kills Key Aides to Assad And Deals a Potent Blow in the Struggle for Syria

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Reporting was contributed by Dalal Mawad and Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Rick Gladstone from New York, Ellen Barry from Moscow, Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem, Elisabeth Bumiller and Eric Schmitt from Washington, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The killing on Wednesday of President Bashar al-Assad's key security aides in a brazen bombing attack, close to Mr. Assad's own residence, called into question the ability of a government that depends on an insular group of loyalists to function effectively as it battles a strengthening opposition.
The strike dealt a potent blow to the government, as much for where it took place as for the individuals who were targeted: the very cabinet ministers and intelligence chiefs who have coordinated the government's iron-fisted approach to the uprising. The defense minister and the president's brother-in-law were both killed, and others were seriously wounded.
The attack on the leadership's inner sanctum as fighting raged in sections of the city for the fourth day suggested that the uprising had reached a decisive moment in the overall struggle for Syria. The battle for the capital, the center of Assad family power, appears to have begun. Though there was no indication he was wounded, Mr. Assad stayed out of public view -- unusual but not unprecedented in a secretive country where the government has long tried to present an image of quiet control. 
In Washington, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said that Syria ''is rapidly spinning out of control,'' and warned Mr. Assad's government to safeguard its large stockpile of chemical weapons. ''It's obvious what is happening in Syria is a real escalation,'' he said at a joint news conference with the British defense minister, Philip Hammond.
The impact of the day's events reverberated on multiple levels, piercing the psychological advantage that Mr. Assad's superior military strength has provided in preserving the loyalty of his forces and frightening much of the public into staying home. With the opposition energized and the government demoralized, analysts wondered if other military units and trusted lieutenants would be more inclined to switch sides -- and if the government would retaliate with an escalation of violence.
The idea that a poorly organized, lightly armed opposition force could somehow get so close to the seat of power raised questions about the viability of a once unassailable police state. The Assad family has for decades relied on overlapping security forces and secret police to preserve its lock on power. At best, for Mr. Assad, the system failed. At worst, for Mr. Assad, defectors or turncoats helped carry out an inside operation.
The government said that the attack was the work of a suicide bomber, while an officer with the Free Syrian Army said it was a remotely detonated explosive.
The most significant victim was Asef Shawkat -- the husband of the president's older sister, Bushra -- who was the deputy chief of staff of the military after years as a top intelligence official. The others killed were Gen. Dawoud A. Rajha, the defense minister and the most prominent Christian in the government; and Maj. Gen. Hassan Turkmani, a previous defense minister serving as the top military aide to Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa.
''Who will replace these people?'' asked Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese military officer and a military analyst knowledgeable about Syria. ''They are irreplaceable at this stage; it's hard to find loyal people now that doubt is sown everywhere. Whoever can get to Asef Shawkat can get to Assad.''
''Everyone, even those close to the inner circle, will now be under suspicion,'' he said.
State television also said the minister of the interior, Lt. Gen. Mohamed al-Sha'ar, had been gravely wounded but was in stable condition. Hisham Ikhtiar, the head of general security, was reported by some activist organizations among those in critical condition, along with some junior officers, but the official news media did not confirm that.
The bombing took place in a small, nondescript building in a neighborhood that is home to the country's elite. The building housed a research center run by the national security agency, one of many overlapping intelligence agencies.
''It was at the heart of the government's nexus of control,'' said an analyst with long experience in Damascus, speaking anonymously because he still travels there often. ''If the regime had a center, that was it.''
But the government mounted a show of normality. It quickly appointed a new defense minister, Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij, the military chief of staff who had previously been responsible for trying to squash the uprising in northern Idlib Province. He appeared briefly on television, vowing that the military would not be deterred by the attack from ''cutting off every hand that harms the security of the homeland and citizens.''
The military also issued a statement saying in part, ''This terrorist act will only increase our insistence to purge this country from the criminal terrorist thugs and to protect the dignity of Syria and its sovereignty.''
Activists reported an even harsher crackdown, with government soldiers firing indiscriminately in several embattled neighborhoods or from helicopters, especially on the southern part of Damascus where fighting first erupted Sunday. Dozens of people were killed, and defections soared, activists said.
''The regime reacted hysterically to the attack,'' said Rami al-Sayyed, an activist in Damascus. ''The security forces and thugs infiltrated various neighborhoods, committing all kinds of crimes. Today we cut the head of the snake, but we still have the tail.''
Like any event in Damascus, details surrounding the attack were murky. There were competing accounts of how the attack occurred and competing claims of responsibility. The Free Syrian Army based in Turkey said it had helped carry out the attack. Also, a brigade from a group with a seemingly religious bent called the Islamic Battalions said it was responsible.
Lt. Malik al-Kurdi, the second in command of the Free Syrian Army troops in Turkey, said it was not a suicide bombing but ''bombs planted around the national security building'' that were set off by remote control.
Since the uprising began in March 2011, claiming an estimated 17,000 victims, Syria has been run by an ever tighter circle of army and security officials close to the president. General Rajha was one of the prominent minority figures used by the Assad government to put a face of pluralism on the military and security services dominated by the president's Alawite sect.
''The Syrian regime has started to collapse,'' said the activist who leads the Syrian Observatory, who goes by the pseudonym Rami Abdul-Rahman for reasons of personal safety. The attack heightened the perception globally that after months of clashes, Syria was embroiled in a civil war.
On the other end of the scale, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, delivered an emotional speech live on television, saying that the Syria of Mr. Assad and Mr. Shawkat was the backbone of the Arab confrontation with Israel.
The attack came as diplomatic maneuvers to seek a cease-fire remained deadlocked by differences between Syria's international adversaries and sponsors, principally Russia. The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to vote on a Western-sponsored resolution that would threaten Mr. Assad's government with economic sanctions if it does not implement a peace plan negotiated by the special envoy Kofi Annan more than three months ago.
The resolution, which Russia has threatened to veto, would extend the mission of 300 unarmed United Nations monitors, whose work has been suspended because of the violence.
Security Council members agreed to delay the vote, originally scheduled for Wednesday, until Thursday at Mr. Annan's request, to allow more time for diplomats to resolve their differences over the resolution's wording.
But in Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov, offering Russia's first official commentary on the Damascus bombing, said via his Twitter account that the attack had put consensus between members of the Security Council even further out of reach.
''A dangerous logic: While discussions on settling the Syrian crisis are being held in the U.N. Security Council, militants intensify terrorist attacks, frustrating all attempts,'' he wrote.
In Syria, the information minister, Omran al-Zoubi, appeared on a talk show to reject claims by those calling it the beginning of the end.
''The morale of our people is very high and our armed forces are at their highest level,'' he said.
But residents of Damascus had been shaken as never before. Residents reached by telephone said that after the news broke around noon, people rushed out to buy food and then rushed back home again. City streets appeared deserted, with not even taxis circulating after dark.
''All the stores and shops are closed,'' said an activist in Damascus reached via Skype. ''Some people are scared and some are happy; you can hear people firing off gunshots in many places.'' A video from Hama showed opposition members distributing candy to celebrate Mr. Shawkat's death.

HEADLINE: The Endless Summer

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

 BODY:
Here's what American exceptionalism means now: on a per-capita basis, we either lead or come close to leading the world in consumption of resources, production of pollutants and a profound unwillingness to do anything about it. We may look back upon this year as the one in which climate change began to wreak serious havoc, yet we hear almost no conversation about changing policy or behavior. President Obama has done nicely in raising fuel averages for automobiles, but he came into office promising much more, and Mitt Romney promises even less. (There was a time he supported cap and trade.)
It has been well over 100 years since the phenomenon called the greenhouse effect was identified, 24 years since the steamy summer of '88, when many of us first took notice, and, incredibly, 15 years since the Kyoto Protocol. That agreement stipulated that signatories would annually reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and was ratified (and even acted upon) by almost every country in the world, including every industrialized nation but one. That would be the United States. Now that's exceptionalism. (Bill Clinton signed Kyoto; George W. Bush, despite an election pledge, repudiated it.) 
The climate has changed, and the only remaining questions may well be: a) how bad will things get, and b) how long will it be before we wake up to it. The only sane people who don't see this as a problem are those whose profitability depends on the status quo, people of money and power like Romney (''we don't know what's causing climate change''), most of his party, and Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman, who called the effects of climate change ''manageable.''
Which I suppose they are, as long as you're wealthy and able to move around at will. But it's not manageable to the corn farmers losing their crops (many are just chopping them down), the ranchers selling off their cattle, the thousands of people in Colorado burned out of their homes in fires caused by the worst drought since 1956 or those who will lose their homes or jobs to fire, flood, drought or whatever in coming years. How will they ''manage''?
All of this is the tip of the iceberg, and the iceberg is, of course, melting. As Bill McKibben points out in a piece to be published in Rolling Stone on Friday, not only was May the warmest on record for the Northern Hemisphere, not only was it ''the 327th consecutive month in which the temperature of the entire globe exceeded the 20th-century average,'' but it was also followed by a June in which some 3,200 heat records were broken in the United States.
The first page alone of the Rolling Stone article will scare the pants off you, but the chorus needs to grow bigger, louder and stronger. That's why the forthcoming book (due July 24) from Climate Central, ''Global Weirdness,'' is so welcome. ''Global Weirdness,'' which explains climate change in simple, easy-to-understand language and ultrashort chapters, is intentionally calm because, says Michael Lemonick, one of the authors: ''Some people respond well to 'Big trouble is coming and we must do something immediately,' but others are overwhelmed and just turn off. We believe that if you look at all the available evidence it's clear we're pushing the earth into a regime where it hasn't been before, and the effects could well be disastrous.''
The time to avoid calamitous effects has likely passed. This doesn't mean the situation is hopeless, but the longer we wait to curb emissions, the worse and longer-lasting the effects. Climate Central's projections show that the biggest cities in Florida, and a great deal of the Northeast coastline (including New York City), will be underwater by 2100, when almost everyone now alive will have ''managed'' to leave the scene. Of course, the calamities won't be limited to North America, nor is 2100 some magical expiration date; the end isn't in sight.
Only reducing carbon emissions can keep matters from becoming worse. Thus the argument for a tax on carbon has never been stronger, but neither has the power of the energy companies to compel legislative paralysis on this issue. The way to a carbon tax is through Congress and the White House, but installing a responsible Congress means campaign-finance reform, another challenge of which Americans are aware but clueless about how to address. But feelings of helplessness are practically un-American: we have the opportunity to demand principled and independent leadership, if we will only try.
It was just about a year ago that we saw the beginnings of what is now called the Occupy movement. And although income inequality has hardly been ''solved,'' it's a bigger part of the conversation now, and that may well spell Romney's downfall. A similar movement - one that, as McKibben told me, ''identifies the fossil fuel industry as the real enemy in the climate fight, which is ultimately a moral battle'' - could possibly get things moving. If we can force our next president to turn his attention to a problem that may well dwarf the economy in scale, perhaps American exceptionalism will come to mean leadership in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Libor Scandal Shows Many Flaws in Rate-Setting

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS and NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The lending benchmark, a convenient tool for the markets, has flaws that have some people even questioning its existence. 

 BODY:
It is an open secret in the banking world: the interest rates for many mortgages and loans are based on a benchmark that is largely guesswork.
The flaws in the rate-setting process, which is used to determine the pricing for trillions of dollars of financial products, have been exposed by the latest banking scandal. Regulators around the world are investigating whether big banks gamed the rates for their own benefit before and after the financial crisis.
But even if banks do not deliberately manipulate the rates, the benchmark remains vulnerable.
 Banks derive the rates from estimates rather than real market data. So the benchmark, a measure of how much banks charge each other for loans, does not necessarily represent actual borrowing costs. This weakness has only been exacerbated in recent years, as banks have mostly stopped lending to each other.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress this week that he did not have "full confidence" in the process, calling it "structurally flawed."
The troubles center on a key benchmark known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. This rate and its variants are used to determine the prices for mortgages and other loans, and play a critical role in the multitrillion dollar market for financial contracts called derivatives.
The Libors are set every weekday around 11 a.m., a process overseen by the British Bankers' Association. At that time, a group of big banks report how much interest they would pay to borrow money from other institutions over different periods and in different currencies. After removing the outliers, the remaining numbers are averaged to come up with the various rates. On Thursday, the three-month Libor, in American dollars, stood at 0.4531 percent.
But the precise rates have little basis in reality.
Since the crisis, many banks have been content to park their cash with central banks, rather than lending it out to other institutions. That means there are few interbank transactions on which to base their Libors, according to bankers who operate in this market.
"Libor was intended for an international lending market that has long since past," said Pete Hahn, a finance professor at the Cass Business School in London. "The whole concept of interbank lending died after Lehman Brothers collapsed."
Now, regulators and investors are questioning whether the benchmark should play any role in determining borrowing costs. Top central bankers will meet in September to discuss potential reforms.
"Why continue with something you know has a substantial amount of wiggle room?" said Alexander T. Arapoglou, a professor at University of North Carolina's business school. "It is just opinions that people could disagree with or manipulate."
The benchmark was supposed to solve a problem for bankers. For years, institutions haggled over the rates charged for different types of loans. To create consistency, the British Bankers' Association developed the Libor standard. At the time, the interbank market functioned relatively well.
As the financial sector ballooned in the last two decades, Libor became increasingly more important. The rates currently cover 10 different currencies, and underpin more than $360 trillion of financial products worldwide.
Even so, the process remains unregulated, with oversight falling largely to the bankers' association. In response to concerns during the crisis, the association conducted a review of Libor and put changes in place in late 2008.
A spokesman for the trade body declined to comment.
After Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle a rate-manipulation case with authorities in June, the trade organization began its own investigation into Libor. The British Bankers' Association is also assessing ways to improve the process, along with central bankers and other authorities.
But it is very difficult to improve Libor if a robust market does not exist.
The industry does not track comprehensive totals for interbank loans. One measure, published by the Federal Reserve, shows that such lending has declined to levels not seen since the 1970s, although the figures do not capture the entire market.
Bankers indicate that such lending has almost completely evaporated. In the current environment, financial institutions will lend money to each other only for a short time, say one month or less. That means banks are largely making estimates for key benchmarks like the three-month and the one-year Libor.
Those two borrowing periods are critical. Vast amounts of derivatives are pinned to the three-month Libor, while the rates on many adjustable-rate mortgages are based on the one-year Libor.
"We just aren't borrowing that much in this market right now," said Daryl N. Bible, the chief financial officer of BB&T, a bank based in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Since interbank lending has stagnated, institutions are largely looking to other types of borrowing to come up with Libors, including certificates of deposits and loans from money market funds. But this is an inexact science that can distort the Libor market.
For example, banks often submit the same rates several days in a row, despite changing market and economic conditions.
In June, JPMorgan Chase reported the same one-year Libor every single day, according to data from Thomson Reuters, which is responsible for collecting the benchmark information. The bank's rate: 1 percent.
By contrast, UBS calculated the figure to three decimal places and regularly changed its rates. At the beginning of June, the Swiss bank reported a one-year rate of 1.037 percent. It dropped to 0.972 percent at the end of the month.
Neither bank responded to a request for comment.
There can also be wide discrepancies among similar benchmarks, which may reflect the artificial nature of the process. While the recent three-month Libor stood at 0.4531 percent, the parallel euro interbank offered rate in American dollars amounted to 0.91643 percent.
During periods of turmoil, the process gets murkier. Some traders indicate that banks at times of stress report rates that would be almost impossible to achieve.
When the European debt crisis heated up this summer, French banks were viewed as vulnerable, meaning they would have had a hard time borrowing at reasonable rates. But the country's banks continued to report Libors, and they remained largely flat.
"When the French banks saw their stock price going down 10 percent a day, could they have borrowed at Libor? There isn't a chance," said a senior executive at a large Wall Street firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations.
In some ways, the flaws with Libor make it a convenient tool for Wall Street. If banks had to carefully reference a real, sometimes volatile, market, they might find it harder to set rates regularly.
Allowing banks to submit guesstimates makes it relatively simple to come up with a daily number. The practices suits the vast derivatives markets, which need a daily rate to price products like interest-rate swaps.
"It is true that current Libor methodology is very convenient for the derivatives world," said Darrell Duffie, professor of finance at Stanford. "Convenience should not trump accuracy."
As the Libor scandal has unfolded, the industry is grappling with how to fix the process. One suggestion is to choose banks' Libor submissions randomly when setting the overall rate, making it harder to manipulate. Authorities have also proposed having independent auditors oversee the process.
The race to replace Libor has also heated up. One suggestion is to use rates from another market that banks frequently use to lend to each other. These loans are backed with high-quality financial assets that lenders can keep if borrowers fail to repay. The limited volume of Libor-related loans do not have such collateral.
The Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald is also developing an index of different short-term lending markets. The idea is that the benchmark, a more diversified reflection of borrowing, could be used as a substitute for Libor.
"To be reliable, indices have to be transaction-based and transparent," said Gary S. Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator that led the inquiry into Barclays.

HEADLINE: How to Communicate With Your College Roommate

BYLINE: TANYA ABRAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Joel Haber, a clinical psychologist and author of "Bullyproof Your Child for Life" and Harlan Cohen, author of "The Naked Roommate," offer advice on communicating with roommates. 

 BODY:
As some of our readers prepare for college, we thought we'd bring to your attention some advice about living with college roommates.
Daniel E. Slotnik has asked two experts - Joel Haber, a clinical psychologist and author of "Bullyproof Your Child for Life" and Harlan Cohen, author of "The Naked Roommate," to comment on what students should do when roommate problems begin to surface.
 A preview of the column, which will appear in the Education Life supplement in Sunday's newspaper, is now available online.
Here is an excerpt from Mr. Cohen:
It's so important to transition students to campus in a way that helps them feel they're never alone. One of the most important things a student can do is have five people in their corner, like a boxer has people in his corner, before they go away to school - people like a counselor, residence-life staff member, spiritual leader, relative, close friend, or other individual to turn to should any problems arise. It's when students feel alone that they can become desperate.

HEADLINE: Nearly 6% Have Used Payday Loans, Study Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Roughly 12 million Americans took out a payday loan in 2010, a Pew report says, and most did so to cover everyday expenses. 

 BODY:
Nearly 6 percent of adults nationwide have used payday loans in the last five years, and they mostly use them to cover everyday expenses, not emergencies, according to a new report from an arm of the Pew Charitable Trusts.
The report, from Pew's Safe Small Dollar Loans Research Project, is based in part on a large survey that found that 12 million Americans used a payday loan in 2010.
Payday loans are getting more scrutiny from regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as more traditional banks and online lenders begin offering the short-term, small-amount loans in addition to storefront lenders.
Payday borrowing is concentrated among younger, low-to-moderate income individuals, the report found, but people of most ages and incomes use payday loans. Among the borrowers most likely to use them are those who lack a four-year college degree; African-Americans; renters, rather than homeowners; those earning less than $40,000 annually; or those who are separated or divorced.
Three-fourths of payday borrowers use storefront lenders, and about a quarter borrow online, the study found. Borrowers take out eight payday loans a year, spending about $520 on interest with an average loan size of $375. Lenders usually charge about $15 for each $100 borrowed per two weeks - the equivalent of a 391 percent annual percentage rate. The loans are secured by a postdated check, or an electronic debit authorization.
Collectively, payday loan borrowers spend about $7.4 billion annually at storefronts, Web sites and, increasingly, banks.
Pew says the survey is the first-ever nationally representative telephone poll of payday loan recipients about their borrowing.
The initial phase of the survey identifying payday loan borrowers was conducted among nearly 50,000 adults from August 2011 to December 2011 and has a margin of sampling error of less than 1 percentage point. A 20-minute telephone survey was then conducted from December 2011 to March 2012 among 451 storefront payday loan borrowers, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
The loans are marketed as two-week credit offerings to help meet unexpected expenses, like a car repair or a medical emergency. But most borrowers use the loans to cover ordinary living expenses, and remain indebted for an average of five months per year, the study found. The first time people took out a payday loan, 69 percent used it to cover a recurring cost, like utilities, credit card bills, rent or food. Just 16 percent used it for an unexpected expense.
"That looks like a real problem to us," said Nick Bourke, director of Pew's small-dollar loan project. The report, and others that will follow, should help inform the discussion about whether and how to regulate payday lending, he said.
The report says a typical payday borrower is someone like "Deborah," a teacher, mother and graduate student struggling to afford her monthly bills and her daughter's routine vaccinations. (Deborah was a member of a focus group convened for the study.) She didn't want to ask friends, so she borrowed a couple of hundred dollars from a payday lender. The loan was due on her next payday, but she didn't have enough funds to meet her regular bills and repay the loan. She ended up renewing the loan for six months, until her income tax refund arrived.
Pew researchers conclude that the findings "raise serious concerns" about payday lending, including "whether a two-week product with an A.P.R. typically around 400 percent is a viable solution for people dealing with a chronic cash shortage."
Have you ever used a payday loan? Why?

HEADLINE: When the Men Went to War

BYLINE: NICOLE ETCHESON


HIGHLIGHT: How life did, and didn't, change for Civil War wives. 

 BODY:
When she learned that her husband, Lucius, had enlisted in the Union Army, Alice Chapin became distraught. She sobbed uncontrollably and pleaded with him, writing in a letter, "Now my dear husband let me tell you I do not verily believe I could live & bid you good bye to go in the Army how can you for a moment think of such a thing, can you leave me? can you leave our babes? no, no, no."
Years later Lucius Chapin would recall that he had enlisted in early 1862 out of patriotism, but at the time he emphasized the economic benefits to his family, who lived in Putnam, County, Ind., between Indianapolis and Terre Haute. Chapin had tried a number of occupations by the early 1860s and made a successful living at none of them. Alice's ill health, probably stemming from pregnancy and childbirth, had left them with large medical bills. Lucius's family blamed Alice for holding their son back. Even Alice's father conceded that someone needed to care for Alice while Lucius used the Army to make a new start.
Despite his wife's pleading and the death of their infant son soon after his enlistment, Lucius served throughout the war, rising to the rank of first sergeant in Company M of the 4th Indiana Cavalry. Alice and their young daughter spent the war in Terre Haute with her parents. 
Alice did reconcile herself to Lucius's war service, even praising his courage. A year after Lucius's enlistment - and her impassioned plea against it - she wrote, "my darling, my brave, my Soldier lad, your wife is proud to think of you standing firmly to your duty, a Man, the 'noblest work of God.'" This was a bleak period in the war for the North, still reeling from the bloody disaster at Fredericksburg, Va., but Alice was "hoping all the time to hear of Battles, or Victories in some shape." In short, contrary to many recent historical accounts of women during the Civil War, Alice Chapin did not make use of the conflict to liberate herself from woman's sphere.
The Chapins' situation was not unusual. Though women often protested against their husbands' decision to enlist, like Alice they typically reconciled themselves to the fact. Nineteenth-century Americans regarded women and men as belonging to separate spheres. A woman's sphere was the home, for which she was presumably fitted by her gentler, more patient nature, and by the physical and mental weakness that made her unable to participate in man's sphere: the rough and tumble of politics or public life.
In his examination of soldiers' letters, the historian James M. McPherson found both Union and Confederate husbands constructed extensive rationales for their absence from family responsibilities: they argued that by protecting their country, they protected their families. And they appealed to their wives' sense of patriotism and honor. Although husbands felt a need to justify themselves to wives who complained of raising children or running a household without a male breadwinner, in a patriarchal society, there was little recourse for a wife such as Alice Chapin but to accept her husband's decision.
It's true that, by the time of the Civil War, many women were using the characteristics of woman's sphere itself to gain entree to a wider role. Women's greater piety and stronger moral sense, after all, made it reasonable for them to speak out on moral issues like drinking and slavery. Such involvement was controversial but had become common. Harriet Beecher Stowe's abolitionist novel, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," featured frequent contrasts between wives whose nave moral objections to slavery are vindicated despite their husbands' more worldly acceptance of the institution. 
Still, many women and men - in agreement that women should use their influence for the betterment of society - would have flinched from the proponents of woman's equality, like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who insisted on rights such as the vote. An 1857 editorial in the Greencastle, Ind., newspaper encouraged women to take up temperance reform in order to save their sons from the saloonkeepers, but it explicitly distinguished this call from appeals to women's rights, which the editorialist rejected.
The war did open opportunities for women to enter the public sphere. The shortage of nurses, which was created by the war's labor needs, allowed women to move into that occupation. Indiana's wartime governor, Oliver P. Morton, recruited women to tend to Hoosier soldiers in hospitals. Women took up factory jobs, working in the Indianapolis arsenal. An observer described the "blushing young virgins and elderly matrons" cheerfully making cartridges "intended to let daylight through some man's heart." Women also formed aid societies to provide clothing and food for the soldiers, and held bazaars whose profits purchased even more provisions. In Greencastle, more than 100 women belonged to the Soldiers' Aid Society and many of its leaders were wives of prominent local men who had often been active in prewar reform. Cosima Sadd was not only secretary of the Greencastle society, but worked at a Louisville, Ky., hospital, ensuring that patients received goods sent from Indiana, including cash and boxes of fruit, cakes and eggs.
Alice Chapin, however, was one of the many women who did not participate in such societies, but instead sent care packages to their husbands or sons individually. Alice sent Lucius parcels containing a turkey, pies, cakes, soap and stamps - but no butter, "as every bit in the Country is bought up by those who are sending Boxes & they are many I assure you." Sarah Hawley, the wife of Lucius's family minister, sent her son a ham when he fell ill in Alabama. These packages were part of their efforts to continue woman's sphere - taking care of their menfolk - despite the men's absence from home.
Like many wives, Alice missed having her child's father participate in parental duties. Puzzled by their toddler's "ungovernable fits of passion," she lamented: "Oh how we need home and Papa!" Presumably Lucius's influence was needed to make their daughter the "good kind amiable woman" her mother hoped she would become. Lucius did try to provide discipline, explaining to her in one letter why she must obey her mother and why corporal punishment was necessary.
The historian Nina Silber has recently argued that although Northern women's civic participation was encouraged and did expand because of the Civil War, there still remained obstacles to women's involvement in the public sphere. Not only were they deprived of their breadwinners, often causing hardship, but their involvement was also predicated on their serving the government, not the government serving their needs. In addition, couples like the Chapins demonstrated women's continued belief in their traditional sphere. Alice Chapin did not want the vote or equal rights: she wanted Lucius at home to take care of his family.
If Lucius joined the army for economic reasons, his enlistment did not solve all the Chapins' financial worries. The bounty money went to pay their debts. Alice learned some of the soldiers' aid helped support soldiers' families but was disappointed by the amount she received. She found a position as a schoolteacher, but Lucius refused to give her permission to take it. He did not want "a 'School Ma'am' for a Wifey," he wrote, so Alice gave up the idea, even reflecting that she might not have "passed muster" anyway. She then tried to make money drying and canning produce. When the war ended, the Chapins were still unsure how Lucius would make a living - he, too, now suffered from ill health, brought on by the hardships of wartime service. 
After the war, the Chapins had two more children. Lucius eventually prospered as a lawyer, local Republican politician and mayor of Greencastle. Alice became active in charitable causes, an acceptable role for a middle-class woman. She collected relief materials for victims of major fires that swept Greencastle in the mid-1870s and played a leading role, along with Lucius, in what was called the woman's temperance crusade of 1873, in which small-town women across the Midwest occupied saloons in an effort to shame owners and patrons into sobriety. Even after the crusade wound down, Alice remained president of the local Ladies' Temperance League. 
As a wedding present for the daughter of Greencastle's Republican congressman, Alice constructed a "handsome bouquet" and wrote an accompanying poem describing the bonds of marriage as being "as strong as steel" while "Soft and sweet are the bonds of love." It was an appropriate sentiment from a woman who accepted her sphere and had signed letters to her soldier husband "Wifey."

HEADLINE: 'Scandalous,' Musical About Aimee Semple McPherson, Sets Broadway Opening

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: The production, which originated at the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle, has a book and lyrics by Kathie Lee Gifford, and music by David Pomeranz and David Friedman. 

 BODY:
Many Broadway shows struggle for media attention - hence the tactic of casting Hollywood stars - but the new musical "Scandalous" has an extraordinary weapon in its publicity arsenal: NBC's "Today" show. On Thursday's broadcast, the co-host Matt Lauer plugged "a very big announcement," then introduced Kathie Lee Gifford, who shares hosting duties for the final hour of "Today."
"I can't even believe the words are coming out of my mouth," Ms. Gifford said. "A lot of weird words have come out of my mouth over the years, but we're announcing today that a musical I've been writing for going on 13 years now will be coming to Broadway this fall."
"Broadway!" Mr. Lauer said, applauding.
By using her "Today" platform, Ms. Gifford instantly put "Scandalous" in a national spotlight that other Broadway musicals this fall, like "Chaplin" and "Rebecca," could only dream about. How often Ms. Gifford rah-rahs her own show on "Today" remains to be seen.
"Scandalous," based on the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, a colorful evangelist from the early 20th century, has a book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford, herself a born-again Christian who was a gospel singer early in her career. The music is by David Pomeranz and David Friedman, and the production is directed by David Armstrong, the artistic director of 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle. The musical ran there in 2011 under the title "Saving Aimee," earning from critics.
Broadway musicals based on religious themes have had a tough time lately; the $14 million musical "Leap of Faith" flopped quickly this spring, and the revivals of "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Godspell" struggled at the box office this year and closed this summer. The musical "Sister Act," which prominently features singing nuns and a salvation storyline, is due to close in August.
Through a spokesman, the producers for "Scandalous" declined to provide the capitalization amount on Thursday, but it is believed to be in the high seven figures.
The show will star musical theater veteran Carolee Carmello as Aimee; Ms. Carmello was nominated for Tony Awards for her performances in "Parade" (during the 1998-99 season) and "Lestat" (2006), and she is currently starring in "Sister Act" as Mother Superior.
Preview performances are scheduled to begin on Oct. 13 at the Neil Simon Theater.
"We have opening night - pinch me - Nov. 15," Ms. Gifford added on the "Today" broadcast.
"Kathie Lee Gifford on Broadway, baby," Mr. Lauer replied.
The lead producers of "Scandalous" include some unusual newcomers like Dick DeVos, a Michigan businessman who ran one of the most expensive races ever for governorin 2006, as the Republican nominee against Democrat Jennifer Granholm (who won). Mr. DeVos is the son of billionaire Amway founder Richard DeVos. Dick DeVos's wife Betsy is also a lead producer; they have a foundation in their name that provides money primarily to religious groups and to organizations that promote free-market economic policies. Another lead producer is Foursquare Foundation, which provides grants to evangelical churches and ministries.
A spokesman for the show did not immediately reply when asked if Ms. Gifford is putting any of her own money into the show.
An earlier version of this post, relying on information supplied by a publicist, included a caption that misidentified an actor in an earlier production of "Scandalous," which was then titled "Saving Aimee." He is Edward Watts, not David Hutton.

HEADLINE: Tips for Living on a College Student Budget

BYLINE: ARIHA SETALVAD


HIGHLIGHT: The author, who was raised in India, offers money management tips for international students who plan to study in the United States. 

 BODY:
One of my earliest memories of America is my first trip to a Walmart. Not just any Walmart, but a suburban behemoth that seemed to go on endlessly. The varieties of candy inside seemed even more infinite; stacks upon stacks of giddily colored boxes describing the sugary goodness they held. But - and here's the point of this story - I could only ever pick one.
During my years at N.Y.U., I've realized that in a city like New York, there is never an excuse to be bored. From the traditional (restaurants and movies), to the moderately new (Shakespeare in the Park and outdoor performances), to the really wild (mixology and trapeze classes), there is no limit to the options available. 
There is, however, a limit to your budget. Especially as a student, especially recently, with the rupee's having depreciated greatly. As Rajeev Malik, senior economist with CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, told India Ink in May, "The rupee has weakened more since the end of July 2011 than it did during the 1991 devaluation. The significant depreciation now will have a much smaller positive impact than in 1991 because it is not accompanied by a reform agenda."
Earning a foreign degree, something that was becoming the norm for a large number of Indian students, is now a luxury. With that heady independence comes the need to manage money responsibly. Americans like to live large (ask for a "small" Coke at a movie theater, and you'll see what I mean), and money will slip through your hands with the greatest of ease. Here are a few ways to ensure that that doesn't happen.
EducationUSA runs a series of webinars that cover the Five Steps to U.S. Study, one of which specifically discusses the planning of a student budget.
However, if you are one of the lucky ones, it is important to have realistic expectations about your part-time income, said Martin Bennett, the EducationUSA outreach coordinator at the Institute of International Education."The general consensus is that having a part-time job on campus can help pay for some personal expenses," Mr. Bennett wrote in an e-mail. "That being said, the expectation should not be that a part-time job will cover much more than $2,000 to $3,000/academic year if a student were to work 16 to 20 hours per week." He added, "20 hours per week on campus while school is in session is the maximum allowed under U.S. immigration regulations.""I advise," he continued, "that unless absolutely necessary, a student take the first semester on campus to get used to the way of life and of the classroom culture and faculty expectations before plunging into a job on-campus."

HEADLINE: A Palestinian in Jerusalem

BYLINE: RAJA SHEHADEH


HIGHLIGHT: Tourists tend to see Jerusalem's Old City as a model of tolerance. It's not. 

 BODY:
Jerusalem - As a tourist visiting the Old City of Jerusalem, seeing Christians, Jews and Muslims walking side by side, hearing church bells ringing and Muslims being called to prayer, you might think the place is a model of tolerance.
As a resident of the Old City of Jerusalem, you think differently.
Last Sunday, I was taken on a tour by Nadera Shalhoub-Kervokian, a Palestinian and a professor of criminology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who has lived in the Old City for the past 30 years. Her home - a tastefully furnished second-floor apartment, where she and her husband raised three daughters - is in the Armenian quarter.
It's also right at the edge of the Jewish quarter, which was rebuilt, expanded and repopulated after Israel's victory in the 1967 war and its occupation of East Jerusalem. According to one study,[pdf] in 2006 37,060 people lived in the Old City, including 27,500 Muslims, 5,681 Christians, 3,089 Jews and 790 Armenian. To this day most groups live in their own quarters, but as Nadera explained, Israeli Jews have increasingly been moving into other areas as well. 
As we walked around the Christian Quarter, Nadera pointed out all the buildings and single rooms that have recently been taken over by Israeli Jews. Exploiting the economic straits in which Arabs find themselves, Orthodox Jews (many with money from American relatives) have been buying a room here, a house there.
To gauge the takeover all you need to do is climb the metal stairs behind the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and walk on the roofs surrounding the church's. Most of the houses you see - some newly built with licenses obtained from the very municipality that denies them to Palestinians - are inhabited by Israeli Jews or house Jewish religious schools. Box-like prefab guard rooms are ubiquitous; there are surveillance cameras and Israeli flags at every corner. Aside from us, the only pedestrians walking on these roofs on this unseasonably hot Sunday were Israeli Jews in religious garb.
Later, after we were back on the street and approaching the narrow lane leading to Nadera's house, she stopped to check two metal sheets drilled on the wall on either side of the lane. Could this be where the new rumored checkpoint will be placed? With no Palestinian representative on the city council - since the illegal annexation of the Old City to Israel in 1967, the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem has been boycotting municipal elections - Nadera has little information about what is going on in the city. She will just have to wait and see.
Also nearby, just a few yards away from the entrance to Nadera's apartment block, is a large car park. After 1967 the Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem, who runs the Armenian Quarter, leased it to the Jewish Quarter Development Corporation for public use. But since 2010, for no apparent reason, "public" has been defined as exclusively Jewish. All of Nadera's Jewish neighbors park their cars there, but she and her Armenian family have been told that they may not. They have to leave their cars a long way away and carry home all their groceries.
Who are these Israeli Jews anyway? Who are they to want to live among Palestinians, so at odds with their neighbors that they feel the need for 24-hour security, for putting iron bars on their windows and doors, for making their houses look more like cages than dwellings?
One day on her way to work, Nadera asked one of them, a man in his 30s wearing a kippa, "Why live like this?" He said, it's a , a religious duty.

HEADLINE: For the Sweltering, Little Relief in Sight

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: NOAA issues its monthly climate report for June and a three-month outlook. 

 BODY:
No one living in America's heartland needs an expert to tell them that it's hot and dry out there. But that's the message from the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration. 
On Thursday, NOAA released its United States and global climate report for June along with a three-month precipitation and temperature outlook. Although predictions get shakier further out, the gist was that there's no relief on the radar. 
"The outlook calls for not a lot of improvement in the near future," said Kelly Helm Smith, a drought resource specialist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. "And it's still relatively early in the growing season, so there's time for a lot more impacts to develop."
Nationally, it was the 14th-warmest June, with 170 heat records broken or tied. Colorado experienced its warmest June on record, and seven other states experienced a June that ranks among their 10 hottest. 
As for the drought, it was the 10th-driest June and so far the 16th driest year on record, with drought conditions recorded in one-half of the lower 48 states and abnormally dry-to-drought conditions in more than 80 percent. 
The report highlighted the potentially devastating effect of the drought on the nation's major agricultural crops. Drought conditions are reported in 76 percent of the places where corn fields are currently planted in the United States, for example.
The Department of Agriculture has consequently cut its predictions for the 2012 corn crop by 12 percent, or 1.82 billion bushels. The drought has been likened to that of 1988, which was the last time that a drought struck the nation's corn belt, although the next six weeks will determine which was more economically damaging.
The U.S.D.A. has also announced a streamlined disaster declaration process for 1,000 counties in 29 states, making assistance virtually automatic for any county suffering from drought for eight weeks or more. 
Looking ahead to August, NOAA said there was a higher-than-usual likelihood of above-normal temperatures for a large swath of the country, especially eastern and central states. Precipitation is expected to be below normal from the Mississippi Valley to the center of the country and then northwestward to the Great Plains. 
""We are not predicting significant relief," said Dan Collins, NOAA's seasonal forecaster. He also said the agency expected the drought to spread to the north and east of areas already afflicted. "Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota, northern Michigan and the Dakotas may all be affected," he said.
An earlier version of this article contained a headline, which was also in the Web address of the post, indicating incorrectly that June was the fourth-hottest on record. It was in fact the 14th-hottest June on record for the United States.

HEADLINE: Aristotle Onassis on Greek Democracy

BYLINE: BERNADETTE CAREY SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: At a dinner party given by Aristotle and Jacqueline Onassis, Greek finances and democracy became the topic of conversation. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
 In the early 1970s, I attended a small dinner party at Mrs. Jacqueline Onassis' Fifth Avenue apartment.
There were 10 of us, including our hosts, Jacqueline and Aristotle; Ari's Greek godson and his wife; Jackie's cousin Nina Steers; Gianni Agnelli and his sister Susanna Rattazzi; and my date, David Frost.
After dinner, as we sat around gabbing about all sorts of things, we eventually landed on the subject of Greece, which was at the time going through one of its never-ending paroxysms of government crises, and seemed a subject that made Ari somewhat annoyed. 
Nevertheless, he told some very interesting and amusing stories about the trials and perils of doing business in Greece, seconded and commented on by the godson. The government, he said, like all Greek governments, was essentially useless, as they knew nothing about business or the financial world. In fact, he said, they knew nothing about democracy. 
Then, he said, "The Greeks aren't ready for democracy."
There was a moment of silent surprise.
I then commented that since I was under the impression that the Greeks had invented it, if the Greeks weren't ready to govern themselves, who on earth was ready?
There was another silent moment.
Then Jackie, being the good hostess, smiled. Gianni, being a good and knowledgeable Italian, roared. And we all -- except Ari -- began to laugh.
Nowadays, every time I listen to talk about Greek finances, Greek elections and Greek governments, I see Ari's good-looking, serious, almost dour face before me and hear him saying, "Greeks, they know nothing about business or finance," and "the Greeks aren't ready for democracy."
Ari loved his country. He always wore two watches, one set to the time wherever he was present physically and the other always on Athens time. But I can't help think he'd be deeply concerned about his country's current situation, and I have a guess at what he'd expect the outcome to be.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Reaches 10 Percent

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The city's jobless rate rose 0.3 percentage points to a level matching the high in the last recession, even as jobs were being added. 

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent in June, equaling the highest level it reached during the recession, even as employers continued hiring at a healthy pace, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
 Though city officials make almost daily pronouncements about how impressively the city's economy has rebounded from the long recession, the unemployment rate has returned to the peak it held for six months, from fall 2009 until February 2010. The last time it was higher was 19 years ago, when it was 10.1 percent, said James P. Brown, principal economist for the department.
 The June rate was up from 9.7 percent in May, and it translated to more than 397,000 unemployed city residents, according to state data. That total was within 2,000 of the highest number of jobless city residents at any time in 37 years of record keeping, the numbers showed. 
 The unemployment rate worsened again despite a gain of 11,500 jobs last month, Mr. Brown said. That increase was modest compared with the strong gains of recent months but was about average for the last 10 Junes, he said. 
 The disparity between the jobs tally and the rising unemployment rate continues to confound economists. Typically, when the survey of employers shows steady hiring for several months, as it has this year, the unemployment rate declines. But the unemployment rate, which is derived from a survey of households, indicates that the job gains are not doing much to improve the lot of city residents.
 "It is disconcerting to observe this trend month after month," said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. Ms. Denham said it was "perplexing" that one survey showed 1,700 fewer city residents had jobs last month than in September 2009 while the payroll survey showed that 190,000 jobs were created during that span. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg emphasized the rosier of the two assessments of the city's job market, saying in a statement that it was "good news for the many job seekers who are voting with their feet and coming here to look for work." He added that, "As fast as New York City is creating jobs, people are entering the labor market even faster, which indicates optimism and confidence in the long-term future of New York City."
 Labor union officials have said the bigger problem is that most of the new jobs are in industries that pay low wages, like retailing and janitorial work. They have been pushing for several months in Albany for an increase in the state's minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009. 
 But Mr. Brown said the pattern was not so simple. While retail stores, hotels and restaurants have been steadily hiring this year, some high-paying industries have been helping to lead the recovery as well.
 "Some of the biggest gains are coming out of professional service industries," Mr. Brown said. "That's not what one would think of as low-wage."
Statewide, the unemployment rate also rose in June, to 8.9 percent from 8.6 percent in May. State officials attributed that increase to a surge of job-seekers re-entering the work force.

HEADLINE: The Naked Coral Hypothesis

BYLINE: DAVID GRUBER


HIGHLIGHT: An evolutionary theory called the "naked coral hypothesis" explains why corals are absent from the geologic record for millions of years and several species rebound when conditions improve. 

 BODY:
Sunday, July 1
As we bob in the sea over the tropical reef tonight after ascending from a dive in Vonavona Lagoon, I can't help but think we are on one of the last frontiers - a rare slice of the planet that is quickly diminishing. It is difficult being a coral reef scientist in 2012. The system we are studying is dwindling - and we feel there is an urgent need to understand the ecosystem while it still has a pulse. Coral reefs are on target to be one of the first major ecosystems to be pushed to an unproductive state. But here, at Shark Point in the Solomon Islands, they are still healthy and functioning.
This reef is unmarked and protected by the indigenous Solomon Islanders, but there are other factors that contribute to its salubrious state. Few people inhabit these parts and those who do live in less-developed and low-impact states. They travel by wooden canoe, have scattered access to electricity, and do not have the technological means to scoop up thousands of fish at once. The locals are visibly underwhelmed by displays of our advanced scientific equipment (including an underwater version of the highest-resolution RED EPIC camera that James Cameron is using to film Avatar 2 and an underwater night-vision camera that we are using to visualize infrared colors not seen by the unaided eye).
"Why do you need all these things?" inquired Joseph Taksa, our guide, as he dropped us on the reef at night with pinpoint precision without the aid of the Global Positioning System or any navigation equipment.
This Week: The permafrost challenge; diving the coral reefs; and treatment options for prostate cancer.
Corals and development do not coexist peacefully. I cannot think of a single place on the planet where there are numerous humans living around tropical coral reefs, and where the reefs have not suffered a precipitous decline. There are many reasons for this: coral reefs are stuck in place, they grow relatively slowly; they have a narrow temperature and nutrient range; and they are incredibly interdependent with a suite of other creatures, such as the single-celled dinoflagellate that often lives inside their skin and provides them with photosynthesized nourishment.
Paradoxically, corals are likely to outlive humans. Coral species have been around for hundreds of millions of years and have survived and rebounded from extinction events like the one that extinguished the dinosaurs. An expedition member, Dan Tchernov, has co-authored an elegant study showing that some corals can even return to soft-bodied, anemone-like forms when the oceans become too acidic, and re-calcify when normal pH levels return. Dr. Tchernov's findings support an evolutionary theory called the "naked coral hypothesis," explaining why corals are absent from the geologic record for millions of years and several species rebound when conditions improve.
But the naked coral hypothesis should not warm human hearts: "Once the modern coral system and its biodiversity are gone, it will be gone for a long, long time - millions of years," Dr. Tchernov said. "We will miss out on many potential economical ventures including drugs, foods, energy sources."
On Day 13 of the expedition, the group has collected dinoflagellates from corals in the warm shallows as well as from the deep reef. These little animals, barely visible to the human eye, will be taken to New York for genetic and protein analysis and some will be kept in deep cryogenic storage at the American Museum of Natural History's Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research. We have returned to this same spot tonight to search for novel biofluorecent proteins and study how fish, corals and other animals are using this glow on the reef.
Yet, after tonight's dive, as I pass our state-of-the-art equipment into our boat (one of the few motor boats in the area), I note the paradox that modern technology itself has accelerated the coral reefs' decline. If fossil fuel-burning innovations and advanced fishing technologies were not here, many of these reef species would still be thriving globally. Some scientists have already written off coral reef ecosystems for dead, road kill on humankind's technological superhighway. But I see a glimmer of promise - here, in this oasis at Shark Point, as well as in other deeper coral reefs we've studied worldwide. Sustaining coral reefs as humans increase in population and consumption levels will require a sea change in our approach to reducing our ecological footprint. It will surely require scientific and sociopolitical innovation. I hold out on hope that we won't have to wait until the year 2,002,012 for reefs to return to the state that we've seen tonight.

HEADLINE: Wolf to Leave UBS to Form New Firm

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Robert Wolf, a top executive at UBS and a major fund-raiser for President Obama, has left the Swiss bank to form his own advisory shop, according to an internal memorandum reviewed by DealBook. 

 BODY:
One of President Obama's biggest supporters on Wall Street is about to leave his perch at UBS, one of the world's largest banks.
Robert Wolf, who is the UBS chairman for the Americas, is leaving at the end of the month to set up his own advisory shop. He will retain close ties to UBS, which will be the first client of his firm.
A 28-year veteran of Wall Street, Mr. Wolf has enjoyed his status as a prominent defender of the Obama administration and a top-ranking fund-raiser. He has garnered more than $500,000 to re-elect the president this year, and regularly plays golf and vacations with Mr. Obama on Martha's Vineyard. 
 In his day job as a top banker at UBS, the Swiss bank, Mr. Wolf has built his business on relationships, relying on contacts spanning Wall Street and Washington. A former bond trader, he rose through the ranks at Salomon Brothers and later ran the UBS fixed-income desk.
His latest role as chairman of the Americas has focused on winning new business from corporations, private equity firms and institutional investors. Mr. Wolf said on Thursday that he hoped his Wall Street and Washington experience, and his strong ties to both worlds, would "bring a unique perspective to my clients."
Mr. Wolf makes more than $5 million a year at UBS, according to several people had been briefed but declined to be identified discussing personnel matters.
"Robert has contributed significantly to the firm in managing and growing our business," three senior UBS executives, including Robert J. McCann, the bank's chief executive for the Americas, wrote in an internal memorandum reviewed by The New York Times. "We appreciate Robert's commitment to our clients and franchise and are pleased that we will continue our relationship as a client of his new firm."
Mr. Wolf's friendship with the president began before other financiers were seeking to curry favor with Mr. Obama during the 2008 campaign. The two met at a 2006 fund-raiser hosted by the billionaire George Soros and quickly became friends. During the financial crisis, he regularly advised Mr. Obama on the turmoil on Wall Street.
Now, when many on Wall Street, frustrated by the administration's attacks on their industry, have switched allegiance to Mitt Romney, Mr. Wolf has remained steadfast in his support.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in April, Mr. Wolf said that when Mr. Obama attacked "fat-cat bankers," he replied, "Mr. President, I know you think I'm overweight, but I can think of better names to call me." Mr. Obama reportedly laughed.
Mr. Wolf's prominence as an Obama backer irritated some at UBS, however, according to people briefed on the matter. This year, the bank's group executive board in Zurich directed Mr. Wolf to send all media inquiries to the bank's media office for approval, with many requests denied. 
But a UBS spokeswoman said that Mr. Wolf's departure had been in the works for some time and was not prompted by any internal battles.
Mr. Wolf set his plan in motion in March. He had just turned 50, was on his way to losing 35 pounds, and was ready for a fresh start. His entire career had been spent at two companies, Salomon Brothers and UBS, and the thought of striking out on his own sounded appealing.
"When you go straight from school to only working at two firms for 28 years, leaving an established platform to do something entrepreneurial is both exciting and overwhelming," Mr. Wolf said. "But I look forward to this new chapter in my career."
That next phase is 32 Advisors, a reference to his jersey number on the University of Pennsylvania football team. The firm is described, on its bare-bones Web site, 32advisors.com, as "a boutique consulting and advisory arm," serving a wide array of potential clients.
While he will no longer work at UBS, he is expected to continue to accompany its bankers to meetings and help it attract new clients. Being independent means that he can do the same for other firms as well.
By striking out on his own, Mr. Wolf will also have more time for his side project: helping the president win re-election.
 Susanne Craig contributed reporting. 

Below is the internal memo:
Dear Colleagues,
After an 18 year career with UBS, Robert Wolf has decided to leave the bank to start his own advisory and consulting firm, 32 Advisors, LLC. We are pleased that he will continue to work closely with UBS as a senior advisor, with a focus on providing client advice and solutions.
Robert has contributed significantly to the firm in managing and growing our business. During his tenure he has held a series of senior leadership roles across the firm including: Member of the Group Executive Board, Chairman and CEO of UBS Americas, President and Chief Operating Officer of UBS Investment Bank, Global Head of Fixed Income and Chair of the firm's Diversity and Community Affairs Committee.
"I have truly enjoyed my 18 years at UBS and the opportunity to work closely with so many talented and dedicated colleagues. I have been fortunate to build strong, lasting personal and professional friendships, and it has been an honor to serve the firm's clients to the best of my ability. While I am excited about this next phase of my career and establishing my own firm, I am also pleased to remain engaged with UBS and continue contributing to the company's growth and progress," said Robert.
We appreciate Robert's commitment to our clients and franchise and are pleased that we will continue our relationship as a client of his new firm. In this new capacity, Robert will be available as a resource to our investment bankers and sales teams, ensuring continuity of coverage. He will continue to work on current mandates, pitches and generating new business for UBS.
Please join us and the entire Group Executive Board in thanking Robert for his dedicated service and significant contributions to UBS. We look forward to continuing our partnership with him in his new endeavors.
Carsten, Andrea and Bob

HEADLINE: Group Led by BC Partners to Buy U.S. Cable Operator for $6.6 Billion

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The private equity firm BC Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have agreed to buy the American cable operator Suddenlink Communications for $6.6 billion. 

 BODY:
8:16 a.m. | Updated
LONDON - The private equity firm BC Partners and one of Canada's largest pension funds have agreed to buy the American cable operator Suddenlink Communications in a cash-and-debt deal worth around $6.6 billion.
BC Partners, which has offices in Europe and New York, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said late on Wednesday that they were teaming up with Suddenlink's management team, led by the chief executive, Jerald L. Kent, to buy the cable company from its current owners, which include Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the Quadrangle Group and Oaktree Capital Management.
The private equity firm and Canadian pension fund will provide around a combined $2 billion for the deal and assume Suddenlink's $4 billion of existing net debt, according to a company statement. The firms also will issue an additional $500 million of unsecured loans provided by Credit Suisse
With Western economies continuing to languish, the cable industry has been a bright spot, as companies look to take advantage of consumer demand for high-speed Internet and television services.
Earlier this year, the Dutch cable operator Ziggo raised around $1 billion in an initial public offering, while the Canadian company Cogeco Cable agreed on Wednesday to pay $1.36 billion for an American company, Atlantic Broadband.
"Cable is an industry we know well in both Europe and the United States, and epitomizes the defensive growth characteristics we typically seek in an investment," BC Partners' managing partner, Raymond Svider, said in a statement.
Suddenlink, the seventh-largest cable operator in the United States, provides television, phone and Internet services for about 1.4 million customers from North Carolina to Texas. The company reported revenue of $1.96 billion and a pretax profit of $743 million in the 12 months ended March 31, according to a company statement.
The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
LionTree Advisors, Goldman Sachs and the law firms Paul Hastings and Seyfarth Shaw advised Suddenlink on the deal, while Credit Suisse and the law firms Latham & Watkins and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised BC Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

TOP STORIES
Morgan Stanley Swings to Profit, but Revenue Falls | Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that it swung to a profit in the second quarter, but its revenue fell as it contended with the doldrums that have descended on the banking industry.
It earned $563 million from continuing operations, which amounts to about 28 cents a share, missing analysts' estimates. On average, analysts expected the company to earn 43 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Excluding certain one-time gains, the company reported that revenue fell to $6.6 billion from $9 billion in the period a year earlier. Including adjustments, revenue fell to $6.95 billion from $9.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Morgan Stanley's profit was 16 cents a share, excluding accounting gains related to the value of its debt. Its return on equity from continuing operations, a prominent measure of profitability, was only 3.5 percent. Shares in the firm fell 2.8 percent, to $13.60, in premarket trading. DealBook 
Scrutiny Intensifies on Collusion in Rate-Rigging Investigation | While much of the scrutiny surrounding interest rate manipulation has centered on Barclays, regulators have said that traders at the big British bank colluded with rivals to influence a key benchmark.
As part of a three-year scheme, a senior Barclays trader in Europe worked with counterparts at Crdit Agricole, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Socit Gnrale, according to people with knowledge of the matter who could not speak publicly because of the investigation. Regulators are examining whether at least one other bank was involved, one of the people said.
In an effort to bolster their profits, the traders collaborated to push interest rates up or down, according to regulatory documents. By doing so, they aimed to eke out extra gains on their trades or limit losses. In its complaint against Barclays, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission described the bank's trader as having "orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks" to profit on their portfolios.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Profit Fell 74% in Second Quarter

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Blackstone Group on Thursday reported a 74 percent decline in second-quarter earnings, underscoring some of the challenges the private equity industry faces. 

 BODY:
8:29 p.m. | Updated 
The Blackstone Group on Thursday reported a 74 percent decline in second-quarter earnings, underscoring some of the challenges confronting the private equity industry.
Blackstone's profit, reported as economic net income after taxes, amounted to $212.3 million for the quarter, compared with $804.2 million in the period a year earlier. The figures include unrealized gains from investments. The earnings of 19 cents a share fell short of the 21 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Capital IQ.
The firm's earnings reflect the broader investment climate, in which economic anxiety in the United States and Europe has put a crimp in deal activity. Even a giant like Blackstone, whose businesses span private equity, investment banking, hedge funds and real estate, has felt the effects of the weak market.
Still, investors committed more money to Blackstone in the quarter, pushing the firm's assets under management to $190.3 billion, a 20 percent increase from the period a year earlier. Though private equity returns have failed to reach the levels of the industry's heyday, investors in search of yields have continued to invest.
"In an environment characterized by slowing global growth and heightened investor caution, our limited partner investors are entrusting us with a greater share of their capital," Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The measure that Blackstone uses to report earnings, economic net income, is considered by the private equity industry to be an accurate reflection of a firm's profitability. On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone reported a loss of $75 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with a profit of $86.2 million, or 18 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, while revenue fell to $627 million from $1.3 billion.
The firm said its private equity holdings declined 4.2 percent in the quarter, contributing to overall weakness. Revenue for its hedge fund business was down 15 percent compared with the period a year earlier. Performance fees, a crucial source of profit, fell.
One bright spot was the debt-investment business, in which revenue increased 53 percent from the period a year earlier.
In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Schwarzman characterized the overall environment in the second quarter as "pretty miserable," adding that economic risks would combine with political concerns, including the looming "fiscal cliff," in the second half of the year.
Mr. Schwarzman urged investors not to focus too much on a single quarter, saying the firm invested over a long-term horizon. Blackstone's shares were up about 0.7 percent to $12.99 a share on Thursday.
Blackstone reported that it had $36 billion in uninvested capital at the end of the quarter. Of that, $16.4 billion was for private equity.

HEADLINE: July 18: New Polls, but Little Change in Horse Race

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: While some polls are certainly more sound than others, it's easy to drive yourself to exhaustion trying to determine which ones are "right." 

 BODY:
Polls from major news organizations, including The New York Times, have a lot going for them. They make a real effort to take a true random sample of Americans -- including the substantial number of Americans who rely exclusively on cellphones. They usually have strong standards of disclosure and transparency. They include long and detailed survey batteries, in addition to reporting the horse-race numbers. In an era of constrained news media budgets, they aren't cutting a lot of corners. All of that counts for a lot, in my view.
At the same time, all polls are subject to sampling error - the variance that inevitably creeps in because you are surveying just a subset of the population rather than everyone in America.
And all polling firms need to make decisions about the right way to identify registered or likely voters, the right way to conduct demographic weighting, the right way to phrase questions, the right way to characterize undecided voters and so on. These are difficult decisions, and they introduce a lot of uncertainty into polling. 
They can also introduce "house effects," which are persistent tendencies to show more favorable results for one party or one candidate than the consensus of polling firms. To be sure, these house effects can also be introduced - intentionally or not -- by poor pollsters who do take shortcuts, who have partisan agendas or who just don't know what they're doing. But even relatively strong polling firms can have them. 
And no polling firm - however strong - can rid itself of sampling variance, although it can reduce it by taking a larger sample of voters.
The point is simply this: even very good polls can have more random noise than people usually realize.
On Wednesday night, there was a lot of cognitive dissonance in my Twitter feed when The New York Times and Fox News came out with polls at about the same time. The New York Times poll, conducted in conjunction with CBS News, showed Mitt Romney with a nominal one-point lead over President Obama. The Fox News poll had Mr. Obama 4 points ahead instead.
It's easy to drive yourself to exhaustion by trying to determine which of these polls is "right." Some analysts are always trying to unlock the Da Vinci Code by looking at the demographic subsamples in polls - a noble idea in theory, but a problematic one in practice (indeed, I think it is often counterproductive) because the demographic subsamples in polls are subject to considerably more statistical noise than the top-line results.
To be sure, I do not take the view that all polls are created equal. Nor does our forecast model, which weights certain polls more heavily based on their methodological standards and their past accuracy.
It's my view that you'll almost always be better served by taking some kind of an average of the polls, by looking at more polls rather than fewer (including looking at state polls) and by looking at the trend lines within individual polls, which allow for more apples-to-apples comparisons.
All of this is a long-winded way of saying that none of the polls out on Wednesday night ought to have changed your impression of the presidential race much. The New York Times/CBS News poll showed a fairly good top-line number for Mr. Romney. But The Times/CBS News has generally shown more favorable results for Mr. Romney (and less favorable ones for Mr. Obama) than the polling average.
The Fox News poll qualifies as slightly good news for Mr. Obama, since its polls have been slightly Republican-leaning so far this cycle - but it was really nothing that couldn't be explained by sampling variance. And Fox News's most recent poll, in June, had shown Mr. Obama 5 points ahead, little different from their new survey.
Over all, the FiveThirtyEight model has shown an extremely flat race for the past month or so. There is little in the way of persuasive evidence that the race is moving much in one direction or another.
If you want to indulge in a more elaborate hypothesis, I might offer this one. It looks as though there may have been some recent deterioration, by a percentage point or so, in Mr. Obama's approval and favorability ratings - perhaps following the fairly poor economic news of late. However, the head-to-head numbers between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been essentially unchanged.
So it's a least plausible that Mr. Obama is being weighted down by the economic news, that Mr. Romney is being weighted down by the negative coverage surrounding Bain Capital, and that these effects are roughly canceling each other out.
It's also plausible that all of this is just statistical noise. Furthermore, it's plausible that, within a week or two, we will seem to see some clearer sign of a trend toward one or another of the candidates. 
There were some interesting data points out on Wednesday apart from the national polls. For instance, a Public Policy Polling survey in New Mexico showed President Obama 5 points ahead of Mitt Romney.
Despite his holding the lead in the poll, this is an unfavorable number for Mr. Obama. Public Policy Polling has shown good numbers for Mr. Obama this year, both in New Mexico and in other states. Its previous New Mexico poll, in fact, had Mr. Obama up by 14 points instead.
Is the poll enough to start thinking of New Mexico as a swing state, something we've generally advised against so far this cycle?
In my view, probably not. Mr. Romney's chances of New Mexico did improve materially on the poll, to 11 percent from 5 percent, according to our forecast model. But Mr. Obama had a pretty big cushion there: the demographics of New Mexico are quite favorable to him, and there's little evidence that Mr. Obama is having trouble with Latino voters in other states. 
Plus, this is the first poll of the cycle to show Mr. Obama with anything other than a double-digit lead in New Mexico. I hope that this survey will inspire other polling firms to take the state's temperature -- New Mexico has been sparsely polled. But in general, the underlying currents of voter opinion in each state aren't shifting as quickly as the polls sometimes seem to imply.
Mr. Obama did get some good news on Wednesday in the form of an increase in housing starts. The news from the housing sector has been one of the few bright spots in the economy lately; any sort of economic upside case for the second half of the year probably depends on those numbers continuing to rebound. Our model's economic index improved slightly on Wednesday because of the gain in the stock market, which reacted to the housing data and to testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Capitol Hill.
Still, for all of this new information, the forecast was not much changed. The model gives Mr. Obama a 67.9 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, versus a 66.8 percent chance before.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
For the first time since the Republican presidential primaries, a New York Times/CBS News poll shows Mitt Romney essentially tied with President Obama among likely voters. Jim Rutenberg and Marjorie Connelly write that the results suggest that fears about the economy are undercutting Mr. Obama's campaign. In the poll, more than half of the respondents disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, while nearly as many perceived Mr. Romney's policies to favor the rich over the middle class and the poor.

        
The Supreme Court dropped further in the court of public opinion after it ruled on the health care overhaul, Adam Liptak and Allison Kopicki note. Equal parts of the public approve or disprove of the court in the wake of the decision, and slightly more people disapprove of the court's decision than approve of it.

        
President Obama's recent comments about the nature of business success crystallized an ideological difference that separates the president from Mr. Romney on the role of government in society. Peter Baker writes that voters have a choice between Mr. Obama's more collectivist philosophy and Mr. Romney's tilt toward ideals of individual achievement.

        
At a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, resisted pressure from Republicans not to do more to aid the economic recovery, Binyamin Appelbaum reports. Republicans argued that action by the central bank might have an adverse effect like prodding inflation higher, but Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was keeping its options open.

        
A panel of financial regulators on Wednesday identified instability in Europe, the "fiscal cliff" that the United States faces at the end of the year, and the struggling housing market as the biggest threats to the economic recovery, Edward Wyatt reports. In a report, the Financial Stability Oversight Council said the financial system was stronger, but the regulators urged lawmakers to take action to prevent further damage to the recovery.
Happenings in Washington

        
Economic data expected Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by leading indicators and existing home sales for June, and weekly mortgage rates.

        
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will testify before the House Judiciary Committee at 10 a.m. during a department oversight hearing.

        
Also at 10, the House Small Business Committee will examine how Democrats' health care overhaul affects small and solo medical practices.

        
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, will speak at a conference called "Evidence and Impact: Closing the Gender Data Gap" that begins at 10:30 a.m.

HEADLINE: How the Division on Taxes Adds Up

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The difference between competing approaches to the Bush era tax cuts amounts to $28 billion, just about 3 percent of this year's expected deficit. But don't expect the parties to split the difference, at least not yet. 

 BODY:
Congress has reached a bitter stalemate over $28 billion.
That is the difference in cost between extending all the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire on Jan. 1 for one year and allowing the tax cuts to expire on earnings over $250,000, which the Democrats want, according to a new analysis by Congress's bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. It amounts to about 3 percent of the expected trillion-dollar budget deficit this year.
The number could ease the way to a resolution of the "fiscal cliff" - the sudden change in government finances that will hit next year when all the Bush tax cuts expire and $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts kick in. Split the difference and the deficit is not severely affected either way.
But compromise is not likely, at least in the short run. Democrats will argue that the figure proves that the tax increases on the rich are a nominal amount which would have little impact on the economy but would signal resolve on the deficit that financial markets are wanting. Republicans will say it proves the Democrats are pressing an ideological agenda to punish success while yielding little deficit reduction.
"The American people deserve better than to have the President and his allies threaten to melt down our economy for what amounts to less than three days of federal spending," Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee who ordered up the cost estimate, said in a statement.
The finger pointing on who is to blame as the nation careens toward the cliff has ratcheted up daily this week. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, again accused Republicans of holding "middle income tax cuts hostage to tax cuts for the richest in the country."
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, said Democrats are guilty of "Thelma and Louise economics - right off the cliff."
In point of fact, Senate Democrats - who will press for a vote next week on their plan - have already made one concession. President Obama had wanted income from dividends to be taxed as ordinary income for families earning more than $250,000. Senate Democrats instead set the dividend rate for such families at 20 percent, higher than the 15 percent for incomes below that threshold but well below the 39.6 percent rate that would hit higher income households under the Obama proposal.
But Democrats made that change more to keep unity in their own ranks than to extend an olive branch to Republicans. Beyond the dividend tax rate, both parties are demanding the absolute capitulation of the other. Some Democrats have quietly suggested a compromise that would allow taxes to rise only for incomes over $1 million a year, but real negotiations have not gone beyond either party's back benches.

HEADLINE: Obama and His Jobs Council: There in Spirit

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: The White House tries to deflect criticism that the president has not met much with his jobs council by pointing out that he has adopted some of its recommendations. 

 BODY:
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The White House wants it known that President Obama is listening attentively to his jobs advisory council, even if he is not meeting with them all that often.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One on Thursday as Mr. Obama embarked on a two-day campaign swing to Florida that the president had adopted the vast majority of the council's ideas that were within his power to enact.
"I want to be clear," Mr. Carney said. "The president is extremely appreciative of the initiatives and ideas that have been put forward by his jobs council."
The comments were intended to defuse criticism that the council, composed of corporate executives, labor leaders and other outside advisers, has not met in public for six months, as first reported by Politico.
After the report, Mr. Carney was asked at a briefing Wednesday if there was a reason why the president had not gotten together with them lately.
"No, there's no specific reason except that the president's obviously got a lot on his plate," Mr. Carney said then. "But he continues to solicit and receive advice from numerous folks outside the administration about the economy, about ideas he can act on with Congress or administratively to help the economy grow and help it create jobs."
The response fueled the controversy because it sounded like Mr. Carney was saying the president was too busy to meet with the jobs council at a time of intense focus on unemployment. Republicans quickly pounced on the comment. 
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the speaker, told reporters Thursday that Mr. Obama "hasn't lifted a finger to work with Congress on jobs" and "doesn't even have time to meet with his own jobs council."
"He's just out there campaigning every day and looking for somebody else to blame," Mr. Boehner said.
Hoping to douse the furor, Mr. Carney raised it unasked during a session with reporters on Thursday. He noted that a plan announced by the administration on Wednesday to streamline the review process for permits on major infrastructure projects actually came from the jobs council, including for ports in Charleston, S.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Miami; New York and New Jersey; and Savannah, Ga. 
He said the president had acted on 90 percent of the ideas put forth by the council that could be advanced through executive authority, but Congress had acted on only 20 percent of those that require legislation, including a jobs act that he said, citing economists, would create 1 million jobs.
"The president is focused on job creation and economic growth, and he is using every tool in his toolbox to advance job creation and economic growth through his executive action," Mr. Carney said. "But we need Congress to act, too."

HEADLINE: On the Trail, Romney Runs Into Some Opposition

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney continued to hammer President Obama on the economy while campaigning in deep-blue Massachusetts. 

 BODY:
BOSTON -- On the campaign trail it is known as "bracketing" -- when a representative of the opposition tries to sully the message of a stage-managed rally. 
Mitt Romney's staff members proved masters of the practice during the Republican primary race, lurking to speak with reporters after speeches by Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
On Thursday, Mr. Romney got the same treatment when two Democratic politicians from Boston tried to counter his visit to a small business here, where he attacked President Obama once again for his "you didn't build it" remark. 
"When the president said if you've got a business you didn't build it,'' Mr. Romney said, standing beside Brian Maloney, 69, who runs a bus and truck repair shop in the Roxbury neighborhood, "come here and talk to Brian." 
On the sidewalk, Tito Jackson, a city councilman representing Roxbury, said that as Massachusetts governor, Mr. Romney had done little to help businesses in the area, which is largely black and Hispanic. 
"I'm very happy that former Governor Romney found his way here,'' Mr. Jackson said. "But you know what, he didn't create jobs when he was governor. He didn't find himself in this community that often. And now we as people -- Roxbury -- we know you, Mitt Romney. We know you.''
Mr. Romney, of course, was not making a serious play to win deep-blue Massachusetts in November. He was using the backdrop of a successful small business, Middlesex Trucking & Coach, to hammer Mr. Obama on the economy. 
"This is a day where we received some news that is not encouraging,'' Mr. Romney said. "Jobless claims are up in this country again and consumer confidence has now shown the third straight month of decline. That is a record that has not been matched since 2008.''
And for a third straight day, Mr. Romney attacked the president for remarks he made about the debt that entrepreneurs owe to government for investments in education and roads. 
"Now I know that some people think what the president said was just a gaffe,'' Mr. Romney said. "It wasn't a gaffe. It was instead his ideology.''
He seemed to be responding to a statement by the Obama campaign earlier in the day that Mr. Romney had taken the president's comment out of context. Speaking at a firehouse in Virginia last week about the support that entrepreneurs receive from society, Mr. Obama said: "Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that.''
It is unclear if the president's "that" referred to roads and bridges, or to businesses. But to Mr. Romney there was no doubt the phrase revealed a basic difference in their philosophies: rugged individualism vs. mutual dependence. 
"The president does, in fact, believe that people who build enterprises like this really aren't responsible for it,'' he said, standing in a truck bay and using a Craftsman tool box for a lectern. "That, in fact, it's a collective success of the whole society that someone builds enterprises like this.''
Mr. Maloney, in business since 1980, was an ideal embodiment of Mr. Romney's message. "I take umbrage at the suggestion that people don't start and build businesses,'' he said. "I started out with 50 bucks and worked with my hands to afford grad school at night. My wife supported me.''
He said government had not helped, and only brought complicated regulations. "It's overbearing,'' he said.
But Felix G. Arroyo, an at-large member of the Boston City Council, speaking in front of several dozen chanting demonstrators, cited Mr. Romney's record of job creation as governor, when Massachusetts ranked 47th in the nation over his four years in office. 
"The facts of his leadership of our state do not speak to him as a job creator,'' he said.
Mr. Jackson, the councilman, cited a remark of Mr. Romney's reported by The Boston Herald in 1994, that private investors do not think of backing businesses in inner-city Roxbury or nearby Dorchester. "Why do we never think about it? Crime,'' Mr. Romney was quoted saying. 
(On the defensive about it the next day, he said he would encourage investors to seek out the neighborhoods).
"If he didn't have the vision for turning around Roxbury then,'' Mr. Jackson said, "how is he going to have that vision when he's president?'' 
While showing Mr. Romney around his company, Mr. Maloney looked out a window at the protesters and said: "We've done a lot for the neighborhood. It's a shame those people are out there.'' 
"Oh, that's the nature of politics,'' Mr. Romney responded, according to a pool reporter. "There are always two teams. We're always bothering each other's teams.''

HEADLINE: Blackstone's Profit Fell 74% in 2nd Quarter, but Investors Continued to Commit Money

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
8:29 p.m. Updated
The Blackstone Group on Thursday reported a 74 percent decline in second-quarter earnings, underscoring some of the challenges confronting the private equity industry. 
Blackstone's profit, reported as economic net income after taxes, amounted to $212.3 million for the quarter, compared with $804.2 million in the period a year earlier. The figures include unrealized gains from investments. The earnings of 19 cents a share fell short of the 21 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Capital IQ.
The firm's earnings reflect the broader investment climate, in which economic anxiety in the United States and Europe has put a crimp in deal activity. Even a giant like Blackstone, whose businesses span private equity, investment banking, hedge funds and real estate, has felt the effects of the weak market.
Still, investors committed more money to Blackstone in the quarter, pushing the firm's assets under management to $190.3 billion, a 20 percent increase from the period a year earlier. Though private equity returns have failed to reach the levels of the industry's heyday, investors in search of yields have continued to invest.
''In an environment characterized by slowing global growth and heightened investor caution, our limited partner investors are entrusting us with a greater share of their capital,'' Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The measure that Blackstone uses to report earnings, economic net income, is considered by the private equity industry to be an accurate reflection of a firm's profitability. On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone reported a loss of $75 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with a profit of $86.2 million, or 18 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, while revenue fell to $627 million from $1.3 billion.
The firm said its private equity holdings declined 4.2 percent in the quarter, contributing to overall weakness. Revenue for its hedge fund business was down 15 percent compared with the period a year earlier. Performance fees, a crucial source of profit, fell.
One bright spot was the debt-investment business, in which revenue increased 53 percent from the period a year earlier.
In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Schwarzman characterized the overall environment in the second quarter as ''pretty miserable,'' adding that economic risks would combine with political concerns, including the looming ''fiscal cliff,'' in the second half of the year.
Mr. Schwarzman urged investors not to focus too much on a single quarter, saying the firm invested over a long-term horizon. Blackstone's shares were up about 0.7 percent to $12.99 a share on Thursday.
Blackstone reported that it had $36 billion in uninvested capital at the end of the quarter. Of that, $16.4 billion was for private equity.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: El Paso Plant's Old Smokestacks Have Avid Fans

BYLINE: By SHEFALI LUTHRA. 
sluthra@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Robert Ardovino grew up within four miles of El Paso's smokestacks -- remnants of the copper smelter run by Asarco.
''I experienced everything that was wrong with that company,'' Mr. Ardovino said of Asarco, which in 2009 settled one of the largest environmental bankruptcies in United States history, after being accused for years of polluting and contaminating El Paso's air and soil. 
Despite that, Mr. Ardovino wants to prevent the demolition of the stacks.
Mr. Ardovino and Gary Sapp, another El Paso resident, run the Save the Stacks movement, and they say the smokestacks are a historic landmark. The planned demolition of the stacks is part of a state-run remediation to clean up the land Asarco occupied.
The company acquired the plant in 1899, and the refinery's smokestacks were added later. The taller one, built in 1967, is more than 800 feet. The other, built in 1951, is close to 600 feet.
Asarco, citing economic challenges, closed the refinery in 1999. In 2002, it considered reopening the plant, but critics cited concerns over the contamination. Analyses found high levels of lead and arsenic had leaked from the plant, and later reports suggested the company had illegally burned toxic waste.
Health and environmental concerns led to a six-year legal battle between Asarco and local environmental groups over whether the refinery would follow environmental standards. Asarco filed for bankruptcy in 2005, and reached a bankruptcy settlement of $1.79 billion in 2009. The company abandoned plans to reopen the El Paso refinery.
Estimates suggest it would cost $14 million to maintain the stacks for 50 years, though that figure is based solely on the blueprint of the stacks, said Roberto Puga, the trustee managing the remediation.
Mr. Puga said that money from the remediation budget could not be diverted to preserve the stacks. As part of Asarco's bankruptcy settlement, the state-run trust received $52 million to clean up the site.
Mr. Ardovino said Save the Stacks would conduct a cost analysis. It has until November to make its case and raise money. If the stacks were to remain standing, they would be privately maintained, Mr. Sapp said.
''It kind of pays for itself,'' he said. He suggested that if the stacks were made structurally sound, they could host an observation deck or be the basis of a new town cultural center.
Veronica Carbajal, a lawyer representing the group Ex-Asarco Workers, said the stacks may stand on a foundation of slag, a smelting byproduct harmful to the environment.
If that is so, keeping the stacks could present a ''catastrophic'' environmental threat, Ms. Carbajal said.
But Mr. Sapp said destroying the stacks could produce dust that must be controlled.
Because demolishing the stacks would have mitigated concerns about the foundation, the trust never conducted an environmental analysis of the site, Mr. Puga said. Save the Stacks must prove that preserving them would pose no threat, he said.
Mr. Puga stressed a need for community dialogue.
''There's people,'' he said, ''who are very passionate on both sides of the debate.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Standards on Workplace Noise Trail Those of Other Countries

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Noise levels recorded at nearly a dozen restaurants, gyms and bars in New York City reached heights that, if sustained over as little as two hours, would violate standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers' hearing. But even if the regulations were heeded, many audiologists say, they would not protect hearing enough: federal noise protection standards lag behind much of the industrialized world's. 
OSHA requires that workers exposed to an average of 90 decibels -- about as loud as truck traffic -- for eight hours wear hearing protection. Under the agency's measurements, when the volume increases by five decibels, the noise dose doubles, and so the permissible exposure time is cut in half -- if levels reach 95 decibels, the maximum exposure without hearing protection is four hours.
But many other countries, and even some agencies in the United States, adhere to stricter standards. (Britain has a Web site where people can calculate their daily doses of noise.)
Under the stricter guidelines, workers may not be exposed to 85 decibels for more than eight hours a day without hearing protection. Several agencies have also concluded that the risk of hearing loss doubles with every three-decibel increase, not five.
Laura Kauth, an audiologist and president of the National Hearing Conservation Association, said, ''The general consensus of professionals in the hearing-health field is that we should limit at 85 decibels'' with a 3-decibel standard for when noise dose doubles.
Under those standards, at 99 decibels (the average sound level recorded one recent Saturday night at Beaumarchais, a restaurant in Manhattan) the maximum recommended exposure is 19 minutes.
Yet enforcement of noise regulations at restaurants, gyms and bars in New York City is almost unheard-of. Noise complaints from workers at these places are rarely, if ever, reported to OSHA, it said.
Part of the problem may be a lack of awareness. At the national level, the only federal body tasked specifically with overseeing environmental noise was the Office of Noise Abatement and Control, which lost its financing three decades ago.
Alice Suter, an audiologist who has worked for OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said part of the reason federal noise standards lagged behind those of comparable countries was stiff resistance to even the suggestion of tougher standards. ''It all has to do with economics and the regulatory process,'' Dr. Suter said. ''It's getting harder and harder for OSHA to issue new regulations and revise old ones.''
Not that OSHA has not tried. In 2010, the agency announced plans to dust off a long-ignored requirement that employers soundproof noisy workplaces and not merely provide hearing protection, which was originally intended to be a temporary fix. Too many workers, the agency said, were being harmed by loud noise.
Opposition came swiftly from the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce, which argued that the guidelines would be too costly.
A month after making the proposal, OSHA withdrew it.

HEADLINE: Kathie Lee Gifford Show Is Broadway Bound

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
Many Broadway shows struggle for media attention - hence the tactic of casting Hollywood stars - but the new musical ''Scandalous'' has an extraordinary weapon in its publicity arsenal: NBC's ''Today'' show. On Thursday's broadcast, the co-host Matt Lauer plugged ''a very big announcement,'' then introduced Kathie Lee Gifford, who shares hosting duties for the final hour of ''Today.''
''I can't even believe the words are coming out of my mouth,'' Ms. Gifford said. ''A lot of weird words have come out of my mouth over the years, but we're announcing today that a musical I've been writing for going on 13 years now will be coming to Broadway this fall.'' 
''Broadway!'' Mr. Lauer said, applauding.
By using her ''Today'' platform, Ms. Gifford instantly put ''Scandalous'' in a national spotlight that other Broadway musicals this fall, like ''Chaplin'' and ''Rebecca,'' could only dream about. How often Ms. Gifford rah-rahs her own show on ''Today'' remains to be seen.
''Scandalous,'' based on the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, a colorful evangelist from the early 20th century, has a book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford, herself a born-again Christian who was a gospel singer early in her career. The music is by David Pomeranz and David Friedman, and the production is directed by David Armstrong, the artistic director of 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle. The musical ran there in 2011 under the title ''Saving Aimee,'' earning mixed reviews from critics.
Broadway musicals based on religious themes have had a tough time lately; the $14 million musical ''Leap of Faith'' flopped quickly this spring, and the revivals of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Godspell'' struggled at the box office this year and closed this summer. The musical ''Sister Act,'' which prominently features singing nuns and a salvation storyline, is due to close in August.
Through a spokesman, the producers for ''Scandalous'' declined to provide the capitalization amount on Thursday, but it is believed to be in the high seven figures.
The show will star musical theater veteran Carolee Carmello as Aimee; Ms. Carmello was nominated for Tony Awards for her performances in ''Parade'' (during the 1998-99 season) and ''Lestat'' (2006), and she is currently starring in ''Sister Act'' as Mother Superior.
Preview performances are scheduled to begin on Oct. 13 at the Neil Simon Theater.
''We have opening night - pinch me - Nov. 15,'' Ms. Gifford added on the ''Today'' broadcast.
''Kathie Lee Gifford on Broadway, baby,'' Mr. Lauer replied.
The lead producers of ''Scandalous'' include some unusual newcomers like Dick DeVos, a Michigan businessman who ran one of the most expensive races ever for governor in 2006, as the Republican nominee against Democrat Jennifer Granholm (who won). Mr. DeVos is the son of billionaire Amway founder Richard DeVos. Dick DeVos's wife Betsy is also a lead producer; they have a foundation in their name that provides money primarily to religious groups and to organizations that promote free-market economic policies. Another lead producer is Foursquare Foundation, which provides grants to evangelical churches and ministries.
A spokesman for the show did not immediately reply when asked if Ms. Gifford is putting any of her own money into the show.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Let Them Eat Crow

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
It has been said that we live in a new gilded age, in which the rich take it as their sovereign right and civic duty to get richer, while the rest of us look on in envy, simmer with resentment or dream of rebellion. ''The Queen of Versailles,'' a new documentary by Lauren Greenfield about life on the thin, fragile, sugarcoated top layer of the upper crust, captures the tone of the times with a clear, surprisingly compassionate eye.
A gaudy guilty pleasure that is also a piece of trenchant social criticism, the movie starts out in the mode of reality television, resembling the pilot for a new ''Real Housewives'' franchise or a reboot of ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.'' Before long, though, it takes on the coloration of a Theodore Dreiser novel -- not quite an American tragedy but a sprawling, richly detailed study of ambition, desire and the wild swings of fortune that are included in the price of the capitalist ticket. 
When they first sit for Ms. Greenfield's cameras, in 2007, David and Jackie Siegel are living an outsized, unlimited version of the American dream. His time-share business, Westgate Resorts, is booming. Families seduced by easy credit, aggressive sales tactics and the chance for a taste of luxury are eager to sign on the dotted line, and a sleek new Westgate dream palace has just gone up in Las Vegas.
Mr. Siegel is happy to talk about his modest beginnings in Indiana, his hard work and his devotion to causes including the Miss America organization and the Republican Party. His wife, a former model and beauty contestant, is outgoing and unpretentious, so tickled by her extravagant life that it is hard not to share her enthusiasm.
Feeling a bit squeezed in their 26,000-square-foot mansion in Orlando, Fla., the Siegels are building a palatial home more than three times as big. Envisioned as the largest residence in America, the house is modeled, with little irony and less restraint, on the French chateau referred to in the film's title.
History buffs will note that the inhabitants of that Versailles were evicted by an angry mob. The Siegels, as of this writing still in possession of their heads, were kept out of their stately pleasure dome by the invisible hand of the market, to which Ms. Greenfield may owe a story credit. If you detect a spoiler here, it's hardly my fault: blame the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent collapse of the real estate market, events that ''The Queen of Versailles'' recaptures from an especially intimate and fascinating perspective.
The Siegels are separated by 30 years -- Jackie is David's third wife; he is her second husband -- and united by seven children, who traipse through the movie, along with a staff of maids and nannies and an indeterminate number of fluffy white dogs. The household is a busy place, its rhythms determined by Mr. Siegel's work ethic and Mrs. Siegel's passionate consumerism. They are frank and open with Ms. Greenfield's crew and generous with their time, allowing a remarkable degree of scrutiny even as the gilding begins to peel away.
(It's true that Mr. Siegel is suing Ms. Greenfield and the film's distributor for defamation, but in America, to paraphrase William Blake, litigation is true friendship.)
It may seem at times as if the Siegels are being held up for ridicule or facile judgment, and ''The Queen of Versailles'' does have its moments of real-life comedy. ''How was it, flying commercial?'' Mrs. Siegel asks one of her children as they arrive in her western New York hometown for a visit. Descending on the car rental counter, she asks, ''What's the name of my driver?''
But back in Florida her actual driver speaks of Mrs. Siegel and her husband as friends, and their relations with the people around them seem relatively untouched by snobbery or noblesse oblige. It is hard not to enjoy Mrs. Siegel's company or to be unmoved by aspects of her life story.
Not that everything is harmonious. There are visible strains in the marriage, and a fair amount of evidence that Mr. Siegel is not always such a nice guy. One of his sons from an earlier marriage, now a partner in Westgate, says some things that hint at a cold, narcissistic paternal core. But the children of farmers, doctors and factory workers have also been known to find fault with their distant, driven, demanding fathers.
''The very rich,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, ''are different from you and me.''
''Yes,'' Ernest Hemingway may or may not have replied. ''They have more money.''
''The Queen of Versailles'' upholds Hemingway's demystified view and testifies to the curious logic of class in the new gilded age. The Siegels are proud of how much they have, embracing the idea that what distinguishes them from others -- from Westgate's customers or the members of its sales force, from friends and family in the heartland -- is not quality but quantity. They are just like everybody else; they just have more. Mrs. Siegel treats herself to a tin of caviar on Christmas morning, but she also likes Chicken McNuggets and diet soda.
David and Jackie Siegel are no better than any of the rest of us. That may go without saying. But the reverse is also true, and Ms. Greenfield's real achievement is to disarm the reflex of superiority that the spectacle of her subjects' way of life may provoke in some viewers.
Schadenfreude and disgust may be unavoidable, but to withhold all sympathy from the Siegels is to deny their humanity and shortchange your own. Marvel at the ornate frame, mock the vulgarity of the images if you want, but let's not kid ourselves. If this film is a portrait, it is also a mirror.
''The Queen of Versailles'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Obscene wealth, but mostly clean language.
The Queen of Versailles
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Directed by Lauren Greenfield; director of photography, Tom Hurwitz; edited by Victor Livingston; music by Jeff Beal; produced by Ms. Greenfield and Danielle Renfrew Behrens; released by Magnolia Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes.

HEADLINE: Advanced Micro Devices Reports Profit Down 40%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Trouble in the global economy dragged the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices' profit down 40 percent in the second quarter, and the company warned Thursday that revenue would continue to be hurt through the summer. 
''Overall weakness in the global economy, softer consumer spending and lower channel demand for our desktop processors in China and Europe made the closing weeks of the quarter challenging,'' Rory Read, the president and chief executive of A.M.D., said in a statement.
A.M.D. is the world's No. 2 maker of microprocessors, behind Intel. Mr. Read warned that though the company was acting to improve its performance, he expected headwinds to continue in the third quarter. A.M.D., which makes about a fifth of the world's computer processors, said its gross margin, a measure of profitability, was 45 percent in the second quarter, compared with 46 percent last year.
Early this month, A.M.D., which is based here, slashed its second-quarter revenue forecast, citing weaker-than-expected sales in China and Europe and lackluster consumer demand over all.
Some analysts said that the largest issue for the company, other than weak demand for personal computers, was that Intel became very competitive on prices in late May and June.
A.M.D.'s net income tumbled to $37 million, or 5 cents a share, from $61 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges and gains, the company earned 6 cents a share, missing analysts' expectations by a penny, according to data provider FactSet.
Revenue fell 10 percent to $1.41 billion, in line with analysts' revised expectations. A.M.D. said computing services revenue fell 13 percent because of lower desktop sales in China and Europe.
The company's stock fell 61 percent Thursday to close at $4.86.
A.M.D. said it expected third-quarter revenue to fall 1 to 3 percent from the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Economy Remains Soft In Output And Housing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Data on home sales and factory production released on Thursday indicate a weakening United States economy.
Americans bought fewer homes in June than in May, manufacturing in the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia region contracted for a third consecutive month, and the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose last week. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that sales of previously occupied homes fell 5.4 percent from May to June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.37 million homes -- the fewest since October.
Compared with a year ago, sales are up 4.5 percent. But the annual sales pace is well below the six million that economists consider healthy.
''It is only one month, and the rest of the housing indicators have all continued to show improvement,'' said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ''Let's hope this June decline is a blip.''
The few pieces of good economic news lately have been confined mainly to housing. On Wednesday, for example, the government said builders broke ground last month on the most homes in nearly four years.
Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region contracted for the third consecutive month in July, a sign of further feebleness in the economy. But some analysts say the report mostly reflects a regional slowdown.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia says its index of regional manufacturing activity rose to minus 12.9, up from minus 16.6 in June. Any reading below zero indicates a contraction.
Some parts of the report improved. New orders and shipments rose, though both remained negative. An index measuring employment dropped sharply from 1.8 to minus 8.4.
The Philadelphia Fed's reading ''suggests the factory sector is still in recessionary territory,'' Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ''But the downturn doesn't appear to be quite as bad'' as this survey suggested.
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose 34,000 last week. Normally, that would signal an increase in layoffs. But the figure was skewed higher by seasonal factors that made it hard to tell whether the job market might be worsening.
The government tries to adjust its unemployment benefits data to reflect temporary summertime layoffs in the auto industry. But this year, many automakers skipped those shutdowns to keep up with demand. That led to fewer layoffs, which the Labor Department did not anticipate.
Once those statistical distortions fade, Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a note to clients, ''We suspect that the data will point to a soggy labor market.''
Also, a gauge of future economic activity in the United States fell in June.
Measures of the overall economy, though, suggest the recovery may be in danger of stalling. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators slipped in June. The index fell 0.3 percent after a 0.4 percent increase in May. It had dropped 0.1 percent in April, its first decline in seven months.
The leading indicators index ''is pointing to no strengthening over the next few months, as the economy continues to sail through strong headwinds domestically and internationally,'' said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board.

HEADLINE: Asia Gets An Assist As Houston Greets Lin

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- If fans here are not quite swept up in Linsanity the way New Yorkers were, at least the Rockets know that Jeremy Lin, who officially became a member of the team late Tuesday night, could give them continued resonance in the vast basketball markets in Asia.
It was 10 years ago that the Rockets, with Yao Ming, pioneered the N.B.A.'s aggressive push into China, attracting millions of TV viewers there and generating millions of dollars in merchandise sales. Now Lin, who is of Chinese and Taiwanese descent, will introduce the Rockets to the international fan base he cultivated in his breakout season with the Knicks. 
At his first news conference since signing a $25.1 million contract with the Rockets, Lin said Thursday that he and Yao had been ''texting back and forth,'' mostly congratulatory messages, but ''when things settle down I'll be talking with him with regards to the city of Houston.''
Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a sports consultancy based in Chicago, said the Rockets' acquisition of Lin was savvy if the team wanted to continue its popularity in China. Yao played his entire N.B.A. career with the Rockets before retiring last year. When Ming was on the roster, Rockets games had a Chinese audience as large as 30 million, according to CCTV5, the Chinese sports channel. And the N.B.A. said it subsequently had amassed more than 41 million combined followers on Sina and Tencent (the Chinese versions of Twitter). An estimated 300 million children and adults play basketball in China.
Houston's population is 6 percent Asian, with some suburbs having concentrations as high as 18 percent. (New York City is 12 percent Asian).
''I am really excited about Lin coming here,'' said Bing You, a doctor of integrative medicine who immigrated to Houston from China's Sichuan Province in 2000. ''Lin is smaller than Yao but very talented. He went to Harvard. He plays with his brain.''
Dr. You said he and many in his community were planning to attend Rockets games, and their relatives in China are already requesting tickets to games when they visit.
Lin tried to reassure Rockets fans Thursday that he was excited to be a part of the team after it was widely reported that he would have preferred to stay in New York.
''Coming into free agency, I didn't expect to be anywhere besides New York,'' he said. Nevertheless, he added, ''I wouldn't have signed an offer sheet with Houston if I wasn't excited about the possibility of playing here as well.''
The Rockets' owner, Les Alexander, sitting next to Lin, explained that his team was making a correction, having cut Lin just seven months ago, setting him on a path to unlikely stardom in the country's biggest market.
''It's always difficult when you make an error,'' Alexander said. ''We made an error when we let him go. I think we rectified it now.''
Lin was not drafted when he graduated from Harvard in 2010 with a degree in economics. He was then signed and quickly waived by both the Golden State Warriors and the Rockets before signing with the Knicks last December.
He played only three months with the team before a knee injury sidelined him for the season. But his short time on the court was extraordinary. In his 12 starts before the All-Star break, Lin averaged 22.5 points and 8.7 assists. In February he scored a career-high 38 points in the Knicks' 92-85 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.
New York was suddenly in the throes of Linsanity, dazzled by a 23-year-old point guard many had not heard of months before.
Reaction to his move to Houston among fans here has ranged from muted to skeptical.
''It seems like a lot of money for someone who's unproven,'' said Tristan Clement, 22, a recent graduate of Rice University who was with friends at a bar located near the campus. ''Dwight Howard would have been a better investment,'' referring to the Orlando Magic center.
Ganis, the sports consultant, said, ''Lin exceed expectations by thousands of miles,'' but noted that his 6-foot-3, 200-pound frame must prove sturdy enough for the rigors of a full N.B.A. season.
''He's kind of frail by N.B.A. standards,'' he said.
Lin admitted Thursday that ''I have a lot to prove'' and said he would focus on building strength in his legs to withstand a full season. ''My knee is feeling better,'' he said. ''I am almost to the point that I have all the speed and explosiveness as before.''

HEADLINE: Rail Yard Reopens As City's Freight Trains Rumble Into Wider Use

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The 65th Street Rail Yard in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, was once a vital gateway to New York City's network of freight rail lines, providing a place for rail cars carried on barges across the harbor from New Jersey to connect with tracks running through Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island.
But for decades, the rail yard, like others, has languished because of railroad bankruptcies, litigation, changing routes, deteriorating infrastructure and other problems, city officials have said. This week, the rail yard finally reopened as part of a long-awaited citywide freight rail expansion that seeks to revive an industry that for many has come to be best known for a symbol of its decline -- the High Line, a derelict elevated freight line in Manhattan famously repurposed as a park. 
''New York has been on a roller-coaster ride with freight rail,'' said Joshua Nelson, a vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, as he stood amid knee-high weeds in the rail yard last week.
Though freight rail remains a tiny part of the city's overall transportation system, city, state and federal officials have spent more than $115 million to help expand infrastructure along the south Brooklyn waterfront since 2009, including laying fresh tracks and renovating a marine terminal that was once a hub for cocoa imports and manufactured goods. They spent another $80 million to restore an abandoned freight rail line on Staten Island's west shore in 2007, and most recently, they announced last month a planned $10 million upgrade of freight rail operations at Hunts Point in the Bronx.
These efforts, which come as the amount of goods being shipped through the city by some freight railroads continues to increase, have won praise from some transportation advocates and residents who see rail as an alternative to the fleets of trucks congesting roadways and spewing fumes into surrounding communities. ''We're in support of it,'' said Monxo Lopez, a member of South Bronx Unite, which has cited truck traffic in opposing the move of the online grocer FreshDirect to the Bronx. ''But it has to be tied up with concrete traffic reductions and community involvement.''
City officials have also said that freight rail is good for the economy, because it gives local companies an option for transporting goods that could be significantly cheaper over long distances than using trucks.
But some communities have raised concerns that trains, too, produce noise and fumes. In 2009, more than a dozen civic groups in Queens banded together to form Civics United for Railroad Environmental Solutions to call for reducing the impact of freight trains. ''Whatever expansion is taking place is certainly going to have a more negative effect on those living near the freight rail lines,'' said Gary Giordano, district manager for Queens Community Board 5.
The expanding freight rail network is the culmination of decades of efforts, some unsuccessful, across the city and region. ''There's been all kinds of resistance,'' said United States Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat representing parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn who has long pushed to expand freight rail. ''Rail fell out of use, and people just didn't see it anymore.''
According to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a regional organization charged with transportation planning, just 1 percent of the 434.7 million tons of freight transported through the city and its suburbs in 2004, the latest year analyzed, was by rail, compared with 89 percent by truck. The council estimates that by 2030, the total amount of freight will nearly double, rising to 804.4 million, though some transportation experts have suggested that number may be too high.
In other parts of the country, a larger share of freight is carried by rail. In 2010, 9.7 percent of the 18.3 billion tons of freight transported nationally was by train, compared with 68.2 percent by truck, according to federal transportation data. Nationally, the total amount of freight is projected to rise to nearly 27.5 billion by 2040.
''There needs to be another way to handle the increasing capacity, other than roadways,'' said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the New York council, citing growing population and consumer demand for products in the region. Bruce Lieberman, chairman of the New York and Atlantic Railway, said his business has steadily attracted new customers, climbing to more than 22,000 carloads annually.
CSX Transportation, one of the nation's largest freight railroad companies, now runs four freight trains a day, each with an average of 75 rail cars, along its main line through the Bronx, compared with two trains a day seven years ago, said William Goetz, a vice president of the company. The cargo carried on the four trains would fill about 900 trucks, he added.
At the 65th Street Rail Yard last week, a line of graffiti-covered rail cars filled with auto scraps waited to be rolled onto barges. The city, which acquired the 24-acre site for $2.5 million in 1981, has periodically tried to revive the rail yard. But in recent years, it has remained closed, in part because the city was embroiled in a legal battle with the New York Cross Harbor Railroad, which previously operated the barge service to and from New Jersey, Mr. Nelson said.
Today, the barges are operated by New York New Jersey Rail, a small railroad owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, using a smaller, city-owned rail yard nearby. The barges will move to the new 65th Street Rail Yard, which can handle longer rail cars and has two ''float bridges'' made of timber and steel to anchor the barges as the railcars are rolled off. The other site has only one float bridge.
''That was the back porch; this is the front yard,'' said Don Hutton, managing director of the railroad, as he pointed out the float bridges, which have been used only for tests since they were built in 2000. ''This is really the big deal. Our guys can't wait.''
Mr. Hutton said his goal was to haul 23,000 rail cars a year by 2017, up from 1,600 rail cars now. The cargo will include Washington State apples bound for city markets, home heating oil for Long Island homeowners, and newly made cars for dealerships across the region.

HEADLINE: Coney Island, Renewed but Recognizable

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Laura Friedman came up with a list of things she wanted to do before leaving Brooklyn for law school in California, and near the top was an outing at Coney Island.
So the other day, she reveled in the restored Wonder Wheel and the Steeplechase roller coaster in Coney Island's spruced-up amusement parks and chomped on a cob of corn from one of its legendary food stands. Afterward she enjoyed a beer with a friend at Ruby's Bar and Grill, an 81-year-old Boardwalk dive that itself has been refurbished as part of Coney Island's revitalization.
''Having never been here before, it still feels honky-tonk to me, but in a good way,'' said Ms. Friedman, 23. ''I like a little bit of grit.'' 
Skeptics who feared that replacing or freshening the woebegone Boardwalk shops, restaurants and rides would mean the Disneyfication of Coney Island -- a swapping of its distinctive sizzle for a more standardized glitz -- may have to wait awhile to see their fears realized. While the overhaul engineered by the city is evident throughout the seaside neighborhood, Coney Island has so far avoided becoming too sanitized and tidy, many patrons say.
The Boardwalk is bustling even in midweek, as hipsters, middle-class families and tourists join up with the regulars who stayed with Coney even in the worst times. Shop owners say there has been a substantial uptick in business. Attendance at the amusement parks has jumped to 640,000 last year from 400,000 in 2010, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation, which steered Coney Island's renewal.
One of the worrywarts, Dick D. Zigun, the tattooed unofficial mayor of Coney Island, said his fears had not materialized. In a 2005 interview he had expressed concern that the city's plans for redeveloping Coney Island would render it as squeaky-clean as some critics say Times Square has become.
''Instead of a tarnished trademark and has-been neighborhood, we have turned the corner and Coney Island is once again an industry leader in the amusement industry, which it invented,'' said Mr. Zigun, president of Coney Island USA, a nonprofit group which runs the annual Mardi Gras-like Mermaid Parade, as well as a sideshow with sword swallowers and fire-eaters.
A year ago, the operator of the new Luna Park, Central Amusement International, a division of Zamperla, a major Italian manufacturer of amusements that has done work for Disney, opened a ''heart-stopping'' new section called Scream Zone. It has four new rides that remind visitors of the thrills once routinely available in the Coney Island of yore, including the Sling Shot, a combination bungee jump and human yo-yo.
The other day, a group of 55 Hasidic boys from Borough Park were steering go-carts around the hairpin turns of the Coney Island Raceway, a reward for their high grades.
''It's a lot of fun,'' yelped Yoel Unger, a round-faced 13-year-old with side curls. ''You race each other and the whole point is whoever gets there first.''
Meanwhile, Grimaldi's, a small but popular pizza chain, is getting ready to open an outlet on Surf Avenue. Tom's, the Prospect Heights diner famous for vinegar fries, is putting finishing touches on an outlet right on the Boardwalk.
''I was happy to see they brought something Brooklyn here, not something from out-of-state, not a franchise,'' said Maya Haddad, who has opened a new beachwear shop on the Boardwalk.
Luna Park is also brimming with rules meant to persuade guests to ''behave in a family-friendly manner.'' Clothing with rude designs, or the use of profanity can get one thrown out. Some remain ambivalent about the upgrading; Michael Brandao, a well-bronzed Boardwalk fixture, reported that ''a lot of the regulars resent the changes.''
''They're trying to draw a different crowd, Manhattan people, people with money, tourists,'' he said. ''They got rid of the hookers, drug dealers, the people who harass you. The downside is there are some nice people who have been coming here for years who can't afford the new Coney Island.'' At least two of the beloved old shops have been allowed by Central Amusement to remain: Paul's Daughter, a 42-year-old fast-food stand formerly known as Gregory and Paul's, and Ruby's, which underwent a face-lift that was required by its nine-year lease. The old, cluttered outdoor sign that advertised ''ice cream, ice-cold beer and soda, corn dogs, and pizza'' has been replaced by something more contemporary, but it is still there, hanging on an inside wall.
Michael Sarrel, the owner, said the bar was attracting a ''different and better demographic,'' with more middle-class people and residents of what some call ''the new Brooklyn.''
''There has been a perception of Coney Island as a dangerous place,'' he said. ''You couldn't come here with kids. Now they can see families here.''
The city, which began eyeing redevelopment after the area grew shabby, rezoned much of the core and in 2009 bought up 6.9 acres, granting a 10-year lease to Central Amusements. The city invested $6.6 million and Central Amusement spent $30 million. There are still plans to restore the B& B Carousel and several ramshackle arcade booths, and the famed Parachute Jumpwill be relit.
''Most people believe that it has been developed in a manner consistent with Coney Island's history,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation.
That sentiment was echoed by Ms. Friedman.
''I wouldn't come if it was Times Square,'' she said.

HEADLINE: AutoNation Posts Record Profit

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
AutoNation, the biggest car retailer in America, said Thursday that it earned record profits in the second quarter because of the continuing recovery in newvehicle sales.
The strong performance was another indication of the solid comeback of the United States auto market from its recession levels three years ago. 
The company, which is based in Florida and operates 260 dealerships nationwide, said it earned $82 million in the quarter that ended June 30, compared to $73 million in the same period a year ago.
Second-quarter revenue increased 17 percent to $3.9 billion, and the number of new vehicles sold grew by 29 percent.
Over all, new-vehicle sales for the entire American industry have increased by 14.8 percent, to 7.2 million, in the first half of this year.
After experiencing the lowest sales in decades during 2008 and 2009, the industry is enjoying better demand primarily because of the aging of cars on the road.
Because so many consumers put off replacing older models, the average vehicle in operation in the United States is now about 11 years old, according to registration data compiled by the auto research firm, R.L. Polk.
The chief executive of AutoNation, Michael Jackson, said demand had been steady in all segments, irrespective of the size of vehicles or their gas mileage.
''This is a real recovery,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview.
Analysts and auto executives are expecting sales for the entire year to reach 14.5 million vehicles or higher.
Mr. Jackson said that he expected the industry to return ultimately to its pre-recession levels.
''We are on track to get back to 16 million a year, which is totally sustainable,'' he said.
He added that the market was thriving without automakers relying on big new sales incentives to spur demand.
''Incentives are rational, reasonable and tactical now,'' he said. ''Before, we were selling the discount rather than selling the product.''

HEADLINE: Markets Advance On Positive Earnings

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Thursday for a third consecutive day, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed to a 2 1/2-month high after earnings from technology companies and expectations for more stimulus outweighed weak economic data. 
So far in this earnings season, a majority of companies have beaten analysts' lowered expectations. In the latest results, I.B.M. raised its full-year outlook, eBay's profit beat forecasts and Qualcomm said it expected a ''strong December quarter.''
''Europe has been quiet, and earnings news, while not earth-shattering, is slightly better than expected,'' said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Company in Lake Oswego, Ore. ''A trading range environment is how we see it.''
Weak manufacturing and employment data as well as falling revenue at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which sent its shares down more than 5 percent, capped gains in the wider market.
Even so, expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon step up stimulus efforts have helped the market shake off bad news. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said this week that the United States central bank would act if the outlook worsened.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 34.66 points, or 0.27 percent, to 12,943.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.73 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,376.51. The Nasdaq composite index added 23.30 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,965.90.
But despite the Nasdaq's strong performance compared with the other indexes, decliners in the index beat advancers by more than 5 to 4. Investors like to see advancers beating decliners by a wide margin to confirm market strength.
The S.& P. is at its highest level since early May. Some investors are pointing to a trading range between the recent highs above 1,400 and a low in June around 1,280.
''People are focusing on individual stocks after earnings and trying to figure out'' through outlooks how weak the economy is, said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill.
In economic data released on Thursday, manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region shrank for a third month, according a survey by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve. And the National Board of Realtors said home resales were lower than forecast. That came shortly after a report showed more Americans applied for unemployment insurance in the latest week.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to 102 6/32, while its yield rose to 1.51 percent from 1.49 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate In June Rose To 10% in City, Despite Hiring

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent in June, equaling the highest level it reached during the recession, even as employers continued hiring at a healthy pace, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
Though city officials make almost daily pronouncements about how impressively the city's economy has rebounded from the long recession, the unemployment rate has returned to the peak it held for six months, from fall 2009 until February 2010. The last time it was higher was 19 years ago, when it was 10.1 percent, said James P. Brown, principal economist for the department.
The June rate was up from 9.7 percent in May, and it translated to more than 397,000 unemployed city residents, according to state data. That total was within 2,000 of the highest number of jobless city residents at any time in 37 years of record keeping, the numbers showed.
The unemployment rate worsened again despite a gain of 11,500 jobs last month, Mr. Brown said. That increase was modest compared with the strong gains of recent months but was about average for the last 10 Junes, he said.
The disparity between the jobs tally and the rising unemployment rate continues to confound economists. Typically, when the survey of employers shows steady hiring for several months, as it has this year, the unemployment rate declines. But the unemployment rate, which is derived from a survey of households, indicates that the job gains are not doing much to improve the lot of city residents.
''It is disconcerting to observe this trend month after month,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. Ms. Denham said it was ''perplexing'' that one survey showed 1,700 fewer city residents had jobs last month than in September 2009 while the payroll survey showed that 190,000 jobs were created during that span.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg emphasized the rosier of the two assessments of the city's job market, saying in a statement that it was ''good news for the many job seekers who are voting with their feet and coming here to look for work.'' He added that, ''As fast as New York City is creating jobs, people are entering the labor market even faster, which indicates optimism and confidence in the long-term future of New York City.''
Labor union officials have said the bigger problem is that most of the new jobs are in industries that pay low wages, like retailing and janitorial work. They have been pushing for several months in Albany for an increase in the state's minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.
But Mr. Brown said the pattern was not so simple. While retail stores, hotels and restaurants have been steadily hiring this year, some high-paying industries have been helping to lead the recovery as well.
''Some of the biggest gains are coming out of professional service industries,'' Mr. Brown said. ''That's not what one would think of as low-wage.''
Statewide, the unemployment rate also rose in June, to 8.9 percent from 8.6 percent in May. State officials attributed that increase to a surge of job-seekers re-entering the work force.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 'Beasts of Revelation'

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea
Through Aug. 3
Religious imagination animates a lot of art being made these days but is rarely a topic of serious critical discussion. ''Beasts of Revelation,'' an entertaining show of 30 contemporary artists toying with biblical and Christian subject matter, is a good conversation starter. 
Alexi Worth's allegorically ingenious painting ''Arizona'' offers a God's-eye view down on a canopy of silvery fig leaves through which a hand is reaching up to pluck one of three green fruits. In another context it would be read as a violation of the Modernist law of flatness in painting. Original Sin and the Expulsion naturally come to mind, while the title directs thought to Arizona's expulsionist immigration policies.
In Roger Brown's cartoonish painting ''The Beast Rising From the Sea,'' a giant, seven-headed, leonine chimera looms against a sky of scallop-patterned clouds as tiny people on the shore look on with alarm. Ed Paschke's hallucinatory painting of a blond man with pupil-less eyes and a radiating extrathoracic heart has a similarly weird humor.
Joyce Kozloff's ''JEEZ,'' a 12-foot-square painted pastiche of scores of images of Jesus copied from as many different sources, takes a more deflationary approach to Christian imagery, while Jimmy Wright hints at personal experience in ''Baptism at Pilot Oak,'' a small painting of a naked man and a clothed one in waist-deep water.
Angela Dufresne's ''Rosemary Magdalene'' pictures a woman in a ragged dress on the shore of a wilderness lake. Painted with impetuous bravura on a seven-and-a-half-foot-wide canvas, it exudes a stirring romance while lodging a feminist protest against Christian patriarchy.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Reports Loss After a Write-Down

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- An accounting charge related to Microsoft's ill-fated acquisition of an online advertising business led to a loss for the software giant's last quarter, its first in more than two decades as a public company.
But while that loss can be played down as an anomaly for a company that has been a reliable moneymaker for decades, weak sales in Microsoft's Windows business cannot. Microsoft said on Thursday that its revenue from Windows fell 13 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30. 
Windows sales looked worse than they really were in part because Microsoft had to change how it recognized that revenue because of an offer it has extended to people who buy PCs running Windows 7. Under that offer, users can pay $14.99 to upgrade to Windows 8 when it comes out in October.
If Microsoft had not had to defer a portion of its Windows sales -- $540 million in this case -- its Windows revenue would have declined 1 percent, still a dismal performance that underscores the challenges in the traditional computer business right now.
Sales in the PC market have stagnated as consumers have diverted their technology spending to more exciting technologies, including smartphones and tablet computers like the iPad. Microsoft and other companies in the PC industry are hoping to reignite growth in the business with the release of Windows 8, an operating system that has been revamped to work better on touch-screen devices.
The blockbuster success of the iPad has forced other significant changes at Microsoft, most notably the company's decision to design and sell its own tablet computer, called Surface. Technology executives and analysts say they believe Microsoft chose to make Surface, the first computer of Microsoft's own creation, after its partners in the hardware business failed to come up with products compelling enough to rival the iPad.
In an interview, Peter Klein, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said sales of PCs to businesses were growing, but that consumer sales, mainly in developed markets like the United States and Europe, were weak.
Mr. Klein said that could be partly attributed to broader weakness in the economy and competition from tablets. Mr. Klein said the company believed Windows 8 would help to change things.
''We're pretty encouraged by the impact that can have,'' he said.
Other parts of Microsoft's business fared better, including its server and tools division, for which sales rose 13 percent. At the company's business division, which includes its Office family of applications, sales rose 7 percent.
Microsoft has also been struggling to improve its position in the smartphone business, where competitors like Apple and Google have gobbled up most of the market.
Mr. Klein said sales of handsets running Windows Phone, Microsoft's mobile operating system, increased more than 50 percent between the company's fiscal third and fourth quarters. Microsoft reported a net loss of $492 million, or 6 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $5.87 billion, or 69 cents a share, during the same period a year ago.
The company said its revenue was $18.06 billion during the quarter, up from $17.37 billion a year ago.
Without the charge related to the company's $6.2 billion write-down of the value of aQuantive, the online advertising business it acquired in 2007, Microsoft would have earned 67 cents a share.
That compares to the 58 cents a share that analysts on average expected Microsoft to report, according to Thomson Reuters.
The weakness in sales of Windows did not surprise analysts who follow the company. Research firms have been warning of poor computer sales for weeks now. Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said in a research note that Microsoft exceeded his expectations for the quarter, partly by keeping its costs under control.
Microsoft shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. They closed the regular trading session at $30.67, up 22 cents.

HEADLINE: Walgreen and Express Scripts Reach Deal

BYLINE: By BRUCE JAPSEN

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Walgreen, the nation's largest drugstore chain, agreed on Thursday to renew its relationship with the prescription benefit manager Express Scripts, opening the door for hundreds of thousands of customers to return in September for discounts and related benefits from their Express Scripts drug cards.
Express Scripts and Walgreen, which announced the new multiyear agreement, had been battling over payment issues for more than a year. 
The dispute cost Walgreens more than $4 billion in annual revenue, analysts estimate, and set off a steep decline in Walgreen's share price.
Terms of the new agreement were not disclosed.
Shares of Walgreen rose 11.8 percent, to $34.62, on Thursday, while Express Scripts was up about 1.85 percent, to $58.76.
The dispute over payments began in June 2011 and led to a parting of the ways at the beginning of the year. Customers had to switch to another pharmacy, or pay more for drugs if they continued to use Walgreen.
Express Scripts is a pharmacy benefit manager, working as a middleman between drug makers and employers. The benefit managers pay pharmacies to dispense the drugs.
Walgreen filled more than 80 million prescriptions managed by Express Scripts in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2011. Walgreen stores filled more than 800 million prescriptions that year.
On Thursday, the companies said Walgreen would return to ''the broadest network of pharmacies available to Express Scripts clients'' effective Sept. 15.
But that does not mean Walgreen will automatically recover all of its lost business, given that Express Scripts had relationships with other pharmacies. Analysts say most of the business of filling prescriptions that had been done by Walgreen moved to CVS.
Walgreen will now have to fight to get that business back, and it may not be so easy.
''Walgreen is going to have to do some advertising to patients to convince them to switch back,'' said Jeff Jonas, a health care analyst with Gamco Investors in New York.
''Pharmacy customers tend to be sticky, so it's not going to be easy to get them back,'' he said.
Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., is the nation's largest pharmacy chain, with more than 8,200 outlets in the United States operating under the Walgreens and Duane Reade names. Therefore, the contract dispute was a serious inconvenience for many customers and employers.
Employers, which people close to both companies said exerted pressure for the deal, welcomed the new contract.
''The loss of a major retail chain in a national pharmacy network is always a concern to employers that want to ensure their workers have access to obtain prescription drugs,'' said Larry Boress, president and chief executive of the Midwest Business Group on Health, a coalition of large employers that buys more than $3 billion in medical care services annually. Among the members are Boeing, Ford Motor and Kraft Foods.
''While a number of employers are seeking smaller retail networks in order to reduce drug benefit costs, Walgreens is a respected and valued vendor that many employers are working with in other ways as well, such as on-site clinics and pharmacies and flu shot programs,'' Mr. Boress added.
The dispute was rancorous, with both sides saying they would not budge on their rate terms.
Since the two parted ways, analysts say Express Scripts gained more leverage this year when it bought a rival drug benefit manager, Medco Health Solutions, bringing tens of millions more Walgreen prescriptions under Express Scripts drug management.
In a statement, Walgreen's chief executive, Gregory D. Wasson, said he was ''pleased that Walgreens and Express Scripts have been able to reach an agreement that works for both parties and is consistent with our company's principles.''
The chairman and chief executive of Express Scripts, George Paz, echoed those remarks.
''Our business model is based on strong alignment with our plan sponsors -- employers, health plans, unions and government health programs -- providing them with a clinically sound and economically responsible pharmacy benefit,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Rice Loyalty

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In the four months that Seiyu Walmart, as the big American retailer's stores are known here, has been selling low-cost Chinese rice, it has struggled to keep shelves stocked at some stores. A Japanese chain, Beisia, also sold Chinese-grown rice for the first time this year but quickly ran out.
Kappa Create's sushi restaurants have started to serve rice grown in California, while Matsuya, one of Japan's biggest beef and rice bowl chains, has introduced a blend of Japanese and Australian rice. Daikokuten Bussan, which runs discount stores across the country, says it would carry foreign rice if it could get a stable supply.
Prompted by declining incomes, as well as fears about radiation from last year's nuclear disaster in Fukushima, a major rice-producing region, a small but growing number of Japanese consumers and businesses are doing the unthinkable: openly abandoning their loyalty to expensive, premium-grade homegrown rice and seeking out the trickle of cheaper alternatives from China, Australia and the United States that make it into Japan's heavily protected market. 
''I don't think many people would have considered buying imported rice in the past, but that might be changing now,'' said Kana Saito, 29, a part-time office worker shopping at a Seiyu Walmart in central Tokyo. She had wanted to buy a 2-kilogram bag of Chinese-grown rice, but it was sold out.
''The label 'domestic-grown' doesn't really have the same stature,'' especially after Fukushima, she said.
Japan's agricultural ministry, for now, says it is not considering an increase in rice imports, which are all but shut out by a 778 percent tariff. Since 1995, the government has imported about 700,000 tons of rice tariff-free annually, most of which it diverts to uses that do not compete with Japanese rice, like livestock feed and emergency stockpiles.
Some imported rice has always been used discreetly by cheap restaurants, bento lunch makers and others, industry officials said. But for consumers to want to buy foreign rice to cook at home -- or for major chains to openly switch to foreign rice -- is a big shift, they said.
Now, the clamor for foreign alternatives has left retailers and restaurants fighting for the tiny amounts the Japanese government makes available for retail use, which came to just 10,000 tons last year, according to government records, a fraction of the nine million tons of rice sold in Japan.
In a survey of 60 food companies by the Nikkei newspaper in March, 70 percent said they would be interested in using imported rice if it were available. Ryo Kanayama, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Seiyu Walmart, said the retailer was ''doing its best'' to secure more foreign rice.
Whether there will be a significant push by Japanese consumers or businesses for more foreign rice is still uncertain, and the Japanese farming lobby, which has strong political clout, remains opposed to an opening-up. Still, waning loyalties to homegrown rice could have immense implications for a country whose politics, society, economy and even national identity are entwined with rice cultivation.
''If we do see Japan opening up the market to more foreign rice, it would be a big shift in postwar Japan,'' said Toshiyuki Kako, an emeritus professor at the Kobe University Graduate School of Agricultural Science in western Japan. ''It goes to show how far consumer attitudes have changed over the past years,'' he said.
In the United States, rice producers are at pains to say they realize the politics of the rice market, but that some easing is long overdue. The U.S.A. Rice Federation, which conducts sporadic taste tests in Tokyo, has said that most consumers here cannot tell the difference between homegrown and imported rice.
''We'd simply like to see demand dictate where U.S. rice goes, not the government,'' said Robert Cummings, chief operating officer at the U.S.A. Rice Federation.
For farmers in and around Fukushima, the interest in foreign rice could not have come at a worse time. Last year, farmers there were just gearing up to plant a new variety of premium-grade rice, bred over 15 years from two top domestic rice strains and proudly named Ten No Tsubu, or the ''Grain From Heaven.''
Agricultural officials had hoped the new variety would tap into the country's traditional penchant for high-grade rice.
But in March 2011, three tsunami-stricken nuclear reactors went into meltdown, rendering more than 18,000 acres of Fukushima farmland unusable. At harvest time, some of the rice was found to be contaminated, dashing hopes of a big debut.
''This rice we have is the best rice ever, yet I'm full of worry,'' said one farmer, Katsuyuki Kuchiki, who says his family has cultivated grain about 40 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant for nine generations. His harvest last year of the new rice tested negative for radioactive matter like cesium, and made it to market -- but at prices far lower than he had imagined.
This year, the region's farmers sprinkled their fields with cesium-absorbing materials, and intend to bump up Grain From Heaven production twentyfold. Regional officials will test every sack for radiation, using 3 billion yen's worth of new screening equipment. ''We're doing everything we possibly can to make sure the rice is safe,'' Mr. Kuchiki said.
Still, their efforts may be lost on Japanese consumers. Though authorities assure consumers that homegrown rice is safe, there is widespread unease about rice grown in and around the disaster-struck region.
A broader concern is Japan's deflationary economy, which has chipped away at incomes over the last decade and made consumers less wedded to expensive brands. A study last year by the Japan-Cooperative General Research Institute, which is affiliated with the country's national agricultural cooperative, shows a jump in sales of low-grade domestic rice and a decline for more expensive brands.
Experts say that younger and less affluent shoppers in particular are looking for low-cost alternatives. Also contributing to the trend is a move away from rice itself, especially among younger Japanese, as the traditional fish-and-rice diet gives way to bread, pasta and pizza. Per capita, the Japanese now eat half the amount of rice they ate in the 1960s.
''Continued deflation means incomes are falling, and so more Japanese are becoming not so picky about rice,'' said Yasuhiro Fujimoto, chief researcher at the institute.
That could test Japan's heavy-handed support of its rice farmers, which has obliged consumers to buy domestic rice at many times global prices.
Until recently, domestic consumers had seemingly been happy with the arrangement, paying up to 5,000 yen, about $62, for a 10-kilogram bag of Japonica, the sticky, short-grain rice favored here -- almost 10 times the going rate globally for the more common, long-grain variety.
Even when a poor harvest caused a supply squeeze and forced Japan to import rice on an emergency basis in 1993, many consumers turned up their noses.
But nearly 20 years later, Seiyu Walmart, Beisia, Matsuya and Kappa Create all said that they had heard few complaints from customers about their foreign rice.
''It turns out most customers didn't mind, or even notice,'' said Tetsuji Tanaka, a spokesman for Matsuya.

HEADLINE: Widespread Drought Is Likely to Worsen

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; Monica Davey contributed reporting from Chicago, Mashid Mohadjerin from Augusta, Kan., and Joanna M. Foster from New York.

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The drought that has settled over more than half of the continental United States this summer is the most widespread in more than half a century. And it is likely to grow worse.
The latest outlook released by the National Weather Service on Thursday forecasts increasingly dry conditions over much of the nation's breadbasket, a development that could lead to higher food prices and shipping costs as well as reduced revenues in areas that count on summer tourism. About the only relief in sight was tropical activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast that could bring rain to parts of the South.
The unsettling prospects come at a time of growing uncertainty for the country's economy. With evidence mounting of a slowdown in the economic recovery, this new blow from the weather is particularly ill-timed.
Already some farmers are watching their cash crops burn to the point of no return. Others have been cutting their corn early to use for feed, a much less profitable venture. 
''It really is a crisis. I don't think we've ever seen anything like this in my lifetime,'' Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois said after touring ravaged farms in the southern part of the state.
The government has declared one-third of the nation's counties -- 1,297 of them across 29 states -- federal disaster areas as a result of the drought, which will allow farmers to apply for low-interest loans to get them through the disappointing growing season.
''It's got the potential to be the worst drought we've ever had in Arkansas,'' said Butch Calhoun, the state's secretary of agriculture. ''It's going to be very detrimental to our economy.''
What is particularly striking about this dry spell is its breadth. Fifty-five percent of the continental United States -- from California to Arkansas, Texas to North Dakota -- is under moderate to extreme drought, according to the government, the largest such area since December 1956. An analysis released on Thursday by the United States Drought Monitor showed that 88 percent of corn and 87 percent of soybean crops in the country were in drought-stricken regions, a 10 percent jump from a week before. Corn and soybean prices reached record highs on Thursday, with corn closing just over $8.07 a bushel and soybeans trading as high as $17.49.
As of Sunday, more than half of the corn in seven states was in poor or very poor condition, according to the Department of Agriculture. In Kentucky, Missouri and Indiana, that figure is above 70 percent. Over all, only 31 percent of the nation's corn is in good to excellent condition, compared with 66 percent at the same time last year.
''We're expecting significant reductions in production potential yield, potential for corn and soybeans in particular,'' said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the Department of Agriculture.
The withering corn has increased feed prices and depleted available feeding land, putting stress on cattle farmers. A record 54 percent of pasture and rangeland -- where cattle feed or where hay is harvested for feeding -- was in poor or very poor condition, according to the Department of Agriculture. Many farmers have been forced to sell their animals.
Because feed can account for nearly half of a cattle farmer's costs, consumers could see a rise in the price of meat and dairy products, experts said. The high sustained heat has led the key components in milk, like fat and protein, to plummet more than usual, said Chris Galen, a spokesman for National Milk Producers Federation.
''This is due to cows eating less dry matter, and drinking more water ... which tends to thin out the resulting milk output,'' he said in an e-mail. ''So, if you're a cheese maker, you need to use a little more milk to get the same volume of cheese output.''
Still, this year's drought is not expected to be as rough on Midwestern agriculture as the one in 1988. Corn yields were 22 percent under trend that year, and this year the Department of Agriculture is projecting yields 11 percent under trend -- ''though that could change in August,'' said Joseph W. Glauber, the department's chief economist.
Many also believe that farmers are better situated this year to handle the impact of a drought than they were two decades ago. More than 80 percent of corn and soybeans are estimated to be insured, Mr. Glauber said.
Last year, crop insurers paid a record $11 billion in indemnity payments, and that ''should serve as a good model for what farmers can expect this year,'' Tom Zacharias, the president of National Crop Insurance Services, said in a news release.
But the impact of this drought has extended beyond farming. In Missouri, the torrid conditions have sparked forest fires that resemble the types of wildfires seen in the West. Already, 117 wildfires have burned in Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest, a record-setting pace. Conditions have been so dry that there was a report of hay in a barn combusting on its own.
Meanwhile, water levels are falling in town reservoirs as well as major waterways like the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Barge and towboat operators have been reducing the size of their loads because of the low water, said Ann M. McCulloch, a spokeswoman for the American Waterways Operators. This means shipping operators, who transport a variety of goods from crops to gravel, have had to take more trips, increasing transportation costs that could be passed on to consumers.
Officials in Augusta, Kan., estimate that they have 110 days worth of water that they can draw from a nearby reservoir. The primary reservoir used for their municipal water supply dropped too low last year, the result of a drought in the area that started two years ago, said Josh Shaw, the assistant to the city manager. Indianapolis has put restrictions on water use; south of the city, Johnson County banned smoking at the county fair.
In Colorado, there is concern that the drought could damage forage that deer, elk and other game feed on in the fall. But the state also has seen advantages from the drought. Lower water levels have been helpful for fly fishing, and, with fewer places for animals to drink water, they will likely gather in concentrated areas, making conditions better for hunting.
And one Indianapolis painter is making the best of the situation, according to The Indianapolis Star, by starting a new arm of his business: painting brown lawns green.

HEADLINE: Less Trading At Morgan; Revenue Slips 24%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
5:30 p.m. Updated
While many banks are getting battered by the trading slump, Morgan Stanley is feeling the pain more acutely.
On Thursday, the bank reported a 24 percent drop in revenue for the second quarter, driven by a significant decline in bond, currency and commodity trading.
Wall Street banks have faced a largely inhospitable environment in recent years, racked by economic uncertainty, the European debt crisis and a new regulatory system. But Morgan Stanley has been trying to navigate the market while also working to transform itself by shedding riskier businesses and building its steadier wealth management arm. 
The bank had started to show signs of improvement in previous quarters, but then it got buffeted by the recent trading downdraft. For the quarter, Morgan Stanley reported that earnings came in at 29 cents a share, widely missing the 43 cents a share that analysts had expected. It posted a loss in the same period of 2011.
The bank also faced the repercussions from a recent credit rating downgrade. The bank was forced to post $2.9 billion in additional money to back its trades in the quarter, after Moody's Investors Service cut its rating by two notches.
The results spooked investors. On a day when the market was up, shares of Morgan Stanley fell as much as 7 percent before recovering slightly to finish the day down 5.3 percent at $13.25.
Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura, wrote in a research note that it was ''hard to pick out too many positives'' from the firm's quarterly results.
And Howard Chen of Credit Suisse described the quarter in a report to investors as ''weak and disappointing.''
As the bank looks to bolster its profit, Morgan Stanley has taken steps to clamp down on expenses and head count. On Thursday, James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive, said that the firm expected to shrink its employee base by 7 percent by the end of the year.
The firm is also seeking to cut other expenses, including by moving some staff to cheaper locations like Baltimore and Glasgow, and being more selective in filling positions.
''Although global economic uncertainty remains a headwind, we are proactively positioning the firm for success,'' Mr. Gorman said in a statement. ''We continue to be focused on taking the necessary steps to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.''
Even so, the bank faced headwinds, particularly in trading. In fixed income, Morgan Stanley has tried to simply its offerings, moving away from complicated and capital-intensive products that can prove risky in tough environments.
But the ''challenging macro backdrop'' weighed on profits, Ruth Porat, the bank's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
With the European debt crisis heating up, investors became increasingly uncertain and trading volume plummeted. Revenue in fixed income fell by 60 percent in the second quarter, to $770 million, a drop that outstrips competitors.
Morgan Stanley is also dealing with the fallout from the credit downgrade. In February, Moody's put big banks on warning, with Morgan Stanley facing a potential three-notch downgrade.
Some clients pulled back, as they waited for Moody's to complete its review, Ms. Porat said.
It only added to the bank's pain that the rating agency delayed the results, she added. In June, Moody's ended up cutting the firm's rating by two levels.
''As the month wore on, clients took a wait-and-see attitude,'' she said. ''Time was not our friend.''
Other businesses suffered as well. Advisory revenue was halved from the year-ago period, to $263 million, as fewer corporations pursued mergers or sales of stocks and bonds.
Still, Mr. Gorman highlighted the division's performance, pointing to big mandates like leading Facebook's initial public offering. (The firm has defended its work taking Facebook public, but the social networking company's stock has fallen 24 percent since the initial public offering in May.)
Morgan Stanley did have one area that posted a gain, the global wealth management group that now includes Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. The unit reported a 23 percent gain in pretax income, to $393 million, although net revenue declined slightly.
The weakness is reducing its profitability. The bank's return on equity now stands at 3.5 percent, down from 12.2 percent in 2010. Goldman Sachs, one of the firm's competitors, said this week that its 5.4 percent return on equity was ''unacceptable.''
Revenue in Morgan Stanley's second quarter was $6.95 billion, down from $9.2 billion.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: July 19, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the drop in Morgan Stanley's revenue as 35 percent, not 24 percent.

HEADLINE: Obama Visits Florida to Win Over Older Voters

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and TRIP GABRIEL; Peter Baker reported from West Palm Beach, and Trip Gabriel from Boston.

 BODY:
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Obama opened a two-day campaign swing through Florida on Thursday as he tried to build support in this deadlocked battleground state by presenting his opponent, Mitt Romney, as a bad choice for older Americans.
After weeks of focusing on Mr. Romney's private-sector business deals, Mr. Obama turned to another front by attacking Republican plans to repeal his health care law and transform Medicare into a voucher program. Democrats have long used Medicare as an issue to galvanize older voters in Florida against Republicans. 
''He plans to turn Medicare into a voucher program,'' Mr. Obama told supporters at a retirement community here. ''If the voucher isn't worth what it takes to buy health insurance in the private marketplace, you're out of luck, you've got to make up the difference, you're on your own.''
Mr. Obama continued: ''How many people think that's a good idea? To finance tax cuts for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them? So Florida, that is wrong. It's wrong to ask you to pay more for Medicare so people who are doing well right now get even more.''
Mr. Romney's campaign called the president's statements ''dishonest attacks'' that mischaracterized his plans for Medicare. The Republican candidate gave three interviews to Florida radio stations to counter the president's visit.
''The president is extraordinarily out of touch with how America's economy works and with how individuals pursuing their dreams in this country have built America,'' he told a Tampa station. ''The president thinks that it's government that should take responsibility for all the successful businesses in this country.''
Mr. Obama's trip to Florida is his seventh of the year. He stopped in Jacksonville and West Palm Beach on Thursday and travels to Fort Myers and Orlando on Friday.
The Obama campaign is so intent on winning Florida and its electoral votes that it began opening offices here more than a year ago and in recent weeks showed millions of dollars of advertisements in the state. But while Mr. Obama won Florida in 2008, he remains effectively tied with Mr. Romney.
A poll conducted for The Miami Herald, The Tampa Bay Times and other news organizations last week found that 46 percent of likely Florida voters support Mr. Obama, and 45 percent support Mr. Romney. Particularly worrisome for the president: more Florida voters than not believe his policies have made the economy worse and want his health care law repealed.
Matthew T. Corrigan, a political scientist at the University of North Florida, said Mr. Obama has the advantages of incumbency and early organization while Mr. Romney has momentum from the economy. ''It's conceivable for the president to lose Florida and have other ways to go,'' he said. ''But I think for Romney, it's a must-win state.''
Mr. Obama's focus on older Americans reflects both their power in Florida and the president's troubles attracting them. Voters 65 and over represented 22 percent of the Florida electorate in 2008, compared with 16 percent nationally. But many are skeptical of Mr. Obama's health care law and plans for Medicare after Republicans have attacked Democrats for shifting money from the program to pay for the new health law.
''Democrats are focusing on that because Republicans have made inroads with seniors in Florida and it's not the reliably Democratic voting bloc it used to be,'' Mr. Corrigan said.
Democrats insisted Mr. Obama will prevail. ''What's unique about Florida,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, ''is we have demographic groups that I think are going to be particularly moved by the dramatic contrast between Mitt Romney's record and his proposals, and President Obama's record and the direction he wants to continue to move this country in.''
At both stops Thursday, Mr. Obama pressed the argument that Mr. Romney's plans would hurt older Americans. Older Floridians saved an average of $600 last year on prescription drug costs because the Obama health care law helped close the so-called doughnut hole in coverage, according to the Obama campaign. The law also helped seniors with free preventive care and annual wellness visits.
The president took aim at Mr. Romney's support for a plan to overhaul Medicare by providing recipients vouchers to obtain health care insurance on the private market. Mr. Obama argued vouchers would never cover the full price, costing older Americans more than $6,000 a year. The Romney campaign called that a distortion and pointed to PolitiFact, an independent fact-checking operation that has deemed Mr. Obama's claim ''mostly false.'' Mr. Romney's aides also noted Mr. Obama used $500 billion in Medicare savings to pay for his health care law.
For his part, Mr. Romney spent the day in Massachusetts, where he visited Middlesex Truck and Coach in Boston to attack Mr. Obama again for saying that successful business owners did not get there without government help.
''Now I know that some people think what the president said was just a gaffe,'' Mr. Romney said. ''It wasn't a gaffe. It was instead his ideology.''
Brian Maloney, 69, who has been in business since 1980, was an ideal embodiment of Mr. Romney's message. ''I take umbrage at the suggestion that people don't start and build businesses,'' he said. ''I started out with 50 bucks and worked with my hands to afford grad school at night.'' Government, he added, brought only complicated regulations: ''It's overbearing.''
Two local politicians showed up to undercut Mr. Romney's message. ''I'm very happy that former Governor Romney found his way here,'' said Tito Jackson, a city councilman from the area, which is largely black and Hispanic. ''But you know what? He didn't create jobs when he was governor. He didn't find himself in this community that often.''
Mr. Romney, whose campaign mastered such tactics during the Republican primaries, brushed off the protest.
''Oh, that's the nature of politics,'' he told the business owner. ''There are always two teams. We're always bothering each other's teams.''

HEADLINE: As Chaos Grows in Syria, Worries Grow on the Sidelines

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK and ROD NORDLAND; Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rod Nordland from Cairo. Mai Ayyad contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Gone is the talk here that last year's Arab Spring was a gift from God.
Now some in Iran are even starting to worry about how much might be at stake if President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, long a client state of Iran's, collapses -- which after a fifth day on Thursday of heavy street fighting in Damascus no longer sounds inconceivable.
The fall of the Assad government would remove Shiite Iran's last and most valued foothold in the Arab world, and its opening to the Mediterranean. It would give Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states their long-sought goal of countering Iranian influence in the region, finally splitting the alliance between Tehran and Damascus that has lasted for decades. And it would further erode Iran's role as a patron of the Middle East's revolutionaries, a goal that moderate Arabs and the United States have long sought.
Already the militant Palestinian group Hamas, long dependent on Syria and Iran, has thrown its support behind the Syrians in the streets seeking Mr. Assad's overthrow. 
Worse might follow, from Tehran's point of view. Iran and Syria's last revolutionary ally, the Hezbollah party that dominates Lebanon, would lose one of its main sources of weapons and financial support. And Lebanon's fragile sectarian balance might be torn apart, raising the threat of another civil war there.
On Wednesday, Hezbollah quickly responded to the government's worst day so far to make its strongest declaration that it would not abandon Mr. Assad.
In a televised address on Wednesday night, the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, offered eloquent condolences for the deaths of the three high-ranking Syrian officials killed earlier in the day. ''These martyr leaders were comrades in arms in the conflict with the Israeli enemy, and we are confident that the Arab Syrian Army, which overcame the unbearable, will be able to persist and crush the hopes of the enemies,'' he said.
He credited Mr. Assad and his government with the victory that Hezbollah claimed against Israel in the 2006 war in Lebanon and with saving Gaza during the 2009 Israeli incursion. ''The most valuable weapons we had in our possession were from Syria,'' he said. ''The missiles we used in the second Lebanon war were made in Syria. And it's not only in Lebanon but in Gaza as well. Where did these missiles come from? The Saudi regime? The Egyptian regime? These missiles are from Syria.''
It was a stunning testament, said Fawaz A. Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. ''For Hezbollah, it is a point of no return now,'' he said. With the speech, ''Hezbollah made it very clear that there is an umbilical cord between the Syrian regime and Hezbollah, and this umbilical cord is existential. They are, as he said, comrades in arms.''
Iran, too, has been staunch in its support of Syria, whose ruling Alawite minority belong to a branch of Shiite Islam, the predominant faith in Iran. Tehran continues to provide Mr. Assad with economic and public support, and it might be sending military assistance as well.
But some voices inside Iran are worried about the awkward position imposed on anyone who supports Mr. Assad against what seems like an increasingly popular and widespread uprising.
''We are supporting some uprisings and ignoring others,'' said Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a Middle East analyst based in Tehran. ''Arab people do not believe us anymore. We come across as antagonists, following our political agenda.''
The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran was once a model for the region, but the Arab world's revolutionaries now look to Egypt, he said, with its experiment in democratizing an Islamic society. ''Instead of gaining influence, we are witnessing the emergence of new powerful countries that in the future could pose a challenge to us,'' Mr. Shamsolvaezin said.
A year ago, Hossein Alaei, a former admiral in the Revolutionary Guards, predicted on the Web site Irandiplomacy that ''ideally'' Mr. Assad would survive. ''But this ideal might not be fulfilled,'' Mr. Alaei wrote. ''We should think of other ways to protect our national security.''
Iran's unrelenting support for Syria has cost it other friends in the region, as the Arab Spring gives aspiring young rebels a model other than the revolution of Iran's elderly ayatollahs. Most Arabs are Sunnis rather than Shiites. Beginning in February, the leadership of Hamas, which had long enjoyed a friendly exile in Damascus and military support from Iran, began moving to Qatar and other havens and publicly expressed support for Syria's revolutionaries. With Iran hampered and hurt financially by Western sanctions, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have proven to be more helpful and better-financed allies.
The Nasrallah speech tried to make it seem ''as if nothing had happened since then, as if the Arab Spring did not happen,'' said Sami Nader, an analyst and a professor of international relations at St. Joseph University in Beirut.
''This is the most important transformation in the history of the Arab world,'' Mr. Nader said, ''and it is proving that Islam and democracy are compatible.''
The speech was in effect an acknowledgment of how completely Hezbollah depends on the Assad government's survival. ''He is telling them he is not going to leave Assad alone,'' said Sarkis Naoum, a columnist for An-Nahar in Beirut, ''that by protecting Assad he will be protecting his party, himself and his community, and also the interests of Syria and Iran.''
Mr. Naoum said he worried about what would happen in Lebanon if the Syrian government collapsed, or descended further into sectarian conflict. Many sectarian fault lines in Syria -- Alawites and Christians versus Sunnis, for instance -- are mirrored in Lebanon, which has large Christian, Alawite and Sunni minorities of its own. Already, there have been conflicts between Alawites and Sunnis in northern Lebanon. Hezbollah has refrained from any action that would threaten strife, but that may change, Mr. Naoum suggested.
''If it feels threatened by chaos in Syria, or even Assad's regime collapses, it will have to take action inside Lebanon, at least to paralyze those who are working with the rebels, especially in the north,'' he said.
''It is a lose-lose situation for Hezbollah,'' he said. ''Either they stay on what most Arabs would say is the wrong side of history, or they abandon an ally that links them with the rest of the Shiite world and find themselves isolated.''
An Assad victory would change that thinking, of course, and Mr. Nasrallah professed confidence. ''We are confident that the Syrian Army, which has had to cope with the intolerable, has the ability, determination and resolve to endure and foil the enemies' hopes,'' he said.
That, too, is the prevailing official view in Tehran, which has its own example of successfully repressing popular dissent, after the 2009 elections. ''Have no doubt, Assad's regime will survive,'' said Hamid Reza Taraghi, an Iranian foreign policy expert and a politician whose views are close to the Iranian government's.
Mr. Shamsolvaezin was not so sure. ''We were popular some years ago, but our ethical decisions have made a crisis for us,'' he said. ''We hoped all in the region would turn away from the U.S. Now, we should be careful they do not turn their backs on us.''

HEADLINE: Where Obama Shines

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
It won't help him win many votes this year, but it should be noted that Barack Obama has been a good foreign policy president. He, Vice President Joseph Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the rest of his team have created a style of policy making that is flexible, incremental and well adapted to the specific circumstances of this moment. Following a foreign policy hedgehog, Obama's been a pretty effective fox.
Some eras call for bold doctrines, new global architecture and ''Present at the Creation'' moments. This is not one of those eras. Today, the world is like a cocktail party at which everybody is suffering from indigestion or some other internal ailment. People are interacting with each other, but they're mostly focused on the godawful stuff going on inside. Europe has the euro mess. The Middle East has the Arab Spring. The U.S. has the economic stagnation and the debt. The Chinese have their perpetual growth and stability issues. 
It's not multi-polarity; it's multi-problemarity. As a result, this is more of an age of anxiety than of straight-up conflict. Leaders are looking around warily at who might make their problems better and who might make them worse. There are fewer close alliances and fewer sworn enemies. There are more circumstances in which nations are ambiguously attached.
In this environment, you don't need big, bold visionaries. You need leaders who will pay minute attention to the unique details and fleeting properties of each region's specific circumstances. You need people who can improvise, shift and play it by ear. Obama, Clinton and the rest are well suited to these sorts of tasks.
Obama has shown a good ability to combine a realist, power-politics mind-set with a warm appreciation of democracy and human rights. Early in his term, he responded poorly to the street marches in Tehran. But his administration has embraced a freedom agenda more aggressively since then, responding fairly well to the Arab Spring, rejecting those who wanted to stand by the collapsing dictatorships and using American power in a mostly successful humanitarian intervention in Libya.
Obama has also shown an impressive ability to learn along the way. He came into office trying to dialogue with dictators in Iran and North Korea. When that didn't work, he learned his lesson and has been much more confrontational since. Early in his term, he tried nation-building in Afghanistan. When that, unfortunately, didn't work, he scaled back that effort.
Obama has managed ambiguity well. This is most important in the case of China. When the Chinese military was overly aggressive, he stood up to China and reasserted America's permanent presence in the Pacific. At the same time, it's misleading to say there is a single China policy. There are myriad China policies on myriad fronts, some of which are confrontational and some of which are collaborative.
Obama has also dealt with uncertainty pretty well. No one knows what will happen if Israel or the U.S. strikes Iran's nuclear facilities. Confronted with that shroud of ignorance, Obama has properly pushed back the moment of decision-making for as long as possible, just in case anything positive turns up. This has meant performing a delicate dance -- pressing Israelis to push back their timetable while, at the same time, embracing their goals. The period of delay may be ending, but it's been useful so far.
Obama has also managed the tension between multilateral and unilateral action. No one can say he is hesitant to work with coalitions. Look at the Libyan action, or the Iranian sanctions. But when it comes to decimating Al Qaeda, the U.S. has been quite willing to go it alone, continuing and expanding many policies of George W. Bush.
There have been failures on Obama's watch, of course. Some of these flow from executive hubris. Obama believed that he could help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. He proceeded clumsily, pushed everybody into a corner and now peace is farther away than ever.
Some failures flow from excessive politicization. An inexcusable blunder by Obama was to announce the withdrawal date from Afghanistan at the same time he announced the surge into Afghanistan. That may have kept the Democratic base happy, but it sent thousands of soldiers and Marines on a mission that was doomed to fail.
Over all, though, the record is impressive. Obama has moved more aggressively both to defeat enemies and to champion democracy. He has demonstrated that talk of American decline is hooey. The U.S. is still responsible for maintaining global order, for keeping people, goods and ideas moving freely.
And, partly as a result of his efforts, the world of foreign affairs is relatively uncontentious right now. Foreign policy is not a hot campaign issue. Mitt Romney is having a great deal of trouble identifying profound disagreements. If that's not a sign of success, I don't know what is.

HEADLINE: Friction at the U.N. as Russia and China Veto Another Resolution on Syria Sanctions

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Diplomatic efforts at the United Nations Security Council to address the Syria crisis suffered a potentially fatal blow on Thursday when Russia and China vetoed a British-sponsored resolution that would have punished the Syrian government with economic sanctions for failing to carry out a peace plan.
It was the third time that Russia and China had vetoed resolutions on Syria since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began, and the collegial atmosphere in the Council chambers was tinged with bitterness and acrimony afterward. 
The British ambassador, Sir Mark Lyall Grant, told the Council after the vote, which was broadcast live on the United Nations' Web site, that Britain was ''appalled by the decision of Russia and China to veto this resolution aimed at ending the bloodshed in Syria.''
Speaking to reporters later outside the Council's chambers, Sir Mark said, ''Frankly, it is impossible to understand why China and Russia felt it necessary to veto this text.''
Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador, also angrily denounced the vetoes. ''We have missed yet another critical opportunity to work together,'' she told the Council. Ms. Rice called it a ''dark day.''
Asked later what the vote signified, Ms. Rice said, ''The message it sends is that two permanent members of the Council are prepared to defend Assad to the bitter end.''
Russia and China, embittered by Security Council actions last year that led to Western military intervention in Libya and the downfall of its longtime leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, are intent on avoiding a repeat in Syria. They have consistently objected to any resolutions concerning Syria that would impose sanctions or criticize Mr. Assad for his efforts to crush an increasingly violent rebellion against his family's four-decade hold on power. Russia, Mr. Assad's most important foreign backer, has also accused the West of funneling support to Mr. Assad's opponents.
Eleven Security Council members, including the other three permanent members -- Britain, France and the United States -- voted for the resolution. Pakistan and South Africa abstained.
The Security Council vote leaves in doubt the future of a 300-member United Nations mission in Syria that was sent to monitor the peace plan, which was negotiated by Kofi Annan, the special envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League.
Mr. Annan's plan calls for a cease-fire, with the Syrian government taking the first step by halting the use of heavy weapons against the opposition. The plan also would create the basis for a political transition.
In a statement, Mr. Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said that Mr. Annan was ''disappointed that, at this critical stage, the U.N. Security Council could not unite and take the strong and concerted action he had urged and hoped for.''
The Security Council's authorization of the monitoring mission expires on Friday. Both Britain and Pakistan submitted new draft resolutions on Thursday that would authorize an extension.
But Ms. Rice, for one, signaled that the United States objected to any further extension of the monitors, whose work in Syria was suspended more than a month ago because conditions there were so dangerous. With no cease-fire to monitor, she said, a further extension ''doesn't make any sense.''
Still, she said, the United States might consider ''a final brief extension of the mission, if it allows the monitors to withdraw safely.''
The pressure on the Security Council to take action against Syria has been mounting steadily, and several members have said that the credibility of the United Nations would be at risk if the Council failed to take a decisive step.
The resolution vetoed by Russia and China on Thursday would have given Mr. Assad 10 days to put the peace plan -- which Mr. Assad accepted three months ago but has basically ignored -- into effect. The resolution would have imposed economic sanctions on the Syrian government under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter. That section of the charter also allows for military intervention to enforce Security Council demands.
''We simply cannot accept a document under Chapter 7, one which would open the path for pressure of sanctions and further to external military involvement in Syrian domestic affairs,'' the Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, told the Council in explaining the Russian veto.
Mr. Churkin had his own reply to Western critics of Russia's position. What they really want, he told reporters outside the Council chambers, is Mr. Assad's downfall because that would severely weaken the influence of Iran, Syria's only ally in the region.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Firebrand Faces Election Challenge in a New Swing District in Florida

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
DELRAY BEACH, Fla. -- Not far from the beach, Representative Allen B. West recited the Declaration of Independence at a sweltering Fourth of July fair, lobbing the sentences into the crowd and hoping the gravitas of the words would sink in.
Mr. West, a Republican positioned near the top of the Democrats' knockout list, is fond of letting words speak for themselves -- no parsing, no apologizing, no backtracking. In this era of survey-tested language, he is a verbal street brawler, unflinching in his speech, a trait that has won him the adulation (and the campaign contributions) of conservatives and Tea Party supporters who cheer on his every Westism. He is one of the top fund-raisers among House Republicans, rivaling Speaker John A. Boehner.
''People are looking for leadership,'' said Mr. West, 51, a first-term congressman, in a brief interview as supporters posed for photographs and exchanged a few words. ''Principles, pragmatism, passion and leadership: It's obvious we are representing those values.'' 
Despite his celebrity and prodigious fund-raising, Mr. West, who announced he would run in a new district this year, faces a serious challenge in November. The question for Democrats is this: Will Mr. West's conservative stance and unbridled style pass muster with a new set of Florida voters in a swing district that is evenly split? In that race, Mr. West is likely to face Patrick Murphy, 30, a Democrat and political neophyte who is shaping up to be a potent force.
Democrats are banking that in a presidential election year, Mr. West will fail to sway enough independent-minded voters to win in November. They view the newly created 18th Congressional District on the Treasure Coast as one of six possible Democratic gains in Florida. Impressed with Mr. Murphy's fund-raising, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put its financial and organizational strength behind him.
Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, said the race would hinge largely on turnout. At the moment, President Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, are neck-and-neck in Florida.
As for Mr. West's penchant for controversy and his conservative voting record, it is too early to gauge its impact on the race. But he runs the risk of turning off at least some potential voters at a time when the Tea Party's influence in Florida has encountered a backlash, said Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University.
Professor Jewett said, ''The danger for West is appearing that he is more interested in headlines and bombast and not as interested in representing voters in the district in a solid conventional way.'' He added: ''When he won two years ago, he seemed like a breath of fresh air to a lot of the voters down there who were anxious to send a message that they were dissatisfied with President Obama. Now that he has been in office for two years, his act may be wearing a little thin.''
Both candidates face primary opponents but are expected to win the races handily.
This year, Mr. West learned that with a squiggle here and a slash there, his original Congressional district in Broward and Palm Beach Counties had become far less hospitable to conservative Republicans. He jumped a step north, declaring he would run in a new swing district encompassing St. Lucie County, Martin County and a slice of northern Palm Beach County.
Mr. Murphy, who was intent on defeating Mr. West, also shuffled north and rechallenged him. The newly drawn 18th Congressional District voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and for Alex Sink, the Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor, in 2010. In 2004, George W. Bush won with 51 percent.
Campaign handicappers have said that Mr. West is trying to modulate his tone; his first campaign ad, while staying true to his views, is sedate by his standards.
But Mr. West, who is fond of holding town hall meetings, said that while he is plunging into local issues, his principles are unshaken and portable. ''Why would you change your principles?'' he said. ''They fit in no matter where.''
Bill Paterson, the chairman of the Republican Party in St. Lucie County, where there are more Democrats than Republicans, said Mr. West would have little trouble hooking Republicans in that county. Mr. West, a retired Army officer, has a conservative voting record but has sometimes broken from the party line.
''So many people want a breath of fresh air,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''He is going to tell you the truth, whether you like it or not. His message doesn't change based on the group he is talking to.''
In his whirlwind first term as a congressman and one of only two black Republicans in the House, Mr. West has said flat-out that as many as 80 House Democrats are Communists. He has remarked that the Democratic Party would do the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proud with its use of ''lies and deceits.'' He has called people with Obama bumper stickers a ''threat to the gene pool.'' Recently, he said that President Obama wants Americans ''to be his slave and be economically dependent on him.''
Later, on Fox News, he said the rise in the number of people on Social Security disability since 2009 merely stokes economic dependency, ''which, to me, is a form of modern, 21st-century slavery.'' Mindful that Mr. West's new district is teeming with retirees, Democrats delighted in hearing the words ''Social Security'' and ''slavery'' in the same sentence and quickly publicized it.
His words, no matter how raw, steer donations his way from around the country. He raised $2.2 million for the quarter, one of the highest tallies in the country, and has $3.7 million on hand.
This election cycle, he has raised nearly $10 million, a huge number for the House. Mr. Murphy raised more than $500,000 this quarter and $2.2 million so far this election cycle; he has nearly $1.3 million on hand.
As for the race, Mr. West's campaign has described Mr. Murphy as a cookie-cutter Democrat with little experience.
''At this point in time, Murphy is running a negative campaign to raise liberal money,'' said Tim Edson, Mr. West's campaign manager. ''No issues. No substance. Just negative attacks.''
It is true that Mr. Murphy has tapped into voters who strongly dislike Mr. West. An accountant who graduated from the University of Miami, Mr. Murphy is vice president of Coastal Environmental Services, which specializes in disaster relief and environmental cleanup, including the BP oil spill. The company is affiliated with a large construction company run by his family.
''There are people saying, 'I don't care who you are, but you are better than Allen West,' '' he said. ''It's truly a moderate district.''
Mr. Murphy, a Florida native, said he decided to challenge Mr. West because he was angry about the partisan gridlock in Washington. Mr. West, he said, epitomizes the bottleneck.
''It's about getting something done,'' said Mr. Murphy, who calls himself progressive on social issues and more moderate on fiscal issues. ''The first thing I want to do when I get to Congress is have dinner with a Republican.''

HEADLINE: London Fund-Raisers Put Romney in a Scandal's Glare

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They were envisioned as low-key, across-the-pond fund-raisers that would allow Mitt Romney to extract campaign cash from expatriates in London by night as he played statesman by day.
But the two receptions that Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, will hold for donors next week during a swing through Europe are turning into an ill-timed public relations headache for him.
Several of the events' hosts are top executives at banks tied to the interest rate-fixing scandal that is now engulfing London's financial and political world, linking Mr. Romney, however superficially, to a messy moment in the continuing debate over Wall Street excesses. 
The British and American authorities are examining the role of more than 10 banks in the possible manipulation of key interest rates that affected how consumers and companies borrowed money around the world.
The former chief executive and a top lobbyist for Barclays, the bank at the center of the scandal, helped organize a Romney fund-raiser. The former chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., has since withdrawn his name as the event's co-host. The bank's lobbyist, Patrick J. Durkin, remains a co-chairman: he has bundled $1.1 million for Mr. Romney from friends and business associates, more than any other lobbyist, according to federal records.
In late June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to resolve accusations that it had tried to manipulate rates to benefit its bottom line. Shortly after, Mr. Diamond resigned from his position.
In a sign of just how politicized the scandal has become, 11 members of Parliament recently signed a resolution, naming Mr. Romney, that called for Barclays executives to ''cease fund-raising for political candidates'' and focus on rebuilding consumer confidence in the banking system.
Soliciting donations abroad, as exotic as it sounds, is by no means new. Election laws permit candidates to accept contributions from citizens living outside the United States, and John McCain and Barack Obama did so.
Barclays was the ninth-biggest source of contributions to Mr. Romney's campaign either directly or through his joint fund-raising effort with the Republican National Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with employees contributing $234,650 through the end of May.
But Democrats may be loath to draw attention to Mr. Romney's donations from big banks like Barclays. Employees of the bank have contributed $34,800 to Mr. Obama and his joint effort with the Democratic National Committee. (Mr. Obama does not allow registered lobbyists to bundle for his campaign.)
This month, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. attended a fund-raiser in Park City, Utah, co-hosted by Mark Gilbert, a top executive at Barclays, who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mr. Obama's re-election bid.
Representatives of the Romney and Obama campaigns declined to comment.
Besides Barclays, executives at several banks under investigation, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, are co-chairmen for the Romney fund-raisers in London.
Mr. Romney appeared to take all the normal precautions for his events in London: an invitation to one of the fund-raisers reminds guests that they ''must provide copy of U.S. Passport.''
Still, any ties to the firms under investigation could detract from a trip intended to highlight Mr. Romney's history with the Olympics. Mr. Romney, who ran the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, plans to attend the opening ceremonies for the 2012 Games next Friday.
What is more, it may give ammunition to his left-wing critics, since Mr. Romney has railed against Wall Street regulation, like the Dodd-Frank Act.
Despite the controversy, the co-host of one fund-raiser, Karl Dasher, said there was ''strong excitement'' for Romney among expatriates in London.
Republican fund-raisers described the London receptions as a case of awkward timing, noting that scrutiny of presidential donors always intensifies when a company is under investigation.
''You want to make sure that you don't wind up with egg on your face because you got some money from some guy who pulled a stunt. But you can't screen everybody that writes your check,'' said Alfred Hoffman Jr., a Florida developer who is a top Republican fund-raiser but is not raising money for the Romney campaign. ''You do the best you can -- you make sure that they're an American citizen.''

HEADLINE: Fund-Raiser for Obama To Leave Post at UBS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
One of President Obama's biggest supporters on Wall Street is about to leave his perch at UBS, one of the world's largest banks.
Robert Wolf, who is the UBS chairman for the Americas, is leaving at the end of the month to set up his own advisory shop. He will retain close ties to UBS, which will be the first client of his firm.
A 28-year veteran of Wall Street, Mr. Wolf has enjoyed his status as a prominent defender of the Obama administration and a top-ranking fund-raiser. He has garnered more than $500,000 to re-elect the president this year, and regularly plays golf and vacations with Mr. Obama on Martha's Vineyard. 
In his day job as a top banker at UBS, the Swiss bank, Mr. Wolf has built his business on relationships, relying on contacts spanning Wall Street and Washington. A former bond trader, he rose through the ranks at Salomon Brothers and later ran the UBS fixed-income desk.
His latest role as chairman of the Americas has focused on winning new business from corporations, private equity firms and institutional investors. Mr. Wolf said on Thursday that he hoped his Wall Street and Washington experience, and his strong ties to both worlds, would ''bring a unique perspective to my clients.''
Mr. Wolf makes more than $5 million a year at UBS, according to several people had been briefed but declined to be identified discussing personnel matters.
''Robert has contributed significantly to the firm in managing and growing our business,'' three senior UBS executives, including Robert J. McCann, the bank's chief executive for the Americas, wrote in an internal memorandum reviewed by The New York Times. ''We appreciate Robert's commitment to our clients and franchise and are pleased that we will continue our relationship as a client of his new firm.''
Mr. Wolf's friendship with the president began before other financiers were seeking to curry favor with Mr. Obama during the 2008 campaign. The two met at a 2006 fund-raiser hosted by the billionaire George Soros and quickly became friends. During the financial crisis, he regularly advised Mr. Obama on the turmoil on Wall Street.
Now, when many on Wall Street, frustrated by the administration's attacks on their industry, have switched allegiance to Mitt Romney, Mr. Wolf has remained steadfast in his support.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in April, Mr. Wolf said that when Mr. Obama attacked ''fat-cat bankers,'' he replied, ''Mr. President, I know you think I'm overweight, but I can think of better names to call me.'' Mr. Obama reportedly laughed.
Mr. Wolf's prominence as an Obama backer irritated some at UBS, however, according to people briefed on the matter. This year, the bank's group executive board in Zurich directed Mr. Wolf to send all media inquiries to the bank's media office for approval, with many requests denied.
But a UBS spokeswoman said that Mr. Wolf's departure had been in the works for some time and was not prompted by any internal battles.
Mr. Wolf set his plan in motion in March. He had just turned 50, was on his way to losing 35 pounds, and was ready for a fresh start. His entire career had been spent at two companies, Salomon Brothers and UBS, and the thought of striking out on his own sounded appealing.
''When you go straight from school to only working at two firms for 28 years, leaving an established platform to do something entrepreneurial is both exciting and overwhelming,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''But I look forward to this new chapter in my career.''
That next phase is 32 Advisors, a reference to his jersey number on the University of Pennsylvania football team. The firm is described, on its bare-bones Web site, 32advisors.com, as ''a boutique consulting and advisory arm,'' serving a wide array of potential clients.
While he will no longer work at UBS, he is expected to continue to accompany its bankers to meetings and help it attract new clients. Being independent means that he can do the same for other firms as well.
By striking out on his own, Mr. Wolf will also have more time for his side project: helping the president win re-election.
Susanne Craig contributed reporting.
Below is the internal memo:
Dear Colleagues,
After an 18 year career with UBS, Robert Wolf has decided to leave the bank to start his own advisory and consulting firm, 32 Advisors, LLC. We are pleased that he will continue to work closely with UBS as a senior advisor, with a focus on providing client advice and solutions.
Robert has contributed significantly to the firm in managing and growing our business. During his tenure he has held a series of senior leadership roles across the firm including: Member of the Group Executive Board, Chairman and CEO of UBS Americas, President and Chief Operating Officer of UBS Investment Bank, Global Head of Fixed Income and Chair of the firm's Diversity and Community Affairs Committee.
''I have truly enjoyed my 18 years at UBS and the opportunity to work closely with so many talented and dedicated colleagues. I have been fortunate to build strong, lasting personal and professional friendships, and it has been an honor to serve the firm's clients to the best of my ability. While I am excited about this next phase of my career and establishing my own firm, I am also pleased to remain engaged with UBS and continue contributing to the company's growth and progress,'' said Robert.
We appreciate Robert's commitment to our clients and franchise and are pleased that we will continue our relationship as a client of his new firm. In this new capacity, Robert will be available as a resource to our investment bankers and sales teams, ensuring continuity of coverage. He will continue to work on current mandates, pitches and generating new business for UBS.
Please join us and the entire Group Executive Board in thanking Robert for his dedicated service and significant contributions to UBS. We look forward to continuing our partnership with him in his new endeavors.
Carsten, Andrea and Bob

HEADLINE: Libor Scandal Shows Rate-Setting Is Hardly a Lesson in Precision

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS and NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
It is an open secret in the banking world: the interest rates for many mortgages and loans are based on a benchmark that is largely guesswork.
The flaws in the rate-setting process, which is used to determine the pricing for trillions of dollars of financial products, have been exposed by the latest banking scandal. Regulators around the world are investigating whether big banks gamed the rates for their own benefit before and after the financial crisis.
But even if banks do not deliberately manipulate the rates, the benchmark remains vulnerable.
Banks derive the rates from estimates rather than real market data. So the benchmark, a measure of how much banks charge each other for loans, does not necessarily represent actual borrowing costs. This weakness has only been exacerbated in recent years, as banks have mostly stopped lending to each other. 
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress this week that he did not have ''full confidence'' in the process, calling it ''structurally flawed.''
The troubles center on a key benchmark known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. This rate and its variants are used to determine the prices for mortgages and other loans, and play a critical role in the multitrillion dollar market for financial contracts called derivatives.
The Libors are set every weekday around 11 a.m., a process overseen by the British Bankers' Association. At that time, a group of big banks report how much interest they would pay to borrow money from other institutions over different periods and in different currencies. After removing the outliers, the remaining numbers are averaged to come up with the various rates. On Thursday, the three-month Libor, in American dollars, stood at 0.4531 percent.
But the precise rates have little basis in reality.
Since the crisis, many banks have been content to park their cash with central banks, rather than lending it out to other institutions. That means there are few interbank transactions on which to base their Libors, according to bankers who operate in this market.
''Libor was intended for an international lending market that has long since past,'' said Pete Hahn, a finance professor at the Cass Business School in London. ''The whole concept of interbank lending died after Lehman Brothers collapsed.''
Now, regulators and investors are questioning whether the benchmark should play any role in determining borrowing costs. Top central bankers will meet in September to discuss potential reforms.
''Why continue with something you know has a substantial amount of wiggle room?'' said Alexander T. Arapoglou, a professor at University of North Carolina's business school. ''It is just opinions that people could disagree with or manipulate.''
The benchmark was supposed to solve a problem for bankers. For years, institutions haggled over the rates charged for different types of loans. To create consistency, the British Bankers' Association developed the Libor standard. At the time, the interbank market functioned relatively well.
As the financial sector ballooned in the last two decades, Libor became increasingly more important. The rates currently cover 10 different currencies, and underpin more than $360 trillion of financial products worldwide.
Even so, the process remains unregulated, with oversight falling largely to the bankers' association. In response to concerns during the crisis, the association conducted a review of Libor and put changes in place in late 2008.
A spokesman for the trade body declined to comment.
After Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle a rate-manipulation case with authorities in June, the trade organization began its own investigation into Libor. The British Bankers' Association is also assessing ways to improve the process, along with central bankers and other authorities.
But it is very difficult to improve Libor if a robust market does not exist.
The industry does not track comprehensive totals for interbank loans. One measure, published by the Federal Reserve, shows that such lending has declined to levels not seen since the 1970s, although the figures do not capture the entire market.
Bankers indicate that such lending has almost completely evaporated. In the current environment, financial institutions will lend money to each other only for a short time, say one month or less. That means banks are largely making estimates for key benchmarks like the three-month and the one-year Libor.
Those two borrowing periods are critical. Vast amounts of derivatives are pinned to the three-month Libor, while the rates on many adjustable-rate mortgages are based on the one-year Libor.
''We just aren't borrowing that much in this market right now,'' said Daryl N. Bible, the chief financial officer of BB&T, a bank based in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Since interbank lending has stagnated, institutions are largely looking to other types of borrowing to come up with Libors, including certificates of deposits and loans from money market funds. But this is an inexact science that can distort the Libor market.
For example, banks often submit the same rates several days in a row, despite changing market and economic conditions.
In June, JPMorgan Chase reported the same one-year Libor every single day, according to data from Thomson Reuters, which is responsible for collecting the benchmark information. The bank's rate: 1 percent.
By contrast, UBS calculated the figure to three decimal places and regularly changed its rates. At the beginning of June, the Swiss bank reported a one-year rate of 1.037 percent. It dropped to 0.972 percent at the end of the month.
Neither bank responded to a request for comment.
There can also be wide discrepancies among similar benchmarks, which may reflect the artificial nature of the process. While the recent three-month Libor stood at 0.4531 percent, the parallel euro interbank offered rate in American dollars amounted to 0.91643 percent.
During periods of turmoil, the process gets murkier. Some traders indicate that banks at times of stress report rates that would be almost impossible to achieve.
When the European debt crisis heated up this summer, French banks were viewed as vulnerable, meaning they would have had a hard time borrowing at reasonable rates. But the country's banks continued to report Libors, and they remained largely flat.
''When the French banks saw their stock price going down 10 percent a day, could they have borrowed at Libor? There isn't a chance,'' said a senior executive at a large Wall Street firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations.
In some ways, the flaws with Libor make it a convenient tool for Wall Street. If banks had to carefully reference a real, sometimes volatile, market, they might find it harder to set rates regularly.
Allowing banks to submit guesstimates makes it relatively simple to come up with a daily number. The practices suits the vast derivatives markets, which need a daily rate to price products like interest-rate swaps.
''It is true that current Libor methodology is very convenient for the derivatives world,'' said Darrell Duffie, professor of finance at Stanford. ''Convenience should not trump accuracy.''
As the Libor scandal has unfolded, the industry is grappling with how to fix the process. One suggestion is to choose banks' Libor submissions randomly when setting the overall rate, making it harder to manipulate. Authorities have also proposed having independent auditors oversee the process.
The race to replace Libor has also heated up. One suggestion is to use rates from another market that banks frequently use to lend to each other. These loans are backed with high-quality financial assets that lenders can keep if borrowers fail to repay. The limited volume of Libor-related loans do not have such collateral.
The Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald is also developing an index of different short-term lending markets. The idea is that the benchmark, a more diversified reflection of borrowing, could be used as a substitute for Libor.
''To be reliable, indices have to be transaction-based and transparent,'' said Gary S. Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator that led the inquiry into Barclays.

HEADLINE: A Hunt for Split-Ticket Voters In a Tight Virginia Senate Race

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
ST. PAUL, Va. -- Like so many others in Appalachia, Amelia Trent's vote is tied to coal, and when it comes to the coal industry and her economic future, Ms. Trent does not trust President Obama.
''Obama is scary. He's a Muslim,'' Ms. Trent said matter-of-factly, but incorrectly, outside the small law firm here where she works as a secretary. On the other hand, she said she could never vote for Mitt Romney. ''He doesn't know what poor is -- or the struggling middle class, which is what we are around here.''
But Ms. Trent, 59, knows and likes former Gov. Tim Kaine, the Democrat contending for the seat of Senator Jim Webb, a fellow Democrat who is retiring. She said she would vote for him over former Senator George Allen, a Republican trying to win his seat back in a neck-and-neck race that could decide which party controls the Senate.
Of more than a dozen competitive Senate races this year, none appear as close as the contest in Virginia. For both Mr. Kaine and Mr. Allen, the search for people like Ms. Trent who say their vote for senator is not tied to their vote for president has become imperative. 
The state appears deadlocked between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday had the presidential candidates even at 44 percent support in the state, a situation consistent with recent national polls. (The poll also showed the Senate race tied.) And neither Senate candidate wants his fate dependent on his party's presidential standard-bearer.
In this hunt for voters, however, Mr. Kaine sees an edge, if only a small one. He was Mr. Obama's handpicked Democratic National Committee chairman, and he has made no real effort to distance himself from the president. Last weekend, he stood side by side with Mr. Obama as the president barnstormed Virginia.
Still, Mr. Kaine portrays himself as a bipartisan problem solver in the mold of Virginia's other senator, Mark Warner, another Democrat who courted both parties while serving as governor. Mr. Kaine has tried to appeal to swing voters in the Washington suburbs, including moderate Republicans, with his record on transportation issues in the region. And his time as a moderate mayor of Richmond could still appeal to some Republicans there.
His language is carefully chosen. At a roundtable discussion in Bristol, hard on the Tennessee border, Mr. Kaine told attendees from both parties: ''I'll make this promise to you: If I'm elected, I will be a partner with the president, whoever it is.''
Mr. Allen, by contrast, has made Mr. Obama -- and Mr. Kaine's close connection to him -- Issue No. 1. In recent advertisements, including one first shown last week, Mr. Allen has sought a bipartisan sheen, but his record has a harder edge than his opponent's, including his famous pledge at the 1994 state Republican convention to knock Virginia Democrats' ''soft teeth down their whiny throats.''
Asked whether she could envision someone who would vote for Mr. Romney and also for Mr. Kaine, Nancy Steele, a Republican bed-and-breakfast manager who attended Mr. Kaine's Bristol meeting, paused and then said no. Asked if she could see an Obama-Allen voter, she laughed and said, ''Never!''
But Mr. Kaine said he thought he could appeal to those who vote for Mr. Romney.
''There will be thousands of Romney-Kaine voters,'' Mr. Kaine said over a milkshake in Bristol. ''Whether it will be 2,000 or 50,000, I don't know.''
Kaine campaign aides say the mother lode of Romney-Kaine voters is not in the less populated country roads of southwestern Virginia but in the suburbs of Washington and Richmond. There, some voters may see Mr. Kaine and Mr. Romney as pro-business technocrats -- and Mr. Allen and Mr. Obama as partisan flag carriers for their parties.
But Mr. Kaine is searching for them across this diverse state. The trip to Bristol last week was his third. He has also been to the conservative southwestern towns of Castlewood, Wise and Blacksburg, and he is planning another trip this month, to a health clinic at the Wise County Fairgrounds.
No one expects the Democrat to win this area, but he cannot afford to be blown out.
''There's some tough real estate in this state,'' Mr. Kaine said, ''and this is some tough real estate.''
The Allen campaign believes that Mr. Kaine is facing a rout in coal country, where many white working-class voters are suspicious of Mr. Obama's intentions for coal. To distance himself from the president, Mr. Kaine would have to offer vocal opposition of the sort that Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, displayed in an advertisement that showed him firing a rifle at an Obama energy bill, said Chris LaCivita, a longtime Virginia Republican campaign adviser. But that will not happen.
''Politics and campaigns aren't waged in a vacuum, and Tim Kaine has two years as chairman of the D.N.C., where he was the coal killer's biggest cheerleader,'' Mr. LaCivita said.
Mr. Kaine's approach is to mix his pitch for bipartisanship with localized boasts about his record as governor, a record that he hopes will differentiate him from the president. A key to that record is the looming Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, a state-of-the-art 585-megawatt coal-fired power plant on the outskirts of St. Paul that started commercial operations on Thursday.
Mr. Kaine mentions the plant virtually everywhere he goes as an antidote to efforts to link him to Obama administration policies that have been tough on coal. He does not pander. In Bristol on Friday, he said that human activity was warming the planet, and that the country needed to transition to cleaner sources of energy. But he also said he helped make the huge coal plant in the mountains above Bristol happen as governor. The plant is proof, he said, that coal and clean-air regulations can coexist.
''My advice is, don't try to weaken regulations,'' he told voters in southwestern Virginia last week. ''Sell your story. Say we can meet these standards.''
There is not much evidence that such nuance will break through the hostility that regulations under Mr. Obama have engendered here. Talk of an Obama ''war on coal'' saturates the airwaves, and in an area already down on its luck, such talk breeds fear.
''It's probably coal that keeps everything going,'' said Betty McMillan, 73. ''If that goes, it all goes.''
In more than a dozen interviews in St. Paul, no one was familiar with any role that Mr. Kaine had in getting the plant going. As recently as March, the former governor toured the plant in a campaign swing. It did not seem to make an impression.
''I did the permitting, and I don't remember that,'' Jeff Kite, 44, an environmental engineer, said about Mr. Kaine's role.
Mr. Kite said that regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency had kept him gainfully employed, because businesses hire him to help them comply with federal standards. But, he said, they are ''just killing permitting.''
''There's no coal mining, no new transportation. He's really hurt the economy,'' Mr. Kite said of the president.
Hank Banner, 43, a Democrat who is the baseball coach at the University of Virginia's College at Wise, sat with Mr. Kite, waiting for lunch at Giovanni's Pizza, one of the few restaurants still open on St. Paul's quiet main street. Mr. Obama will not win Virginia, Mr. Banner said, shaking his head.
''Folks he got in '08 he's not going to get this time,'' he said. But, he was quick to add, Mr. Kaine could win.
Among Democrats in Bristol, word that not even the residents of St. Paul knew of Mr. Kaine's role in the giant plant elicited concern. Energy produced in Virginia is a mainstay of Mr. Allen's campaign, and his drumbeat on the issue appears to be taking root among voters. At Mr. Kaine's Bristol roundtable discussion, he was peppered with pointed questions about drilling off the Virginia coast, natural gas exploration and coal.
''Are you in complete alignment with President Obama, who said he wanted to go on and bankrupt the coal industry?'' Ken Kistner, 77, asked with real bite, not backing off when Mr. Kaine said he had never heard that.
That led to Mr. Kaine's embracing steps against climate change, talking up clean energy and describing his role in starting the plant outside St. Paul.
Told no one in the town knew of that role, Jerry Mathews, 76, a Democrat at the Bristol event, said with a sigh, ''That's a problem.''
Bob Bruce, 65, a retired pharmaceutical representative, said, ''He probably needs to pound his chest a bit more.''

HEADLINE: Pathos Of the Plutocrat

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.'' So wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald -- and he didn't just mean that they have more money. What he meant instead, at least in part, was that many of the very rich expect a level of deference that the rest of us never experience and are deeply distressed when they don't get the special treatment they consider their birthright; their wealth ''makes them soft where we are hard.''
And because money talks, this softness -- call it the pathos of the plutocrats -- has become a major factor in America's political life. 
It's no secret that, at this point, many of America's richest men -- including some former Obama supporters -- hate, just hate, President Obama. Why? Well, according to them, it's because he ''demonizes'' business -- or as Mitt Romney put it earlier this week, he ''attacks success.'' Listening to them, you'd think that the president was the second coming of Huey Long, preaching class hatred and the need to soak the rich.
Needless to say, this is crazy. In fact, Mr. Obama always bends over backward to declare his support for free enterprise and his belief that getting rich is perfectly fine. All that he has done is to suggest that sometimes businesses behave badly, and that this is one reason we need things like financial regulation. No matter: even this hint that sometimes the rich aren't completely praiseworthy has been enough to drive plutocrats wild. For two years or more, Wall Street in particular has been crying: ''Ma! He's looking at me funny!''
Wait, there's more. Not only do many of the superrich feel deeply aggrieved at the notion that anyone in their class might face criticism, they also insist that their perception that Mr. Obama doesn't like them is at the root of our economic problems. Businesses aren't investing, they say, because business leaders don't feel valued. Mr. Romney repeated this line, too, arguing that because the president attacks success ''we have less success.''
This, too, is crazy (and it's disturbing that Mr. Romney appears to share this delusional view about what ails our economy). There's no mystery about the reasons the economic recovery has been so weak. Housing is still depressed in the aftermath of a huge bubble, and consumer demand is being held back by the high levels of household debt that are the legacy of that bubble. Business investment has actually held up fairly well given this weakness in demand. Why should businesses invest more when they don't have enough customers to make full use of the capacity they already have?
But never mind. Because the rich are different from you and me, many of them are incredibly self-centered. They don't even see how funny it is -- how ridiculous they look -- when they attribute the weakness of a $15 trillion economy to their own hurt feelings. After all, who's going to tell them? They're safely ensconced in a bubble of deference and flattery.
Unless, that is, they run for public office.
Like everyone else following the news, I've been awe-struck by the way questions about Mr. Romney's career at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm he founded, and his refusal to release tax returns have so obviously caught the Romney campaign off guard. Shouldn't a very wealthy man running for president -- and running specifically on the premise that his business success makes him qualified for office -- have expected the nature of that success to become an issue? Shouldn't it have been obvious that refusing to release tax returns from before 2010 would raise all kinds of suspicions?
By the way, while we don't know what Mr. Romney is hiding in earlier returns, the fact that he is still stonewalling despite calls by Republicans as well as Democrats to come clean suggests that it could be something seriously damaging.
Anyway, what's now apparent is that the campaign was completely unprepared for the obvious questions, and it has reacted to the Obama campaign's decision to ask those questions with a hysteria that surely must be coming from the top. Clearly, Mr. Romney believed that he could run for president while remaining safe inside the plutocratic bubble and is both shocked and angry at the discovery that the rules that apply to others also apply to people like him. Fitzgerald again, about the very rich: ''They think, deep down, that they are better than we are.''
O.K., let's take a deep breath. The truth is that many, and probably most, of the very rich don't fit Fitzgerald's description. There are plenty of very rich Americans who have a sense of perspective, who take pride in their achievements without believing that their success entitles them to live by different rules.
But Mitt Romney, it seems, isn't one of those people. And that discovery may be an even bigger issue than whatever is hidden in those tax returns he won't release.

HEADLINE: Democrats Gain the Upper Hand

 BODY:
It's only been a year since Congressional Republicans, bent on cutting spending, manufactured a financial crisis by threatening not to raise the debt ceiling. Now, apparently thinking the public has forgotten that debacle, they're furious that Democrats have figured out a way to turn the tables. 
Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership, said Monday that her party was prepared to let all the Bush-era tax cuts expire on Jan. 1 if Republicans refuse to raise taxes on the wealthy. The same holds true, she said, for the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that begin at the same time, which Republicans demanded in the debt crisis but now oppose after realizing that the cuts affect more than social welfare programs.
Republican leaders quickly voiced horror at these tactics. ''Has it come to this?'' said Speaker John Boehner, accusing Democrats of holding the economy hostage for the sake of high-end tax increases. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, called it ''an entirely avoidable high-stakes game of chicken with the single-minded goal of taking more money from those who earn it.''
Taking hostages has unfortunately become the default method of exercising power in Washington, after Republicans decided that conventional compromise with Democrats was unpalatable. But the Democrats' proposal would have nowhere near the same outcome as the Republicans' debt ceiling threat last year.
Had Republicans forced the government into an unprecedented default last August, the worldwide impact on credit markets and economic growth would have been ''catastrophic,'' in the words of Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman. By contrast, the combined impact of the tax-cut expiration and the spending cuts -- the so-called fiscal cliff -- would only push the economy into a shallow recession next year, he told a Senate panel Tuesday morning.
That would be a painful outcome for millions of people, but it is not comparable to a default, and would not happen instantly, instead building slowly over time.
It could also be prevented from happening altogether, as early as January, and Senator Murray has the right plan to do so. By letting all the tax cuts expire on schedule, Republicans can then join Democrats in restoring the cuts only for income up to $250,000. No vote need be taken on raising taxes for the rich, and thus Republicans won't have to remove their no-tax-increase straitjacket.
She is right in refusing Republican demands to end the half of the sequester that cuts $500 billion from defense over a decade, the only leverage Democrats have in preventing much bigger and more painful domestic cuts. If Republicans want to limit the recessionary impact of the sequester they initiated and supported, they will have to reduce it in a balanced way, now that Democrats have learned a painful lesson from Republican power games.

HEADLINE: Iran: Ahmadinejad Speaks on Sanctions

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The West has begun a ''heavy battle'' with Iran by tightening sanctions over Tehran's disputed nuclear program, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Thursday in his first major speech since a European Union oil embargo took effect this month. Speaking at a conference, Mr. Ahmadinejad said his government was doing all it could to sidestep a growing list of sanctions, imposed over Iran's refusal to halt its uranium enrichment activities. ''The government will not retreat one iota from their rights, values and principles against weakening materialistic powers,'' the official IRNA news agency quoted him as saying. The remarks come two weeks after a total oil embargo imposed by the European Union and banking sanctions by the United States went into effect against Tehran over the uranium enrichment, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes only but which the West says is aimed at developing weapons.

HEADLINE: More News Reports Show Up in Campaign Ads, to Journalists' Chagrin

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- While hiking the Appalachian Trail the other day, I became part of a Republican campaign attack on President Obama.
Save the Mark Sanford jokes; I was (really) chaperoning a church youth group. Only after returning did I learn that my prevacation reporting about second-quarter job growth on CNBC had led off a television ad assailing Mr. Obama's economic record.
It was merely a three-second factual observation -- ''The worst job-adding quarter in two years'' -- and not especially elegant at that. Yet beginning on July 11, it was shown 6,136 times over six days in media markets from Denver to Tampa, according to Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. 
More and more this election year, campaign ads include footage from television news programs, further blurring the fading lines separating modern journalism and politics. The trend bothers practitioners of journalism more than those in politics.
''I thought you were particularly photogenic that day,'' chuckled Karl Rove, a founder of Crossroads GPS, the Republican group that produced the ad featuring my work.
But of course that was not the reason Crossroads used the CNBC footage. They wanted to borrow a bit of credibility from the same ''mainstream media'' that they choose at other moments to bash as biased.
''When people see political ads, they think someone's lying to them,'' said Mark McKinnon, an ad maker who worked with Mr. Rove on both of George W. Bush's winning presidential campaigns.
''We try really hard to get credible third-party messengers to deliver facts,'' Mr. McKinnon explained. ''A fact coming from you is much more believable than a fact coming from us.''
As flattering as that might sound to journalists, our own credibility is hardly setting industry records right now. Which is precisely why journalists worry about the additional baggage of becoming associated with campaign advocacy.
''I don't like it,'' said Tom Brokaw, for years the anchor of ''NBC Nightly News.'' ''It's so hard to stay in what I call the 'umpire mode.' ''
Mitt Romney did not help him with an ad during Florida's Republican primary race this year. Fighting to fend off Newt Gingrich, the Romney campaign broadcast an ad consisting solely of Mr. Brokaw's ''Nightly News'' report on a 1997 House ethics vote against Mr. Gingrich, then House speaker.
Mr. Brokaw and NBC News worried that the ad ''compromised'' his role as a journalist and asked that it be stopped. As they expected, the request was ignored; by Kantar Media's count, the ad ran 2,225 times.
Once campaigns feared complaints from prominent TV journalists -- and the hassle of responding to the lawyers who spoke for them. Now ad makers from both parties shrug them off, as the prevalence of the practice increases their confidence that ''fair use'' broadcasting rules make legal threats toothless.
''I understand why Tom was angry,'' said Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic news media consultant. But, he added, ''that's a lost battle.''
It has been lost for several reasons, including the erosion of trust in politicians and the explosion of political talk on cable television. The expanded supply of available material ricochets rapidly among partisans via Twitter, Facebook and other social media.
''It's very easy'' to build an attack ad around TV news footage,'' Mr. Carrick said. ''You can put it together in a half-hour.''
A campaign like this one, centered on economic conditions, only increases the incentives to use TV talking heads as shortcuts. Personal scandals are easier to exploit in 30 seconds than international debt crises.
''Illustrating the problems facing the American economy is very difficult to do,'' said Elizabeth Wilner, a former political director at NBC News who is now a vice president at Kantar and a columnist for Advertising Age. Using TV journalists ''provides compelling, credible footage to back up the ads' arguments.''
As the ad featuring Mr. Brokaw shows, the technique is more broadly useful than that. Mr. Romney's campaign rolled out an ad featuring TV footage of David Brooks of The New York Times, Mark Halperin of Time magazine and Bob Schieffer of CBS News discussing the negative tone of Mr. Obama's campaign.
''This was done without our permission,'' Mr. Schieffer complained on ''Face the Nation,'' the Sunday talk show he hosts.
I am less concerned, perhaps because my Crossroads speaking part is so brief and noncontroversial. As a grade school student in 1968, long before CNBC existed, I appeared in a campaign ad that today would set off far greater blowback. It was an ad for Robert F. Kennedy, whose campaign my father, Richard Harwood, was then covering for The Washington Post.
The stakes are also much higher for the likes of Mr. Schieffer and Mr. Brokaw, since I am the TV news equivalent of a Miami Heat bench warmer to their LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. The major networks invest heavily in their superstar anchors, who as a result are especially sensitive to anything that could threaten their reputations and appeal to viewers.
But they also know they had better get used to it. ''I'm afraid we are just caught now in this world,'' said Mr. Brokaw, now semiretired, from his home in Montana. ''All the gates are down, and it's not comfortable.''

HEADLINE: Accounting Detente Delayed

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
''I'm the decider,'' George W. Bush once famously said. ''I decide what is best.''
In the world of accounting, the dream of having just one decider, whose rules would apply everywhere, has repeatedly been endorsed by major governments around the world. Just last month, the Group of 20 countries reaffirmed support for ''continuing work to achieve convergence to a single set of high-quality accounting standards.''
But it is not going to happen. There will be at least two major deciders -- the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board in many other countries. There will be minor deciders in countries large and small who will decide which international standards they like and which they don't. Even when the rules appear to be the same, they may not be consistently interpreted and enforced.
This week -- days after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission made clear it was not going to move toward adoption of international standards anytime soon -- the two boards found themselves in angry disagreement over one of the most contentious issues to emerge from the financial crisis: how banks should account for loans that may be going bad. 
The two boards had reached tentative agreements this spring -- I'll get to some of the details later -- but Leslie Seidman, the chairwoman of the American board, told a joint meeting of the two boards that bank regulators and others had voiced concern about the rules and that she wanted more time to work out guidance and details.
''This is deeply embarrassing,'' responded Hans Hoogervorst, the chairman of the international board, which was meeting in London and was linked by videoconference to the American board's meeting in Norwalk, Conn. He said he feared ''this whole thing is going to unravel'' after three years of extensive effort.
Whatever happens to bank accounting, the two boards may move farther apart in the near future. Currently four of the 16 members of the international board are Americans, but two of them -- including Paul Pacter, a former top staff official of the American board -- have terms expiring this year. Some Europeans, including Michel Barnier, a member of the European Commission, have suggested that the board should be limited to people from countries that use the rules.
A quarter-century ago, there was, for all practical purposes, one decider for accounting rules for major companies around the world. That was the American board. Foreign companies that wanted access to the American capital markets had to either use American GAAP -- generally accepted accounting principles -- or reconcile their financial statements so readers could see how much money they would have made if they had used GAAP.
But that dominance withered. In 1990, the Securities and Exchange Commission began allowing foreign issuers to sell securities to American institutional investors without changing their accounting, and over time new technologies made it much easier for even small American investors to buy stocks on overseas markets.
In 2000, Arthur Levitt, then the S.E.C. chairman, took the lead in reorganizing the international board to make it a more credible standard-setter, and said he hoped that international rules might eventually be used in the United States.
Four years ago, it appeared that time was near. The S.E.C., under the chairmanship of Christopher Cox, announced that foreign companies that traded in the United States would no longer need to reconcile their statements to American GAAP, so long as they followed international standards exactly as laid down by the international board. He began a process aimed at allowing, or perhaps even requiring, American companies to also use the international rules.
By last year that ''road map'' was to have led to an S.E.C. decision, but it did not. Late last Friday, the commission issued a fairly saccharine staff report on the issue that made no recommendations. That report had been ready months ago.
The push for international rules in the United States turned out to have little domestic support. The major accounting firms love the idea, and so do some large multinational companies. But many domestic companies fear the expense of changing.
In recent years, the American and international boards have tried to move the two sets of rules together by adopting identical standards in various areas. That process worked in some areas, but it has produced sharp disagreements on rules for insurance companies, and now the latest dispute has erupted over bank rules.
Those rules concern when, and how, banks should write down the value of loans on their books. During the crisis, banks complained that the existing rules made it too difficult to take write-downs until it was crystal-clear that a loan had gone bad.
After extensive efforts, the two boards agreed on what they called the three-bucket approach. Loans would start life in the first bucket, on which reserves could be taken based on expectations that a certain percentage would go bad, but the reserve would equal no more than the expected losses over the next 12 months. When loans deteriorated, they would be switched to the second or third buckets and written down to reflect all losses expected over the life of the loan. The second and third buckets would differ only in that one would be for specific loans with problems, while the other could be for groups of loans -- such as mortgages in a town whose major employer was going out of business, or loans to a country that was facing fiscal difficulties.
Ms. Seidman said the Federal Reserve and others had voiced concerns that loans might not be moved from the first bucket to others quickly enough, and that in some cases the goal of getting loans written down more quickly would be frustrated.
If so, that could reflect the fact that American bank regulators had been more aggressive than their European counterparts in urging banks to write down bad loans quickly, perhaps even stretching the current rule. It is possible that the three-bucket rule would have a larger impact in Europe. Perhaps clarifying language satisfactory to all can be drafted, allowing a final rule proposal to be issued this year by both boards. But even if that happens, the fight is an illustration of increasing tension between the two boards, neither of which wishes to defer to the other. The boards could have jointly announced a delay, but there was too much frustration and anger in London to allow that.
In any case, American GAAP will not be replaced by international rules. It appears that the most the S.E.C. will consider doing is to submit any new rule adopted by the international board to the American board for consideration. Some accountants had hoped that American companies would be given permission to use international rules if they wished to do so, but that appears unlikely.
The European Commission already claims the right to modify the rules, and it did so some years ago at the request of French banks, which were allowed to opt out of a rule they did not like regarding the valuation of derivatives. As that happens in other jurisdictions, international standards may become widely divergent, making the goal of comparable financial statements even less likely to be achieved.
Japan, which a couple of years ago appeared to be on course to adopt the international rules, now seems likely to allow but not require their use. Some companies there will use Japanese GAAP while others follow American GAAP. Since international rules will continue to be accepted by the S.E.C. for foreign companies, it is possible that Americans will still have great influence. By refusing to accept filings by companies that it thinks are violating the rules, the S.E.C. could enforce some conformity in the application of the standards, at least among internationally traded companies. But there will still be two deciders, one based in London and one in Norwalk.
Of course, there is seldom really only one final decider. During the financial crisis, politicians and bank regulators forced both boards to back down on efforts to force banks to take losses on securities whose market values had plunged, leaving both looking somewhat compromised.
And it turned out that not even President Bush could always have the final word. His statement that he was ''the decider'' came in the spring of 2006, when he was rebuffing demands by some retired generals for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. In November, after Republicans suffered major losses in the midterm elections, Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation was announced.

HEADLINE: With $20 Billion Loan Pledge, China Strengthens Its Ties to African Nations

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- President Hu Jintao said Thursday that China would lend $20 billion to African governments for infrastructure and agriculture in the next three years, in a speech to a gathering of African leaders.
The loans outlined by Mr. Hu, which doubled the amount offered at the last such conference here, in 2009, signaled that China was pressing ahead with aid programs in African nations with abundant energy and mineral resources but with more focus on grass-roots projects.
China's aid to Africa has expanded rapidly in the last decade as the continent has become a major source of oil from Sudan and Angola, and copper from Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. China has come under heavy criticism for offering its aid without conditioning it on human rights performance or governance, especially in the case of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan. 
At the same time, its projects -- roads, pipelines and ports -- have focused on benefiting China's extractive industries, not African people, critics say. The infrastructure is generally built with Chinese labor.
The president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, addressed the meeting and praised China's approach, saying it was preferred to Africa's experience with Europe. ''We are particularly pleased that in our relationship with China, we are equals and that agreements entered into are for mutual gain,'' Mr. Zuma said.
However, he was also quoted as saying: ''Africa's commitment to China's development has been demonstrated by supply of raw materials, other products and technology transfer. This trade pattern is unsustainable in the long term. Africa's past economic experience with Europe dictates a need to be cautious when entering into partnerships with other economies.''
In his speech, Mr. Hu said China would train 30,000 Africans, offer 18,000 scholarships and send 1,500 medical personnel to Africa. He said China would mount programs to improve drinking water and protect forests, new endeavors for China.
Li Xinfeng, an African studies scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the change was notable.
''Before,'' he said, ''China had more of an attitude that 'We'll give what we want to give you,' but now the aid is more focused on African needs.''
But how much of the aid promised by Mr. Hu will be disbursed, and where exactly it will go, was unclear because China's aid programs to Africa are not clearly documented, development experts said.
''An accurate number of what China actually gives is difficult to come up with because Western countries have different definitions of foreign aid to China,'' said Yun Sun, a foreign policy expert on China and Africa at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
For example, China can say building roads and infrastructure benefits the people, she said, but the real aim is to strengthen the legitimacy of the government and get natural resources.
In an assessment of how Chinese aid works, the Congressional Research Service, an independent arm of Congress, said, ''China appears to administer foreign aid in an ad hoc fashion, without a centralized system, foreign aid agency and mission or a regularized funding schedule.''
The conference of African leaders held at the Great Hall of the People seemed a lower-key event than in the past when Beijing was decorated with banners announcing ''Amazing Africa.''
Many leaders were not present, perhaps a reflection that the timing of the conference was pushed forward so it would not clash with the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party, which will choose China's new leadership in the fall.
China's experience in Africa has not been so smooth in the last year. The flow of oil from Sudan has stopped because of a feud between Sudan and South Sudan, which became independent in July 2011.
The China National Petroleum Corporation has pulled most of its engineers from the oil fields in South Sudan, and Chinese-built infrastructure, including a pipeline from the fields to Port Sudan, and a refinery near Khartoum, are virtually abandoned.
In Libya, China was a longtime backer of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and since the revolution and his death, the new leaders have failed to honor China's contracts.
Criticism from some quarters in Africa became so intense last year that a senior Chinese official felt compelled to answer.
In an interview with an African magazine called Jeune Afrique, the director general of the Department of African Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, Lu Shaye, defended the sending of Chinese workers to Africa. In doing so, China was more efficiently spending its assistance than Western donors to Africa, he said.
''They work in three shifts a day and work all day and all night to speed up project schedules,'' Mr. Lu said of the Chinese workers.
''Take government assistance projects as an example,'' he said. ''China spends 95 percent of the money on the project and on the recipient countries, while the West may spend 80 percent on their own staff.''
The Congressional Research Service reported that total United States foreign assistance to Africa in 2009 was $8.2 billion. Under the Obama administration, a new emphasis has been placed on health care, and more than half the $8.2 billion went to health-related programs.

HIGHLIGHT: Climate, corn, and hopelessness. 

 BODY:
I've been searching for something useful to say about the epic heat wave and drought afflicting U.S. agriculture, other than that this is the shape of things to come. Of course it's about climate change: a rising number of temperature records is exactly what you'd expect given an underlying upward trend in global temperatures. And the economic consequences will be large: maybe 1 percent on U.S. consumer prices, but suffering and food riots in poorer nations that spend more of their income on food.
Yet with so much of the American political spectrum in fierce denial over the issue, there is no prospect whatsoever of getting action.
So what do you say?

HEADLINE: Oregon Moves (Slowly) to Gird Schools for Inevitable Quake

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Oregon, awaiting an inevitable and potent earthquake, makes a little progress buttressing vulnerable schools. 

 BODY:
Here's a Dot Earth "postcard" on an encouraging financial development in earthquake-threatened Oregon from Ted Wolf, a co-founder of Oregon Parents for Quake-Resistant Schools. As longtime readers here know, Oregon will inevitably be struck by a potent earthquake generated along the Cascadia subduction fault offshore. The only question is when, not if.
The state has been slow to gird for this calamity, which is not surprising considering that the last great quake (and tsunami) struck in 1700. (That tsunami was strong enough to be noted and recorded by historians across the Pacific in Japan; here's a simulation of the waves.)
There was little to destroy back then, of course. But now -- just to take schools as a sample -- there is enormous vulnerability. One fact: "Of the 2,161 public school buildings in a state inventory comprising most of Oregon's 1,355 public elementary, middle, and high schools, 2,027 (94 percent) pre-date the state's first seismic building codes." Close to 1,000 schools are estimated to be at risk of collapse in the next Cascadia jolt, state officials estimate.
Here's Wolf's post: 
Given Dot Earth's long focus on the risk to schools in Oregon from the Cascadia Subduction Zone and other earthquake faults, I thought you would like to know we are making progress. The State of Oregon sold $7.21 million in bonds on Tuesday to fund seismic retrofits at seven K-12 schools, including Alameda Elementary School in Portland -- the district's highest-enrollment elementary school.
This brings the total of state-funded school retrofits in Oregon up to 22 schools in 16 school districts around the state, from metropolitan Portland to rural (and coastal) Myrtle Point. This is a small but real start on the more than 1,000 school buildings that are candidates for retrofits, and tangible testimony to the efforts of earthquake hazard engineer Yumei Wang and state Sen. Peter Courtney over many years.
Much more must be done to grow this program, but the latest round of state retrofit grants will create jobs and protect more than 2,300 schoolchildren throughout Oregon.
Here's a great piece making the case that popular green school initiatives need to include earthquake resilience, as well -- written by Wolf and co-author Jules Bailey, an economist and member of the Oregon House of Representatives from Portland. (I've written on this theme on Dot Earth, as well.)
There's more on the threat to the Northwest from the Cascadia subduction fault in this video discussion by Oregon State University emeritus geosciences professor Bob Yeats:

HEADLINE: Mud-Slinging Enters Debate Over Ethanol's Impact on Gasoline Prices

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: A debate over ethanol's impact on the price of a gallon of gasoline has pitted a biofuel trade group against two economists. 

 BODY:
Viewed from outside the ivory tower, a dispute among economists over ethanol's impact on gasoline prices might be expected to proceed in a genteel manner. Instead, the debate has bubbled over.
Christopher Knittel, an energy economist at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, and Aaron Smith, an agricultural economist at the University of California, Davis, took issue in a recent paper with a claim, made in advertisements by the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group, that ethanol production reduced gas prices nationally by 89 cents a gallon in 2010, and by more than $1 a gallon in 2011. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsackhas also cited the 2010 figure in his defense of the biofuel.
The trade group's claims are based on academic work by Dermot J. Hayes of Iowa State University and Xiaodong Du of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The professors' original peer-reviewed work on the subject, published in 2009, assigned a more modest amount of credit to the biofuel for its ability to reduce gasoline prices. That work, however, was updated in May - with financial support from the trade group - for Iowa State's Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, and the findings ascribed greater price-reducing powers to ethanol.
The updated report included the assertion that ethanol production in 2011 had an average marginal effect of reducing gasoline prices by $1.09 a gallon, with regional impacts ranging from 73 cents a gallon on the Gulf Coast to $1.69 a gallon in the Midwest.
Mr. Knittel and Mr. Smith claimed that the scholarship was "driven by implausible economic assumptions and spurious statistical correlations."
To illustrate their critique, the professors employed the same statistical models used in the Iowa State report to draw intentionally absurd conclusions, among them that ethanol production depresses the price of natural gas and increases unemployment in the United States and Europe.
"We also used their model to show that ethanol production is causing my daughter to grow older, and if it was taken away she'd get younger," Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview. "We know that's not true, or at least we hope it isn't true."
Matt Hartwig, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, defended the scholarship represented in the Iowa State report, noting it was based on a peer-reviewed model, and was updated annually. "I would be surprised if this paper from M.I.T. were to hold up under such scrutiny," he said in a telephone interview. "It doesn't read like a scientific paper, but more like two professors with an ax to grind taking potshots at the secretary of agriculture and R.F.A."
A report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2008 cited various estimates for ethanol's monetary impact on the price of a gallon of gasoline. "Without ethanol, today's gasoline prices would be 20 to 35 cents higher," the report said, citing the Energy and Agriculture Departments.
Ethanol has long been added to gasoline in 10 percent concentrations, but a richer formulation known as E15, having been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, began making its way to filling stations this month. The cost savings for the motorist who chooses E15 over E10, however, are not so clear, as explored recently by Wheels.
Mr. Knittel of M.I.T. said in an interview that ethanol most likely reduced gasoline prices, at most, by 10 cents a gallon, after adjustments were made to account for the biofuel's lower energy potential relative to pure gasoline. He described claims made by the trade group, which have appeared at bus shelters and billboards, particularly around Washington, as "false advertising."
For his part, Mr. Hayes, one of the authors of the Iowa State study, said in an e-mail that the marginal effect on gasoline prices was difficult to calculate precisely. Even so, he was confident that the report released in May would stand up to scrutiny.
"We will have to let the academic process play its way out," he wrote.

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A midsummer night's links. 

 BODY:
Must read: Bill McKibben writing in Rolling Stone on the "terrifying new math" of global warming. (My take here.)
New York City is launching two new initiatives to promote healthy shopping and eating. is a voluntary pilot program that asks bodegas to make it a priority to stock and display healthy foods instead of junk, while the campaign is an illustrated cost-comparison guide meant to show that cooking at home can be healthier and cheaper than eating takeout or fast food (I have made that point before, and am thrilled that the city is doing the same). Meanwhile, new research shows that New York City's trans fat ban has actually made fast food and the people who eat it healthier. No surprise there, but good to know.
There's even more writing on the wall when it comes to pork gestation crates: The food-service giant Sodexo and the retail giant Costco Wholesale Corp. have become the latest major companies to commit to phasing the crates out of their supply chain. Meanwhile, Mercy For Animals (with some help from Bob Barker, in a sadly dorky intro) has released yet another graphic undercover video of pigs in gestation crates being abused at Christensen Family Farms in Minnesota, one of Wal-Mart's suppliers and the third largest pork supplier in the country.
The House Agriculture committee has approved a version of the farm bill; now, as the bill shifts back to the full house, one of the major debates will be how much to cut food stamps (SNAP). The cuts proposed in the House are about three times deeper than those proposed in the Senate. Either way, it seems certain that a number of SNAP participants will lose their benefits when the new farm bill is signed into law. Meanwhile, Time has picked up on a report from Michele Simon about how big food corporations (and even banks) are reaping the benefits of federal food assistance. This is exactly why efforts (like "Health Bucks") to direct more SNAP dollars towards the purchase of healthy foods and the smaller farmers who produce it are so necessary; SNAP can be reformed to save money without taking food away from people who need it.
The Christian Science Monitor suggests what the massive drought plaguing some the country's most fertile agricultural regions might mean for food prices, and Obama's hope for reelection. Much more sobering: A year after the horrific famine in Somalia, the effects are still being felt.
Here's a great piece by The Times' Stephanie Strom, in which she explores how large corporations are co-opting (and potentially diluting) "organic" food. Also, if you're interested in local food (in a wonkish sort of way) read this extensive overview from the U.S.D.A.'s Economic Research Service: Local Food Systems: Concepts, Impacts, and Issues.
The Microbial Data Program (the country's largest produce-safety testing program) has been given a temporary reprieve by the U.S.D.A. to operate through the rest of the year after President Obama's proposed budget cut its funding. A permanent solution to keep the program running beyond this year is imperative, though that doesn't mean it's likely.
A new study found that bananas were as effective as Gatorade in providing nutrition for cyclists during intense workouts. (I guess we now have something to look forward to: bananas manufactured by PepsiCo.) Another new study has found that a piece of food (like a bagel, for instance) cut into multiple pieces is more satiating than that same food left in one piece. So, I suppose if you want to reduce your craving for second helpings, cut your food before you eat it.
Taco Bell's new offering: The Cheesy Cardboard Gordita Crunch (probably an improvement in both flavor and nutrition). In other unpalatable fast food news, the president and COO of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, has reaffirmed his company's stance on same-sex marriage. "I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'" he said. "I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we would have the audacity to try to redefine what marriage is all about." Lovely. Now we know what really is causing global warming: gay marriage.
When you think of the planning for our food future, this is probably not what comes to mind: NASA and Lockheed Martin are already at work trying to figure out how to feed the astronauts who will potentially man the two and a half year mission to Mars in the 2030s. One possibility: a greenhouse on the surface of Mars from which the astronauts can harvest produce and cook. Local agriculture never seemed so far away.

HEADLINE: Bring Your Questions on Skilled Immigrants

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Send us questions for Brookings Institution scholars about H-1B visas and their effects on the economy and American skilled workers. 

 BODY:
Are more skilled immigrants good for the economy? Do they lower American workers' wages? Where are they most in demand?
Now's your chance to ask scholars from the Brookings Institution these and other questions about skilled immigrants. Neil G. Ruiz, Jill H. Wilson and Shyamali Choudhury released a report this week about the geography of H-1B visas, which allow employers to hire foreigners to work in specialty occupations on a temporary basis.
Demand for H-1B workers varies by region, as you can see from the map above. But across the country, openings for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (or STEM) occupations account for nearly two-thirds of requests for H-1B workers.

HEADLINE: Slight Decline in the Jobs Outlook

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The economic data was just weak enough this week to cause a slight decline in The Times's weekly election-year job tracker. 

 BODY:
The economic data was just weak enough this week to cause a slight decline in The Times's weekly election-year job tracker. The economists at Moody's Analytics now forecast average monthly job growth of 129,000 in the six months leading up to election, down from a forecast of 131,000 a week ago.
The economists write:
Good news on the economy is scarce; our estimate of second-quarter GDP has been lowered several times, and now is close to 1% annualized. This pace of growth is unlikely to spur faster business hiring, thus the job market will not improve significantly in the third quarter. Not only is spending on a weak trajectory, but it is increasingly difficult to see what would spark stronger growth over the remainder of 2012.
Uncertainty about the economy and U.S. fiscal situation is leading us to lower our forecast for job growth leading up to the election. This was an underlying theme of the Fed's latest Beige Book, which noted that firms are delaying adding full-time workers. We are also unlikely to get clarity on the U.S. fiscal situation until after the presidential election, keeping the job market recovery in low gear.
The forecast for rate of growth remains in a range that would suggest a close presidential election. As we have noted before:
Historically, nothing - not social issues, campaign advertisements or gaffes - has influenced voters more heavily than the direction of the economy in an election year. In only three races since World War II has the outcome been different from what the economy's direction would have suggested: 1952 (when the popular Dwight D. Eisenhower was running), 1968 (when the Vietnam War hobbled the Democrats) and 1976 (when Watergate hobbled the Republicans).

HEADLINE: Reporter's Hard Drive: Covering Italy in the Maelstrom

BYLINE: ELISABETTA POVOLEDO


HIGHLIGHT: Covering the euro crisis from Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, has been a roller coaster ride -- surprising, exhausting, but never dull. 

 BODY:
ROME - The folders in my computer are a snapshot of contemporary Italy distilled by news cycles and personal interests over the years (blind baseball; the arts; women farmers; Pompeii).
I was born in Italy, but grew up in Canada. When I moved back here and started working as a journalist, more than 25 years ago, my folders were of the cardboard kind and took up entire cupboards. (I have been told by my colleagues that I have a serious paper problem). Computers have saved many trees, at least where I am concerned.
Some of the folder names of the last eight months denote epochal changes: "THE END of B" (B being Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, though it turns out that reports of his end may have been greatly exaggerated); "Monti Save Italy"; "Merkel Monti"; "Monti Bailout Fund." And a dispiriting, ever-growing new addition: "Monti in Trouble," Monti of course being Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is valiantly trying to sail a country equated by many to a sinking ship through turbulent European waters (enough with the nautical metaphors, though they are disturbingly apt).
There's a file, too, where I stash away articles, mostly editorials, by economists, industrialists and other Italians struggling to make sense of the dramatic market oscillations that have been pummeling Italy since the start of the euro crisis. The file is named "This is Not Italy," a rallying cry of sorts, encapsulating the widespread frustrations of many Italians, impotently looking on as impersonal market forces - including ratings agencies - buffet the national economy, heedless of the social wreckage they leave in their wake. (Perception and reality are on a collision course here, though it is sometimes hard to tell which is which.)
That file has been growing rapidly in recent weeks, as market confidence in Italy has begun to wane anew.
There was outrage - passionate and bipartisan - after Moody's downgraded Italy a couple of notches from A3 to Baa2 on July 13. A reportedly irate Mr. Monti, who was at a conference of business leaders in Sun Valley, Idaho, was widely quoted as blasting the international ratings agency. 
"It's a disgrace. Instead of rewarding us, they are punishing us," Mr. Monti is said to have said, furious (again, reportedly) that Moody's had not taken into account the tough measures that his government has enacted to circumvent financial disaster. (The conditional is a condition. Italian journalists, at times, put quotation marks around phrases they wouldn't have been able to hear - except as the proverbial fly on the wall).
Ostensible market deafness towards Italy's virtuousness has become a recurrent government refrain as the market pressures persist. 
"No other country has done so much in such a short time," the newly installed finance minister Vittorio Grilli said in an interview Sunday in Milan Corriere della Sera, asking international markets to recognize Italy's efforts to tackle its debt crisis, carry out structural reforms and balance the budget. Tell that to the markets.
Other articles in the folder lash out against what the authors see as unjustifiable rankings. "Why we aren't a junk country," opined Alessandro Plateroti in an editorial in the economic daily Il Sole 24 Ore last week, accusing Moody's of insisting on "a black-and-white picture of our rainbow."
Italy's reality is far different, according to data Mr. Plateroti - and many others - cite from the Economy Ministry. "In the first semester of 2012 the state sector deficit dropped to 29.1 billion euros, from 43.9 billion euros a year earlier. In June, the state sector budget surplus was 5.8 billion euros, up from 1 billion euros a year earlier. In light of these figures, analysts believe that the government isn't lying when it says that it expects a primary surplus equal to 4.9 percent of GDP by the end of year, up from 3.6 percent of GPD estimated in 2012."
And there are articles that ponder deeper cultural failings. "Italy is a strange country where, when the enemy is the disaster left by an earthquake, industrialists lend factories to each other. And under the rubble there is a strange country that produces life-saving machines for half of Europe's hospitals, thanks to a biomedical-device production district that ranks fifth in the world," wrote Alberto Orioli, also in Il Sole 24 Ore, calling for a boost in national pride. 
After all, Mr. Orioli points out, in one year Italy has implemented the same reforms that Germany took 12 years to pass. As well, Italy is the only European country with a 3.4 percent primary surplus, and its private wealth is higher than its GDP, "with a ratio not too far from that of Germany." Not to mention the country's untapped wealth when it comes to art and culture.
This Italy.
The wide spread between Italian and German government debt, the unsustainable bond yields, the fear of contagion: This is not Italy, many Italians say. 
Most revealing, perhaps, are letters written by Italian citizens to newspaper and magazine columnists plaintively asking: Are things really as bad as they say? Is it true Italians are re-discovering values like God and the family? "Did we need the crisis for this?" Pietro D. from Rome asks of the Rev. Rino Fisichella, a prelate who has a weekly column on faith in the popular magazine Oggi (an Italian version of the U.S. magazine People). 
His answer is vague, and vaguely Christian Democratic. "Politicians should understand that family policies must be at the heart of their actions," Father Fisichella writes. But based on statistics that suggest that 82 percent of Italians today think that faith is central to life, he adds that the church should acknowledge this thirst for God. "Even in times of crisis, you can live and think positively," he writes.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Libor Scandal Shows Flaws in Rate-Setting | It is an open secret in the banking world: the interest rates for many mortgages and loans are based on a benchmark that is largely guesswork.
The flaws in the rate-setting process, which is used to determine the pricing for trillions of dollars of financial products, have been exposed by the latest banking scandal. Regulators around the world are investigating whether big banks gamed the rates for their own benefit before and after the financial crisis.
But even if banks do not deliberately manipulate the rates, the benchmark remains vulnerable. Banks derive the rates from estimates rather than real market data. So the benchmark, a measure of how much banks charge each other for loans, does not necessarily represent actual borrowing costs. This weakness has only been exacerbated in recent years, as banks have mostly stopped lending to each other.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress this week that he did not have "full confidence" in the process, calling it "structurally flawed."

HEADLINE: Would Pawlenty Put Minnesota Within Romney's Reach?

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Minnesota has the longest streak of voting for Democratic presidential candidates of any state in the nation, though Republicans have gained ground in recent years. 

 BODY:
By mostaccounts, Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, is one of the top names on Mitt Romney's list of potential vice-presidential nominees. Mr. Pawlenty is liked, though perhaps not loved, by the main pillars of the Republican Party -- social conservatives, the Tea Party and establishment Republicans -- making him a safe choice for a risk-averse Romney campaign.
But if Mr. Romney is looking for a vice-presidential nominee that might also bring along votes from their home state, Mr. Pawlenty might be a poor choice compared to someone like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who comes from a state that is a genuine tossup. The home-state effect of a vice-presidential nominee can be overrated in any case, but Minnesota has the longest streak of voting for Democratic presidential candidates than any other state in the nation. 
Still, like many of the states we have profiled, partisan allegiance in presidential voting can mask a more nuanced picture on the ground. In four elections since 1972, the Republican presidential candidate has come within 4 percentage points of winning Minnesota. And in the early 2000s, Republicans gained ground in the state. Enough ground, in fact, that the Republican Party held its national convention in St. Paul in 2008.
"It's a mistake to think of Minnesota as blue rather than red, and even a mistake to talk about Minnesota as purple," Mr. Jacobs said, "Minnesota is really more polka-dotted."
The polka-dot pattern is exemplified by the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Congressional districts. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress and a co-chairman of the Progressive Caucus, represents Minnesota's Fifth District, which includes Minneapolis. The bulk of the Democratic votes in the state come from this area, along with St. Paul in the Fourth District. 
The Sixth District, which is adjacent to the Fourth and Fifth, is represented by Michele Bachmann, the conservative firebrand. Mrs. Bachmann's district along with the Second District, to the south of Minneapolis and St. Paul, encompasses most of the suburban and exurban communities surrounding the Twin Cities. The two districts are the anchor of Republican support in Minnesota. 
The rest of the state is less densely populated. North-central and northeast Minnesota, the Iron Range, are rural, blue collar and tend to vote Democratic. Unions are well organized in the northeast, and can still flex political muscle. The northwest is more rural and about evenly split in terms of partisan allegiance.
The southeastern part of the state includes the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, an area which was traditionally Republican but has become more competitive. And as Hispanics have moved into southern Minnesota to work for agribusinesses, the southeast has become a swing region. The farm counties in the southwest have been losing residents, but those who remain are, for the most part, very socially and fiscally conservative.
The Bellwether: Blue Earth County
Look to Blue Earth County, anchored by Mankato, for an approximate measure of the final statewide margin between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney on Nov. 6. Blue Earth, an area with rich farmland that produces soybeans, corn and hogs, has roughly matched the final vote of the state in the past three presidential elections.
The Bottom Line
Mr. Romney does have a narrow path to victory in Minnesota. The FiveThirtyEight model currently gives him a 7 percent chance of carrying the state. In 2000 and 2004, support for the Democratic Party (known locally as Democratic Farm Labor Party) eroded somewhat among traditional Democratic voters in the Iron Range, an area that tends to be more socially conservative. Unease with environmental and gun control regulations helped Republicans make inroads in northern Minnesota. In 2010, Democrats lost the Eighth District, which covers this area, for the first time since 1946, when Chip Cravaack, a Republican, defeated veteran Representative Jim Oberstar. 
At the same time, many Twin Cities suburbs and exurbs have become more Republican, moving the overall balance of the state a few percentage points toward the right.
But the 2012 election cycle might not be the best time for a Republican to try for an upset in Minnesota against an incumbent president. First, Minnesota's economy is positively robust compared to the rest of the nation. The state's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent.
Second, the Minnesota Republican Party is essentially in shambles, Mr. Jacobs said. Struggling with financial problems, the party faced eviction from its headquarters. "It's been kind of a laughingstock for the last year," Mr. Jacobs said.
In late 2011, the Republican majority leader of the state senate, Amy Koch, resigned after allegations surfaced that she was having an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. And the state's Republican Party was just fined $33,000 for accepting illegal contributions in 2010.
Lastly, the issues that helped Republicans make inroads in the Iron Range area may have lost their potency. Mr. Oberstar's loss seems to have energized Democratic activists in the area, Mr. Jacobs said.
But can a Romney-Pawlenty ticket overcome those issues and pull Minnesota into reach?
A survey of likely voters in Minnesota by Public Policy Polling from early June tested several Republican tickets and found that a Romney-Pawlenty matchup was the most popular. But Romney-Pawlenty still trailed Obama-Biden by 11 percentage points.

HEADLINE: After Killings at Theater, Campaigns Suspend Their Ads in Colorado

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Mitt Romney both said Friday that they were suspending advertising in Colorado in the wake of a deadly shooting at a movie theater in that state. 

 BODY:
Tragedy collided with an unpleasant side of election-year politics on Friday, prompting the suspension of negative advertising in one of the country's most hotly contested battleground states.
President Obama and Mitt Romney both said Friday that they were suspending advertising in Colorado in light of the shootingthere that claimed at least 12 lives and injured dozens more. Two major "super PACs" also said they would cease advertising for now, an acknowledgement that to continue pointed political attacks at this time would be distasteful.
"We are pulling all ads in Colorado until further notice," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. An Obama campaign official confirmed that the president's negative ads were being dropped.Since all of Mr. Obama's commercials running in Colorado this week have targeted Mr. Romney, it appeared the campaign was indeed suspending all its television advertising there.
American Crossroads and its sister organization, Crossroads GPS, which have spent millions of dollars attacking Mr. Obama in Colorado and were preparing to begin a fresh round of advertising on Friday, confirmed that its ads were being dropped as well. 
"In moments of tragedy like the Aurora shooting, we all stand together as Americans," said Steven Law, the group's president.
A super PAC supporting the president, Priorities Action USA, also said its ads were suspended.
Colorado is one of the handful of battleground states where a fierce advertising war is playing out. Lately, most of those ads have been attack ads.
President Obama's campaign had been airing three searing attacks on Mr. Romney in Colorado. One mocked Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, showing him singing "America the Beautiful" as headlines about his holdings in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands flashed on the screen. Another cited Mr. Romney's opposition to abortion. And a third says his economic plan would raise taxes on 18 million working families.
The two English-language ads Mr. Romney has been running in Colorado accuse Mr. Obama of showering his friends and campaign contributorswith federal stimulus dollars and of lyingabout Mr. Romney's business record.

HEADLINE: Bank of England Says New York Fed Gave No Warning on Rate-Rigging

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: American authorities did not warn British officials about the rate-rigging scandal during the height of the financial crisis in 2008, according to documents released by the Bank of England on Friday. 

 BODY:
LONDON - American authorities did not warn British officials about the rate-rigging scandal at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, according to documents released by the Bank of England on Friday.
The e-mails from the British central bank shed new light on conversations between Mervyn A. King, the Bank of England governor, and Timothy F. Geithner, who was head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at time of the discussions.
The documents will increase pressure on American and British officials, who have come under mounting scrutiny from politicians about why they did not respond more quickly to potential illegal activity at some of the world's largest banks.
 Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, talked to Barclays and a number of other global banks during 2008 about potential problems with how the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, was set, according to documents released on Friday. Despite the conversations, some traders and senior executives at Barclays continue to alter the rate until 2009.
The e-mails outline the Bank of England's discussions with both the New York Fed and the British Bankers' Association, the London-based trade body that oversees Libor. The conversations center on concerns about how the rate was set.
The documents also called on the British Bankers' Association to conduct a review, including input from international government agencies, to ensure the credibility of the rate.
"I don't see that a group of junior bankers in London can decide this without a global debate," Mr. Tucker wrote in an e-mail in May 2008.
The call for a review into Libor in 2008 came after Mr. King and Mr. Geithner had talked about potential problems with the rate during a meeting in Basel, Switzerland, in early May 2008.
This discussion was followed by a flurry of e-mails a month later in which Mr. Geithner, who is now the Treasury secretary, recommended changes to the rate, which is used as a benchmark for more than $360 trillion financial products worldwide.
The suggestions included ''strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure'' and ''eliminate incentive to misreport,'' according to documents released by the New York Fed.
Mr. King told Mr. Geithner that he supported the suggestions. Yet the New York Fed did not make any allegations of wrongful behavior connected to Libor, according to documents released on Friday. Mr. King told a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Mr. Geithner's suggestions did not represent a warning about the potential manipulation of Libor.
''At no stage did he or anyone else at the New York Fed raise any concerns with the bank that they had seen any wrongdoing,'' Mr. King said. ''There was no suggestion of fraudulent behavior.''
Other senior British officials also said that they did not believe that the New York Fed had raised concerns about possible illegal activity connected to Libor.
Mr. Tucker, who is a potential successor to Mr. King, held several conversations with the New York Fed in May and June, 2008 about the American suggestions for change the rate-setting process, according to the documents released on Friday.
Despite the discussions, the recommendations ''didn't set off alarm bells,'' Mr. Tucker told British politicians on Tuesday.
In the wake of a public outcry against the Libor scandal, Mr. King wrote to central bank chiefs this week, inviting them to discuss Libor reforms at meeting scheduled for September.
Questions about the rate, however, had been raised as far back as 2007.
Barclays acknowledged to the New York Fed in April 2008 that it was reporting artificially low rates to mask its relatively high borrowing costs. The British bank also raised questions about whether other institutions were providing correct submissions to Libor. The concerns about the integrity of the rate were passed to Mr. Geithner and other top American officials, according to documents released last week.
American authorities began an investigation into potential manipulation of Libor at some of the world's largest banks in 2008. The Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, opened its own inquiry in early 2010.
In the first settlement related to the international investigation, Barclays agreed to pay around $450 million to American and British authorities after some of the firm's traders and senior executives were found to have altered the rate for financial gain.
Regulators' failure to question the rate-setting process stemmed from a widespread view that Libor was a low-risk area of the financial services industry, according to parliamentary testimony from senior British officials.
The British Bankers' Association continues to have receive minimal oversight from British authorities. The country's government has started an investigation into how the rate is set.
''There was no indication between 2005 and 2007 that the Financial Services Authority perceived the submission produced for Libor as a risk area,'' the regulator's chairman, Adair Turner, told a British parliamentary committee.
Mr. Turner did acknowledge that the chance of ''deliberate manipulation was just waiting to happen.''
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, put it more bluntly during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee this week, saying he lacked ''full confidence'' in the accuracy of the rate-setting process.

HEADLINE: Libor Case Documents Show Timid Regulators

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Documents released on Friday show that regulators balked at playing a more public role in reform efforts in 2008, and some British officials pushed back on certain fixes. 

 BODY:
As an interest rate manipulation scandal grips the banking industry, regulators have defended their actions and trumpeted their efforts to overhaul the flawed system during the financial crisis.
But documents released on Friday show that regulators balked at playing a more public role in reform efforts during 2008, and some British officials resisted certain fixes.
Although the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England advocated changes to the rate-setting process, they demanded anonymity. In shunning the spotlight, the regulators deferred to the British Bankers' Association, a private industry group that oversees the rate-setting process.
 "They will obviously have to remove the references to us and Fed," a Bank of England official said in a June 2008 e-mail, referring to a draft of the trade group's proposal.
The documents, released by the Bank of England, shed new light on the inconsistent regulatory response to problems with the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The crucial benchmark affects the cost of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans.
Authorities around the globe are investigating whether more than 10 banks reported false rates to produce profits and deflect concerns about their well-being. In June, Barclays reached a $450 million settlement with regulators over rate-rigging, the first case to stem from the broad investigation. The wrongdoing at Barclays intensified during the financial crisis, when the bank lowballed its rate out of fear that high borrowing costs indicated weak health.
After the Barclays case, lawmakers in London and Washington are questioning why regulators were not more aggressive in thwarting the illegal activities. The House Financial Services Committee is collecting transcripts of calls between regulators and the banks under scrutiny.
The trove of e-mails and documents released on Friday builds on what regulators have disclosed in pieces over the last few weeks.
The New York Fed previously divulged that it learned in April 2008 that Barclays was reporting false rates, a revelation that came months after hearing market chatter about issues with Libor. In testimony before Parliament this week, British authorities said the New York Fed never told them that Barclays was breaking the law.
Instead, Timothy F. Geithner, who served as the head of the New York Fed at the time, proposed changes to the rate-setting process. The Bank of England echoed the recommendations.
But the new documents suggest that the British central bank heard complaints about potential Libor manipulation in 2007, sooner than previously known. Despite the knowledge, the documents show that Bank of England officials failed to stop the illegal actions and dismissed some of Mr. Geithner's plans to fix the process.
In part, officials at the British central bank were unsure about the extent of the Libor problems. Some issues "might go away with time," one Bank of England official said in a June 2008 e-mail. The regulator also acknowledged that some market participants saw fundamental flaws with the system. "Since August 2007, this problem has become more severe," a Bank of England official wrote in an internal memo in May 2008. "There is a longstanding perception that Libor by virtue of the manner in which it is set is open to distortion."
By the middle of 2008, there was a consensus among British and American authorities that the rate-setting process - whether or not it was deliberately manipulated - needed to be fixed.
In an e-mail to Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Geithner recommended that British officials "strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure" and "eliminate incentive to misreport," according to documents released last week. Mr. King replied that the ideas "seem sensible," and he agreed to pass them on to the British Bankers' Association.
Both the New York Fed and the Bank of England pushed the trade group to beef up its proposal and ensure that the rate-setting process was accurate. The changes focused on improving Libor's governance procedures, including audits into how banks submitted rates. Officials also wanted to ensure that the Libor-setting process was more transparent and featured rates from a broader panel of financial institutions.
But within the Bank of England, new documents show, some central bank officials undermined parts of Mr. Geithner's plan.
The New York Fed recommended, for example, that the British Bankers' Association could randomly select rates from banks. A Bank of England official said it "does not seem such a good idea," according to the documents released on Friday. Another idea to poll banks twice daily about their rates, rather than just once in the morning, will "create more difficult issues than it solves," a different official said.
Instead, some Bank of England officials seemed to support a plan to have "a panel of senior bankers overseeing" the Libor process. In essence, the central bank wanted to let a wider set of firms police themselves.
At the same time, neither the New York Fed nor the Bank of England was willing to help oversee Libor. Authorities say they could not provide the government's official stamp of approval to a for-profit plan. The regulators also hoped to keep open the possibility that alternatives would emerge to compete with Libor.
A Bank of England official said in a June 2008 e-mail that "we have a clear line" that the central bank's name "should not be used." The official proposed a broader phrase instead: "all interested parties."
That approach upset the trade group, which said the new wording "is just too weak." The British Bankers' Association argued that government had an interest in protecting the integrity of Libor.
The lobbying became so fierce that a Bank of England official noted that the trade group "is close to desperate for even a small hook to imply that there will be a dialogue with central banks."
After months of discussions, the regulators got their way. The final wording of the Libor review, which was published in late 2008, did not refer to specific central bank authorities.

HEADLINE: Employment Breakdown by State Shows Little Change in June

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Payrolls increased in 29 states in June, while 21 lost jobs, indicating limited progress in the United States labor market.
The unemployment rate rose in 27 states, fell in 11 and in the District of Columbia and was unchanged in 12 states. California led the nation with a 38,300 jobs gained, with Ohio next with an increase of 18,400 jobs, the Labor Department reported on Friday in Washington. 
Companies last month added the fewest workers in almost a year, concluding the worst quarter for corporate hiring since the first three months of 2010, according to national figures released July 6. Employment in the three-year economic expansion has been slow to recover in some states that are contending with weaker housing markets or industries.
''We see a lack of diversity in some of the economies,'' Michael Brown, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N. C., said before the report was released. ''That puts them at risk for cyclical swings. Not only do you have economic fundamentals at work, you have demographics at work.''
Alabama and New Jersey showed the biggest increases in unemployment. The rate in Alabama climbed to 7.8 percent in June from 7.4 percent the previous month. New Jersey's unemployment rate jumped to 9.6 percent in June, the highest in almost two years, from 9.2 percent as more people entered the labor force looking for work.
Nevada continued to have the nation's highest unemployment rate, at 11.6 percent. Rhode Island was second, with a rate of 10.9 percent, followed by California at 10.7 percent.
North Dakota had the lowest unemployment in the nation, at 2.9 percent, followed by Nebraska at 3.8 percent.
States showing the largest decreases in employment were Wisconsin, Tennessee and Maryland.
State and local employment data are derived independently from the national statistics, which are typically released on the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Employers nationwide added 80,000 jobs last month, after 77,000 in May, Labor Department data showed on July 6. Private payrolls climbed 84,000 in June, the weakest in 10 months.
The unemployment rate, which held at 8.2 percent in June, has been 8 percent or higher since February 2009.
New York's jobless rate rose to 8.9 percent from 8.6 percent in May. In New York City, unemployment climbed to 10 percent, matching a postrecession peak reached in the six months through February 2010, from 9.7 percent, a report showed July 19.

HEADLINE: Mourning and Mulling

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
America is aching.
There are some events that we never grow numb to, things that weigh heavily on our sense of humanity and national psyche.
Early Friday morning, 24-year-old James Holmes, masked and armed, entered a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and opened fire. After things settled, at least 12 people were dead and 59 were left wounded.
It is on days like this that we are reminded of how much more alike than different we are, when we see that tears have no color, when ideologies melt into a common heart broken by sorrow. 
But it is also on days like this that the questions invariably come.
They are questions about the shooter. How deep must the hole have been in his life? How untenable was the ache? How cold must the heart have grown? When did he cross the line from malcontent to monster?
But there are also questions for us as a country and as a people. We are called to question our values and our laws, and those obviously include our gun laws.
My own feelings on the matter are complicated.
I grew up in a small town in northern Louisiana -- in the sticks. Everyone there seemed to own guns, even the children. My brothers slept beneath a gun rack that hung over their bed. Women carried handguns for protection. Even now, my oldest brother is an amateur gun dealer, buying and selling guns at his local gun shows.
There are parts of America where guns are simply part of the culture, either for hunting and keeping the vermin out of the garden (there are more humane methods of doing this, of course, but some people simply have their ways), or for collecting.
(According to a 2011 Gallup poll, 45 percent of Americans have a gun in their home.)
But, as a child, I also saw how guns could be used in a fit of anger or after a few swigs of liquor. And I have seen the damage they do to the fabric of society in big cities where criminals and cowards alike use them to settle disputes and even scores.
While I hesitate to issue blanket condemnations about gun ownership -- my upbringing simply doesn't support that -- common sense would seem to dictate that it is prudent and wise to consider the place of guns in modern societies. It has been some time since we have needed to raise a militia, but senseless violence is all too common. The right to bear arms is constitutional, but the right to be safe even if you don't bear arms would seem universal. We must ask ourselves the hard question: Can both rights be equally protected and how can they best be balanced?
As Howard Steven Friedman, a statistician and health economist for the United Nations, wrote for The Huffington Post in April:
''America's homicide rates, incarceration rates and gun ownership rates are all much higher than other wealthy countries. While the data associated with crime is imperfect, these facts all point to the idea that America is more violent than many other wealthy countries.'' This is not the way in which we should seek to excel.
There are whole swaths of gun owners who don't use their guns in a criminal way. But many of the people who use guns to commit murder are also law-abiding until they're not. (Holmes's only previous brush with the law seems to have been a 2011 traffic summons.) We shouldn't simply wait for the bodies to fall to separate the wheat from the chaff.
One step in the right direction would be to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Even coming from a gun culture, I cannot rationalize the sale of assault weapons to everyday citizens. (The Washington Post reported that Holmes had a shotgun, two pistols and an AR-15 assault rifle, all legally purchased.)
But this will be an uphill battle because the National Rifle Association has been extremely effective at promoting its agenda and sowing fears that gun rights are in jeopardy even when they are not. Much of that campaign has been aimed at painting President Obama as an enemy of the Second Amendment, and it has been exceedingly successful.
That 2011 Gallup poll, in a reversal from previous polls, found that most people are now against an assault weapons ban. (In general, the desire for stricter gun control laws has been falling for the last two decades.)
We simply have to take some reasonable steps toward making sure that all our citizens are kept safer -- those with guns and those without.
We can't keep digging graves where common ground should be.

BULGARIAN OFFICIAL SAYS
BOMBER WAS A FOREIGNER
Bulgarian police fanned out across the tranquil beach towns along the Black Sea searching for clues to the identity of the bomber who blew up a bus filled with Israeli tourists. Bulgaria's interior minister said at a news conference that investigators had determined that the suicide bomber, who died along with five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver, was a foreigner. Page A4
A HARD LINE ON PROTESTERS 
When four young women performed a crude anti-Putin song at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow in February, it seemed like just one more episode in a season of protest. But the three women were arrested after the performance and have been held in custody for more than four months, a term that was extended by six months and they could be sent to prison for seven years. Page A4
SYRIA MONITORING EXTENDED
With violence reaching new heights in Syria, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a 30-day extension of the monitor mission, throwing what amounted to a thin lifeline to Kofi Annan, the special envoy in the Syrian conflict, to save his paralyzed peace plan from total irrelevance. Page A7
SENEGAL GIVEN ULTIMATUM
The International Court of Justice ordered Senegal to prosecute the former president of Chad, Hissene Habre, who has lived comfortably for two decades in Senegal despite indictments in connection with political killings, torture and a host of other brutalities. The court decision could also affect exiled leaders in other countries. Page A8
CHANGE IN KOREA MILITARY
The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has begun stripping his country's powerful military of its lucrative export rights in a bold attempt intended to both rejuvenate the staggering economy and curtail top generals' influence, according to a Seoul-based Web site run by defectors from North Korea.

WASHINGTON IN LIMBO
AMID MAYOR'S WOES
Mayor Vincent C. Gray of Washington's 18-month-old administration has all but come undone under the weight of criminal charges against supporters who helped him get elected, leaving this scandal-weary city in political limbo. Page A9
D.C. BUILDING HEIGHTS
More than a century after Congress put a limit on the height of buildings in the District of Columbia, Washington is reprising a debate over whether taller buildings should be allowed. Supporters say easing the restriction would be an economic boon to the city. Opponents worry that taller buildings could compromise its short-statured charm. Page A14
GUN DEBATE IN COLORADO
The news of the armed assault in Aurora, Colo. -- just a half-hour drive from the site of the Columbine High School shootings in 1999 -- has a freakish resonance in a state that has long played an unsought role in the national debate over gun laws and firearm rights. Page A13

MOURNING THE CHANGES
TO A HARLEM INSTITUTION
Sylvia's opened in Harlem in 1962 as not much more than a counter with more stools than tables and has since evolved into a big business. While the restaurant is still celebrated as an institution, some longtime residents of the neighborhood say a bit of its appeal has been lost. Page A15

EUROPE AGENCY SUGGESTS
APPROVAL OF GENE THERAPY
The European Medicines Agency has recommended approval of a gene therapy to treat a rare genetic disease, according to the agency's Web site. If the European Commission follows the advice, this would be the first regulatory approval of a gene therapy drug in the Western world. Page B1
NEW DATA IN LIBOR SCANDAL
As the interest-rate manipulation scandal grips the banking industry, regulators have trumpeted their actions and efforts to overhaul the flawed system. But recently released documents show that they balked at playing a more public role in the reform in 2008. Page B1
LOOKING TO SWISS BANK
As the Justice Department weighs the possibility of criminal charges in the unfolding Libor rate-setting scandal, it may want to consider the record of the Swiss banking giant UBS. Common Sense, James B. Stewart. Page B1

In a decision that appeared to unsettle some investors, the European Central Bank said that it would at least temporarily stop accepting Greek government bonds as collateral for low-cost loans. Page B3

ARTISTIC DIRECTOR RETIRES
FROM BRITAIN'S ROYAL BALLET
When Monica Mason retires as artistic director of Britain's Royal Ballet this weekend, she will have served the company for 54 years. While a few artists have served ballet companies longer, none spring to mind who have worked in as many capacities, writes Alastair Macaulay. Page C1
'EMILIE' AT LINCOLN CENTER
Kaija Saariaho's ''Emilie'' is a monodrama for soprano and orchestra that lasts about 75 minutes and is presented by the Lincoln Center Festival at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater. The monodrama genre may not be able to prop up a work of that length, even something as involving and intense this one, writes Anthony Tommasini. Page C1

 BODY:
Nik Wallenda promised that his tightrope crossing over Niagara Falls would generate untold millions in free publicity for a struggling corner of upstate New York.
But the City of Niagara Falls, N.Y., says Mr. Wallenda's feat left it with something else: about $25,000 in unpaid overtime bills for police officers and firefighters.
A month after his stunt, Mr. Wallenda and the mayor of Niagara Falls are locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over whether Mr. Wallenda, a seventh-generation circus performer, owes money to the city that he had said his high-wire act would help revitalize. 
City officials say Mr. Wallenda's team took advantage of their hospitality. Mr. Wallenda says he was stabbed in the back. Neither side appears close to giving in.
''I'm the mayor of a poor city,'' said Paul A. Dyster, adding, ''We have tried to be very patient.''
Mr. Wallenda's 1,800-foot crossing transfixed a national television audience and generated a wave of publicity that the falls had not experienced in decades. It seemed like a particular coup for the economically depressed American side of the falls, creating an instant hero and a point of pride for a city that has lost more than half its population in the last half century.
Mr. Dyster was ungrateful and unwise in picking a fight, Mr. Wallenda said, adding, ''It's either politics, or he doesn't care about the city.''
The feud, which drew front-page coverage in The Buffalo News on Friday, hinges on whether Mr. Wallenda should pay for work by dozens of police officers and firefighters called in by the city around the time of his performance.
When Mr. Wallenda asked state lawmakers last year to enact special legislation to give him permission to undertake his crossing, they included a provision requiring him to pay for ''reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement'' stemming from his walk.
Mr. Wallenda's lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said that Mr. Wallenda's starting point was in a state park overlooking the falls and that the Wallenda group had paid the state $200,000 for costs associated with the event. He said any money the city spent was related only to its ''exploitation of the event,'' not the walk itself.
''They claim to be broke all the time,'' Mr. Bartolomei said of city officials, ''but don't put it on Nik Wallenda's shoulders. All he did was good things. He got the city tens of millions of free worldwide advertising.''
Mr. Wallenda, speaking by phone from Branson, Mo., where he was performing, said the disagreement had left a sour taste in his mouth.
''In my heart of hearts, I go, 'Who cares about the mayor?' because this is about Nik Wallenda doing something good for the area,'' Mr. Wallenda said. ''But it irks me, for sure.''
Mr. Dyster maintains that the city, which has a budget of roughly $100 million, is just trying to collect the money it was promised, and that Mr. Wallenda clearly had an obligation to the city as well as to the state. After all, the mayor asked, how would people have gotten to the state park if the city had not kept traffic flowing on city streets?
His administration has calculated overtime for the police and fire departments at $42,700. First Niagara Bank donated $17,500 to defray those costs, and the city wants Mr. Wallenda to pay the balance.
''This was not a charitable enterprise; it was a private business venture,'' Mr. Dyster said, adding, ''I cannot gift taxpayer money to people.''
The City of Niagara Falls, Ontario, which is far more of a tourist attraction than its American counterpart, is taking a different approach. Its mayor, Jim Diodati, said the city still had about $10,000 in personnel costs stemming from the time of Mr. Wallenda's walk, but it was not looking for any money from him.
''I see it as an investment,'' Mr. Diodati said. ''It's like the goose that lays the golden egg. You don't want to put too much stress on that goose.''
Mr. Wallenda, for his part, said he had been hoping to open a Wallenda-themed exhibition -- perhaps someday a full-scale museum -- in Niagara Falls, N.Y. But he suggested he might have to rethink the location.
''It definitely makes me go, 'Well, why would I want to give back to the city if the mayor is so arrogant?' '' Mr. Wallenda said.
''That's why New York looks the way it does and Canada looks the way it does,'' he added. ''Because of that attitude.''

HEADLINE: Woeful Trenton Sees Mayor Add Insult to Injury

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
TRENTON -- To measure the decay here in New Jersey's capital, residents could have counted the unfilled public pools, the shuttered libraries and police stations, the block after block of boarded-up stores and homes.
But they did not need to go that far. The city was falling apart from the top.
It started just a month after Mayor Tony F. Mack took office in 2010, when his housing director quit after it was revealed that the official had being indicted on charges of forgery and theft. Two months later, one of his judicial appointees quit over bad checks and unpaid debt, and his business administrator -- the second of seven, during just nine months -- resigned, having stolen from a Congressional campaign.
Then the mayor's half brother was indicted on a charge of using city resources to do private work. And the chief of staff who Mr. Mack promised would finally bring order resigned after the police said they found him near City Hall with heroin. 
So it was momentous but not surprising when the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided City Hall on Thursday morning after descending with search warrants the morning before on the homes of the mayor, his brother and one of the mayor's chief donors.
''What took the F.B.I. so long to get here?'' George Muschal, a councilman, demanded. ''It's full-blown corruption.''
Mr. Mack, 46, said on Thursday in a statement that he had not violated the public trust and that he would not comment further. No one answered the door at his home on Friday.
Like other manufacturing cities that have stopped thriving, Trenton has been bedeviled by decades of poverty and a low property tax base. But if other mayors merely find themselves unable to reverse those currents, Mr. Mack has been exceptional for the amount of disruption he has brought to an already broken city, all in just two years.
He has laid off one-third of the police force, even as the city was paying to create a portrait wall of mayors at City Hall. Swing sets in the city's once-glorious Cadwalader Park have no swings, but he spent $17,000 for a sign over the entrance with his name prominently displayed.
Last year, after discovering a failure at the city's filtration plant, he waited two days to tell residents to boil their water. In February, municipal buildings ran out of toilet paper while Mr. Mack squabbled with the City Council over a contract for paper products.
Along the way, the mayor's campaign finances were investigated, he sued a former employee who said she had suffered reprisal for exposing wrongdoing, and he narrowly averted foreclosure on his home.
There have been no criminal charges filed against him. But there is not much confidence left, either.
''He promised 'safe, clean and prosperous,' '' Mr. Muschal said. ''How is it safe with 108 cops laid off? How could it ever be prosperous?''
No one denies Trenton had problems before Tony Mack. Once it was a center for the manufacturing of ceramics, rubber, steel and iron. The famous sign on one bridge still commemorates the city's industrial past -- ''Trenton Makes, the World Takes'' -- but residents acknowledged there was some poetic truth when the lights in the letters began failing before recent repairs, leaving it ''Trenton akes.''
''The city has promoted this culture where there's favoritism and cronyism,'' said Tyrone Gaskins, who served on the mayor's transition team but has become a critic. ''It's 'You've got to support me or you're not going to be able to work.' ''
When the previous mayor, Douglas Palmer, decided to retire after 20 years, Mr. Mack, who had run against him before, had the best name recognition.
The city is about 52 percent black and 34 percent Hispanic; Mr. Mack, a Democrat who is black, won against a Hispanic candidate in a nonpartisan runoff in June 2010.
''We told him, 'It's not about you; it's about serving the people of the city who are in dire, dire straits,' '' Mr. Gaskins said. ''He just hasn't done that. He's been in the service of his interests and his cronies.''
Mr. Mack got rid of many longtime department heads, and with them, institutional knowledge. A seasoned business administrator who arrived to great fanfare lasted four weeks, quitting after the mayor ignored his warnings not to hire a friend, who had been indicted on the forgery and theft charges.
When the Council began questioning his hiring, the mayor accused its members of ''conniving'' against him.
With the State Department of Community Affairs pressuring him over his management, Mr. Mack in 2011 hired Paul Sigmund IV, who served with him on the county board years earlier. Mr. Sigmund was well educated, the son of a former mayor of nearby Princeton Borough and the grandson of Hale and Lindy Boggs, who had represented Louisiana in Congress. But he had little government experience. Two months later, in May, he resigned after the police arrested him with heroin.
A campaign to recall Mr. Mack started the next month. It gathered more signatures than Mr. Mack had won votes, but it failed to meet the state threshold, 25 percent of registered voters.
Two months after the effort failed, Mr. Mack asked the Council to raise his pay by $28,000, to $154,000. It declined. The state also made some aid contingent on the hiring of candidates it had approved.
Reed Gusciora, a Democrat who represents Trenton in the State Assembly, said the city could ask for more state aid, or payments in lieu of taxes for buildings the state government uses tax free.
''But you can't even make the pitch to the governor or the Legislature because no one believes that we're going to spend the money wisely,'' he said.
And business leaders have reported that they have met with department heads, he said, only to follow up and discover that there was a new head, and then another. ''In a tight economy, a businessman is not going to take chances on that,'' Mr. Gusciora said.
On Thursday, Mr. Mack issued a directive making the latest business administrator acting mayor while he was absent, but he gave no indication where he was going. At his house, in a historic district of large homes, the blinds were pulled on Friday.
He has found support from people who came up, as he did, from the city's poorer neighborhoods.
But there are signs of growing weariness. In Cadwalader Park, just up the hill from the sign the mayor had erected with his name, a lamppost had cracked and fallen. Underneath its smashed lantern, someone had pasted a bumper sticker: ''Tony F. Mack.''

HEADLINE: Libor Case Documents Show Timid Regulators

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
Although the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England advocated changes to the rate-setting process, they demanded anonymity. In shunning the spotlight, the regulators deferred to the British Bankers' Association, a private industry group that oversees the rate-setting process.
''They will obviously have to remove the references to us and Fed,'' a Bank of England official said in a June 2008 e-mail, referring to a draft of the trade group's proposal. 
The documents, released by the Bank of England, shed new light on the inconsistent regulatory response to problems with the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The crucial benchmark affects the cost of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans.
Authorities around the globe are investigating whether more than 10 banks reported false rates to produce profits and deflect concerns about their well-being. In June, Barclays reached a $450 million settlement with regulators over rate-rigging, the first case to stem from the broad investigation. The wrongdoing at Barclays intensified during the financial crisis, when the bank lowballed its rate out of fear that high borrowing costs indicated weak health.
After the Barclays case, lawmakers in London and Washington are questioning why regulators were not more aggressive in thwarting the illegal activities. The House Financial Services Committee is collecting transcripts of calls between regulators and the banks under scrutiny.
The trove of e-mails and documents released on Friday builds on what regulators have disclosed in pieces over the last few weeks.
The New York Fed previously divulged that it learned in April 2008 that Barclays was reporting false rates, a revelation that came months after hearing market chatter about issues with Libor. In testimony before Parliament this week, British authorities said the New York Fed never told them that Barclays was breaking the law.
Instead, Timothy F. Geithner, who served as the head of the New York Fed at the time, proposed changes to the rate-setting process. The Bank of England echoed the recommendations.
But the new documents suggest that the British central bank heard complaints about potential Libor manipulation in 2007, sooner than previously known. Despite the knowledge, the documents show that Bank of England officials failed to stop the illegal actions and dismissed some of Mr. Geithner's plans to fix the process.
In part, officials at the British central bank were unsure about the extent of the Libor problems. Some issues ''might go away with time,'' one Bank of England official said in a June 2008 e-mail. The regulator also acknowledged that some market participants saw fundamental flaws with the system. ''Since August 2007, this problem has become more severe,'' a Bank of England official wrote in an internal memo in May 2008. ''There is a longstanding perception that Libor by virtue of the manner in which it is set is open to distortion.''
By the middle of 2008, there was a consensus among British and American authorities that the rate-setting process - whether or not it was deliberately manipulated - needed to be fixed.
In an e-mail to Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Geithner recommended that British officials ''strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure'' and ''eliminate incentive to misreport,'' according to documents released last week. Mr. King replied that the ideas ''seem sensible,'' and he agreed to pass them on to the British Bankers' Association.
Both the New York Fed and the Bank of England pushed the trade group to beef up its proposal and ensure that the rate-setting process was accurate. The changes focused on improving Libor's governance procedures, including audits into how banks submitted rates. Officials also wanted to ensure that the Libor-setting process was more transparent and featured rates from a broader panel of financial institutions.
But within the Bank of England, new documents show, some central bank officials undermined parts of Mr. Geithner's plan.
The New York Fed recommended, for example, that the British Bankers' Association could randomly select rates from banks. A Bank of England official said it ''does not seem such a good idea,'' according to the documents released on Friday. Another idea to poll banks twice daily about their rates, rather than just once in the morning, will ''create more difficult issues than it solves,'' a different official said.
Instead, some Bank of England officials seemed to support a plan to have ''a panel of senior bankers overseeing'' the Libor process. In essence, the central bank wanted to let a wider set of firms police themselves.
At the same time, neither the New York Fed nor the Bank of England was willing to help oversee Libor. Authorities say they could not provide the government's official stamp of approval to a for-profit plan. The regulators also hoped to keep open the possibility that alternatives would emerge to compete with Libor.
A Bank of England official said in a June 2008 e-mail that ''we have a clear line'' that the central bank's name ''should not be used.'' The official proposed a broader phrase instead: ''all interested parties.''
That approach upset the trade group, which said the new wording ''is just too weak.'' The British Bankers' Association argued that government had an interest in protecting the integrity of Libor.
The lobbying became so fierce that a Bank of England official noted that the trade group ''is close to desperate for even a small hook to imply that there will be a dialogue with central banks.''
After months of discussions, the regulators got their way. The final wording of the Libor review, which was published in late 2008, did not refer to specific central bank authorities.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Troubles Mount in Scandal-Weary Capital

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY and THEO EMERY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The news conference was of the routine sort, announcing a small-business initiative. And, as could be expected, at the lectern stood Mayor Vincent C. Gray, praising the city's growing entrepreneurial spirit as though nothing were amiss.
''We are working hard,'' a jovial Mr. Gray told the crowd at lunchtime on Tuesday in an Anacostia office building. ''For me, this is an exciting time to build on work that's been done.''
Even as he proceeds with ribbon-cuttings and official announcements, however, Mr. Gray's 18-month-old administration has all but come undone under the weight of criminal charges against supporters who helped him get elected, leaving this scandal-weary city in political limbo.
Last week, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, Ronald C. Machen Jr., revealed a well-financed ''shadow campaign'' that secretly pumped more than $650,000 into Mr. Gray's 2010 race against the incumbent mayor, Adrian M. Fenty, financed by contributions from a city contractor with whom Mr. Gray has close ties. 
Mr. Gray asserts that he knew nothing of the scheme, an assertion that many critics dismiss as unlikely. Privately, associates of the mayor and other elected officials have begun to consider contingency plans, should they wake up to news that he is no longer the chief executive of the nation's capital.
It is not the first time scandal has touched his administration. Two political allies pleaded guilty in May for their roles in paying a minor mayoral candidate to attack Mr. Fenty publicly during the campaign. The administration then hired the candidate, Sulaimon Brown, but later fired him. That prompted Mr. Brown to go public about his role.
Mr. Gray has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. He says the federal investigation into his campaign has not affected his day-to-day management.
Yet this shocked city, which delivered Mr. Gray a decisive victory in 2010, is left wondering whether its mayor is in denial or simply biding his time. Will he be the subject of a criminal complaint that will force him from office? If not, might he resign anyway, as numerous prominent Washingtonians, including three City Council members, have demanded?
A Washington Post poll released on Thursday indicated that a majority of residents now question the mayor's integrity and think he should resign.
David A. Catania, a City Council member who called for the mayor's resignation, said that many in the city were contemplating a post-Gray government, and that some were planning for the special election that would result.
Others are just trying to understand the unraveling of what seemed like a promising administration -- all in less than two years' time.
''All of us are scratching our heads, trying to figure out, 'What happened?' '' said Ann Loikow, a retired banking lawyer and neighborhood activist who supported the candidacy of Mr. Gray, who had been City Council chairman. ''I was shocked to see all of this stuff unfold.'' She added, ''He was seen as an ethical and intelligent public servant, a native Washingtonian who really cared and understood the city.''
Barbara Lang, president of the local Chamber of Commerce, added, ''I'm very angry about this because I was very much a part of helping him get elected.''
Though there had been reports about the shadow campaign for months, the scheme came into sharp focus last week when a longtime ally of Mr. Gray's pleaded guilty to a city campaign finance violation, among other crimes.
The defendant, Eugenia C. Harris, was a conduit for fake campaign donations and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Gray campaign expenses that tainted the election's outcome.
''The large-scale shadow campaign we had here,'' Mr. Machen said in an interview, ''is unprecedented.''
The campaign revelations came on the heels of several tumultuous months here. In January, a City Council member, Harry Thomas Jr., resigned after he was charged with stealing public money intended for a children's charity. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nearly three years in prison.
Last month, the chairman of the Council, Kwame Brown, pleaded guilty to bank fraud and a campaign finance violation, resulting in a reshuffling of the council. Mr. Brown is scheduled to be sentenced in the fall.
Mr. Brown's and Mr. Thomas's actions were unrelated to Mr. Gray. But in the minds of some people here, the guilty pleas in the municipal government and from the campaign swirl together to paint an ugly picture, and Mr. Gray is somewhere in the frame, however fuzzy.
Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for Mr. Gray, said he had advised Mr. Gray not to comment on the shadow campaign during the investigation.
Mr. Bennett also said Mr. Gray was being treated unfairly. ''There is a rush to judgment based on speculation and a presumption of guilt,'' he said. ''He has not been charged with anything, much less convicted.''
Those who have spoken privately with Mr. Gray say he finds his situation maddening. ''He is disappointed and angry,'' Ms. Lang said. ''But I've never seen someone who is more resolute about serving this city.''
So there has been mostly silence from the mayor, except at choreographed news briefings.
There are echoes, of course, from notorious scandals in Washington's past, most memorably those of the early 1990s, when in his third term as mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr. was videotaped in a hotel room smoking crack cocaine in a sting by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He served six months in prison. In 1994, he regained the mayor's office for a fourth term, and he remains on the City Council today.
''You have to come away from this with a feeling of 'What has happened here?' '' said Anne Renshaw, president of the Federation of Citizens Associations of the District of Columbia. ''And why won't we get a government that is steady and absolutely straightforward?''
But Mr. Gray is not Mr. Barry, and Washington today is not the struggling city it was in the 1990s.
With a meticulous reputation, Mr. Gray swept into office as a man of the people, and by many accounts, the city has thrived under his tenure. Construction projects that had long been stalled have sprung back to life. Residents say city services are dependable. And with its bustling business corridors, the city has developed a strong reputation as business-friendly.
It follows, then, that Mr. Gray is not without loyal supporters. On Wednesday, a coalition of Christian ministers held a rally outside City Hall to pray for him and demand that he be treated with ''justice, honor and dignity.''
For his part, Mr. Gray is carrying on in wards where he has a lot of support. At a ribbon-cutting for a new crossing light this week, he said, ''We're going forward and doing our job, as we indicated we would do.''
At another briefing that day, a city department head praised the mayor for his ''energy and leadership.'' The city's falling unemployment rate was cited, as were the number of buildings under construction. ''That is a big deal,'' said Victor Hoskins, a deputy mayor. ''Look at the cranes.''
To some observers, it felt less like a news conference than a farewell tribute.

HEADLINE: Private Pension Plans, Even at Big Companies, May Be Underfunded

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AFTER years of poor investment returns, the pension funds of the United States' largest companies are further behind than they have ever been.
The companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 collectively reported that at the end of their most recent fiscal years, their pension plans had obligations of $1.68 trillion and assets of just $1.32 trillion. The difference of $355 billion was the largest ever, S.& P. said in a report.
Of the 500 companies, 338 have defined-benefit pension plans, and only 18 are fully funded. Seven companies reported that their plans were underfunded by more than $10 billion, with the largest negative figure, $21.6 billion, reported by General Electric. 
The other companies with more than $10 billion in underfunding were AT&T, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, I.B.M. and Lockheed Martin. JPMorgan Chase had the largest amount of overfunding, $1.6 billion.
The main cause of the underfunding at many companies does not appear to be a failure to make contributions to the plans. Instead, it reflects the fact that investment markets have not performed well for a sustained period.
As the accompanying charts show, over the last 15 years, the S.& P. 500 rose at an annual rate of less than 5 percent, even with dividends reinvested. Not since 1945 had a 15-year period been so bleak for the stock market. The Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which includes all investment grade bonds, returned 6.3 percent, but that, too, was lower than it had been for a long time.
Virtually all pension funds had assumed returns would be better, leaving them underfunded when their investments failed to perform as expected.
The prolonged poor performance of stocks has led some companies to move away from them. Seven years ago, S.& P. said, stocks made up 65 percent of pension-fund assets and bonds made up 29 percent, with the remaining assets in real estate and other investments, like private equity funds. By last year, stocks were down to 48 percent and bonds up to 41 percent.
The stock market's poor performance has also convinced some companies that they no longer want to take the risk of guaranteeing pension payments. Many have closed their pension plans to newer employees and stopped accruing benefits for workers already in them. Instead, they have pushed employees into defined-contribution plans, in which the worker, not the employer, bears the risk of poor investment performance.
Determining whether pension funds have adequate funding is, to some extent, a work of art. Companies estimate what they will owe in the future, and then discount that number based on how long it will be until they have to pay it and the interest rate at which their pension-plan investments could grow. The discount rate used can have a significant effect.
For example, if a company estimated it would owe $1 million in 10 years and used an 8 percent discount rate, the current obligation would be $434,000. If it chose a 3 percent rate instead, the current obligation would be $737,000.
Next year, pension funds will appear to be better funded, even if they are not. Congress voted this year to allow funds to discount their obligations using a 15-year average of bond yields, meaning they can use a higher rate and so report lower obligations.
General Electric announced on Friday that it would slash its pension contributions as a result of the new law, and many other companies are expected to do the same.
Because such contributions are tax-deductible, lower deductions may mean higher tax bills, which would increase government revenue, at least for a few years.
Of course, markets will do whatever they will do, regardless of the assumptions pension-fund sponsors make. In the long run, contributing less now may simply mean companies have to contribute more later.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Underfunded Pensions: The amount by which pension plans were underfunded in the largest companies in the United States grew to a record $355 billion last year, or more than 20 percent of their assets. A chief cause of the underfunding was that fund investments, largely stocks and bonds, did not perform as well as expected in recent years. (Sources: Standard & Poor's

HEADLINE: Congress Takes New Look At Low-Slung Washington

BYLINE: By REBECCA BERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Change, if it comes to the nation's capital, will evidently be measured in feet.
More than a century after Congress put a limit on the height of buildings in the District of Columbia, Washington is reprising a debate as to whether taller buildings should be allowed.
Supporters say easing the restriction would be an economic boon to the city. Opponents worry that taller buildings could compromise the District's short-statured charm. And nearly everyone agrees that the height limits are completely arbitrary. 
At a Congressional hearing this week, lawmakers hinted that the political climate might be ripe for things to look up in the District, structurally speaking.
''Over all the years that we've had an arbitrary height limit, has it served us well?'' asked Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ''Perhaps. But it's served us without a plan.''
Washington falls back into its elevation sickness every few years, but the city itself has limited say in the matter because any change to the law must be approved by Congress. Although the Republicans leading the House largely resist federal-government intervention in their own districts, they have not shied away from intervening in Washington's affairs.
''This committee has no desire to make D.C. into the next New York,'' Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, affirmed as he opened the hearing, dismissing the concerns raised by some.
Indeed, it has been a debate given to hyperbole, and repetition. In 1988, as a change to the law was being discussed, Dorn C. McGrath Jr., then the chairman of the citizens' planning group Committee of 100 on the Federal City, told The New York Times, ''There is constant pressure to skyscraper this city.''
With the preponderance of its rooftops currently resting below triple-digit heights, Washington would be dwarfed not only by the monumental towers of New York or Chicago, some more than 1,000 feet tall, but also when measured against shorter buildings of smaller metropolises, like Atlanta or St. Louis.
The Height of Buildings Act became law in Washington first in 1899 and then, in its current form, in 1910, after residents complained about the construction of the Cairo Hotel, now an apartment building, at 160 feet tall. The limit imposed thereafter -- which is measured relative to the width of a city street but comes out roughly to 90 feet for residences and 130 feet for commercial buildings -- was agreed to arbitrarily. Were Congress to change the law, it would most likely consider raising the limit only by tens of feet, not hundreds.
If the original decision was largely aesthetic, the choice Washington now faces is steeped in economics.
From April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2011, the District of Columbia grew faster than any state, according to the Census Bureau, but height limits prevent development for businesses and residences, driving prices up and limiting taxable space.
Further exacerbating the problem is the fact that many existing buildings house the federal government and nonprofit organizations, which cannot be taxed.
''For a relatively small city that's already constrained when it comes to its land, it seems to be a particular burden for Washington,'' said Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He added, ''This is one of those things that does seem artificial, and is probably something that could stand some tweaking.''
Why the law has not been tweaked is the stuff of local lore. The popular belief that Washington's buildings must be no taller than the Capitol dome (288 feet) or the Washington Monument (just over 555 feet), for example, has become widespread -- and makes for a better yarn than the bureaucracy-steeped reality.
Bonita Richardson, a Washington resident, said she thought the law might be an anachronistic leftover from a time when the technology did not yet exist to build taller buildings, but did not really know. Regardless, she said she would support a change ''as long as it stays in good taste.''
''It's all part of progress,'' Ms. Richardson, 51, said, ''but sometimes when things get out of control it can become overwhelming, and then it's not pretty anymore.''
The emotional attachment many Washingtonians have to the city's unique aesthetic is perhaps the greatest obstacle to upward mobility of the physical kind. Laura M. Richards, who testified at the hearing, said walking among Washington's diminutive buildings was a ''joyful pleasure'' and ''about the frantic life of our modern world being made more bearable.''
''People want a horizontal city,'' said Ms. Richards of the Committee of 100 on the Federal City.
In many parts of the city, where zoning restrictions set the height of buildings lower than those dictated by the Height Act, the landscape could remain horizontal regardless of what Congress decides. But inertia might prevent even that.
''The Height Act is like a symbol,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting Democratic delegate in Congress. ''It's discussed, it's even revered. But I don't know many people, expert or not, in this city who know very much about the Height Act of have spent any considerable time understanding it.''

HEADLINE: For UBS, A Record Of Averting Prosecution

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
As the Justice Department weighs the possibility of criminal charges in the unfolding Libor rate-setting scandal, it may want to consider the record of the Swiss banking giant UBS.
At UBS, a series of immunity, nonprosecution and deferred prosecution agreements in recent years -- evidently the government's preferred approach to corporate crime -- seems to have had scant, if any, deterrent effect. ''It's depressing,'' Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, a member of the House oversight committee, told me this week after we discussed UBS's recent transgressions. ''The Justice Department has to decide: Is the day of consent decrees and settlements, where you pay a fine, one passed on to shareholders, are those days over? Are the days of jail time here?''
UBS, one of more than a dozen banks being investigated for manipulating interest rates for their own benefit, is hardly the only major global bank with a record of recidivism. Just this week, HSBC apologized after a Senate committee exposed a pattern of money laundering for ''drug kingpins and rogue nations.'' HSBC, which had been cited twice in the last decade for repeatedly violating money laundering laws, remains under civil and criminal investigation. 
It was a rival, Barclays, that set off an international furor when it admitted to a wide-ranging conspiracy to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, commonly known as Libor, which is the benchmark for countless interest rate determinations and an estimated $450 trillion in derivative contracts. It obtained a nonprosecution agreement, in large part because of what the Justice Department called its ''extraordinary'' cooperation, and agreed to pay American and British authorities a $450 million penalty. Barclays has had its own problems with accusations of money laundering and paid $298 million to settle charges that it circumvented United States prohibitions on funneling money to Iran.
But in many ways, UBS is in a league of its own given its track record for scandals. Should UBS be implicated in the Libor rate-fixing conspiracy, it's hard to imagine a better corporate candidate for a criminal indictment -- even though it has already been granted conditional immunity from some aspects of the Libor scandal.
As the Justice Department points out in its guidelines for charging a corporation with a crime: ''A corporation, like a natural person, is expected to learn from its mistakes,'' and ''a history of similar misconduct may be probative of a corporate culture that encouraged, or at least condoned, such misdeeds, regardless of any compliance programs. Criminal prosecution of a corporation may be particularly appropriate where the corporation previously had been subject to noncriminal guidance, warnings or sanctions.''
UBS, with dual headquarters in Zurich and Basel, traces its roots to 1854. Last year, it had more than $26 billion in revenue and nearly 65,000 employees worldwide. It was deemed too big to fail during the financial crisis, and had to be bailed out by the Swiss government after a $50 billion write-down on mortgage-backed securities.
The bank's recidivism seems rivaled only by its ability to escape prosecution:
UBS obtained a deferred prosecution agreement in 2009 for conspiring to defraud the United States of tax revenue by creating more than 17,000 secret Swiss accounts for United States taxpayers who failed to declare income and committed tax fraud. UBS bankers trolled for wealthy clients susceptible to tax evasion schemes at professional tennis matches, polo tournaments and celebrity events. One UBS banker smuggled diamonds in a toothpaste tube to accommodate a client. In return for the deferred prosecution agreement, UBS agreed to pay $780 million in fines and penalties and disclose the identities of many of its United States clients. At the same time it settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it acted as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser to American clients and paid a $200 million fine. In October 2010 the government dropped the charges, saying UBS had fully complied with its obligations under the agreement.
In May 2011, UBS admitted that its employees had repeatedly conspired to rig bids in the municipal bond derivatives market over a five-year period, defrauding more than 100 municipalities and nonprofit organizations, and agreed to pay $160 million in fines and restitution. An S.E.C. official called UBS's conduct ''a 'how to' primer for bid-rigging and securities fraud.'' UBS landed a nonprosecution agreement for that behavior, and the Justice Department lauded the bank's ''remedial efforts'' to curb anticompetitive practices.
In what the S.E.C. called at the time the largest settlement in its history, in 2008 UBS agreed to reimburse clients $22.7 billion to resolve charges that it defrauded customers who purchased auction-rate securities, which were sold by UBS as ultrasafe cash equivalents even though top UBS executives knew the market for the securities was collapsing. Seven of UBS's top executives were said to have dumped their own holdings, totaling $21 million, even as they told the bank's brokers to ''mobilize the troops'' and unload the securities on unsuspecting clients. As Andrew M. Cuomo, who was New York's attorney general then, put it: ''While thousands of UBS customers received no warning about the auction-rate securities market's serious distress, David Shulman -- one of the company's top executives -- used insider information to take the money and run.'' Besides reimbursing clients and settling with the S.E.C., UBS paid a $150 million fine to settle consumer and securities fraud charges filed by New York and other states. It again escaped prosecution.
There's more -- including UBS's prominent role and big losses in the mortgage-backed securities debacle that helped bring on the financial crisis. The federal agency overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sued UBS for securities law violations, accusing it of ''materially false statements and omissions.'' The agency is seeking $1 billion in damages. (UBS has denied the charges and the case is pending.) UBS hasn't been charged with any civil or criminal misconduct related to mortgage-backed securities.
In the continuing global interest rates investigations, UBS last summer revealed that it had received conditional immunity from the Justice Department and other authorities. It was shown this leniency even though the Justice Department has pointedly said that Barclays, not UBS, was the first bank to cooperate.
Among the dozen or so banks caught up in the investigation, UBS hasn't disclosed what role, if any, it played. But its conditional immunity indicates that UBS confessed and gave evidence against others.
A corporation can avoid criminal conviction and fines for antitrust crimes ''by being the first to confess participation in a criminal antitrust violation, fully cooperating with the division, and meeting other specified conditions,'' according to the Justice Department.
The department's antitrust division stresses that it makes only one grant of immunity per conspiracy, so it isn't clear how both Barclays and UBS managed to get it. Libor is set each day based on submissions from major global banks for a variety of currencies. UBS is a member of the banking panels that determine United States dollar, British pound, euro, yen and Swiss franc Libor rates.
UBS said its antitrust immunity was tied only to yen-related rates. That means it could still be prosecuted for antitrust crimes related to other currencies. Barclays obtained antitrust immunity only for a conspiracy involving the euro interbank offered rate, suggesting that the Justice Department is treating the cases as separate conspiracies.
Unlike Barclays, UBS does not have immunity or a nonprosecution agreement from the criminal division, which means it could be charged with the full range of securities and commodities fraud.
When I asked UBS for comment about its record, a spokeswoman said that the bank ''acknowledges and takes responsibility for the mistakes and oversights that occurred in our past, and we have learned a great deal. New senior management is fully committed to protecting the firm's reputation, our employees and shareholders from any misconduct by individuals. We continuously work to ensure compliance with the rules, and improve controls to keep mistakes from happening or to detect them as soon as possible, if they do occur.''
In the Libor scandal, UBS's conditional immunity applies only to the company, not to individuals.
While UBS seems to fit the profile for charging corporations with crime, it remains the case that individuals commit crimes, even if companies are liable for their acts. But so far, the only person from UBS to receive a jail term in connection with any of the bank's multiple scandals and offenses is Bradley Birkenfeld, the original whistle-blower in the huge tax evasion case. Mr. Birkenfeld pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and was sentenced to 40 months in prison.
Another UBS banker, Renzo Gadola, pleaded guilty in the tax fraud case, cooperated, and was granted probation. A third was charged but hasn't been tried and remains a fugitive.
In another notorious case, British authorities charged a trader, Kweku Adoboli, with fraud and false accounting after UBS announced it had lost $2.3 billion in unauthorized trades. He pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. And in the municipal securities bid-rigging scandal, three former UBS bankers are facing trial and a fourth pleaded guilty but hasn't been sentenced.
Otherwise, no one at UBS has faced criminal charges, even though two high-ranking UBS officials settled New York and other states' charges of insider trading for dumping their auction-rate securities. One, Mr. Shulman, UBS's global head of municipal securities, who was publicly criticized by Mr. Cuomo, paid $2.75 million to settle the charges and was suspended as a securities broker for two and a half years. Another, David D. Aufhauser, UBS's general counsel, paid $6.5 million and was barred from practicing law in New York for two years. Mr. Shulman was suspended by UBS and Mr. Aufhauser left the bank. UBS declined to comment on the reason for his departure and named him an adviser to the bank.
Neither man admitted or denied guilt, but in both cases, the allegations made by the authorities were incriminating. According to the complaints, Mr. Shulman sold his personal holdings within days of learning the market was in distress. Mr. Aufhauser was on an Acela train to Washington when UBS's chief risk officer e-mailed him to warn that the auction-rate securities market was collapsing. Minutes later, he e-mailed his UBS broker to sell the securities in his account. (A lawyer said Friday that Mr. Aufhauser subsequently reversed the trade and didn't profit from the order.)
Today Mr. Shulman is listed as a ''managing member'' of BasePoint Capital L.L.C., a private investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Aufhauser is a partner at the prominent Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. His biography on the firm's Web site references his experience as ''managing director and global general counsel of the UBS AG investment bank.''
Both Mr. Shulman and Mr. Aufhauser declined to comment.
Is it any wonder that despite repeated apologies and promises to change, UBS and other banks keep getting in trouble?
Last week the New York Times reporters Ben Protess and Mark Scott wrote that the Justice Department was building criminal cases against several individuals and institutions implicated in the Libor scandal, even as rumors swirled that more generous settlements with major banks were in the works.
If prosecutions are forthcoming, it will be a welcome sign that banks and their employees will be held accountable for their misdeeds. As the recent wave of scandals suggests, years of leniency have failed to bring the hoped-for results or respect for the law.
''My view is we're well past the day where we can postpone putting guilty people behind bars,'' said Mr. Welch, the representative from Vermont, who sent a letter this week to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urging the department to ''aggressively prosecute'' bank officials who manipulated Libor.
''The whole point of prison terms is to deter conduct in that community, and we know jail sentences are an effective deterrent,'' Mr. Welch added. ''Restoring public confidence means that people who commit crimes spend some time in jail.''
Online Correction: July 20, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column misstated the charges against UBS from the federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as fraud, rather than securities violations.

HEADLINE: General Electric Profit Surpasses Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The General Electric Companyreported a 2.5 percent rise in profit from continuing operations on Friday, topping Wall Street expectations as solid demand in the United States and emerging markets offset weakness in Europe.
The largest conglomerate by revenue in the United States stuck with its forecast for the remainder of 2012, saying it would increase earnings at a double-digit percentage rate by pushing profit margins higher.
In a move intended in part to cut costs, G.E. said it would break up its big energy division into three separate units. 
''The environment continues to be challenging,'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors. He said the United States economy was stable, adding that ''Europe remains very tough, but within our expectations.''
G.E.'s industrial sales in Europe were down 7 percent in the quarter, but up 6 percent in the United States and 24 percent higher in China, said Keith S. Sherin, G.E.'s chief financial officer. Overall revenue rose 2.5 percent, but missed expectations.
The company, the maker of electric turbines and jet engines, posted a profit of 38 cents a share, excluding one-time items, a penny above analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. It excludes 5 cents in charges from its former subprime mortgage unit and its Japanese consumer finance business.
''G.E. had the perfect opportunity to bring expectations down and blame it on Europe and that would have been the telltale move that would have said, 'O.K., G.E. is beginning to suffer here in this environment.' And they didn't do that,'' said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at the Harbor Advisory Corporation in Portsmouth, N.H.
The division of the energy infrastructure unit, created in a 2008 restructuring, into three parts will cut annual expenses by $200 million to $300 million a year once it is completed, executives said. The three separate divisions will report directly to Mr. Immelt.
John Krenicki, a 50-year-old G.E. vice chairman who runs the division, plans to leave the company at the end of the year, G.E. officials said.
''We discussed him taking other roles within the company, subsequent roles within the company and I think his sense was it was time for him to think about other things he can do,'' Mr. Immelt said.
G.E. declined to make Mr. Krenicki available for an interview.
The energy arm, G.E.'s largest industrial unit, was one of its strongest performers in the quarter, with profit jumping 13 percent on a 15 percent rise in sales. The company has stepped up its presence in the energy sector over the last couple of years, making more than $11 billion in acquisitions and expanding beyond its core of making electricity-producing turbines to offer more equipment used in oil and gas production.
Shares of G.E. closed up 7 cents, or 0.35 percent, to $19.87 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
Sales rose 2.5 percent, to $36.5 billion from $35.6 billion -- shy of Wall Street's expectation of $36.8 billion. The company noted that the strengthening dollar reduced revenue by $900 million in the quarter.
''Revenue was a little lighter than expected, even though earnings beat and they had a strong industrial business,'' said Cort Gwon, chief strategist at HudsonView Capital Management in New York.
The strongest revenue growth came at its transportation unit, which makes railroad locomotives, where sales rose 27 percent, to $1.6 billion.
GE Capital revenue declined 8 percent, to $11.49 billion, reflecting the company's continuing efforts to pare back the operation. The unit's profit rose 31 percent, to $2.12 billion.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan's Economic Challenges

 BODY:
As American and coalition forces prepare to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, the Afghan government faces a challenge as daunting as the need to take over the fight against the Taliban: assuming responsibility for an economy that has been almost exclusively dependent on outside assistance for more than a decade. 
The numbers are staggering. According to the World Bank, an estimated 97 percent of Afghanistan's roughly $15.7 billion gross domestic product comes from international military and development aid and spending in the country by foreign troops. The economy is already contracting as troops leave, and future growth will be slower, especially in urban areas and areas of conflict.
To increase the odds for a more gradual and manageable transition, the United States and other major donors pledged $16 billion in development aid through 2015 at a conference in Tokyo last week. It was an important and necessary commitment. Now they have to deliver.
The United States and other nations have promised that they will not abandon Afghanistan, which happened in 1989 after the Soviet Union was pushed out. The World Bank has warned that an abrupt aid cutoff could provoke a collapse of political authority, civil war and a greater reliance on opium profits.
The major donors, however, are mired in financial crisis, and they are tired of war and with the corruption and ineptness of President Hamid Karzai's government, which has failed to build a stable and viable country despite the loss of thousands of lives and billions of dollars of assistance.
Not all the money has been wasted. Since 2001, many more Afghans have access to health care, schooling and even cellphones. But the country is still one of the world's poorest and lacks reliable basic services like electricity.
The government has been unable to generate enough revenue to cover more than a fraction of its budget. Billions of dollars have been transferred to Dubai and elsewhere as Afghans with huge caches of cash bet against their country's future and sabotage its ability to grow.
Transparency International, a watchdog group, says Afghanistan is among the world's most corrupt countries and getting worse. The group says at least $1 billion donated over the past eight years has been siphoned off.
The Tokyo conference tried to address this issue by requiring, for the first time, the Afghan government to reduce corruption before receiving all of the newly promised aid. Mr. Karzai gave all the right assurances, but he has done that before. If he is serious now, he is fast running out of time.
Just days after the conference, seven top members resigned from the government agency that promotes investment in Afghanistan over what they said was rampant corruption and mismanagement. If Mr. Karzai fails to enact serious reforms and prosecute lawbreakers, the United States and other donors will lose all credibility if they don't withhold at least some aid. Now is also the time for Afghans and the international community to work to guarantee free and fair elections so a new president can be chosen as called for, in the constitution, in 2014.
Eventually, Afghanistan has to wean itself from its donors. Indigenous businesses are growing, and there is even greater potential. The country has significant mineral deposits. Exxon Mobil has hinted at interest in exploring for oil. A recent conference organized by India drew investors from more than 40 countries. These opportunities will have much better prospects with a transparent, honest, competent and law-based government.

HEADLINE: Overseas, Romney Will Try to Hone Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- So long, Victory Column. Hello, Gdansk Shipyard?
Next week, Mitt Romney will dive into a rite of passage for presidential candidates: the big trip overseas to burnish foreign policy credentials.
But for Mr. Romney, the question is not whether he can duplicate the euphoria that greeted Barack Obama's foreign campaign swing in 2008. Even Mr. Romney's Republican backers acknowledge there is no way he can compete with the images of Mr. Obama before 200,000 cheering Germans at Berlin's Victory Column, or the well-timed endorsement by the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, of Mr. Obama's call for a timetable for withdrawal of American troops just as Mr. Obama arrived in Iraq.
Far more important, both political and foreign policy experts say, is whether Mr. Romney will be able to use the three-country trip to Britain, Israel and Poland to establish a solid foreign policy doctrine that distinguishes him in a meaningful way from the president. 
In fact, one of the few real national security differences between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama is on Afghanistan: even as public sentiment has turned sharply against the war, Mr. Romney has refused to explicitly commit to the 2014 date for a troop withdrawal supported by Mr. Obama and NATO leaders. Mr. Romney's aides say that while he supports the timetable in concept, withdrawals would still depend on how commanders see conditions on the ground. And unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney has refused to back negotiations with the Taliban. Mr. Obama's 2008 trip began in Afghanistan, but Mr. Romney's itinerary does not call for a stop there.
''He ain't going to Afghanistan because he doesn't want to say that he'll slow down the troop withdrawal process,'' said Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Romney will be attending a fund-raiser in London. Then he will travel to Jerusalem, appealing to Jewish voters in the United States. In Warsaw and Gdansk, he will make a play for Catholic and Polish voters (a big constituency in Pennsylvania and Michigan), Republican political strategists say.
''The Polish part is about the Catholic vote, and that vote is very important,'' said Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican campaign operative. ''Everyone that has won the majority of the Catholic vote has won the presidency.''
Mr. Romney will appear with Lech Walesa in Gdansk, the site of the Solidarity leader's battles against the Soviet-backed government during the cold war, giving Mr. Romney a chance to highlight his other key foreign policy difference with Mr. Obama -- the relationship between the United States and Russia, which Mr. Romney has called America's biggest geopolitical foe.
A big question in Gdansk is whether Mr. Romney will repeat his Russia comment. He was criticized for it by both Obama officials and the foreign policy establishment and even some of his own foreign policy advisers have privately criticized the remark. But at a time when Russia, back under the helm of the former K.G.B. chief Vladimir V. Putin, is increasingly criticized for continuing to aid the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, Mr. Romney may decide to reiterate his criticism of Mr. Obama's Russian policy.
''This trip demonstrates Governor Romney's belief in the worth and necessity of standing with our allies and locking arms with our allies, and that indeed is the common theme binding the United Kingdom, Israel and Poland,'' said Lanhee Chen, the Romney campaign's policy director. ''Each of these nations shares our love of liberty as well as the fortitude to defend it. They're each pillars of liberty and have fought through periods where liberty was under siege.''
Obama campaign aides have been quick to point out the difference between Mr. Romney's itinerary and Mr. Obama's pre-election trip in 2008. Four years ago, Mr. Obama met with the President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and played basketball with American troops in Kandahar, then headed to Iraq for meetings with Mr. Maliki and Gen. David H. Petraeus. In Jordan, Mr. Obama rode shotgun in a car driven by King Abdullah, who, after a lengthy meeting, personally drove Mr. Obama to his waiting plane at the airport, a phalanx of security cars screaming behind them.
In Jerusalem, Sderot and Ramallah, Mr. Obama met with both Israeli and Palestinian officials, including President Mahmoud Abbas, before winning over the crowds in Berlin and a skeptical Chancellor Angela Merkel. In Paris, Nicolas Sarkozy was so effusive in his praise that it was called an endorsement by the French news media. At his final stop in Britain, Mr. Obama met with government officials and the opposition.
''Obama had a different mission on his trip -- he was presenting himself as a rock star of change,'' one Romney aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Mitt Romney is running at a time when things are tough for Americans. We're not selling the same product. The mood in 2008 was different, and the mission of their trip was different.''
Mr. Romney is not going to Germany -- the timing for a meeting with Ms. Merkel did not work out, aides said. Nor is he going to anywhere else in the Middle East besides Israel. He will not meet with Mr. Abbas, but will meet with Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, with whom, one aide said, Mr. Romney had ''an existing relationship.''
In Israel, Mr. Romney may be pressured to say more about what his policy would be toward any pre-emptive Israeli military action against Iran, as well as how a Romney administration would handle the civil war in neighboring Syria. Mr. Romney has said he favors helping arm the Syrian rebels, but he has stopped short of agreeing with some Republicans in Congress who have called for airstrikes.
Mr. Romney will try to use the trip to counter criticism that he does not have a real foreign policy, a charge that the Obama camp plans to aggressively pursue in coming days. Obama campaign aides were quick to post Twitter messages and a video clip earlier this week of Romney campaign adviser Tara Wall's inability -- or unwillingness -- to answer a question on MSNBC's ''Daily Rundown'' about specifics of Mr. Romney's Afghanistan strategy.
''I'm not going to get into the details of that,'' Ms. Wall said, before changing the subject to the economy. Within minutes, the clip was winging its way around the digital world.
Whether the trip bolsters Mr. Romney's foreign policy credentials may not matter much. ''People will say that Mr. Romney is there to establish some rapport with these international figures,'' said the presidential historian Robert Dallek. ''But it doesn't mean a darn thing, because if you become president, they'll have to take you seriously.''

HEADLINE: Job Creators of 1955

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Making do with 40-foot yachts. 

 BODY:
Brad DeLong points us to an amazing Fortune reprint: a portrait of American executives in 1955, back when inequality was much lower and tax rates at the top much higher than they are today. The business leaders of the time led straitened lives by historical standards -- they were substantially poorer than the previous generation of executives:
The executive's home today is likely to be unpretentious and relatively small--perhaps seven rooms and two and a half baths. (Servants are hard to come by and many a vice president's wife gets along with part-time help. So many have done so for so long, in fact, that they no longer complain much about it.)
...
The large yacht has also foundered in the sea of progressive taxation. In 1930, Fred Fisher (Bodies), Walter Briggs, and Alfred P. Sloan cruised around in vessels 235 feet long; J. P. Morgan had just built his fourth Corsair (343 feet). Today, seventy-five feet is considered a lot of yacht. One of the biggest yachts launched in the past five years is the ninety-six-foot Rhonda III, built and owned by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., of Birmingham, Alabama. The Rhonda III cost half a million dollars to build, and the annual bill for keeping a crew aboard her, stocking her, and fueling her runs to around $130,000. As Chairman Robert I. Ingalls Jr. says, only corporations today can own even so comparatively modest a craft. The specifications of the boat that interests the great majority of seagoing executives today are "forty feet, four people, $40,000." In this tidy vessel the businessman of 1955 is quite happily sea-borne.
According to modern conservative dogma, this kind of punishment of "job creators" should have brought economic progress to a screeching halt. Yet according to Fortune, executives continued to work hard -- and the postwar generation was actually a period of economic progress that has never been matched.
Somehow, John Galt never made an appearance.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LOW, FRANCES LEVISON

 BODY:
LOW--Frances Levison, One of the first women to be recognized as a reporter at the Time-Life organization and a long-time resident of New York, died in San Francisco on June 18, 2012 after a short illness at age 92. After attending Horace Mann for 12 years, graduating from Vassar College (class of '41) with honors and earning an MA in History from Columbia University, Frances started as a researcher with Life Magazine. When she left the Time-Life organization in 1952, Frances was a full-fledged reporter and the lone woman reporter among the Time Washington Bureau staff. She worked in New York and Chicago, and after WWII in London, Paris, and Washington, D.C. Among her memorable articles for Life Magazine was an intimate study of Elizabeth Taylor who at age 17 was coming on the Hollywood scene as perhaps its most glamorous ingenue. Another was an in-depth study of Margaret Truman, daughter of former President Harry S. Truman. 
Frances also wrote of her experience as a student at Le Cordon Bleu Cooking School in Paris in which she described the peeling of a live eel among the culinary techniques of the French kitchen. This article, accompanied by a photograph of the chef performing the slippery operation, caught the eye of fellow student, Julia Child. Frances spent several nights in an Illinois prison for women to write an article about the inmates, many of them incarcerated because of violence against abusive husbands or boyfriends. She was forever moved by the screams and moans she heard in those nights behind bars. Frances left the Time-Life organization in 1952 to marry Robert A. Low, then an officer in the U.S. Department of State. She became a Special Assistant to Henry M. Jackson, Democratic Senator from Washington state. She and her husband became lifelong friends of Sen. Jackson. Frances and 'Bob' moved to New York City in 1954. Bob entered city politics and Frances played significant roles in her husband's campaigns for the New York City Council, where he served two terms, 1961-1969. He is best remembered for sponsoring and seeing the signing into law by then-Mayor John V. Lindsey of a local anti- pollution law that outlawed the burning of soft coal and outlawed apartment house incinerators, and gradually reduced the permissible content of sulphur in fuel oil. His campaigns for mayor and for president of the City Council in 1969, while unsuccessful had Frances all over Manhattan and the five boroughs getting deeply connected with the people and issues of the most important city in the world. After the birth of her two sons, Allen (now an airline pilot) and Roger (a long time hedge fund manager), Frances joined the New York City Partnership, a predecessor of the Partnership for New York. The Economic Development Council of New York City awarded her a medal of achievement for her work in connecting business leaders with the work of City agencies, particularly the public school system. Later she brought the program, now known as Open Doors, to the Board of Education. The Program focused on exposing young students to the world of work and included talks by representatives of various fields of work. It also included visits to work sites and offices. Part of her program introduced young people to the possibilities of employment in the Culinary Arts. She became an early member of Les Dames d'Escoffier, now an international organization of prominent women connected with the food world. Frances was a believer in the power of education and continued to support East Harlem School at Exodus House in New York City, a year-round middle school that teaches children from low-income families develop academic excellence, moral integrity, courtesy, and an unshakeable commitment to their future and the fate of their community. Since moving to San Francisco with Bob in 1996 to be near their family, Frances had dedicated herself to several charitable activities, including AIM High, an organization that conducts summer programs for middle school students in school sites around the Bay Area. She also built a family website to honor her two deceased sisters, Helene and Eleanor, ancestors and share family stories, photos and memorabilia. Frances is survived by her husband, Bob, as well as her son, Allen, his children Andrew, Alexandra and Elena (and their mother, Berta); son Roger, and his children Jesse, Gabriel and Sarah (and their mother, Virginia), and many nieces and nephews. Donations in Frances' memory may be made to East Harlem School, 309 East 103rd Street, New York, NY 10029. A gathering for family and friends to celebrate Frances' life will be held in New York City at a later date.
