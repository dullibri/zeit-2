HEADLINE: Amid Global Trade Fight, a Bright Year for Solar Use in the U.S.

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: Despite increasing popularity, the panel market is oversaturated and China's solar industry, thanks to putative tariffs, was described as an "abandoned baby" by the president of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industry Association. 

 BODY:
The United States installed more solar panels in 2012 than in any previous year, according to a new report, with residential use of solar power up 70 percent over 2011.
By the end of this year, homeowners, businesses and utility companies will have installed enough photovoltaic cells to produce 3.2 gigawatts (or GW) of electricity in the United States, up from 1.9 GW last year, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Report.
The report was produced by GTM Research Solar and a trade association, the Solar Energy Industries Association. 
California led the charge this year with new installations of residential and commercial panels and facilities for utility companies. Next was Arizona, where utility companies installed the majority of new facilities.
In an op-ed piece in The New York Times last week, two alternative-energy advocates, David Crane and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., called for "Solar Panels for Every Home," arguing that a move toward grid independence would reduce the risk of blackouts like the one that affected thousands of people in the Northeast after Hurricane Sandy. (The majority of residential solar panels are third-party-owned, meaning that many users don't own the panels on their own roofs.)
But the growth of solar in the United States comes amid something of a global trade war.
In May, the United States imposed a 31 percent tariff on Chinese-manufactured solar panels. The step was taken after some $3.1 billion worth of Chinese-made solar panels were sold in the United States in 2011, according to U.S. Department of Commerce figures cited by Keith Bradsher and Diane Cardwell of The Times.
In August, Rendezvous reported on the difficulties that some European solar manufacturers were having in competing with inexpensive Chinese products.
Both Europe and the United States charge that China has been selling solar panels overseas for less than their manufacturing cost and effectively subsidizing the industry. Although solar panels are included in China's five-year economic plan - which ends in 2015 - Beijing has denied the dumping charges.
After the European Union finally decided to open its own anti-dumping investigation in September, the Chinese government took its case to the World Trade Organization, as Keith reported.
"Developing solar photovoltaic renewable energy is conducive to resolving the serious challenges of energy security and climate change facing humanity, in line with the common interests of all countries," said Shen Danyang, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry.
Despite an increasing market for panels in the United States and elsewhere, all sides acknowledge that the market is oversaturated. China's solar industry - at risk of losing its huge export market because of the recently imposed tariffs - was described as an "abandoned baby" by the president of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industry Association, Li Junfeng, according to the state-run newspaper China Daily.
"It was everyone's favorite when it could make money," he said, "but now, it has lost favor with media and investors."
The new report puts global solar manufacturing capacity at 70 GW while an estimated 31 GW are currently needed. But China recently announced that it would increase its own production goals to 40 GW from 21 GW.
Prices in the United States are still on the decline. For residential users, for example, the price of installing solar has decreased in the past year by 15.3 percent, the report found.
 Do you care how the electricity you use is generated? Do you have solar panels on the roof of your home? If yes, do you care where those solar panels are manufactured?

HEADLINE: Guns and the Decline of the Young Man

BYLINE: CHRISTY WAMPOLE


HIGHLIGHT: Even if guns were to vanish, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly. 

 BODY:
 2:05 p.m. | Updated 
 This post originally contained an article that was not ready for publication. The correct version appears below. 
Adam Lanza was a young man. Jacob Roberts was a young man. James Holmes is a young man. Seung-Hui Cho was a young man. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were young men.
We can all name a dozen or so hypotheses about why they kill: their parents' unlocked gun cabinet, easy access to weapons on the Internet, over- or under-medication, violent video games and TV programs, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed mental disorders, abusive or indifferent parents, no stable social network, bullying. However, young women are equally exposed to many of the same conditions yet rarely turn a weapon on others. This leaves us wondering about the young men. 
There is something about life in the United States, it seems, that is conducive to young men planning and executing large-scale massacres. But the reasons elude us. 
The first reaction to the horror and bloodshed of a mass killing like the one in Newtown, Conn., is a rekindling of the gun control debate. I happen to believe, along with many others, that the repeated mandate we give to the National Rifle Association and its lobby, and the complacency with which we allow our politicians to be subject to the will of gun manufacturers is odious.
Limiting access to weapons is certainly a pragmatic albeit incomplete solution to the United States' propensity for murder. However, were the guns to vanish instantaneously, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly.
What is it that touches them?
I come from a small town near Fort Worth, Texas. In this region, like many others across the United States, young men are having a very hard time of it. When I consider how all of the people I knew there are faring, including my own family members, the women have come out considerably better than the men. While many of the women were pregnant in high school and have struggled with abusive relationships, financial hardships and addictions, they've often found ways to make their lives work, at least provisionally, and to live with their children if not provide for them in more substantial ways. 
The same cannot be said for many young men in the region, who are often absent fathers of multiple children by multiple women, unemployed or underemployed, sullen and full of rage. While every woman in my family has done O.K. in the end, every man on one side of my family except for my grandfather has spent time in jail, abused drugs or alcohol, suffered from acute depression, or all of the above. Furthermore, pervasive methamphetamine use, alcoholism, physical and psychological abuse and severe depression have swept not only my hometown and my region but large segments of the United States. If this pattern is not familiar to you personally, I am certain it is the lived experience of someone you know.
This is merely anecdotal evidence, not social science, but I believe that it is indicative of a sort of infection spreading in our collective brain, one that whispers to the American subconscious: "The young men are in decline." They were once our heroes, our young and shining fathers, our sweet brothers, our tireless athletes, our fearless warriors, the brains of our institutions, the makers of our wares, the movers of our world. In the Western imagination, the valiance of symbolically charged figures like Homer's Ulysses or the Knights of the Round Table remained unquestioned since their conception. However, as centuries progressed and stable categories faltered, the hero figure faces increasing precarity. Even if we consider the 20th century alone, we see this shift from World War II, when the categories of good and evil were firm, to later conflicts like the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, involving a disparity between what the government believed to be right and what much of the civilian population did. 
Does the heroic young man still make sense today, or has his value already been depleted?
Certainly, there are young men who are paragons of success: the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, the sharply dressed bankers, the swarms of brilliant graduates who receive their diplomas each year. And there are heroes who fight our fires, soldiers who fight our wars and the first-responders who are the first to set eyes on the dead children's bodies at the scenes of mass shootings. But more young men these days are avatars of soldiers rather than soldiers themselves. 
If the soldier has largely been replaced by the video game character and the drone, if the mothers have proven that they can raise the children alone, if the corporations are less able or willing to guarantee the possibility of upward mobility and some level of respect that comes with title, if someone else can bring home the bacon, what is left for young men?
All this, and they still are not allowed to cry.
There is also the issue of race. Not all of the men I listed in the beginning of this piece are Caucasian. However, take a moment and imagine what the archetypical image of a mass murderer in the United States looks like. Is he white in your mind? This image can only be attributed to the truth of those patterns that have established themselves, from Charles Whitman's 1966 shooting spree at the University of Texas, to Timothy McVeigh's 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, to the 1999 Columbine massacre, to Wade Michael Page's 2012 attack on the Sikh temple in Wisconsin. The mass murderer is a type. And his race is white.
Young, African-American men are often imagined to be violent on the street, killing one another in gang-related violence or murdering convenience store clerks while trying to empty the cash register. The stereotypical image, even in its wrongheaded reduction of the black man to an inherently violent being, does not leave room for that other kind of murderer, the one who plans and executes a calculated, non-spontaneous large-scale death spree.
The angry white man has usurped the angry black man.
I would argue that maleness and whiteness are commodities in decline. And while those of us who are not male or white have enjoyed some benefits from their decline, the sort of violence and murder that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary will continue to occur if we do not find a way to carry them along with us in our successes rather than leaving them behind.
For women, things are looking up. We can vote, we can make more choices about our bodies than in decades past, we've made significant progress regarding fair pay, and more women are involved in American politics than ever before. The same can be said for minorities. However, because resources are limited, gains for women and minorities necessarily equal losses for white males. Even in this feels intuitively fair to many, including those white males who are happy to share resources for the greater benefit of the nation as a whole, it must feel absolutely distressing for those who are uncomfortable with change and who have a difficult time adjusting to the inevitable reordering of society. 
From the civil rights and feminist movements of the 1960s and onward, young men - and young white men in particular - have increasingly been asked to yield what they'd believed was securely theirs. This underlying fact, compounded by the backdrop of violent entertainment and easy access to weapons, creates the conditions for thousands of young men to consider their future prospects and decide they would rather destroy than create. 
Can you imagine being in the shoes of the one who feels his power slipping away? Who can find nothing stable to believe in? Who feels himself becoming unnecessary? That powerlessness and fear ties a dark knot in his stomach. As this knot thickens, a centripetal hatred moves inward toward the self as a centrifugal hatred is cast outward at others: his parents, his girlfriend, his boss, his classmates, society, life. 
A partial solution to these toxic circumstances could be a coordinated cultivation of what might be called an empathic habit. Most people surely felt an impulsive empathy for the parents and survivors involved in the Sandy Hook massacre, as shown by the countless memorial services and candlelight vigils that took place after the murders. But empathy could help best if exercised before rather than after such tragedies. 
Empathy could serve many of us: those who have not yet put themselves in the position of a person who is losing their power and those who can aim a gun at someone without imagining themselves on the other end of the barrel. For those of us who belong to a demographic that is doing increasingly better, a trained empathic reflex toward those we know to be losing for our gains could lead to a more deferential attitude on our part and could constitute an invitation for them to stay with us. To delight in their losses and aim at them the question, "How does it feel?" will only trigger a cycle of resentment and plant the seeds for vengeance. It is crucial to accommodate the pain of others. 
For a start, feeling needed is undoubtedly essential to each individual. This fact must be addressed at home, at school, in the workplace, and in politics. For example, one could envision the development of a school curriculum that centers around an empathic practice, particularly in courses such as history, social studies, literature, and political science. If students have no access to an empathic model at home, they would at least be exposed to it in the classroom. In the workplace, the C.E.O. must be able to put herself in the position of the lowest ranked employee and vice versa. Victims and victors must engage in the hypothetical practice that forces each to acknowledge the others' fortunes and misfortunes. 
Empathy is difficult because it forces us to feel the suffering of others. It is destabilizing to imagine that if we are lucky or blessed, it just as easily could have gone some other way. For the young men, whose position is in some ways more difficult than that of their fathers and grandfathers, life seems at times to have stacked the cards against them. It is for everyone to realize the capricious nature of history, which never bets consistently on one group over another. We should learn to cast ourselves simultaneously in the role of winner and loser, aggressor and victim. 
We have a choice whether our national refrain of "No more mass murders" will be meaningful or meaningless. We cannot neglect the young men. By becoming empathic stewards of civic and personal life, there is a chance we could make someone think twice before targeting another human being.

HEADLINE: The 'Mommy Penalty,' Around the World

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Around the developed world, women earn less than men by a sizable margin. And women with children experience a far larger wage gap. 

 BODY:
Around the developed world, women earn less than men by a sizable margin: as of 2010, about 16 percent less when employed in similar full-time jobs. Women with children, though, experience a far larger wage gap, a phenomenon known as the "mommy penalty." 
That chart is from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's latest report on the gender gap around the world. It shows that, among members of the O.E.C.D., the median woman without children who works full time earns 7 percent less than the median man working full time, whereas the median female full-time worker with children earns 22 percent less than the median male full-time worker. 
The United States is about on trend with developed countries over all: in the United States, the median childless, full-time-working woman of reproductive age earns 7 percent less than the median male full-time worker. For women with children, the wage gap more than triples, to 23 percent. That gap in Japan is even bigger -- the median Japanese mother working full time earns 61 percent less than the median Japanese full-time male worker.
And remember, those wage gaps are for full-time workers only. The gap widens if you compare all working mothers, since women are much more likely than men to work part time.
Why do mothers earn so much less than both men and childless women?
In the United States, much of the "mommy penalty" can be explained by the types of jobs mothers versus non-mothers take. In particular, compared with non-mothers, mothers end up in jobs that pay a higher share of their compensation in benefits rather than wages. 
Benefits should play less of a role in most other rich countries, which have some form of universal health coverage. Occupational choice still accounts for much of the wage gap, though, as do differences in hours worked even among full-time workers. 
Access to child care appears to affect the motherhood penalty as well, the report says. Women are more likely than men to be the primary caregivers for their children, so if affordable child care is not available, women are more likely to take time away from their jobs to care for their children and be penalized with lower wages. Higher enrollment rates in formal child care programs are thus associated with smaller gender wage gaps. 
Interestingly, longer periods of maternity and parental leave are associated with a wider wage gap between men and women. The report notes that countries with more generous parental leave policies tend to have lower enrollment in formal child care programs.

HEADLINE: Reading the City

BYLINE: ALLISON ARIEFF


HIGHLIGHT: Finding out what makes cities smart, through books, conferences and hitting the pavement. 

 BODY:
I was in Barcelona last month for a conference on smart cities (more specifically, on how technology can make cities smarter). There were some intriguing presentations and a lot of cool-looking "smart" trucks and electric bikes. I could have spent a lot more time "interfacing" with all the technology housed in Fira de Barcelona convention center (which, starchitect hotel by Toyo Ito notwithstanding, is definitely a textbook case of bad urbanism). 
But I didn't. 
There are two common-sense truths to smart cities. First, technology is awesome, yes, but we should be viewing it not as a silver bullet but one admittedly phenomenal tool of many in any city's arsenal. (And, as many asked when the power went out during a panel discussion: How do you have a smart city with no electricity?) 
Second, the most successful technologies are well-hidden -- invisible, even -- which means there isn't a lot to see at a smart cities conference. So after absorbing about all I could about open data, demand-based pricing and fiber optic networks, I reached a not-at-all surprising decision: Hey! I'm in Barcelona. I can learn a lot more about how a city works by actually experiencing it.
I had only the vaguest destinations in mind, and they were all-the-more vague because my smartphone didn't work in Spain. (Another observation: few smart-city devotees consider how those cities might function for those not in possession of the latest iteration of the iPhone. It's a social equity issue that calls for greater focus.)
Initially frustrated by my gadget's refusal to work, I quickly changed my attitude and found its absence utterly liberating. I couldn't tweet or text. I walked around with a paper map much as I had when I'd backpacked through Europe in college. I hopped on the train a few stops in order to cross the threshold of modernism's uber-monument, the Barcelona Pavilion and soon after marveled at its opposite, the wondrously curvy Casa Batlló of Gaudi. While walking across the city the day of a general strike, I noticed things like the dizzying variety of creative building facades (Barcelona has building height requirements, but once you've satisfied that you're free to go crazy).
When I got home I gave a lot of thought to the importance of stepping away from the screen(s). All that walking also inspired me to do some research like I used to do - by reading books, not clicking on links. What follows is a list of books, all published this year, that speak to my recurring obsessions - cities, walking, suburbia. Spending time with any of them would be as delightful a diversion as a stroll down the Ramblas. 
I should be going on these Barcelona-esque walkabouts in my own hometown (San Francisco) more often than I do. And that will be my early New Year's resolution, especially after having read P.D. Smith's "City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age,". The author's ideas are original and inventive enough to warrant his description of the book as "a guidebook to an imaginary 'Everycity.' It's a great thinker whose musings run the gamut from the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan to Tahrir Square, graffiti to gladiators, who can quote the Old Testament and Baudelaire, and throw in an infographic entitled, 'When skyscrapers rise, do markets fall?' 
Indeed, Smith is a flaneur in the tradition of Baudelaire -- "His passion and his profession are to become one flesh with the crowd." That "become one" part isn't going to happen from behind the wheel of a car. The breadth and complexity of his urban observations are absolutely contingent upon his experiencing the city on foot. 
Barcelona, London (where Smith lives), New York, San Francisco. These are cities any walker would love. But what of less walkable places? The city planner Jeff Speck believes that the easier it is to walk in a city, the greater its ability to thrive. In his new book, "Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time," Speck highlights 10 steps for cultivating urban walkability. Often provocative ("Specialists give bad advice, American parking is socialist"), the book is delightfully acronym- and jargon-free, and most of Speck's suggestions are revolutionary in their simplicity (i.e., "plant trees" and "welcome bikes"). Each step, he writes, "individually makes a difference; collectively they can transform a city and the lives of its residents."
Speck argues for friendlier (read: not modern) architecture to engage citizens; another new book demonstrates how even the coolest of modernists, the aforementioned Barcelona pavilion architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, designed a series of buildings for Lafayette Park, "a suburb within the city" of Detroit, that has evolved from a 1940s slum to find its footing as one of Detroit's most racially integrated and economically stable neighborhoods. But "Thanks for the View, Mr. Mies: Lafayette Park, Detroit" focuses less on the thinking behind the architecture and planning than the current residents' everyday perspectives of living in the neighborhood. 
The reality of actually seeing into other people's houses (because of all of Mies's pristine glass walls), has a cumulative - and positive -- effect, the authors observe, on the way residents relate to one another. And the bird-watching, as Lafayette Park resident Karen Tonso says, is extraordinary, "a perfect place for observing hawks and Peregrine falcons in the sky, and woodpeckers, wrens, goldfinches and tanagers in the trees."
If you somehow merged the geometry of Mies with the colors of those birds you'd begin to approximate some of the fantastical work featured in "Architectural Inventions" by Matt Bua and Maximilian Goldfarb. The book unabashedly embraces the imaginary, the whimsical, even the irrational (Gaudi would fit right in). Alternately gorgeous, weird and/or crazy drawings depict structures like the "Canadian Cheese Greater [sic] & Manure Palace From 1978/1983," the "Full Moon Commune" and the "Deep Cycle," which appears to consist of a food truck pulled by a pair of oxen. Why not?
As over-the-top as the projects in "Architectural Inventions" get, however, few can compete with the cinematic saga obsessively documented in the essays, diagrams and photographs in "Torre David: Informal Vertical Communities." For anyone interested in how cities work, this book is especially fascinating in that it explores the potential -- and pitfalls - of what can happen when there's no planning at all. 
I first read the incredible story of Torre David in this paper last year and haven't been able to get it out of my mind. A skyscraper in Caracas, Venezuela, that was abandoned in the wake of that country's banking crisis -- and later transformed into a 45-story city -- Torre David now houses more than 750 families. Within the half-built, partially falling apart building are supermarkets, hair salons, churches, playgrounds and parking lots. Though all residents are essentially squatters, there exists a marked social hierarchy - higher floors have more complete units, more access to services, lower ones lack water, walls or power and must navigate open elevator shafts, gaping holes in the floor. It's an imperfect yet persuasive solution to that city's particular challenges. "The problem is not the architecture," states the architect and planner Yona Friedman in the book's epigraph. "The problem is the reorganization of things which already exist."
And one last book, which shows the tragic consequences that come when a city is too planned -- Dave Eggers's novel "A Hologram for the King." I'm so saddened by, but also so in love with this book, which reflects with absolute precision the impact of ill-fated urban visions and the devastating effects brought on by the decline not only of American manufacturing and housing but of the American Dream.
"This is a new city. Uncharted territory, right?" asks the novel's protagonist, a former bicycle manufacturing executive who has just arrived to give an IT sales pitch in the mysteriously desolate King Abdullah Economic City. "You ask anyone about the Wi-Fi?"

HEADLINE: Wall Street, Invested in Firearms, Is Unlikely to Push for Reform

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The private equity sector has stakes in some major gun makers, and taking the lead after the shootings in Newtown, Conn., could endanger firms' own profits. 

 BODY:
 5:25 a.m. | Updated 
 Following the publication of this column, which was critical of the role of private equity firms' ownership of gun manufacturers, Cerberus announced that it was planning to sell its stake in Freedom Group."It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level," Cerberus said in a statement on Tuesday. 
As the debate over gun control rages following the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Conn., one unlikely group is expected to play a central role in pushing back against any reform effort: the private equity industry. 
It is often overlooked, but some of the biggest gun makers in the nation are owned by private equity funds run by Wall Street titans. The .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that was used on Friday by Adam Lanza to massacre 20 schoolchildren was manufactured by the Freedom Group, a gun behemoth controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, named after the three-headed dog of Greek myth that guarded the gates of Hades. Its founder, Stephen A. Feinberg, hunts regularly on the weekends with a Remington Model 700.
Besides Cerberus, Colt Defense, a spinoff from the manufacturer of the .44-40 Colt revolver made famous by John Wayne, is jointly owned by Sciens Capital Management, a fund advised by the Blackstone Group and another fund run by Credit Suisse.
On Colt Defense's Web site, it markets weapons for law enforcement and the military, including a 9-millimeter submachine gun that looks like something out of the video game Call of Duty. These are weapons you hope never fall into consumers' hands.
And then there is MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm that once owned the diet company Jenny Craig that now controls Bushnell Outdoor Products. Bushnell makes just about everything for a gun except the gun itself, for both the hunting and "tactical" markets.
Need a laser scope for your semiautomatic handgun? Bushnell makes one called the Tactical Red Dot: First Strike. How about military-grade night-vision goggles? Yep, it has a subsidiary that makes them.
Looking for a "loader" for your AK-47? It has you covered. Or what about a magazine for bullets? One of its subsidiaries sells the Hot Lips 10-Round Magazine, which is marketed this way: "Put 10 rounds through your 10/22 faster than the blink of an eye, and reload with amazing ease." (Really, folks. It also makes a 25-round version.)
Perhaps it should not be a surprise, but Wall Street will hardly take a leadership position in the conversation about gun control. The more vocal stances could come from pension funds questioning their investments in gun makers, though they may be loath to take a stand.
Since the killings on Friday, the Freedom Group and other notable gun manufacturers have not commented on the tragedy - not even a basic, "We condemn such violence and pray for the families of Newtown."
When I called Mr. Feinberg, he declined to comment, as did others. About a year ago, the National Rifle Association issued this statement about Freedom and Cerberus: "The owners and investors involved are strong supporters of the Second Amendment and are avid hunters and shooters."
Cerberus and other funds with ownership stakes in the gun industry would be in an awkward position if they sought reforms that could hurt their investments. Cerberus invests money in companies like Freedom for other investors, including public pension funds. It has a fiduciary duty to maximize investors' returns.
However, some of its investors may be rethinking their position on investing in companies like Freedom, which was used as an acquisition vehicle to buy up brands including Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS Firearms, a leading maker of military-style semiautomatics.
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, which has a stake in Freedom through a $751.4 million investment in Cerberus's funds, said Monday it was reviewing its investment. "At this point our investment branch is examining the Cerberus investment to determine how best to move forward given the tragic events of last Friday in Newtown, Conn.," the company said in a statement to Reuters.
Private equity firms have a long history of investing in "sin" companies, including guns, alcohol, gambling and tobacco, in part because the companies often are inherently discounted. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired RJR Nabisco in 1988; the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was later spun off.
On Monday, Eliot L. Spitzer, the former governor of New York and the former New York State attorney general, called on Cerberus's investors to pressure it to try to reform the gun industry.
"While Cerberus, whose array of holdings is vast, is generally immune to public pressure and the opprobrium of trafficking in products that while legal may be marketed in a loathsome way, Cerberus would not be immune to pressure brought by its own investors," he wrote on Slate.
He added: "Every student at a university should ask the university if it is invested in Cerberus. Every member of a union should ask their pension-fund managers if they are invested. Information is the key first step. From there, action will quickly follow."
If Mr. Spitzer is right, the economic impact of such reform may be painful for its investors. About two years ago, when Freedom sought to pursue an I.P.O. (which was later shelved) it identified gun control as one of its biggest "risk factors."
"The regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future and any such development might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows," the company told potential investors. "In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions."

HEADLINE: Guns and the Decline of the Young Man

BYLINE: CHRISTY WAMPOLE


HIGHLIGHT: Even if guns were to vanish, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly. 

 BODY:
 2:05 p.m. | Updated 
 This post originally contained an article that was not ready for publication. The correct version appears below. 
~~~
 In the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and the resulting renewed debate on gun control in the United States, The Stone will publish a series of essays this week that examine the ethical, social and humanitarian implications of the use, possession and regulation of weapons.
~~~
Adam Lanza was a young man. Jacob Roberts was a young man. James Holmes is a young man. Seung-Hui Cho was a young man. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were young men. 
We can all name a dozen or so hypotheses about why they kill: their parents' unlocked gun cabinet, easy access to weapons on the Internet, over- or under-medication, violent video games and TV programs, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed mental disorders, abusive or indifferent parents, no stable social network, bullying. However, young women are equally exposed to many of the same conditions yet rarely turn a weapon on others. This leaves us wondering about the young men. 
There is something about life in the United States, it seems, that is conducive to young men planning and executing large-scale massacres. But the reasons elude us.
The first reaction to the horror and bloodshed of a mass killing like the one in Newtown, Conn., is a rekindling of the gun control debate. I happen to believe, along with many others, that the repeated mandate we give to the National Rifle Association and its lobby, and the complacency with which we allow our politicians to be subject to the will of gun manufacturers is odious.
Limiting access to weapons is certainly a pragmatic albeit incomplete solution to the United States' propensity for murder. However, were the guns to vanish instantaneously, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly.
What is it that touches them?
I come from a small town near Fort Worth, Texas. In this region, like many others across the United States, young men are having a very hard time of it. When I consider how all of the people I knew there are faring, including my own family members, the women have come out considerably better than the men. While many of the women were pregnant in high school and have struggled with abusive relationships, financial hardships and addictions, they've often found ways to make their lives work, at least provisionally, and to live with their children if not provide for them in more substantial ways. 
The same cannot be said for many young men in the region, who are often absent fathers of multiple children by multiple women, unemployed or underemployed, sullen and full of rage. While every woman in my family has done O.K. in the end, every man on one side of my family except for my grandfather has spent time in jail, abused drugs or alcohol, suffered from acute depression, or all of the above. Furthermore, pervasive methamphetamine use, alcoholism, physical and psychological abuse and severe depression have swept not only my hometown and my region but large segments of the United States. If this pattern is not familiar to you personally, I am certain it is the lived experience of someone you know.
This is merely anecdotal evidence, not social science, but I believe that it is indicative of a sort of infection spreading in our collective brain, one that whispers to the American subconscious: "The young men are in decline." They were once our heroes, our young and shining fathers, our sweet brothers, our tireless athletes, our fearless warriors, the brains of our institutions, the makers of our wares, the movers of our world. In the Western imagination, the valiance of symbolically charged figures like Homer's Ulysses or the Knights of the Round Table remained unquestioned since their conception. However, as centuries progressed and stable categories faltered, the hero figure faces increasing precarity. Even if we consider the 20th century alone, we see this shift from World War II, when the categories of good and evil were firm, to later conflicts like the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, involving a disparity between what the government believed to be right and what much of the civilian population did. 
Does the heroic young man still make sense today, or has his value already been depleted?
Certainly, there are young men who are paragons of success: the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, the sharply dressed bankers, the swarms of brilliant graduates who receive their diplomas each year. And there are heroes who fight our fires, soldiers who fight our wars and the first-responders who are the first to set eyes on the dead children's bodies at the scenes of mass shootings. But more young men these days are avatars of soldiers rather than soldiers themselves. 
If the soldier has largely been replaced by the video game character and the drone, if the mothers have proven that they can raise the children alone, if the corporations are less able or willing to guarantee the possibility of upward mobility and some level of respect that comes with title, if someone else can bring home the bacon, what is left for young men?
All this, and they still are not allowed to cry.
There is also the issue of race. Not all of the men I listed in the beginning of this piece are Caucasian. However, take a moment and imagine what the archetypical image of a mass murderer in the United States looks like. Is he white in your mind? This image can only be attributed to the truth of those patterns that have established themselves, from Charles Whitman's 1966 shooting spree at the University of Texas, to Timothy McVeigh's 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, to the 1999 Columbine massacre, to Wade Michael Page's 2012 attack on the Sikh temple in Wisconsin. The mass murderer is a type. And his race is white.
Young, African-American men are often imagined to be violent on the street, killing one another in gang-related violence or murdering convenience store clerks while trying to empty the cash register. The stereotypical image, even in its wrongheaded reduction of the black man to an inherently violent being, does not leave room for that other kind of murderer, the one who plans and executes a calculated, non-spontaneous large-scale death spree.
The angry white man has usurped the angry black man.
I would argue that maleness and whiteness are commodities in decline. And while those of us who are not male or white have enjoyed some benefits from their decline, the sort of violence and murder that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary will continue to occur if we do not find a way to carry them along with us in our successes rather than leaving them behind.
For women, things are looking up. We can vote, we can make more choices about our bodies than in decades past, we've made significant progress regarding fair pay, and more women are involved in American politics than ever before. The same can be said for minorities. However, because resources are limited, gains for women and minorities necessarily equal losses for white males. Even if this feels intuitively fair to many, including those white males who are happy to share resources for the greater benefit of the nation as a whole, it must feel absolutely distressing for those who are uncomfortable with change and who have a difficult time adjusting to the inevitable reordering of society. 
From the civil rights and feminist movements of the 1960s and onward, young men - and young white men in particular - have increasingly been asked to yield what they'd believed was securely theirs. This underlying fact, compounded by the backdrop of violent entertainment and easy access to weapons, creates the conditions for thousands of young men to consider their future prospects and decide they would rather destroy than create. 
Can you imagine being in the shoes of the one who feels his power slipping away? Who can find nothing stable to believe in? Who feels himself becoming unnecessary? That powerlessness and fear ties a dark knot in his stomach. As this knot thickens, a centripetal hatred moves inward toward the self as a centrifugal hatred is cast outward at others: his parents, his girlfriend, his boss, his classmates, society, life. 
A partial solution to these toxic circumstances could be a coordinated cultivation of what might be called an empathic habit. Most people surely felt an impulsive empathy for the parents and survivors involved in the Sandy Hook massacre, as shown by the countless memorial services and candlelight vigils that took place after the murders. But empathy could help best if exercised before rather than after such tragedies. 
Empathy could serve many of us: those who have not yet put themselves in the position of a person who is losing their power and those who can aim a gun at someone without imagining themselves on the other end of the barrel. For those of us who belong to a demographic that is doing increasingly better, a trained empathic reflex toward those we know to be losing for our gains could lead to a more deferential attitude on our part and could constitute an invitation for them to stay with us. To delight in their losses and aim at them the question, "How does it feel?" will only trigger a cycle of resentment and plant the seeds for vengeance. It is crucial to accommodate the pain of others. 
For a start, feeling needed is undoubtedly essential to each individual. This fact must be addressed at home, at school, in the workplace, and in politics. For example, one could envision the development of a school curriculum that centers around an empathic practice, particularly in courses such as history, social studies, literature, and political science. If students have no access to an empathic model at home, they would at least be exposed to it in the classroom. In the workplace, the C.E.O. must be able to put herself in the position of the lowest ranked employee and vice versa. Victims and victors must engage in the hypothetical practice that forces each to acknowledge the others' fortunes and misfortunes. 
Empathy is difficult because it forces us to feel the suffering of others. It is destabilizing to imagine that if we are lucky or blessed, it just as easily could have gone some other way. For the young men, whose position is in some ways more difficult than that of their fathers and grandfathers, life seems at times to have stacked the cards against them. It is for everyone to realize the capricious nature of history, which never bets consistently on one group over another. We should learn to cast ourselves simultaneously in the role of winner and loser, aggressor and victim. 
We have a choice whether our national refrain of "No more mass murders" will be meaningful or meaningless. We cannot neglect the young men. By becoming empathic stewards of civic and personal life, there is a chance we could make someone think twice before targeting another human being.

HEADLINE: Reimagining the Coral Market

BYLINE: JOSIE GARTHWAITE


HIGHLIGHT: A new study suggests that the coral trade for aquariums is shifting toward farming rather than harvesting, which might help preserve some coral species. 

 BODY:
In the international trade in live coral, most of which ships to the United States for ornamental marine aquariums, the source is quickly shifting from wild harvesting to farming, researchers report in a new study. 
This shift suggests that, contrary to the conventional view that the live coral trade is a threat to coral reef ecosystems, the buying and selling of corals could help create a powerful incentive for protecting reefs in many small island communities, these scientists say.
"The difference in a year is staggering," said the study's lead author, Andrew Rhyne, an assistant professor of marine biology at Roger Williams University and a research scientist at the New England Aquarium.
Particularly in Indonesia, the world's largest supplier of stony corals and home to more coral reef areas than any other nation, many producers have "learned that if you collect a really beautiful, interesting coral, if you export that, you get to export it one time," Dr. Rhyne said. "If you keep it and farm it, you get to export it forever." 
Published last week in the Conservation Letters journal, the study comes less than a month after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed listing 66 species of coral as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

The paper documents trends in American imports of stony corals from 1990 to 2010, and found that a majority of corals imported to the United States are still collected from the wild, but a small but growing fraction comes from aquaculture.
From 1990 until around 2007, the volume of coral reef livestock imported into the United States climbed by more than 8 percent a year. Imports fell sharply after 2007, by about 9 percent annually - a trend that the researchers attribute to the global economic downturn, a likely increase in domestic aquaculture production and advances in lighting and filtration technology that allow hobbyists to keep smaller tanks with less live rock. 
Imports of corals in the genus Acropora, which are among the easiest to cultivate and the most widely farmed, dropped most sharply. "Other taxa are going to catch up," Dr. Rhyne said, "but this will take a bit of time."
The threat to corals remains dire, however. "The big picture is that coral reefs are in crisis," said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, the organization that pushed for NOAA's recent action by filing a petition to list 83 coral species under the Endangered Species Act. 
The gravest threats, including ocean acidification, rising ocean temperatures and disease, are linked directly or indirectly to greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, NOAA says. 
"Then layered on top of it are all the local threats that corals have suffered from over the last century or more," like water quality issues, overfishing, coastal development, and destructive collection practices, Dr. Wolf said.
Commercial trade in stony and reef-building corals has been regulated under the international treaty known as Cites, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, for nearly 30 years. At this point, according to NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program, a failure to address carbon dioxide emissions and the impacts of climate change could in the long term "make many other management efforts futile." Yet local issues cannot be ignored, it adds. 
In its assessment of the major threats to reefs, "there is evidence that alleviating more local stressors can help improve resiliency for many coral species," the agency says.
"Everybody wants to protect the reefs," said Dr. Rhyne, whose co-authors for the paper were scientists affiliated with Boston University, the New England Aquarium and the environmental group Conservation International. "The argument comes in how you best go about doing that."
Dr. Rhyne and his colleagues describe coral farming in small island communities as a potential tool for conservation at the local level. But it's a tool they worry "is at risk of being lost due to the well-intended but rigid rules of the E.S.A."
Although production methods vary, many coral farmers use a process known as fragmentation, or "fragging," which involves cutting or collecting small segments of live coral. These segments can come from wild reef colonies, damaged reefs or from previously "fragged" mature corals. 
The segments can then be planted in large tanks on land, where they are eventually cut up and affixed to concrete for transplanting offshore. Smaller operations like those maintained in villages in the Solomon Islands may initially cultivate fragments on a boat, and then lower them into the ocean to grow on racks, Dr. Rhyne said. Ornamental pieces can be ready for sale within four months.
Coral farming is not only a business endeavor. Since the 1990s, scientists have worked to develop coral nurseries for restoration projects. In 2009, the federal government awarded more than $3.3 million for an effortto plant at least 5,000 colonies of the Acropora species staghorn and elkhorn, which NOAA has just proposed reclassifying as endangered. (They have been listed as threatened since 2006.) 
Part of the goal is to both repopulate degraded areas and increase the genetic diversity of reefs along the Florida coast, with the expectation that a reef seeded with 35 nursery-raised Acropora colonies a year could restore the reef's coral cover to 1970s levels in a decade, compared with the estimated 30 years or more that it takes for natural recovery.
Commercial growers, of course, have different aims. Coral farmers, Dr. Rhyne said, can develop product lines based on the colors or shapes that consumers like, perceive as rare and are willing to pay top dollar for - up to about $500 per piece, according to the study, or hundreds of dollars per kilogram of biomass. 
"This is one reason for the massive change," he said. "Growing corals is fast, not that technically difficult, and allows the exporter to save the best-looking pieces and make copies of them."
Indonesia's shift away from wild harvesting even as other exporters (notably Australia) expand theirs, is hardly due to chance. As Dr. Rhyne put it, "We have some stick and some carrot in play here." 
The country has been working with NOAA, the Ocean Foundation and the Indonesia Nature Foundation to improve its coral trade. Most production in the country has already moved to sites clustered around major airports, and the country is on track to source some of the most common types of coral entirely from aquaculture within a few years, Dr. Rhyne said.
That means a greater supply of coral for restoring damaged reefs, too, said one of the co-authors, Michael Tlusty, director of research for the New England Aquarium. Indonesia and the Philippines jointly supply 85 percent of the world's coral reef products; Indonesia requires 10 percent of any coral producer's output to be transplanted to the wild.
 "If the country as a whole sells a million of pieces of coral," Dr. Tlusty said, "there are 100,000 pieces that are available to be used for restoration projects."
The notion that aquaculture practices are verifiably sustainable and that protections under the Endangered Species Act would be overly rigid stirs some skepticism. "It's not just that once a coral gets listed, all trade stops," Dr. Wolf said. "The point of listing these corals as endangered or threatened is giving them the kind of safety net that they need so that we have corals into the future." 
NOAA, she added, has the flexibility to restrict imports based on its assessment of whether trade is harming the corals listed as threatened.
Dr. Rhyne's team acknowledged in last week's study that the aquarium trade "has the potential to cause overharvesting, collateral damage to coral reef habitat and introduction of exotic species." 
But in a year of only modest progress on international climate agreements, the researchers said, the Endangered Species Act protections may be like a Band-Aid fix for a broken bone. 
"We're taking this sort of E.S.A. action to get at the issue of climate change," Dr. Tlusty said. "It's one of these things where we're not taking the real big, significant action, and then we're doing these little tiny things, hoping that would be best."
In NOAA's final management report on the proposed listing, released Nov. 30, the agency ranked 19 threats to reef-building corals generally, and found ornamental trade to be of low importance. Still, Dr. Rhyne said, if the potential ecological, social and economic benefits of the live coral trade are to be realized over the long term, more information and closer data tracking will be necessary.
Dr. Wolf, too, urges close study. "Trade has proven to be a threat to many corals, and there needs to be a high level of accountability and documentation of trade, including aquaculture," she said.
The driving question, she said, is this: "Are these corals that are proposed as threatened or endangered - are they indeed threatened by that trade?"
"If so, let's ban or limit trade on those corals, because it doesn't do anybody any good - it doesn't do the reefs any good, it doesn't do the people that are harvesting them any good - if what they're harvesting is just declining to extinction."

HEADLINE: Debt Reckoning: Updates on the Fiscal Deadline

This feature follows the talks between President Obama and Congressional leaders over the so-called fiscal cliff. It aims to explain the major economic and fiscal issues, examine public opinion and analyze the options that the parties are considering as the deadline approaches.
 3:00 P.M. | Credit Ratings Services Give Mixed Reviews to Tax Deal 
Two of the major credit ratings services have given mixed reviews to the fiscal package that Congress devised this week to avert a fiscal crisis, and said the agreement would not change their negative outlook for America's sovereign debt. 
Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday that the package did not "provide a basis for a meaningful improvement in the government's debt ratios," one of the main things Moody's analysts need to see for their outlook on the United States' debt to improve. The debt ratios would not change appreciably because the fresh revenue to be gained from the higher tax rate on wealthy households would be eclipsed by the revenue forgone by keeping the current tax rates in place for everyone else, Moody's said in a brief report. 
Moody's and Standard & Poor's both said on Wednesday that the new fiscal package had bought Congress about two months' time before it would have to enact big cuts in federal spending - as much as $1.2 trillion worth over 10 years. The two-month delay means the next round of high-pressure Congressional negotiations is likely to coincide with the next deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling, which will come in late February or early March.
"Although Moody's believes that the debt limit will eventually be raised, and that the risk of default on Treasury bonds is extremely low, this confluence of events adds uncertainty to the outcome," Steven A. Hess, a member of Moody's sovereign risk group, wrote in the report. "The debt trajectory resulting from this process is likely to determine whether the AAA rating is returned to a stable outlook or downgraded." 
Standard & Poor's said the agreement might bolster "the still-fragile U.S. economic rebound," but "does little to place the U.S.'s medium-term public finances on a more sustainable footing." It also said the continuing uncertainty put the creditworthiness of America's states and cities under "a fiscal cloud," because many states rely on capital gains taxes, and the fighting in Washington could roil the stock market. Moody's said that the deal helped America dodge a recession for the time being, but that the increase in the Social Security payroll tax, along with additional spending cuts expected in the coming months, were likely to dampen economic growth.
The third major ratings agency, Fitch, did not issue a statement in response to the fiscal agreement, but a spokesman said the observations Fitch had made in December still applied. Fitch said in a report on Dec. 19 that it expected Congress to find a way to pull back from the "fiscal cliff," but that it would not be "a credible plan to reduce the federal budget deficit and stabilize government debt over the medium term." 
The three agencies already have a negative outlook on the United States' sovereign debt, suggesting that a downgrade is possible at some point. Standard & Poor's is the only agency ever to downgrade the United States Treasury's credit, which it did in August 2011 by one notch to AA-plus, when Congress nearly failed to increase the government's borrowing authority in time to avert a cash crunch. Moody's and Fitch kept their ratings at the highest possible, Triple-A. 
The three agencies said that while they were looking at quantitative ratios, like the relationship between the federal debt and gross domestic product, they were also considering federal policy makers' ability to negotiate productively despite their fundamental differences. 
Fitch said it was watching for a credible deficit reduction plan, with "specific measures and targets" and "a significant down payment in 2013."
Standard & Poor's noted that Republicans in Congress "have indicated they will demand more spending cuts, while the White House has hinted at a harder line than it took in 2011, when political brinkmanship nudged the country toward default on its debt." Brinkmanship and the brush with default were what prompted the agency's unprecedented downgrade in 2011.
A credit downgrade normally makes it more expensive for an institution to borrow, but that did not happen after Standard & Poor's action. Global investors have kept on flocking to Treasuries, and the federal government's borrowing rate is now around 1.8 percent, compared with a rate above 2.5 percent around the time of the downgrade.

 8:52 P.M. | Debt Ceiling Doubt and Its Costs 
Even as President Obama prepares to sign the hard-won tax deal that Congress passed Tuesday, another manufactured deadline with a colorful name is threatening to hamstring the government and undermine the economy.
Goodbye, fiscal cliff. Hello, debt ceiling.
The federal government has exhausted its legal authority to borrow money, and in about two months it will no longer have enough cash to meet all of its obligations, the Treasury Department said Monday.
Congress could vote to let the government borrow more, as it has done 11 times since 2001, most recently in August 2011. But some Congressional Republicans say they are willing to do so only as part of an agreement to reduce federal spending, while Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he would not accept any conditions, even as he warned of disastrous consequences.
"We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred," Mr. Obama said. "If Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic - far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff."
While it remains difficult to imagine that the federal government would default on its obligations, doubts may grow as the deadline approaches, and the cost of that uncertainty could be significant. The belief that lending money to the United States government is virtually risk-free is a basic tenet of the global financial system. The risks of other investments are measured by comparison, and priced accordingly.
Doubts also could cost the government directly. The scale of federal borrowing means that even small increases in the interest rates that the government pays to investors add billions to the federal debt. The slightly higher rates on debt issued during the last debt ceiling standoff, in 2011, will cost taxpayers about $18.9 billion in additional interest payments, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
"Last-minute agreements to raise the debt ceiling undermine confidence in the sovereign's willingness to pay," Fitch Ratings, which evaluates risks for bond investors, said in a report last month. It added that it still saw little chance of defaulting, describing the very idea as "incredible."
The debt ceiling was created, ironically enough, to make it easier for the government to borrow. The Treasury once required Congressional approval each time it issued debt. The ceiling, which evolved from an initial version created in 1917 to facilitate the government's wartime borrowing binge, replaced those individual authorizations with an upper limit, like the limit on a credit card.
There is an important difference, however: This credit card can be used only for spending that Congress has separately authorized.
That might seem to obviate the need for a limit, or at least create a ready justification for the necessary increases. Instead, over the last century, Congress has repeatedly authorized more spending than borrowing, creating a long-running series of crises that have grown more frequent in recent years.
The ceiling is now set at roughly $16.4 trillion and, as of Monday, that is the amount of the federal debt, too. The government has enough money to pay its debts until "mid-February or early March," the Congressional Budget Office estimated in November. The government needs to borrow about $100 billion a month, and the Treasury estimated last week that it could use bookkeeping tricks to borrow about $200 billion more without increasing the total amount of its debts.
These "extraordinary measures" mostly involve government pension funds that invest their holdings in special federal debt to earn interest. The money that the Treasury borrows from the funds, however, cannot be used to pay other bills. So over the next two months, as about $175 billion in debt held by those funds comes due, the Treasury will repay the money it borrowed and then borrow the same amounts from external investors to pay its bills. Once the debt ceiling is raised, the Treasury will then compensate the pension funds for the lost interest.
The tax deal that passed Congress on Tuesday also cuts into the time remaining to deal with the debt ceiling because it reduces revenues while postponing spending cuts.
Falling off the cliff, for all of its downsides, could have delayed hitting the ceiling.

 9:48 A.M. | Markets Jump on Fiscal Deal 
Global stocks kicked off the 2013 trading year with a strong start Wednesday, as investors welcomed a deal between President Obama and congressional Republicans that ended, at least temporarily, an impasse over fiscal policy that had threatened chaos in the new year.
The broad-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index leaped 2.1 percent at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.8 percent, or about 236 points, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.7 percent.
The deadline drama over the so-called fiscal cliff ended when a sufficient number of Republicans in the House of Representatives joined Democrats to back a deal the Senate had reached earlier, modestly raising income taxes on the highest-earning Americans, ending payroll tax cuts, and creating permanent tax cuts for others.
"There's clearly a big relief rally," said Christian Schulz, an economist in London with Berenberg Bank. Read more

 0:45 A.M. | Obama Bolts for Hawaii After House Vote 
President Obama wasted little time after the House vote on the fiscal deal before hailing the result, laying down a marker for the next confrontation over spending - and then bolting town for a few more days of rest on the beach in Hawaii.
 Mr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room shortly after the vote and lamented that the deal did not address the broader issues involving spending and debt but said "we are continuing to chip away this problem step by step" and called on Republicans to agree on a balanced mix of further tax revenues and spending cuts."
 "The one thing that I think hopefully the new year will focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinksmanship and not scare the heck out of folks quite as much," he said.
 But Mr. Obama warned Republicans against trying to use an upcoming vote on raising the debt ceiling to extract spending concessions.
 "While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills they've already racked up through the laws they have passed," he said. "Let me repeat we can't not pay bills that we've already incurred."
 Mr. Obama took no questions and after eight minutes left the briefing room. Just minutes after that, Marine One had landed on the South Lawn and the president was spotted heading for the helicopter to fly to Joint Base Andrews, where he boarded Air Force One for an overnight flight to Hawaii to resume a vacation interrupted by fiscal talks.
 Air Force One rolled down the runway at one minute past midnight and Mr. Obama will arrive in Honolulu in the early morning Wednesday to rejoin Michelle Obama and their two daughters, who stayed behind when he returned to the capital after Christmas.
 The bill he spent so much time negotiating will have to catch up with him; it will have to be enrolled by congressional officials before being sent to him for his signature, and presumably flown to Hawaii. While Mr. Obama once had a congressional bill signed by auto pen while he was in Europe, that was the first time that had ever happened and is a practice generally avoided by the White House.

 11:38 P.M. | House Passes Fiscal Deal, 257 to 167 
The House late Tuesday passed and sent to President Obama legislation to avert tax increases on most Americans and prevent large cuts in spending for the Pentagon and other government programs. The measure, brought to the House floor less than 24 hours after its passage in the Senate, passed 257 to 167, with 85 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in voting to allow incomes taxes to rise for the first time in two decades. The bill is expected to be signed quickly by Mr. Obama.

 6:13 P.M. | A Bigger Tax Bite for Most Households Under Senate Plan 
Only the most affluent American households would pay higher income taxes this year under the terms of a deal that passed the Senate early Tuesday morning, but most households would face higher payroll taxes because the deal does not extend a two-year-old tax break.
The legislation, which still must overcome resistance exhibited on Tuesday by House Republicans, would grant most Americans an instant reversal of the income tax increases that took effect with the arrival of the new year. Only about 0.7 percent of households would be subject to an income tax increase this year, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. The increases would apply almost exclusively to households making at least half a million dollars, the center estimated in an analysis published Tuesday.
But the Senate's decision not to reverse a scheduled increase in the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while widely expected, still means that about 77 percent of households would pay a larger share of income to the federal government this year, according to the center's analysis.
The tax this year would increase by two percentage points, to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, on all earned income up to $113,700. Read more

 11:28 P.M. | Insurance Program Is Cut to Help Reach an Accord 
 11:26 p.m. | Updated: The fiscal deal approved on Tuesday put off the question of broad spending cuts, but it included an array of provisions added at the behest of members of one party or the other to pick up votes or generate savings.
One such sweetener repeals a long-term-care insurance program that had been championed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Other provisions would help companies that produce biofuels with algae; cut Medicare payments to hospitals and radiologists; protect tax breaks for motor sports complexes and certain film and television productions; and cancel a scheduled pay raise for members of Congress.
The bill, the American Taxpayer Relief Act, also freezes Medicare payments to doctors, which otherwise would have been cut by at least 26.5 percent in 2013.
The Congressional Budget Office said the freeze would cost $25 billion over 10 years, with most of that coming in 2013-14.
Congress offset the cost with changes in Medicare and other federal health programs. For example, it reduced Medicare payments to hospitals by $10.5 billion over 10 years after finding that many hospitals had increased their Medicare revenue by describing the severity of patients' illnesses in more detail.
Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents investor-owned companies, objected to the cut.
"We understand the necessity for Congressional action to avoid a dive off the fiscal cliff," Mr. Kahn said. "But we are disappointed that scarce hospital finances would be used to offset the Medicare physician payment fix."
The tax and spending legislation steers clear of the most contentious proposals for Medicare savings, which would, for example, have increased the age of eligibility for the program. The bill does squeeze savings from health care providers. It cuts Medicare payments for nonemergency ambulance transportation of kidney dialysis patients, gives the government more time to recover overpayments and trims payments to health maintenance organizations serving Medicare beneficiaries.
Under the long-term care insurance program, cherished by some Democrats, workers would have paid monthly premiums during their careers and could have received cash benefits if they became disabled later in life. The program was part of President Obama's health care law.
Obama administration officials suspended the program in October 2011, saying they could not find a way to make it financially sustainable. Many Democrats wanted to keep it on the books, in the hope that it could be revived someday. But Republicans wanted to repeal it, and they got their way.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who was an architect of this week's budget deal, had criticized the long-term care program, known as Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, or Class, saying it was "destined to fail in the real world."
Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, who led opposition to the long-term care insurance program, welcomed the prospect of its repeal. He said the administration had "ignored repeated warnings about the financial solvency of this massive new entitlement."
However, a separate section of the fiscal legislation establishes a commission to study the need for long-term care and recommend legislation in about six months.
The 15-member panel is supposed to examine demographic trends, as well as the potential for new technologies to improve "long-term services and supports."
The legislation also reduces Medicare payments for physical therapy and other therapy services when they are provided more than once on the same day to the same patient.
In addition, the bill would reduce Medicare payments for one particular radiology service when performed in hospital outpatient departments. Lawmakers specified the service in detail: "stereotactic radiosurgery, complete course of treatment of cranial lesion(s) consisting of one session that is multi-source Cobalt 60 based." The cutback is expected to save $400 million over 10 years.
In the future, lawmakers said, they may also cut payments to hospital clinics for services that can be done at lower cost in doctors' offices.
The bill would save $4 billion in 2022 by extending cuts in Medicaid payments to states for hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people. Republicans had sought bigger savings in Medicare and Medicaid and said they would continue their efforts to rein in the growth of the health care programs, which together account for nearly one-fourth of federal spending.
"What I've seen does not include significant spending cuts," said Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia.
Democrats said they would resist any changes that reduced benefits or access to care for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.

 10:33 A.M. | Tax Bill Passed by Senate Includes Farm Bill Extension 
The last-minute tax packagepassed by Senate early Tuesday morning included a nine-month farm bill extension that will prevent an increase in milk prices that was due to hit at the beginning of the year, but the proposal fell short of changes sought by dairy farmers and lawmakers on the agriculture committees who were hoping for a new five-year bill to be included in the legislation.
The most recent farm bill, passed in 2008, expired on Sept. 30. If a new bill is not passed or the current one extended, farm programs would lose billions of dollars in financing and would revert to a 1949 agriculture law. The old law would reintroduce higher government price supports for milk, corn, rice, wheat and other crops and could lead to higher consumer prices and federal spending. Milk prices could jump to as much as $6 to $8 a gallon if farm programs are allowed to expire. Milk now costs an average of $3.65 a gallon.
The Senate passed a farm bill over the summer, but the House failed to bring up its version for a vote after Republicans split over the size of the cuts to nutrition programs. The bills would have cut between $24 and $35 billion from agriculture programs.
Members of the House and Senate agriculture committees had worked on getting the White House and Congressional leaders to include the bills in deficit talks, touting the savings as a way to get a new five-year farm bill passed. But the Senate instead chose to include a proposal by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader.
The proposal by Mr. McConnell would extend only portions of the current farm bill. The extension would have no disaster assistance, something farmers had sought after suffering through the worst drought in 50 years in 2012. The proposal would also eliminate conservation programs and financing for fruit vegetable growers and organic farmers. The proposal does contain provisions to prevent milk prices from increasing. But it would not include a program that pays milk producers when feed prices increase. 
Mr. McConnell's proposal would leave in place direct payments to farmers, which total about $5 billion a year. The payments go to farmers or farmland owners whether or not they grow crops and have long been a target of liberals and conservatives as an example of wasteful government spending.
Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called the extension incomplete and criticized it for continuing the direct payments that were eliminated in the Senate farm bill.
"Rather than embrace the Senate's bipartisan farm bill, which cuts $24 billion in spending and creates certainty for our agriculture economy, Senator McConnell insisted on a partial extension that reforms nothing, provides no deficit reductions, and hurts many areas of our agriculture economy," said Ms. Stabenow.
Dairy producers also expressed their disappointment in the extension.
"These stopgap measures don't even qualify as kicking the can down the road," said Jerry Kozak, president of National Milk Producers Federation. "It's little more than a New Year's Day, hair-of-the-dog stab at temporarily putting of decision that should haven been made in 2012 about how to move farm policy forward, not offer more of the same."
The House is expect to pass a similar farm bill extension Tuesday afternoon when it votes on legislation to stave off billions in tax increases and cuts in government spending.

 7:48 P.M. | House Members Express Dismay Over Tentative Deal 
House members of both parties expressed little enthusiasm for a tentative deal to stave off large tax increases as they learned elements of the agreement taking shape on Tuesday.
"What I've seen does not include significant spending cuts," said Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia.
 Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, expressed dismay at the likely delay in automatic spending cuts, with no assurance of other savings to offset the cost. "It's preposterous to delay the sequester," Mr. Burgess said, referring to the cuts. 
 Mr. Burgess said the leadership of the House Republican caucus had told members to "stay close and stay sober" on New Year's Eve, in case they needed to return to the Capitol on short notice.
 Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, said the emerging agreement was vexing because it put off major decisions until a time when Democrats might have less leverage.
"We¹ll be in a squirrel cage," confronting similar issues in a few months, Mr. Blumenauer predicted. "Democrats have all the leverage now" and will probably have less in a few months, when Congress debates an increase in the federal debt limit, he said. "This reinforces all the worst political behavior around here."

 4:25 P.M. | Late in the Game, Biden Re-emerges as a Fiscal Player 
Another year, another fourth-quarter summons from the fiscal bench for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 The late entry of Mr. Biden to the tax-and-spending talks that have consumed the capital over the last two months recalls his role in the debt crisis of 2011 and once again seems to have been critical toward cutting through the deadlock.
 Mr. Biden was handed the ball not by President Obama but by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, who called the vice president after growing frustrated by negotiations with the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden have had good relations going back to their years together in the Senate.
 As soon as the talks boiled down to Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell, it became a relatively short path to a tentative agreement on taxes. The two talked late into the night on Sunday, with their last call coming around 12:45 a.m. Mr. Biden remained at the White House along with Mr. Obama until 2 a.m. before returning to the vice presidential residence for a little sleep.
 Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were back on the phone at 6:30 a.m. on Monday, and by the afternoon Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell were both reporting a near-deal. The vice president and the senator agreed on a compromise raising tax rates on income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for households as well as renewing a variety of tax credits, increasing the estate tax on the wealthy and extending unemployment insurance. But the two still remain in talks about how long to postpone automatic spending cuts due to take effect this week.
 It's not as if Mr. Biden had not been part of the jockeying over the two months before the call from Mr. McConnell. He has sat in on the meetings and advised the president on what to do. But he was largely a secondary figure as long as the action was centered on the House with Speaker John A. Boehner as the main Republican negotiator. Once Mr. Boehner gave up and handed off the issue to Mr. McConnell in the Senate, the vice president's long history in the upper chamber put him back on the field.
 Last year, Mr. Obama gave Mr. Biden the task of negotiating with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, for a way out of a confrontation over the nation's debt ceiling, but they failed to come up with a resolution and Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner stepped in. After the two of them failed to reach a grand bargain, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell came up with an agreement that resolved the issue for the moment but set up the automatic spending cuts that take effect later this week unless the two sides come up with an agreement to stop them.
 The tandem between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell comes not from any ideological affinity; the vice president is a liberal Democrat and the senator is a conservative Republican. But Mr. McConnell has a strained relationship at best with the other two main Democratic players, Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid, leaving the vice president as his best "dancing partner."
 "They have a good relationship," said a senior White House official who asked not to be named discussing continuing talks. "It's borne fruit before."
 Both sides are hoping it does again.

 3:43 P.M. | McConnell Pushes for Deal on Taxes 
With a deal within reach to stop hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases from kicking in Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell went to the Senate floor Monday to call on Congress to act now on the tax agreement and leave a deal on automatic spending cuts for the coming days.
 "Let's pass the tax relief portion now," said Mr. McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. "Let's take what's been agreed to and get moving. The president wants this, members of Congress want to protect taxpayers, and we can get it done now." 
 Mr. McConnell was instrumental in all but securing a deal that would head off most of the fiscal punch if Congress could get it passed. When Senate Democrats all but walked away from negotiations, he reached for the phone and called Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to find a new Democratic negotiating partner.
 "I'm happy to report that the effort has been a successful one and as the president just said, we are very close to an agreement," Mr. McConnell said.
 But a final deal is being held up by one last question: What to do about $110 billion in automatic spending cuts set to begin Jan. 2. Republicans want them to go into force unless they are replaced by spending cuts elsewhere. Senate Democrats want to put them on "pause" for at least a year. President Obama said he would suspend the cuts with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere. And all sides are angry over the impasse.
 Mr. McConnell's solution will most likely be resisted by Democrats, who will see it as a clear Republican victory with the spending cuts remaining in place, at least temporarily. But many Republicans are just as opposed to those cuts as Democrats because they hit defense programs especially hard. Pressure would continue to mitigate or reverse the damage.
 "Let me be clear," Mr. McConnell said, "we will continue to work on finding smarter ways to cut spending, but let's not let that hold up protecting Americans from the tax hike that will take place in about 10 hours. We can do this. We must do this."
- Jonathan Weisman 
 2:05 P.M. | Republicans Express Anger Over Obama Statement 
Republicans responded to the president's statement angrily, accusing him of "moving the goal posts" just when a deal was in reach. They said they knew that the two sides still had to agree on how to suspend automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, but that they generally agreed such a suspension would be offset, at least partially, by spending cuts elsewhere. Instead, the president said any deal to turn off the so-called "sequester" had to be financed by tax increases and spending cuts in concert.
"He can't hold the middle class hostage when an agreement is ready simply because he wants to get the sequester done now," said a senior Republican leadership aide after the speech. "That can be handled over the next month or so."
- Jonathan Weisman 
 1:54 P.M. | Obama Addresses Potential Deal on Taxes 
 President Obama said on Monday that a deal on taxes is "within sight," though still incomplete, as negotiators scramble to meet a midnight deadline.
 "Today it appears that an agreement to prevent his New Year's tax hike is within sight," he said in an appearance with supporters at the White House. "But it's not done. There are still issues left to resolve, but we're hopeful that Congress can get it done."
 Mr. Obama used the occasion to warn Republicans that he will continue to press for more tax increases even beyond whatever may be included in a deal today. "If Republicans think I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone," he said, then "they've got another thing coming. That's not how it's going to work."
Mr. Obama also said that though he would have preferred a "grand bargain" that provided a comprehensive solution to deficit reduction, but that "with this Congress that was a little too much to hope for at this time."

 1:37 P.M. | A Tentative Deal on Tax Increases 
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, on Monday reached agreement on a tentative deal to stave off large tax increases starting on Tuesday, but remained stuck on whether and how to stop $110 billion in across-the-board spending cuts in 2013, an official familiar with the negotiations said.
Under the emerging deal, income taxes would rise to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income over $400,000 for single people and $450,000 for couples. Above those income levels, dividends and capital gains tax rates would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent.

 12:29 P.M. | A Focus on Details as the Framework of a Deal Emerges 
Talks between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are dipping deep into the weeds, a sign of how far negotiations have come toward a deal.
Democrats say no deal is final, and in fact are mightily unhappy with some of the provisions, but the details are spilling out from officials close to the talks. 
Under the blueprint, income taxes would rise on incomes over $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for couples, but the affluent would take another hit. Two provisions phasing out the personal exemption and other tax deductions would be reinstated after being eliminated by the Bush tax cuts of 2001. The so-called PEPS and Pease provisions would begin kicking in on incomes over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples.
The tax rate on capital gains and dividends would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent, but that would kick in with the higher income tax rates, at incomes of $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for couples.
- Jonathan Weisman 
 11:49 A.M. | Senate Democrats Push Back on a Potential Deal 
Senate Democrats are pushing back hard on a deal that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell are closing in on, objecting vociferously to any compromise that suspends automatic across-the-board spending cuts for any time frame short of a year.
 A senior Senate Democratic aide said a one-year "pause" in those cuts - known as sequestration - is nonnegotiable. Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, has suggested a three-month suspension, according to officials knowledgeable about the negotiations.
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the Democratic Party's most senior liberals, took to the Senate floor to suggest that he will oppose the deal that is coming together.
 "As I see this thing developing, as I have said, no deal is better than a bad deal," Mr. Harkin said, "and this is a very bad deal, the way things are shaping up."
 Democratic officials stressed that no deal yet exists, but phone calls between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell have moved negotiations forward. Talks center on allowing tax rates to rise to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on incomes over $450,000 for married couples, an extension of unemployment insurance and a provision to prevent the alternative minimum tax from expanding into the middle class starting on Tuesday. Negotiators are still apart on a tax regimen for inherited estates, but according to a Democratic aide, Mr. Biden has suggested a 40 percent tax rate on the value of estates over $4 million. That would split the difference between the Democratic demand for a 45 percent rate on estates over $3.5 million and the Republican position of a 35 percent rate on inheritances over $5 million. Mr. Biden has also suggested allowing tax rates to rise on singles earning more than $400,000 a year. On Sunday, Democrats had wanted that threshold set at $360,000.
 Democrats are leery that the vice president will give away too much, when they believe that they hold the upper hand politically. Mr. Biden and the Republican leader spoke past midnight last night and again at 6:30 this morning after a series of conversations that began shortly after noon Sunday, when Mr. McConnell reached out to the vice president to break a stalemate.
 Skeptical Democratic aides said they still feared that the deal would blow up over the issue of sequestration. Republicans on Sunday said any "pause" in the $110 billion in cuts for 2013 should be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. Democrats balked, and continue to balk, even after Mr. McConnell suggested that Republicans could accept a three-month hiatus.

 11:24 A.M. | U.S. to Hit Debt Limit as Fiscal Negotiations Heat Up 
On top of everything else, the United States officially hits its debt ceiling today, starting a countdown clock that ends in a cash management crisis in a matter of weeks.
The debt ceiling is a statutory limit on the amount the country can borrow - currently, it sits at about $16.4 trillion - which Congress periodically needs to raise if the country is spending more than it is taking in in revenue. Right now, of course, it is doing just that: The country is running deficits of about $1 trillion a year.
Of late, Republicans have refused to raise the ceiling unless Democrats agree to commensurate spending cuts. In 2011, that led to the heated and ultimately fruitless debt negotiations between the White House and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, as well as the passage of the spending cuts in the "fiscal cliff" that Congress is now peering over. 
This time around, Republicans want to extract cuts, likely from entitlement programs like Social Security, in exchange for their help in lifting the ceiling. But Democrats have said that Congress should go back to raising the debt limit as a matter of course, as generally happened up until last year.
Specifically, the White House has said that it will not negotiate with Congressional Republicans over the debt ceiling. "We are not going to play that game," President Obama said at a meeting with the Business Roundtable this month. "If Congress in any way suggests that they're going to tie negotiations to debt ceiling votes and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation - which, by the way, we had never done in our history until we did it last year - I will not play that game, because we've got to break that habit before it starts."
Democratic aides have described a strategy that is more literal than one might think: to simply refuse to discuss the ceiling as any kind of bargaining chip. But Republicans continue to see the debt limit as a potent piece of leverage over the White House. That has set up another major debt confrontation for early in 2013. 
Right now, the Treasury is undertaking "extraordinary measures" to give the government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills. But such measures buy Washington only so much time. In February or March, the Treasury secretary would need to decide which payments to delay or default on.

 10:23 A.M. | As Senate Scrambles, DeMint Shows No Sign of Return 
If the Senate votes on any legislation to avert a fiscal crisis on Monday, they may have to do it without Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina. 
The Republican senator, who announced this month that he would retire just two years into his second term to head the Heritage Foundation, has not returned to the Capitol for votes in weeks, and there were no signs that he would be beating a hasty return. No one answers the phone at his office and an e-mail to his spokesman was not immediately returned. 
While several senators returned at their own pace last week, when the Senate reconvened with a hope that a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff would be in the offing, most have made it back. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois is set to return to the Senate on Thursday; Mr. Kirk has been away for a year after having a stroke. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has also been missing this week as he is recovering from flu, though his office said the senator would return to vote should a deal come to the floor.
While some of his colleagues may mourn his absence, Democrats no doubt will welcome it as Mr. DeMint is one of a handful of senators who might object to a unanimous consent agreement that must be obtained to get a deal before the 112th Congress's business is finished.

 11:20 P.M. | Different Tax Proposals and Their Reach 
The deadline for resolving the pending fiscal crisis is less than a week away and, absent a breakthrough, spending cuts and tax increases on every income level will go into effect on Jan. 2. During their negotiations, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner have sought to keep tax rates at their current level for some taxpayers while letting them rise for high earners, but they have not agreed on where to set the income threshold. Mr. Obama has called for rates to go up on income above $250,000 (he later increased his offer to $400,000), Congressional Democrats have said they would agree to $500,000, and Mr. Boehner has called for a $1 million threshold. Here is a breakdown of what portion of earners, income and taxes would be affected at three different levels.

 1:43 P.M. | Crawling to the Cliff? 
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, of Nevada, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to say absent an unexpected breakthrough, time has run out on a deal to avert large-scale tax increases and budget cuts in the first days of next year. And in the Senate's current state of dysfunction, he could be right.
The Senate, by tradition, has operated on negotiated agreements and unanimous consent to move legislation from one parliamentary stage to another. If just one senator does not sign on to such agreements, work can continue but only at a crawl. Here's the math.
Mr. Reid could motion Thursday afternoon to bring up legislation that would extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts on incomes under $250,000, set dividends and capital gains tax rates at 20 percent, ensure the alternative minimum tax does not expand dramatically to hit more of the middle class, extend expiring unemployment insurance and temporarily stop across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs. Assuming one senator objects to a request to move straight to the bill by unanimous consent, the Senate would then vote at 9 a.m. to cut off debate on that motion to proceed to the bill.
If that motion got 60 votes Saturday morning, there would then have to be 30 hours of "post-cloture ripening" before the Senate actually votes on the motion to proceed to the bill. That would take the Senate to 1 p.m. Sunday. If again that procedural motion received 60 votes, the Senate would be on the "fiscal cliff" bill itself. Mr. Reid would then immediately file to cut off debate on the bill itself. 
At that point, under Senate rules, the earliest possible vote on final passage would be Tuesday, Jan. 1. By then, the 112th Congress would have disbanded and efforts to pass the bill would have to start all over again - this time on the other side of the "fiscal cliff."

 4:27 P.M. | Geithner Puts Issue of Debt Limit in Writing 
At the end of the year, the United States will hit its statutory borrowing limit, starting a countdown clock that would within a matter of weeks lead to it failing to pay all of its obligations, according to a statement from the Treasury Department. 
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner wrote a letter to Congress informing it that the United States would hit its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit on Dec. 31. The Treasury will "shortly" begin undertaking "extraordinary measures" to avoid the limit - essentially moving money from pocket to pocket to give the government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills, from soldiers' salaries to Social Security payments, after that date. But within weeks - sometime in February or March, analysts estimate - its required payments would overwhelm its receipts, leaving an unprecedented cash shortfall. That would most likely send financial markets into a tailspin and lead to another downgrade of the country's debt rating. 
This year, the debt ceiling has become a potent political football, complicating negotiations over the scheduled year-end tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff. The White House wants the debt ceiling to be taken off the table in the negotiations and for Congress to raise it as a matter of course. (Congress controls the country's level of debt, by virtue of its controlling the government's power to tax and spend. The debt limit is a secondary check on the total amount of outstanding debt that Congress periodically needs to raise.) But Republicans have threatened not to raise the ceiling if President Obama vetoes a bill extending the Bush-era tax cuts for household income above $250,000 a year, and more generally have indicated that they intend to use it as a bargaining chip. 
The full text of Mr. Geithner's letter is below: 
PUB-DATE: December 26, 2012
The Honorable Harry Reid
Majority Leader
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Mr. Leader:
I am writing to inform you that the statutory debt limit will be reached on December 31, 2012, and to notify you that the Treasury Department will shortly begin taking certain extraordinary measures authorized by law to temporarily postpone the date that the United States would otherwise default on its legal obligations. 
These extraordinary measures, which are explained in detail in an appendix to this letter, can create approximately $200 billion in headroom under the debt limit. Under normal circumstances, that amount of headroom would last approximately two months. However, given the significant uncertainty that now exists with regard to unresolved tax and spending policies for 2013, it is not possible to predict the effective duration of these measures. At this time, the extent to which the upcoming tax filing season will be delayed as a result of these unresolved policy questions is also uncertain. If left unresolved, the expiring tax provisions and automatic spending cuts, as well as the attendant delays in filing of tax returns, would have the effect of adding some additional time to the duration of the extraordinary measures. Treasury will provide more guidance regarding the expected duration of these measures when the policy outlook becomes clearer.
Sincerely,
Timothy F. Geithner
Identical letter sent to:
 The Honorable John A. Boehner, Speaker of the House
 The Honorable Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader
 The Honorable Mitch McConnell, Senate Republican Leader

 9:59 P.M. | Military Looks to Phase in Spending Cuts 
In last year's budget talks, Congress set up the prospect of $500 billion in automatic cuts in military spending to help pressure political leaders to reach a broader deficit-reduction deal.
The cuts, which would start with $50 billion next year, would be disruptive. But military analysts say they could be phased in more gradually than originally thought, eliminating the need for furloughs or layoffs on Jan. 2.
As a result, White House officials and House Republicans believe that they can limit the fallout at the Pentagon if they miss that deadline and reach a larger budget deal sometime next year.
"It's not like a government shutdown, where things close and the lights go out," said Todd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. "It looks more like a glide slope than going down a cliff."
The defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, who has said that the automatic cuts would be catastrophic, also toned down his remarks in a memorandum to Pentagon employees on Thursday.
"These cuts, while significant and harmful to our collective mission as an agency, would not necessarily require immediate reductions in spending," he wrote. But, he added: "Should we have to operate under reduced funding levels for an extended period of time, we may have to consider furloughs or other actions in the future."
Under the law that created the process, known as sequestration, uniformed members of the military would be exempt from furloughs or pay reductions, and war spending would be protected.
But a significant number of the Pentagon's civilian employees could be furloughed or laid off, as could some of the contractors who build weapons systems and provide services to the military.
The plan was created to cut spending automatically if the White House and Congress could not agree on how to meet caps on discretionary spending. Mr. Panetta has said sequestration would act like a meat ax, chopping about 10 percent off most Pentagon programs next year. If the plan is not altered, the cuts would add up to $500 billion over 10 years.
Democrats initially hoped that the threat of the automatic cuts would help prompt more hawkish Republicans to make a deal on deficit reduction. But the level of military spending never became a major topic in the presidential election, and it has been pushed to the side in the latest negotiations.
The House voted 215 to 209 on Thursday night to cancel the military cuts. The narrow margin in the House, which has 241 Republicans, suggested that "the floor is getting soft under defense spending" in general, said Gordon Adams, who helped oversee military budgets in the Clinton White House.
Mr. Harrison, the budget center analyst, said that if the automatic cuts were to start on Jan. 2, they would unfold in several stages. The fiscal year started on Oct. 1, so the Pentagon would have three quarters in which to shave about $50 billion from its base budget of more than $525 billion.
"There would be no immediate layoffs," he said. And weapons programs that had already been financed would keep going.
By next spring, the Pentagon would probably have to furlough or lay off civilian employees, and "things could get messy," he said. It would also have to slow awards of new contracts, and it would have fewer employees to oversee contractors, causing more delays.
Mr. Harrison said that unless the department could shift money from other uses, it would eventually have to reduce its civilian payroll by nearly 14 percent. Though the Pentagon has said it would try to avoid layoffs, Mr. Harrison said it could only achieve that level of savings through furloughs if nearly every one of its 791,000 civilian employees took a month off without pay.
Because most weapons programs are financed in advance of the work, he said, the purchases from contractors might decline by only 3.5 percent next year.
Military analysts said that if a broader deficit-reduction deal is reached, the Pentagon might have to accept from $150 billion to $300 billion in cuts over 10 years instead of the $500 billion under the sequestration law. It also would have more flexibility in apportioning the cuts.

 5:58 P.M. | Obama Proposes Scaled-Back Deal on Taxes and Spending 
President Obama urged Congress on Friday to make another attempt after Christmas to pass a scaled-back plan before the end of the year to head off broad tax increases and spending cuts that would otherwise occur.
After meeting with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and talking on the phone to House Speaker John A. Boehner, the president said he was hoping for a formula that would gain enough support from both Democrats and Republicans to allow passage by bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate.
"We move forward together, or we don't move forward at all," he said. 
He said such a plan, among other things, would avoid raising taxes on the middle class and extend unemployment insurance payments.
Mr. Obama stressed that he remained "ready and willing to get a comprehensive package done," whether in a grand compromise or a series of steps.
But the limited, stopgap approach, he said, is "an achievable goal that can get done in 10 days."
The House and the Senate are not expected to resume business until after Christmas.
In the meantime, Mr. Obama said, "Everybody can cool off, everybody can drink some eggnog, have some Christmas cookies, sing some Christmas carols and enjoy the company of loved ones." 
He acknowledged that there would have to be compromises in order to draw enough support from both parties.
"Nobody can get 100 percent of what they want," Mr. Obama said. "And this is not simply a contest between parties in terms of who looks good and who doesn't. There are real-world consequences to what we do here."
Describing the halting progress of the past few weeks, Mr. Obama said that "I met them halfway on taxes and I met them more than halfway on spending."
As he has done all along, he said that his primary aim was to avoid tax increases on lower and middle tax brackets - but that the wealthy would be asked to pay more.
The scaled-back plan the president is proposing would extend expiring Bush-era tax rates on incomes below $250,000, with a measure to temporarily suspend automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits, Democratic officials said Friday.
The bill would be similar to legislation already passed by the Senate, but the added measures delaying so-called "sequestration" and helping the unemployed would make it that much more difficult for Republicans to oppose, Democrats said. 
Senator Reid was meeting with the president Friday afternoon to consult on ways forward. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said Mr. Reid would move forward with the stripped-down bill to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff only if Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, agreed not to filibuster it.
Asked whether he would do that, Mr. McConnell stepped onto an elevator and said, "Merry Christmas."
With just days to go before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts go into effect, Democrats are increasingly giving up hope on a major deficit reduction deal. They hope a fallback plan would win so much support in the Senate that Mr. Boehner would feel no choice but to bring it to the House floor, where a combination of Democrats and Republicans would push it to passage.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, said he was not briefed on the plan but would be willing to move forward on anything at this point.
"Whatever has enough votes in the House and the Senate - the bigger the better - but just get the votes," he said. 
The plan would do nothing to cut spending or put into motion changes to entitlement programs like Medicare, nor would it head off showdowns early next year on raising the nation's statutory borrowing limit or keeping the government running when a stopgap spending law runs out in March. But it would prevent a fiscal jolt in less than two weeks.

 11:44 A.M. | Congressional Democrats Offer Support for Deal 
Congressional Democrats on Friday prepared to offer their support to President Obama and the speaker of the House to strike a deal, even if it means the president's taking another step toward Republicans.
"We saw the failure of 'Plan B.' It's time to get 'Plan C,' which is 'compromise,' and use the president's current proposal as the basis," said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "We're prepared to step up and get him the 218 votes, as long as it's fair and balanced, which the president's currently is."
Even before Thursday night's Republican rebellion, polls showed that Americans strongly support Mr. Obama's position on taxes, and more broadly that they are inclined to blame Republicans for the failure to get a deal. That could give the president carte blanche to stand his ground behind his last offer, which would allow taxes to rise on incomes over $400,000, raise $1.2 trillion in revenues over 10 years, cut $930 billion in spending over a decade and save $290 billion in interest payments on a lower national debt. By the White House's count, that would be balanced, $1.2 trillion in taxes, $1.2 trillion in savings, on top of $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to last year.
But at a Democratic leadership meeting after the Thursday vote was called off, Democrats discussed further concessions. Those could include raising the income threshold for tax increases to $500,000 and possibly inching higher on the $400 billion in federal health care savings Mr. Obama has offered.

 8:28 a.m. | Conservative Republican: Boehner Diving 'Left' 
Representative Tim Huelskamp, a conservative Republican from Kansas who led the House Republicans' resistance to House Speaker John A. Boehner's fiscal plan, said on Friday morning that he would not vote for any approach that raised taxes on anyone, no matter how wealthy.
Mr. Huelskamp said he blamed the failure Thursday night of Mr. Boehner's effort to pass the "Plan B" legislation on the House Republican leaders, as well as on Senate Democratic leaders and President Obama. He also criticized Mr. Boehner and the Senator majority leader, Harry Reid, for leaving town until after Christmas.
"Let's do Plan W - go to work," Mr. Huelskamp said. "We can still get this done."
Mr. Huelskamp took this strikingly uncompromising stance in an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" show. He described the Boehner approach to negotiations with the White House as a "dive left."
"We don't have to raise taxes on anyone," he said.
Without Congressional action on some kind of compromise, taxes will be raised automatically next year in all tax brackets. 
Mr. Boehner's office said the speaker would talk to the press at 10 a.m. Friday morning.
Mr. Huelskamp, a frequent critic from the right of his own party's leaders, was one of three conservative Republicans ousted from committee assignments after the November elections by Mr. Boehner, apparently because they did not toe the party line.
In a statement on his Web page explaining his opposition to the Boehner plan, he called it "a 'show' bill that asks us to compromise on our principles."
"Republican leadership thought they could silence conservatives when they kicked us off our committees," he said. "I'm glad that enough of my colleagues refused to back down after the threats and intimidation."
Also on Friday, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the second ranking Democrat in the House, said on MSNBC that he hoped the collapse of the Boehner plan would open a path to compromise. 
He said that would mean shaping a "balanced, fiscally effective" formula, presumably including higher taxes on wealthier people - but he would not be pinned down on a specific income level. 
"Democracy is compromise, " he said. But on the subject of tax increases, he said, "zero is the answer to a large number of Republicans."

 11:57 P.M. | When Reality and Perception Part Ways 
In their efforts to resolve the pending fiscal crisis, Republican and Democratic negotiators are struggling to thread a very fine needle: finding budget cuts big enough to help stabilize the country's long-term debt but palatable enough to sell to both sides and the public at large.
Part of the challenge is that the biggest, fastest-growing expenses tend to be the ones Americans object most to cutting. Last year, a Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health poll asked respondents whether they would support major, minor or no reductions to a number of programs.
Over all, Americans were most willing to cut foreign aid, spending for the war in Afghanistan and salaries and benefits for federal workers. But Congress could eliminate spending on foreign aid and Afghanistan entirely and still be left with large deficits.
As of the 2011 fiscal year, the government was spending about $22 billion a year on foreign aid and $120 billion on the conflict in Afghanistan. But for the past four years, it has run deficits of more than $1 trillion a year. As for federal salaries, they have been frozen for the past two years. And if all federal civilian workers took a 10 percent pay cut, that would amount to roughly $19 billion a year in savings.
Americans were far less willing to cut Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare. But those programs pose far and away the biggest challenge to the long-term fiscal health of the country, as Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and a number of other economic experts have long warned. Rising health care spending is often singled out as the one most pressing factor.
Moreover, Congress has already wrung billions in savings from discretionary spending programs. According to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, the Budget Control Act passed last year contained about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, about two-fifths from defense and three-fifths from other discretionary spending. That will shrink nondefense discretionary spending - meaning public education, agriculture, infrastructure, aid to the poor and numerous other programs - as a share of economic output to its lowest level since 1962 at least.

 8:32 P.M. | Both Sides Stand Firm on Details: You First 
WASHINGTON - Despite the dueling news conferences and stream of well-rehearsed sound bites from the White House and Congress about the budget talks, one element is still largely missing from the debate: details about spending cuts.
Beyond numbers so large they are virtually meaningless to most Americans and a few specific proposals, like an adjustment to the Social Security formula, neither side has said much about how it wants to cut federal spending. Given that tax increases - the most discussed point of the negotiations - would by themselves only bring in a fraction of the $1.2 trillion in new revenue the president has called for, the omissions are all the more glaring.
At times, the comments can seem like funhouse mirror images.
"Mr. President, let's talk about a balanced plan, but where are your specifics on the spending cut?" Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican majority leader, said recently.
The following day, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, chided her Republican colleagues for writing to the president to propose steep spending cuts and $800 billion in new revenue. "The Republicans sent a letter - perhaps you saw it? It had a number in it. It had no specifics," she said.
The lack of specificity is especially striking from Republicans, because they favor a deficit package composed largely of spending cuts.
There are several reasons that neither side is saying much publicly about the numbers.
First, both sides generally prefer taking a "you-first" posture in budget negotiations. Although polls show that a majority of Americans favor generic spending cuts, the largest federal programs - Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid and the military, among others - are all popular. That gives politicians reason to stand back while the other side details proposed cuts, and then to criticize those plans.
Second, this phase of budget talks revolves mostly around overall savings. The specifics are likely to be hashed out early next year, creating further reason for the parties to keep their views to themselves for now.
"The notion that we'd put out a document that anyone could use to pick apart and bash us with, that just doesn't really gain us anything in the negotiations," said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, who sits on the Budget Committee and is a member of the House Republican leadership.
With a tinge of irritation in his voice, he added: "I do find it rather interesting the short-term memory that many people have, saying we haven't received a list of specifics from the House. We've actually sent two."
Mr. Lankford was referring to two bills passed this year by the Republican-led House that contain what Republicans say are the meat of their spending cuts. The principal bill - the "Ryan budget," named after its main architect, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the committee's chairman - would overhaul programs like Medicare and reduce spending by trillions of dollars in proposed cuts over the next decade.
The second bill included similar reductions as a way of avoiding automatic cuts that are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 if a deal is not reached, including paring services like food stamps, children's health insurance and Medicaid.
Democrats tried to turn the 2012 campaign into a referendum on many of those proposed cuts, making Republicans think that it would be unwise to relight those battles. Since the election, members of the Republican conference, usually a restless bunch, have been reticent to talk more about spending.
"It really has surprised me a bit," said Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, who has broken ranks with some in his party and disavowed a no-tax-increase pledge signed by almost every House Republican. "I somewhat expected when the speaker initially indicated that revenue was on the table, a bolder voice of those saying absolutely not."
For its part, the White House has proposed $800 billion in cuts. The president has said that half would come from federal health care programs; $200 billion from other so-called mandatory programs, like farm price supports that are not subject to annual Congressional spending bills; $100 billion from military spending; and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress's annual discretion.
For members of Congress not in the top ranks of leadership, there is one more reason not to talk in detail about cuts: Many of them do not know what exactly is happening in the negotiations.
"For us, we remain united behind the president," said Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, a member of the House's tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and one of the party's Congressional leaders. "Everybody is always concerned about the details of any proposal. But to be brutally honest, we don't have a whole lot of details to look at."
Anyone looking for more specifics is likely to be disappointed.
"At the end of the day the deal is going to be cut by the two principal negotiators," said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. "In these types of situations you either trust your negotiator or you don't."

 2:40 P.M. | White House Continues Effort to Court Business 
The White House's effort to win support in the business community for a deal to end the fiscal impasse in Washington is set to continue on Wednesday afternoon, as top administration officials meet with the heads of some of the nation's most powerful industry groups.
The meeting, confirmed by individuals briefed on the session, comes in the wake of last week's shift by the Business Roundtable to support tax increases as part of any compromise. That move provided nervous Congressional Republicans a bit of cover as the two sides seek an agreement that will cut the deficit and prevent more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts from going into effect beginning in January.
 White House officials attending the session include Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury, as well as top advisers like Valerie Jarrett and Gene Sperling, along with Jeffrey Zients, head of the Office of Management and Budget.
 In addition to John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan who is president of the Business Roundtable, other industry representatives at the meeting will include Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
 The manufacturers association and the Chamber of Commerce have been relatively quiet amid the flurry of activity by chief executives and the White House, so observers will be closely watching to see if they come out with any specific policy recommendations in the coming days.
 Several other well-known business representatives are also expected to attend - Marion Blakey of the Aerospace Industries Association, Rob Nichols of the Financial Services Forum, Tim Pawlenty of the Financial Services Roundtable and Dan Danner of the National Federation of Independent Business.

 10:43 A.M. | Obama Threatens to Veto Boehner's Fiscal 'Plan B' 
President Obama said on Wednesday that he would veto Speaker John A. Boehner's stripped-down "Plan B" approach to averting a fiscal crisis less than two weeks away, demanding that any package include an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a variety of tax breaks for the working poor that are set to expire.
"The American people have been clear that they will not accept an economic approach that places too big of a burden on the middle class, seniors, students and the most vulnerable Americans while asking too little of the wealthiest Americans," said the White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer. The Congressional Republican 'Plan B' legislation continues large tax cuts for the very wealthiest individuals - on average, millionaires would see a tax break of $50,000 - while eliminating tax cuts that 25 million students and families struggling to make ends meet depend on and ending critical incentives for our nation's businesses. It would also cut off a vital lifeline of unemployment assistance to two million Americans fighting to find a job just a few days after Christmas." 
The threat is more about getting deficit-reduction talks going again than stopping House legislation that would allow tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million but do little else to get control of the deficit. House Republican leaders are trying to round up the votes to push the bill to passage in the House on Thursday, against concern among ardent conservatives over the tax increases it would allow and among military hawks over the across-the-board defense cuts scheduled for January that it does nothing to stop. Regardless, it has little chance to get a hearing in the Senate.
"The president believes this moment presents both sides an opportunity to reach a significant, balanced deal that is good for American families, the economy and for our nation's future," Mr. Pfeiffer said.
Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, called the veto threat "bizarre and irrational."
"Republicans have always said a broader, 'balanced' plan is the ideal solution, and we have put one forward," he said in a statement. "In the absence of a 'balanced' solution from the president, however, we must act to stop taxes from rising across the board in 12 days."
Mr. Boehner says he too wants to resume negotiations over a broader deal that prevents most tax increases next year but also locks in spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare. But he says the president's offer - now in its third iteration - is still too heavy on tax increases and too light on spending cuts and entitlement reforms.

 5:00 P.M. | Without Action on Farm Bill, 'Dairy Cliff' Awaits 
In the new year, the dairy industry could be facing a fiscal crisis of its own.
Unless Congress passes a farm bill or votes to extend the current law, which expired last September, milk drinkers could see prices surge to more than $6 a gallon early in the new year, government and industry experts say.
With a possible "dairy cliff" nearing, several lawmakers are scrambling to get a stalled farm bill included in the tax and spending deal between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner.
Without action by Congress, several programs, including price supports for milk producers, expire at the end of the year. At that point, retail milk prices could soar because a complex federal milk pricing program would revert to a 1949 formula that would push up prices. Hundreds of dairy farmers also face foreclosure as a drought and high feed prices have pushed up operating costs.
"With each passing day, the difficulty of enacting a farm bill before the end of this Congress grows," a bipartisan group of 33 senators said in a letter last week to Senate Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader. "Congress must do the responsible thing and pass a full, five-year reform farm bill," the letter said. "Accordingly, we urge you to consider folding in the Senate's strong bipartisan bill in any end-of-year package."
The senators said the proposed farm bill cuts, ranging from $23 billion in the Senate version to $35 billion in the House bill, should be part of any plans to cut spending. It is unclear what version of the farm bill, if any, the White House and Republican leaders would fold into a deficit reduction package. Senators are calling for their version to be included in the deficit talks because the bill has already passed the Senate. The House bill cleared the Agriculture Committee but has not been voted on by the full House. House members have rejected the Senate bill.
Senate and House Agriculture Committee leaders have been meeting for weeks to try and reach a compromise on the different proposals. But the two sides are deadlocked on the size of potential cuts in food stamps, which makes up nearly 80 percent of the farm bill spending. The Senate bill would cut the program by $4.5 billion over 10 years, while the House version would cut $16.5 billion over the same period. Senators have offered to make deeper cuts, they but are unwilling to go as far as the House.
House Agriculture Committee leaders have so far rejected the Senate offer as inadequate. The House leaders said they were waiting for a "balanced offer" from the Senate.
House lawmakers aren't the only ones who would be opposed to the Senate bill being included in a deficit reduction deal.
Southern farmers have also voice their objections, saying the bill favors Northern farmers. Many Southern farmers, especially rice and peanut growers, say the Senate bill would provide an inadequate safety net because it would eliminate direct payments. Direct payments cost about $5 billion a year and are given to farmers and farmland owners, whether or not they grew crops.
Both versions of the farm bill would eliminate the payments, but the Senate bill would replace them with crop insurance, which rice and peanut farmers say is inadequate in dealing with their losses. The House bill would include a price loss program, mainly for rice and peanut crops, to subsidize farmers' income if prices fall below target prices set by the government.
"It is no secret that many Southern producers believe that the Senate bill is tilted toward 'Northern interests' at the expense of rice, peanut, and other farmers in the South," rice producers wrote in a letter to the group of 33 senators.
The Senate has offered to provide some additional support for rice and peanut farmers, but the proposal falls short of what House leaders and Southern farmers are demanding.

 8:39 P.M. | Social Security Checks Enter the Debate 
WASHINGTON - As part of a deal being negotiated by President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner to avert the worst of the year-end tax increases and spending cuts, Social Security payments might be lower in the future for millions of Americans.
On Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans were examining a multitrillion-dollar deficit reduction package put forward by the president, though the two sides were trading barbed remarks and aides were emphasizing that nothing was final until the whole deal was done.
But the White House seemed willing to make a concession to Republicans with a switch in the formula that ensures that Social Security payments keep up with the pace of inflation - an idea that immediately proved unpopular with its liberal base.
"Any talk of shrinking the program to save money is flawed from the start because Social Security is not part of the national budget in the same way as military spending," Representative Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona said in a statement. "It's paid for through a dedicated payroll tax separate from general budgeting."
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York was among many on the left who echoed that sentiment. "Everyone has a grandparent, a friend or a neighbor who relies on the Social Security benefits they earned to pay for medical care, food and housing," he said in a statement. "A move towards chained Consumer Price Index would be a long-term benefit cut for every single person who receives a Social Security check."
Democrats and Republicans are considering switching Social Security payment adjustments to a "chained" Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index tracks the price of a basket of commonly purchased household goods. A chained index accounts for consumers' tendency to substitute similar items for one another as prices fluctuate. A consumer might buy more apples when the price of oranges increases, for instance.
Though it sounds like nothing more than a technical fix, adopting a chained index would squeeze benefits over time. The chained index ends up, in a given year, about 0.3 percentage points lower than the unchained index. That difference accumulates, so after five years, it might be 1.5 percentage points lower. Using a chained index would cut Social Security spending by about $112 billion over a decade, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.
AARP, the lobbying and research group for older Americans, immediately criticized the proposal. "We would rather see a broader discussion addressing retirement security," said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP. "We object to the context in which it's being discussed, which is a few weeks before Christmas, without people understanding what the change really means."
Because the payment reductions would accumulate over time, AARP and other groups argue that they would hit the oldest Americans disproportionately hard. They might also unduly burden women, who tend to live longer than men, and the lowest-income older people, who are most dependent on Social Security checks, the groups warned.
Some economists and policy experts have also argued that both the current and the chained indexes underestimate the inflation that older Americans experience. The government produces an experimental "elderly index," for instance, that tries to capture the consumption habits of people over 62 more accurately than other measures. For instance, older people buy more health care and less education than the average family, so the elderly index puts more weight on the former and less on the latter.
In no small part because of spiraling health care costs, inflation as measured by the elderly index has grown faster than inflation as calculated by the standard index that Social Security uses. That implies that the purchasing power of Social Security payments linked to a chained index would erode more over time, given what older Americans buy.
Still, other economists and policy experts from across the political spectrum have argued that a chained index is a more accurate measure of the inflation that households actually experience, and therefore is a better policy tool. They note that the elderly index is still experimental, and that not just older people receive or spend Social Security payments.
"We know that the current measure of inflation is not adequately measuring experienced inflation, and we should hence go with the better measure," said Christian E. Weller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group based in Washington, and the author of a plan to modernize Social Security.
Both liberals and conservatives have at times argued against making changes to Social Security outside the context of a broader overhaul. Many analysts - particularly Democrats - argue that Social Security does not contribute to long-term deficits because it has its own financing stream in payroll taxes. But it does have a long-term fiscal challenge, as payouts would eventually overwhelm its trust fund and revenues.
"Back when the system started, the demographics were really favorable," said Andrew G. Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning research group in Washington. "You could provide decent benefits for the rich and poor alike at low cost. You can't do that anymore, mathematically. We could provide decent benefits for the rich and the poor by raising taxes a lot, but we need to raise taxes for other things." 
Mr. Biggs said Social Security changes that provided more ample benefits to vulnerable low-income older people and less to the well-off might prove to be a better path forward.
"We oppose chained C.P.I.," Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said in an interview. "But I think all of us are waiting to see the details in the final package, and we'll make our determination then."

 3:10 P.M. | Spending vs. Revenue: Simple Formula, but ... 
It takes only two lines to explain the federal government's financial situation. The first shows federal spending, measured as a share of the nation's economic output. The second shows federal revenues. And the space in between - that's the deficit.
To be more precise, over the last half-century, federal spending on average equaled 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product, while revenues averaged 17.9 percent.
As those figures suggest, the government almost always runs an annual deficit. Revenue has exceeded spending in just five of the last 50 years - in 1969 and from 1998 to 2001. The rest of the time, the government has borrowed some of the money that it needs. And the next year it borrowed even more, to cover the old debts and the new deficit. Every year the government runs a deficit increases the total amount of the federal debt.
Borrowing can be very good policy. It allows the government to provide Americans with a higher quality of life: more infrastructure, more services, more investment in the future. And as long as the economy continues to grow, the loans actually become easier to repay with time because doing so requires a smaller share of current revenue.
Inflation helps in the same way: more dollars to repay the same amount of debt.
Consider what happened after World War II. In 1946, the federal debt equaled 122 percent of the nation's annual economic output, the highest level on record. And over the next three decades, the amount the government owed almost exactly doubled.
As the accompanying chart shows, the government ran annual deficits in most of those years. But economic output, and inflation, rose even faster. By 1975, the federal debt was twice as large, but it equaled just 35 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
Or consider a person who makes $10,000 and buys a home with a mortgage that requires annual payments of $2,000. Over the following decade, the person gets a few raises and a new job. Add in some inflation, and the worker is now making $20,000. The mortgage debt, however, does not increase. The person still owes just $2,000 a year.
That's the sunny side, but deficits can cause problems too. Greater debt requires larger interest payments. Government borrowing can soak up money that might otherwise be available to businesses and consumers. The European debt crisis is a reminder that countries sometimes cannot borrow as much as they need.
And the federal government's needs are getting larger. The chart shows clearly that the gap between spending and revenue has yawned wider since the mid-1970s, save for that anomalous interlude in the late years of the Clinton administration.
In recent years, of course, the gap has grown even wider. The recession eroded revenues, and the government, seeking to stimulate the economy, increased spending.
Over the last five years, spending averaged 22.8 percent of the nation's annual economic output, revenues 16.3 percent.
What happens next? That is where the two charts diverge.
In the first situation, the government jumps from the so-called fiscal cliff. That has a certain appeal. As the chart shows, revenues would increase, spending would plunge, and the annual deficits would shrink. Economists, however, predict that the nation also would plunge back into recession. "The economy will, I think, go off a cliff," the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference last week.
In the second situation, the government makes almost no changes to current policy and annual deficits shrink slightly before expanding again. That, too, has an obvious benefit: it avoids an immediate dose of economic pain. But it leaves the larger issue unresolved. Annual deficits, and the debt, would continue to grow.
Both the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans would like to land somewhere in between: more revenues, yes, and less spending too, but not enough of either to eliminate deficits or undermine the economic recovery.
So far, they have not been able to agree where those lines should be.

 12:02 P.M. | Obama and Boehner Meet as Deficit Negotiations Continue 
President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met at the White House on Monday morning, an administration official said, indicating further quickening of their negotiations for a tax-and-spending deal to reduce deficits since the weekend.
 The two men met for about 45 minutes, according to the White House, and neither side is providing any information. However, people in both parties say that Mr. Boehner, for the Republicans, is not pressing any more for an increase in the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65, while Mr. Obama has indicated that for the right deal he would support switching to a new inflation formula for federal programs, one that would have the effect of reducing future cost-of-living payments for Social Security beneficiaries. 
 The meeting was their first since Thursday, but they spoke by phone on Friday and staff advisers were in back-and-forth consultations through the weekend. 
 In this final week before Christmas, Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner must come to some accord by Tuesday to get some measure through Congress before lawmakers depart, some Republicans say. In the House, Mr. Boehner has a three-day rule requiring that many days before a vote so members can familiarize themselves with legislation. The rule can be waived, but that would require a majority vote from the full House.
If the sides fail to reach an agreement, they would likely have to call lawmakers back to the Capitol in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, which could pose additional challenges. After Dec. 31, absent some bipartisan action, taxes would go up for every taxpayer with the expiration that day of the Bush-era tax rates, and tens of billions of across-the-board cuts would be made in domestic and military programs, potentially causing a recession, economists say.

 8:33 P.M. | Talks Highlight a Structural Divide 
WASHINGTON - To Democrats, Republican resistance to raising tax rates on affluent Americans seems not only stubborn, but also befuddling and self-defeating.
Public opinion strongly favors it. President Obama just won re-election campaigning more strongly on the tax issue than on any other. Federal revenue as a share of the economy is near a 60-year low. Washington faces a $1 trillion annual deficit.
Yet even as some party leaders and intellectuals urge them to concede the point, most rank-and-file House Republicans refuse. That is why Speaker John A. Boehner has moved so gingerly, finally offering late last week to raise rates only on incomes of $1 million or more, despite calls from Senate Republicans for a deeper concession.
The reasons run deep in the structure of 21st-century American politics, and the modern Republican Party.
The national exit poll conducted by Edison Research for the November election illustrates how polarization by party and ideology has estranged the coalitions behind Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner in their stalled negotiations.
Seven of 10 Obama voters said government should be doing more to solve problems. Eight in 10 voters said tax rates should rise. (Two-thirds said tax rates should rise for incomes over $250,000, and another 13 percent said taxes should go up for everyone.) By contrast, 8 in 10 voters who backed the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, said government already did too much. A 54 percent majority said no one's tax rates should rise.
Those national numbers actually understate the homogeneity of constituencies that returned a Republican majority to power in the House. Because state legislatures draw most House districts to favor their own majority party, more than 80 percent of those elected to the House won with at least 55 percent of the vote.
As a result, the everyday interactions Republicans have with their constituents and colleagues reinforce a lower-tax worldview diametrically opposed to that of their Democratic counterparts - and out of step with most Americans. The biggest threat to their careers is primary challenges from opponents more conservative than they are.
"It's who they are," said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. "It's the air they breathe. It's what the Republican electorate produces."
Mr. Cole, a former chief of staff for the Republican National Committee, has lately become Mr. Obama's unlikely ally. He has tried, fruitlessly so far, to convince his colleagues that yielding to the president on higher rates for families with incomes of more than $250,000 would spare the party political damage while allowing them to fight the administration later on spending cuts.
What Mr. Boehner has proposed is allowing the top rate to revert to 39.6 percent for income of $1 million and above, and to raise his total for new revenue over 10 years to $1 trillion from $800 billion, according to a person familiar with his latest offer. That rate increase would raise far less revenue than Mr. Obama's plan, which would affect many more taxpayers.
In return, according to the person familiar with the talks, Mr. Boehner is seeking concessions from Mr. Obama on spending cuts now, rather than waiting until next year as Senate Republicans have suggested. Contrary to some reports, Mr. Boehner would also like to have some increase in the nation's borrowing limit as part of a year-end compromise on the Bush-era tax cuts and spending to avoid another battle over a Congressional vote to raise the limit, which will be needed as soon as January.
But as grudgingly as Mr. Boehner has moved even that far, there is no guarantee that he could sell such a proposal to his caucus even if Mr. Obama were to accept it. That underscores the difficulty of bridging the chasm between the principal negotiators.
"I don't think the president has any earthly idea" of the strength of Republican opposition, Mr. Cole said. "He moves in a different political culture."
The cultural gap between the parties once was narrower - before conservative Southern Democrats became Republicans, liberal northern Republicans became Democrats and centrists dwindled. In 1990, days before Mr. Boehner was elected to the House, a Republican president, George Bush, joined a Democratic-controlled Congress to enact tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction package.
Of the 47 House Republicans who voted "aye" in 1990, only two remain. Of the 19 Senate Republicans, only two remain. One of those senators, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, will leave office in January after losing his seat in a Republican primary. The Tea Party challenger who defeated him then lost to a Democrat.
"The sad story of the Republican Party is that we've become the party of primaries," said Kim Alfano, Mr. Lugar's media consultant.
The 2012 Republican presidential primaries foreshadowed the difficulty Mr. Boehner now faces. In one debate, every candidate including Mr. Romney rejected the notion of a budget deal that would include tax increases even if accompanied by spending cuts 10 times as large.
"That was a danger sign," said Peter Wehner, a deputy to former President George W. Bush's top political strategist, Karl Rove.
Because conservative voters outnumber liberals, ideological compromise comes more easily to Democrats. Self-described conservatives (35 percent of the electorate) cast 6 in 10 votes for Mr. Romney; those identifying as liberals (25 percent) cast 4 in 10 for Mr. Obama.
Now the prospect of blame for tax increases, spending cuts and an economic downturn forces Mr. Boehner and his allies to seek a compromise. If Mr. Obama accepts deeper spending cuts, Mr. Cole said, enough Republicans would brave anger from their base and back higher tax rates to permit a deal. Mr. Boehner could abandon trying to win over most of his caucus and assemble a majority made up principally of Democrats. But that would mean gambling with his speakership.
"He'd have to persuade them he is doing them a favor by allowing them to vote 'no' " on tax increases, said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top House Democrat on budget issues. "I think he could pursue that strategy and keep his job."
Reaction from the conservative news media poses another risk if Republicans compromise. "How does Fox play this?" asked former Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican and former chairman of his party's campaign committee.
The White House hopes another powerful voice may tip the balance. Many of Republicans' traditional business backers have urged a deal including tax increases to keep the economy from tipping back into a recession.
"Their position as the party of no new taxes is unsustainable," said Bernadette Budde, who retired this month as a strategist for the Business Industry Political Action Committee. "If you're not going to listen to the business community about economic problems, who are you going to listen to? Some talk-radio host? Some blogger? Some political operative?"

 3:52 P.M. | Boehner's New Offer on Taxes Could Help Reach a Deal 
Speaker John A. Boehner's latest offer to President Obama to allow tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million has already changed the terms of negotiations to avert a fiscal crisis in January, and both sides on Sunday expressed new optimism that a deal could be reached this week.
In a phone call with Mr. Obama on Friday, the speaker, who had resolutely opposed allowing income tax rates to rise on anyone, instead spoke in terms of preventing taxes from rising on everyone with a yearly income below $1 million. He also said he could accept an agreement that would raise $1 trillion in new revenues over 10 years, up from $800 billion, if the president committed to significant savings from benefit programs like Medicare, according to people familiar with the talks.
Also, in a big concession, Mr. Boehner offered to extend the debt limit for a year rather than withhold Republican support for an increase to once again use the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit as leverage to force Mr. Obama's acceptance of additional spending cuts in coming months. Mr. Obama has lowered his revenue demand from $1.6 trillion over 10 years to $1.4 trillion, and some Democrats have said his bottom line is $1.2 trillion. Even so, administration officials characterized the speaker's overture as a sign of progress.
With Friday's exchange, the president and the speaker put aside their philosophical argument over whether higher tax rates would hurt "small businesses" and "job creators" and began wrangling only over price. While Republicans with knowledge of the talks said a deal was not imminent, they indicated that it was close. "We are hopeful," one of the officials familiar with the talks said Sunday.
No deal is certain. The parties are far apart on possible changes to benefit programs, especially Medicare, and new tax revenues that must be locked in right away through higher tax rates rather than later through an uncertain tax reform effort. Democrats were hostile on Sunday.
"The reported offer by Speaker Boehner on tax rates would lose almost three-quarters of the revenue that could be gained by ending the Bush tax cuts for households with incomes over $250,000," said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. And that number does matter. The president and the speaker are $400 billion apart on the amount their proposals would instruct Congress's tax-writing committees to raise when the hard work of overhauling the tax code begins next year.
The sides are further apart on the amount of spending that should be cut. The White House has said it wants the relevant Congressional committees to find $400 billion in savings from federal health care programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Mr. Obama's health care law over 10 years, and about $200 billion in other cuts. Republicans want $600 billion in savings from health care programs over 10 years and $600 billion in other cuts, none of them detailed yet.
The officials familiar with the talks said this weekend that Mr. Boehner wants Mr. Obama to agree to move the government to a different way of calculating inflation that would slow the growth rate of many government programs, chiefly Social Security, by slightly lowering cost-of-living adjustments. It would also raise additional revenues because tax brackets, which rise each year with inflation, would rise more slowly. Rising incomes would more quickly push people into higher tax brackets.
But the officials said that Mr. Boehner was willing to drop discussions of an immediate increase in the eligibility age for Medicare, to 67 from 65, recognizing the fierce opposition to that change among Democrats.
Mr. Boehner crafted his proposal on tax rates as a counterargument to a growing number of Republicans who have publicly said that the party should quickly pass legislation to extend expiring tax rates for incomes below $250,000. Advocates of that position said it would keep taxes from going up on Jan. 1 for 98 percent of households.
But Mr. Boehner argued that the proposal, still being pushed by Mr. Obama, would allow the top two income tax rates to increase to 39.6 percent and 36 percent, from 35 percent and 33 percent, to capture people who could arguably call themselves upper middle class. By pressing for a limit of $1 million of income, only the top rate and a handful of the superrich would be affected, and virtually no legitimate small businesses would feel the hit.
The president's plan, which also would include higher tax rates on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, would raise $960 billion over 10 years. Congressional tax experts estimated on Sunday that a 39.6 percent rate on incomes over $1 million would raise $269.3 billion over 10 years. If limits on tax deductions and credits for high-income families that were repealed in the 2001 tax cut are allowed to return, that figure would top $300 billion.
The officials said that would be enough to justify canceling spending cuts that are set to take effect on Jan. 2 and would allow Congress to start on a tax-code overhaul that would create a new set of tax rates, possibly beginning in 2014. Closing loopholes and curtailing deductions and credits would raise most of the $1 trillion in revenues Mr. Boehner has offered, they say.
But Republicans have yet to show how tax writers can get from $300 billion in revenues through one higher tax rate to $1 trillion, and many tax experts have said it could be impossible without cutting back tax breaks for the middle class as well as for those with high incomes.
Politically, however, even Mr. Boehner's modest play on higher rates carries a significant risk in a House Republican conference in which most lawmakers have vowed to never raise taxes. One Republican House member, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to undermine the speaker's bargaining position, called Mr. Obama's resolute demand for higher tax rates "a brilliant play to start a Republican civil war."

 2:13 P.M. | Foreseeing the Issues in Medicare's Future 
The projected growth of Medicare costs is the single biggest contributor to the country's long-term budget deficits, many estimates show. No cohort of Americans, with the possible exception of the very affluent, pays enough in Medicare taxes and premiums to cover its eventual Medicare costs.
Much of the early public discussion of the fiscal deadline has focused on taxes, and the decline of tax rates in recent decades has played a crucial role in creating the deficit. But the question of how to reduce the growth of Medicare costs will become increasingly important as the population continues to age and health costs continue to increase.
In the current fiscal talks, Republicans are pushing for significant changes to Medicare, in exchange for agreeing to tax increases. Democrats are arguing that Medicare is not the most pressing budget problem.
What follows is a primer on Medicare costs.
 Q. Is Medicare really a bigger long-term problem than Social Security or military spending? 
 A. Yes. Over the next 25 years, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare spending will rise to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product, from 3.7 percent this year. (Other federal health care spending - like Medicaid, the insurance program principally for low-income families - is projected to rise to 3.7 percent of the G.D.P. in 2037, from 1.7 percent this year.)
In total, health care spending's percentage of the G.D.P. is expected to rise by five points. Social Security spending is projected to rise by only 1.2 percentage points, to 6.2 percent in 2037. All other federal spending is expected to shrink by two percentage points, to 9.6 percent.
These estimates assume that some current policies continue, rather than that the various tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 occur and remain in place.
 Q. Why is Medicare the big problem? 
 A. As much attention as the aging of society receives, the rise of medical costs is a bigger budgetary problem. The faster growth of Medicare costs, relative to Social Security costs, highlights this difference.
Social Security costs will indeed grow in coming years, adding to the government's fiscal problems. But those costs will not grow nearly as rapidly as Medicare's, because Medicare costs are a function of both the aging society and the cost of treating any one person. Social Security's costs stem almost entirely from the number of elderly people.
 Q. Don't most Americans pay for their Medicare benefits, through payroll taxes over their working lives? 
 A. No, and it is not even close. Two married 66-year-olds with roughly average earnings over their lives will end up paying about $122,000 in dedicated Medicare taxes through the payroll tax, including the part their employers pay, according to Eugene Steuerle, Stephanie Rennane and Caleb B. Quakenbush of the Urban Institute. That married couple can expect to receive about three times as much - $387,000, adjusted for inflation - in benefits. The projected gap is even larger for younger people because of growing health care costs.
In short, the single biggest cause of the long-term deficit is that most people receive much more from Medicare than they give to it.
 Q. Why are health costs growing so rapidly? 
 A. For a good reason and a bad one.
The good reason is that our medical system has made enormous progress in recent decades and can treat conditions that once would have killed people. Cancer treatment and cardiac care are two examples of areas with beneficial new treatments that are often not cheap. An American who turns 65 today can expect to live almost 20 more years on average, up from about 16 years in 1980.
The bad reason is that our health care system wastes large amounts of money. The United States spends roughly twice as much money per person on health care as many other rich countries, without getting vastly better results. Americans receive better care in some areas (some cancers) and worse in others (higher error rates).
It is hard to make the case that the American health system provides a good return on the money it spends. Life expectancy is higher and has grown over the last 30 years in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Japan, among other countries.
 Q. What are the possible solutions? 
 A. For starters, we could pay more in taxes. Tax revenues are near a 60-year low as a share of the G.D.P. They will rise somewhat as the economy recovers and incomes increase, but not by nearly enough to pay for growing health care costs.
Covering the future costs of Medicare and Medicaid solely through higher taxes would involve sharp increases - much greater than anything being debated now. So most budget experts believe that changes to Medicare need to be part of the deficit solution.
Among the options are raising the eligibility age, which is now 65; reducing benefits for affluent families; introducing more competition; and paying for quality of care, rather than quantity.
 Q. What are the upsides and downsides of each? 
 A. Let's take the options one at a time:
The main arguments for raising the eligibility age are that Americans live longer than they used to and that the 2010 health care law makes it easier for people to get insurance if they do not receive it from an employer. The main counterargument is that the longevity increase has been smallest for low-income people, who are most likely to benefit from Medicare coverage.
Reducing benefits for high-income families has some bipartisan support, given the recent increases in income inequality. But some Democrats worry that it could eventually undermine Medicare's popularity, making it more akin to a welfare program.
Many Republicans advocate for more competition in health care, noting that competition has reduced prices and raised the quality of service in many industries. It has an uneven record of doing so in health care, though, in part because insurers can often profit by denying care.
Paying for quality rather than quantity has support from many economists. But it is not always easy. Patients and doctors often want to proceed with high-cost care even when research has not shown it to be effective.
 Q. Does Medicare need to be fixed before Jan. 1? 
 A. Obviously not. Many potential changes would need to be phased in and would not bring savings for years. Other policy changes, like tax increases, can have a quicker effect on the deficit.
On the other hand, fixing Medicare is never going to be easy. Every budget negotiation between Congress and the president is an opportunity for them to make progress on a fiscal problem that is growing every year.

 5:11 P.M. | Study Questions Link Between Tax Cuts and Growth 
A nonpartisan research division of Congress has produced its second report this year questioning the link between tax cuts on high incomes and economic growth, stepping once again into the fuming debate on Capitol Hill over raising taxes on wealthy Americans. 
The Congressional Research Service published its first report in September. After Republicans objected to its findings and methodology, the service withdrew it, prompting an outcry from Democrats.
But on Thursday the service reaffirmed its earlier finding, stating in a new report that it had found "no conclusive evidence" between tax cuts and economic expansion.
The study looked at gross domestic product figures from 1945 to 2010 and compared them with tax rates during those years. Even with top marginal rates exceeding 90 percent, the real gross domestic product growth rate averaged 4.2 percent during the 1950s. Yet during the 2000s, the growth rate was 1.7 percent while the top marginal rate was 35 percent. 
"It is reasonable to assume that a tax rate change limited to a small group of taxpayers at the top of the income distribution would have a negligible effect on economic growth," the report said. 
A tax increase on people in the highest income tax brackets would cover only a small portion of the government's expenses, but it has nonetheless become a focal point in the discussions to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. Even if the top marginal income rates return to the Clinton-era levels of 36 percent and 39.6 percent after Dec. 31 - rather than stay at the Bush-era rates of 33 percent and 35 percent - the additional revenue would be only about a quarter of the $1.6 trillion that President Obama wants to collect over 10 years.
Mr. Obama has made the tax increase his bottom line in negotiations, while House Republicans have so far refused to relent, saying they prefer an option that closes tax loopholes and eliminates credits without actually raising rates.

 11:05 A.M. | Study Says Farm Bills Would Add to, Not Cut, Deficit 
For weeks, leaders of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees have lobbied for their stalled farm bills that cut farm and food program spending to be included in any deals between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans aimed at staving off billions of dollars in spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to go into effect early next year.
In June, the Senate passed a $969 billion farm bill that saved $23 billion over 10 years by cutting several farm subsidies and nutrition programs. The House Agriculture Committee has passed its version of the bill, which saves even more: about $35 billion over 10 years. The full House has not scheduled the bill for a vote.
"The farm bill is the only bipartisan deficit reduction bill that passed the Senate this year. It's only natural it should be part of a larger deficit reduction agreement," Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said last week.
But a new analysis of previous spending on farm bills shows that the proposed bills might actually add to the deficit. 
The analysis by the Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington research group, shows that the last two farm bills, in 2002 and 2008, exceeded their original price tags by billions of dollars. The Congressional Budget Office, which provides cost estimates for legislation, calculated the savings in both bills.
"But taking a look at the C.B.O. scoring track record, it's pretty clear they aren't exactly the 'Farmer's Almanac' when it comes to farm bills," said Steve Ellis, vice president of the taxpayer group.
Mr. Ellis points out that the 2002 farm bill was supposed to cost $451 billion, according to the budge office's original calculations. But the bill ended up costing $587 billion. The 2008 farm bill had an original price tag of $604 billion, but ended up costing $912 billion
The taxpayer group said that with the worst drought in 50 years expected to drive up the cost of farm programs like crop insurance, there is reason to believe that the most current farm bill could easily exceed $1 trillion and wipe out any savings. Crop insurance, which was supposed to be about $9 billion a year, according to the budget office projections last year, is already on pace to exceed $20 billion this year, due to the effect of the drought. 
"It would be the height of fiscal irresponsibility to cram a trillion dollar piece of legislation into a fiscal cliff package. Only Washington would try call a trillion dollars in spending 'deficit reduction,'" Mr. Ellis said
A spokesman for Ms. Stabenow said the new Senate version of the farm bill would make changes that would achieve savings, like eliminating $5 billion in so-called direct payments that are given to farmers or landowners whether or not they grow crops. The House bill also eliminates the payments.
"The C.B.O. determined that the bill we came up with achieves true savings," said Cullen Schwarz, the spokesman. "The C.B.O. is the ultimate arbiter of the cost of legislation, not Taxpayers for Common Sense."

 10:26 P.M. | To Bernanke, 'Cliff' Says It All 
WASHINGTON - Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said on Wednesday that the economy was already suffering because of the uncertainty over whether Congress and the White House can resolve their standoff over fiscal policy by the end of the year.
Consumer and business confidence, spending and investment, and hiring are all softer today than they would be without the looming deadline and the continual pronouncements of impasse, he said.
As the inventor of the shorthand term "fiscal cliff" - which implies that the economy would suffer serious harm if large, automatic cuts in federal spending and increases in taxes are abruptly imposed on Jan. 1 because no compromise was found - Mr. Bernanke made plain at a news conference that he believed the most dire warnings were valid.
"If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary," he said, "I think the economy will go off the cliff."
In Keynesian terms, a contractionary fiscal policy would be one in which taxes are increased and spending is cut, sucking money out of the hands of consumers and cutting demand for goods and services.
Absent an agreement before the end of the year, that is just what would happen when tax increases and spending cuts are programmed by law to take effect, cutting the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Most economists think a recession would result, and Mr. Bernanke plainly agrees.
Mr. Bernanke dismissed the arguments coming from some quarters that it would do little harm to go past the deadline for a few weeks or months, too short a time for the economic consequences to be profound. "I don't buy the idea," he said. "It would be costly."
And the Fed, which has been struggling to prop up the economy by buying bonds and keeping interest rates low, would be largely powerless to do more in the face of a recessionary policy on taxes and spending.
"We cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff," he said of the Fed. "It's just too big."
He said it would be "most helpful" for Congress and the administration to resolve the fiscal questions on two fronts: first, to not create what he called "enormous headwinds" to the economy in the short term, and second, to build a framework for a longer-term sustainable fiscal path.
Essentially, do not try to balance the books too fast, or when the economy is too weak, but do enough to give the markets and the public some reason to hope that in the long term the fiscal problems can be solved - including changes to address the growing costs of health and retirement programs.
He said he remained hopeful that Congress and the administration would "do the right thing," but he did not offer a detailed prescription, in keeping within the traditional role of the Federal Reserve chairman.
"There is a problem with kicking the can down the road," he said. It risks "derailing the recovery which is currently in process."

 5:35 P.M. | Public Wants Cooperation on Fiscal Crisis, Polls Show 
As the deadline approaches, several polls released this week suggest that a growing number of Americans wish to see cooperation in Washington to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, with cautious optimism about the possibility of such an agreement. However, there appears to be little support for increases in any taxes or reductions in any programs.
The latest Gallup Poll shows that 70 percent say government leaders should compromise their principles and beliefs in order to reach an agreement by Jan. 1 - up from 62 percent in a Gallup survey taken last week.
In addition, the number of Democrats who wish for compromise is essentially unchanged, at about 70 percent. But more Republicans are now saying they want to see their leaders make some concessions, up to 67 percent from 55 percent last week. And the number of independents seeking cooperation grew to 70 percent from 61 percent.
The public remains fairly confident about a settlement: 18 percent say it is very likely and 41 percent consider it somewhat likely. More than a third (38 percent), say they think a solution in time to avoid the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts is not too or not at all likely, according to Gallup's findings. 
About twice as many Americans endorse the way Mr. Obama is dealing with the budget discussions compared with Speaker John Boehner. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll illustrates Mr. Obama's power as president to reach the public's notice and Democrats' unified support of him.
Nearly half, 49 percent, approve of how Mr. Obama is handling the negotiations to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year and 42 percent disapprove. Mr. Boehner's efforts are much less appreciated - just 25 percent approve while 49 percent disapprove. But 26 percent have no opinion of Mr. Boehner's role.
About 8 in 10 Democrats and liberals approve of how Mr. Obama is handling the debate, according to the Washington Post/ABC News survey. Fewer Republicans or conservatives - less than 4 in 10 - like how Mr. Boehner has been dealing with the negotiations. Independents divided evenly on Mr. Obama's actions, but are about twice as negative toward Mr. Boehner.
In the Gallup poll, the public's evaluation of Mr. Obama's performance in the fiscal talks is just about the same: 48 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove. Rather than ask about Mr. Boehner specifically, Gallup queried the public about the Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress, and both sides of the aisle received failing grades.
Only 38 percent approve of how Democratic leaders are handling the negotiations, 50 percent disapprove. The public's view of Congressional Republicans is even more negative: 26 percent approve of Republican leaders and 64 percent disapprove.
In the latest Bloomberg poll, 65 percent, including almost half of Republicans, say Mr. Obama has a mandate to raise taxes on incomes over $250,000. Just about as many say the president's re-election authorizes him to protect Social Security from substantial cuts and defend Medicare from fundamental change.
In the latest McClatchy-Marist poll, however, while most Democrats and independents support raising taxes on people with high incomes, most Republicans voters oppose. But a majority of voters, regardless of party, oppose raising taxes for all income levels. With regard to possible spending cuts, most voters are against eliminating the deductions for mortgage payments and charitable contributions, reducing funds for Medicaid or Medicaid and raising the age that people start to receive Medicare.
The nationwide polls were all conducted using landlines and cellphones. The Bloomberg Poll was conducted Dec. 7 to 10 by Selzer and Company of Des Moines with 1,000 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The Gallup Poll was conducted with 1,009 adults Dec. 8 to 9 with 1,069 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points
The Washington Post/ABC News poll was conducted Dec. 5 to 9 with 1,018 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The McClatchy-Marist Poll was conducted Dec. 4 to 6 with 1,091 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

 1:59 P.M. | From House Conservatives, Blunt Words on Boehner 
A group of House Republican conservatives - incensed by its leadership's purge of dissenters from House committees and increasingly worried about talks with the White House - put Speaker John A. Boehner on notice Wednesday that he could face trouble from the far right if he backs any deficit deal that raises taxes.
The House's most ardent conservatives met with reporters Wednesday and were bracingly blunt about their feelings for the speaker, even as Democrats pressed him from his left to give in on tax rate increases on the affluent.
Representative Jeff Landry of Louisiana, just defeated for re-election by a fellow Republican, Representative Charles Boustany Jr., blamed Mr. Boehner for the fiscal crisis now confronting Washington. Representative Cynthia M. Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said she would rather see the nation go over the "fiscal cliff" than embrace a deal that President Obama could accept. And Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, who was removed from the House Agriculture Committee for failing to fall in line with Republican leadership, said the vast majority of his district wanted him to oppose Mr. Boehner's re-election as speaker.
"If Speaker Boehner wants to come back to my district, he's not going to be met with very much welcome," said Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan and another subject of the purge.
The conservatives speaking out represent a small portion of the House Republican Conference, but their anger reflects a storm of criticism Mr. Boehner is facing on conservative talk radio and Internet outlets, in part for movement toward the president on taxes, in part for embracing a purge that threw Mr. Huelskamp and Mr. Amash off their committees, along with Representative David Schweikert of Arizona and Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina.
Their criticism was bracing. Mr. Landry said the blame for the crisis should be put "squarely on" Mr. Boehner's shoulders for pushing legislation last year that set up across-the-board defense and domestic cuts if other deficit reduction efforts failed, and for not pushing hard enough for deeper spending cuts over the past two years.
"He should acknowledge responsibility," Mr. Landry said. "It's not that Speaker Boehner is a bad person. But when you make bad decisions, you have to take responsibility."
Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, compared the purge to parents' punishing their children for breaking rules no one knew existed, and said the move had not been helpful for party unity.
"If you treat your kids that way, I'm a father. You just don't do that. That's just not helpful," said Mr. Jordan, who added that his group was pressing the leadership to reinstate the purged members.
Mr. Boehner is now being squeezed by a right flank unwilling to compromise and a left flank that wants him to give in on tax rates quickly and pass legislation extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98 percent of American households. Democrats are increasingly eager to exacerbate those divisions. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, dared the speaker on Wednesday to bring up a Senate-passed bill to extend middle-class tax cuts using expedited rules that would take a two-thirds vote to pass.
"What are they afraid of?" she asked.
She compared the speaker's predicament to her own in 2007, after Democrats were swept into power on a wave of anger about the Iraq war and she, as the new House speaker, had to find a way to finance the war against the wishes of most of her party. With tax increases looming over almost every working family, she said Mr. Boehner had to find a way forward, even if it costs him his speakership.
"It's painful," she said, "but that's the job we signed up for."

 12:22 P.M. | Democrat Says Boehner Is Dragging Out Talks 
A senior House Democrat, Representative Chris Van Hollen, suggested on Wednesday that Speaker John A. Boehner is dragging out budget negotiations with President Obama for fear that a compromise would so anger Republican lawmakers that his re-election as House leader on Jan. 3 would be threatened.
Mr. Van Hollen's remark, in a breakfast meeting with reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor, addressed speculation in both parties about whether Mr. Boehner would bring a deal with the president to a House vote if he found it did not have support from a majority of Republican colleagues. To do so would violate what Congressional Republicans call the Hastert rule, the practice of the former Republican speaker J. Dennis Hastert to bar votes on measures that a majority of Republican opposed.
"The biggest impediment right now is the speaker's ability to get a decent number of Republican votes for an agreement," said Mr. Van Hollen, of Maryland, who is the lead Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
"I'm getting increasingly concerned that one of the reasons the speaker is deciding to, I think, string out these discussions is that he wants to wait until Jan. 3 when the election for speaker takes place," Mr. Van Hollen added. "And he's concerned that any agreement he reaches - if it violated the so-called Hastert rule - could undermine support for him in his caucus and make it more difficult on Jan. 3. So I would hope that he would put the interests of getting an agreement before House Republican politics."
An aide to Mr. Boehner, Brendan Buck, rejected such talk, noting that media reports have suggested that Mr. Boehner has never been stronger among House Republicans since becoming speaker in 2011.
After the November election, Republicans voted overwhelmingly to renominate Mr. Boehner as speaker, which traditionally is tantamount to election because the majority's choice predictably beats the minority nominee - in Democrats' case, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. But the official House election does not occur until Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes for its two-year session.
Republicans, if unhappy with any tax-and-spending cuts deal negotiated before then by Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama to prevent a fiscal crisis in January, could withhold their votes or write in an alternative to Mr. Boehner. It would take only 17 abstentions to unseat him, and while that is considered highly unlikely - Republicans hardly want to tip the result to Ms. Pelosi - even opposition short of defeat for Mr. Boehner could embarrass and weaken his speakership, and in that sense could be weighing on the talks.
Mr. Buck also dismissed Mr. Van Hollen's charge that Mr. Boehner is stringing out negotiations with the White House. Rather, he said: "The president's allies in Congress are urging him to employ a slow-walk strategy to take us over the fiscal cliff. We've seen nothing from the White House that suggests they're rebuffing those calls."

 12:13 P.M. | Boehner Says He and Obama Remain Far Apart on Deal 
House Speaker John A. Boehner on Wednesday described a "deliberate" conversation he had with President Obama Tuesday night, saying the two leaders remain far apart on how to address the federal deficit less than three weeks until hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts kick in.
"Listen, I was born with a glass half full. I remain the most optimistic person in this town, but we've got some serious differences," he told reporters, after meeting with House Republicans to tell them to expect to remain in Washington between Christmas and New Year's Eve. "There were some offers that were exchanged back and forth yesterday and the president and I had a pretty frank conversation about just how far apart we are."
House Republican leaders continue to press Mr. Obama to lay out specific spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare before they yield further on tax increases, but they refuse to say which cuts they are demanding. The White House says it has laid out a menu of specifics from the budget Mr. Obama released last February, and so far the only recent concessions have come from Mr. Obama; a slight reduction in his tax-increase demand, to $1.4 trillion from $1.6 trillion over 10 years. The president also promised that an overhaul of the corporate tax code, long sought by Republicans, could be part of a deficit deal.
Even with that small decrease, the president's tax demand cannot pass the House or Senate, Mr. Boehner warned.
In November, leaders in both parties were optimistic that a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff could be hammered out well before Christmas. Now, Congressional Republicans seem to be hunkering down for a long, difficult holiday season. Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, emerged from the weekly meeting of the House Republican Conference to say the speaker's message was "keep your Christmas decorations up and make no plans."
"The speaker is standing firm, and we're going to stand firm with him," said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee.
Behind the scenes, talks are gathering steam. The president and speaker have talked almost daily since a face-to-face meeting at the White House Sunday. New offers were exchanged over the past two days.
But publicly, Republican leaders are trying to hold Mr. Obama responsible if no deal can be reached, while they struggle to hold together their troops.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, said Wednesday, "the president seems to be walking us ever so slowly toward the cliff."
Meantime, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, went to the Senate floor Tuesday night to say his party should accept tax-rate increases on the top two percent of households now, then battle Mr. Obama on spending early next year when Congress must raise the government's statutory borrowing limit or risk a debilitating government debt default. Republicans could also use as leverage the expiration of the "continuing resolution" - or C.R. - in March that is keeping the government operating.
"Where we may be headed is towards the end of this month rescuing the 98 percent, putting that issue over to the side and then using the debt ceiling or the C.R. as that forcing moment to cause us to finally come to terms with this fiscal issue," Mr. Corker said.

 3:54 P.M. | Business Group Reverses Course on Tax Increases 
The Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the largest corporations in the country, dropped its opposition to immediate tax increases on Tuesday and released a letter to Congressional leaders calling for a quick resolution of the fiscal crisis that could include tax rate increases. 
"Compromise will require Congress to agree on more revenue - whether by increasing rates, eliminating deductions, or some combination thereof - and the administration to agree to larger, meaningful structural and benefit entitlement reforms and spending reductions that are a fiscally responsible multiple of increased revenues," said the letter, signed by more than 100 chief executives.
The business group, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had previously called for an extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts while Washington hashes out an overhaul of the tax code next year. That put the group at odds with the business-backed Fix the Debt coalition, which is backing a mix of tax increases and spending cuts - and includes many of the Business Roundtable's members. 
But just three weeks before hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases and spending cuts are set to begin, the group decided it needed to try to broker a deal.
Rising Republican talk of using the debt ceiling as leverage early next year to force more spending cuts also may be spooking the business community. The government will hit its statutory borrowing limit in late January or early February, and many Republicans say they will not raise the limit without another round of budget cuts.
"We don't need to go through another debt ceiling debacle," said David Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell, who called for an increase in the borrowing limit large enough to cover "at least a couple of years."
John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan who is now the Business Roundtable's president, said the shift was a recognition that there was a real possibility that no tax cuts would be extended.
"This is a time for a compromise," he said. "It's the principled thing for elected officials to do."

 3:46 P.M. | Obama Ally Urges President to Compromise on Deficit 
Tim Kaine spent two years as President Obama's staunch defender, making the case on behalf of the president's policies in his role as chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
But now, as a senator-elect from Virginia, Mr. Kaine is urging Mr. Obama to compromise with Republicans in Congress to achieve a tax and spending deal before he arrives in Washington early next year.
In an interview, Mr. Kaine, a former governor, said Mr. Obama and Democrats should be willing to agree to some Republican demands, including "smart ways" to cut Medicare, in the interests of avoiding a fiscal crisis.
But he also said Republicans would have to give in to some increase in the tax rate for the wealthy.
"I've put on the table what I thought was a reasonable compromise: Let the tax cuts expire" for income over $500,000, Mr. Kaine said. "The Republicans are not going to walk to the president and say we're going to do it exactly your way. And the president's not going to walk to Republicans and say we'll do it your way."
"So find compromises," he urged.
Mr. Kaine said his party must be willing to cut entitlement spending. But he rejected the idea of changing the age of eligibility for Medicare or Social Security.
"You can save $24 billion a year in Medicare if you just say the federal government can negotiate for prescription drug pricing," Mr. Kaine said. "That is an entitlement reform that saves money. The way we score it up here, that's $240 billion over 10 years."
Mr. Kaine warned the lame-duck lawmakers not to allow automatic cuts to military programs, which could be disruptive for Virginia's many military contractors and its large naval base. But he said the military must make spending reductions in the future.
"We've got to find money to save in defense, too. Defense isn't off-limits for an analysis of savings," Mr. Kaine said. "To make cuts, you can't leave your big line items off the table. Just don't give us automatic cuts to the wrong line items in amounts that are unreasonable."

 12:43 p.m. | Boehner Looks to Change the Focus of Fiscal Debate 
House Speaker John A. Boehner on Tuesday pressed President Obama to offer specific spending cuts to go with the White House's request for tax increases in an effort to shift the fiscal debate away from the issue of tax rates on the affluent toward more friendly Republican political turf.
Opening the House for business, Mr. Boehner spoke publicly on the negotiations to avert the pending fiscal crisis for the first time since he and Mr. Obama met face to face at the White House on Sunday. The speaker described that face-to-face as a "nice meeting" and "cordial." 
"But we're still waiting for the White House to identify what spending cuts the president is willing to make," he added. "The longer the White House slow walks this process, the closer our economy gets to the fiscal cliff."
If no deal can be reached, three weeks from Tuesday, hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect, an economic jolt that most economists believe would send the country back into recession. Republicans have grown frustrated that the public debate on how to resolve that so-called "fiscal cliff" has been dominated by issues of revenue, and whether Bush-era tax cuts on income over $250,000 should be allowed to expire.
A growing number of Republicans, publicly and privately, have said Congress faces little choice but to accede to the president's demand that tax rates rise on the rich, but to get a broad deficit-reduction deal, they say Mr. Obama must offer up specific changes to entitlement programs like Medicare to slow their growth and cut federal spending. If those specific cuts do not emerge, senior Republicans - and some Democrats - say Washington is likely to muddle through the crisis with a series of decisions that hold off the worst impacts of the fiscal hit without a global deal that would really tackle the deficit.
That would likely mean passing legislation in the coming days to extend expiring middle-class tax cuts, then moving on quickly to separate bills to stave off a sudden expansion of the alternative minimum tax and a lowering of reimbursements to health care providers who treat Medicare patients. Those bills must pass before the end of the year.
Early next year, lawmakers say, Democrats will initiate a fight to extend expiring unemployment benefits, while Republicans are expected to resume their bid to force spending cuts and entitlement changes as a price for raising the government's statutory borrowing limit, which will be reached in late January or early February. Another spending fight would likely erupt in March when the current stopgap law to fund the federal government is set to expire.
This lurch from fiscal battle to fiscal battle is "a terrible idea," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the Senate Budget Committee chairman. But without a broad deficit-reduction agreement that raises tax rates on the affluent while satisfying Republican demands for entitlement changes, it is looking like the most likely outcome.
Mr. Boehner said he remains "hopeful" a larger deal can be reached. But he tried to put the onus on Mr. Obama.
"The American people sent us here to work together toward the best possible solution," he said on the House floor. "And that means cutting spending."

 12:30 P.M. | Estate Tax Among Those to Rise if No Deal Is Reached 
Like so many other provisions of the tax code, estate taxes are caught up in the tangle of competing proposals in the rush to a year-end resolution of the nation's fiscal problems.
Absent an agreement before the end of the year, inheritance taxes are set to jump significantly in 2013, potentially drawing in tens of thousands of estates which otherwise would escape taxation.
Starting on Jan. 1, estates would be allowed to pass on only $1 million free of taxation, and the top effective tax rate on inheritance would rise to as much as 60 percent. This year, in contrast, the exemption from taxation is a bit more than $5 million per decedent and the top rate on taxable estates is just 35 percent.
Such a big tax hike may be unlikely, as most Republicans and many Democrats staunchly oppose taxation of family wealth as it passes between generations, and would likely seek at the very least to temporarily extend the current, relatively generous provisions pending a broader review of tax policies.
If there is a compromise, it's impossible to know its terms yet.
President Obama has suggested taking the estate tax back to where it was in 2009. That represents a middle ground, exempting inheritances up to $3.5 million ($7 million from a couple) and taxing the remainder at up to 45 percent.
The Senate in July passed legislation that would extend Bush-era tax cuts for incomes under $250,000, and Democrats, as well as some Republicans, are pressing the House to simply take up that bill, pass it, and send it to President Obama. But the Senate bill is silent on the estate tax. 
In July, some Democratic senators facing tough re-election fights, like Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, would not go along with the president's proposal. Liberal Democrats could not abide by the current rate of 35 percent on estate values above $5 million.
So even if the House passes the Senate tax bill, the estate tax issue will remain unresolved.
On Tuesday, a group of wealthy individuals, liberal policy experts, and advocates of a progressive tax system called for something considerably stiffer than the Obama plan, but not as tough as what is currently scheduled to happen on after the first of the year.
The group, sponsored by the Responsible Wealth Project, proposed that the exemption be set at $4 million per couple ($2 million per decedent), with steadily escalating taxes starting at 45 percent, raising even more money from the extraordinarily wealthy.
Speaking for the group, Robert E. Rubin, former Treasury Secretary and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, said it was meant not only to provide revenues for federal programs, including spending that could stimulate the economy, but also to address societal inequalities.
"I think it is a reasonable compromise between where we are now and going all the way back to 2001 levels," said another proponent of this plan, John C. Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group and was its chief executive.
Taxes on estates have varied widely for more than a decade.
In 2001, Congress voted to phase out the estate tax and repeal it entirely in 2010. Ultimately, the tax was reinstated in the 2010 tax act, with an exemption starting at $5 million that could be doubled by a couple to pass on $10 million without taxation. The top rate was set at 35 percent.
But that was a temporary fix, and its time is about to run out, exposing thousands to the prospect of higher taxes.
This year just 3,600 estates are expected to face any taxation at all, affecting just one in 500 people who died in 2012, according to the Tax Policy Center.
But if the tax reverts on schedule, more than 50,000 estates, the wealth of about one in 50 people who may die each year, could be taxed.
President Obama's plan, by comparison, would end up taxing about 7,500 estates.
Under differing formulas, the amount of estate taxes collected over the next decade could swing by tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of dollars.
Whether the biggest benefits of estate tax relief go to the very wealthiest or to relatively modest estates depends on whether any new formula focuses on expanding exemptions or lowering tax rates. 
Higher exemptions focus the benefits on people inheriting relatively smaller estates, many of whom would owe no tax at all, while saving relatively little for people with the largest estates, which would pay tax on most of their wealth.
Cuts in the top marginal tax rates, in contrast, would save relatively little money for smaller estates, but could save the wealthiest heirs many millions of dollars.
So the fight, like the rest of the argument over a fiscal solution, is on two battlegrounds - how much revenue does the federal government need to collect, and from whom is it right to collect it?

 11:39 A.M. | As Lawmakers Look for Savings, Coburn Highlights Waste 
Some Americans wait each year for the new Farmer's Almanac, others for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. On Capitol Hill, great joy is spread through Senator Tom Coburn's annual "waste book" which details various ways in which the Republican senator from Oklahoma finds government something other than efficient.
Among his favorite targets is a company that makes organic hair products for dogs, cats, and horses - "Boost! Volumizing Spray" - that received funds to bolster sales and junk food groups that benefit from the food-stamp program. This year, he highlights a program out of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that has developed a recipe for pizza that could be served some day on Mars.
For those who think a lot about government spending, the book is a bible of fun. 
Mr. Coburn tends to dribble out details from the book on the Senate floor and in news conferences, delighting the world with his discoveries. His findings are especially relevant this year, as Congress prepares to avoid the so-called "fiscal cliff" and members scramble for ways to save money. 
This was underscored Tuesday morning when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, cited the latest report on the Senate floor. Mr. Coburn, he said, "issued a study that showed taxpayers are funding Moroccan pottery classes, promoting shampoo and other beauty products for cats and dogs, and a video game that allows them to relive prom night," Mr. McConnell snorted. "Get this: taxpayers also just spent $325,000 on a Robotic squirrel name RoboSquirrel."
Come again with the squirrel? 
According to the report, researchers at San Diego State University and the University of California Davis spent some of a $325,000 federal science grant to program a taxidermied squirrel named "RoboSquirrel" to help further the understanding of snake and squirrel interactions, especially those leading to squirrel fatality. 
Mr. Coburn does not denounce the utility of wildlife study per se, but notes: "During these difficult fiscal times of massive deficits, paying $325,000 for a robot squirrel seems a bit squirrelly."

 11:11 A.M. | Democrats Escalate Fiscal Fight With Automated Calls 
President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner may have ratcheted down the rhetoric while they try to hammer out a tax-and-spending deal ahead of the new year.
But Democrats in the House may not have gotten the message.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is continuing to barrage the districts of 35 Republican House members with automated phone calls accusing the members of wanting "reckless, budget-busting tax cuts for millionaires."
The phone calls refer listeners in the districts to a Web site, GOPHostageTakers.com. The Web site urges visitors to sign a petition on behalf of a tax increase for the wealthy.
"The Senate already passed a tax cut for the middle class, but Boehner and House Republicans won't even allow the full House to vote on the bill," the site says. "They're willing to go over the fiscal cliff just to protect reckless tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires."
The automated calls are part of a full-court press by Democrats that started with the president several weeks ago. But the president's personal involvement in the campaign-style effort has become more muted as closed-door negotiations with the speaker have begun.
In a statement, Representative Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic committee, showed little interest in letting up the pressure.
"Tea Party House Republicans were elected pledging to protect America's middle class, not on a pledge to Grover Norquist, and its time they started acting like it," Mr. Israel said. Mr. Norquist leads Americans for Tax Reform.
(Update: Mr. Boehner may not have gotten the "be nice" message, either. In remarks Tuesday, he accused the White House of slow-walking the negotiations and of refusing to offer specific cuts the president would be willing to accept.)

 8:18 P.M. | Federal Agencies Brace for Possible Cuts 
While the Obama administration and Congressional leaders are trying to negotiate a deal to head off billions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts on Jan. 1, federal agencies are quietly preparing for tighter budgets.
Faced with across-the-board spending cuts of roughly 8 percent, top officials are drawing up plans to lay off workers, shift money to critical duties like airport screening, delay new contracts and postpone payments to states for some education financing.
Some 1,200 programs, including airport security, food inspections and drug approvals, could be affected by the automatic cuts. They must be squeezed into the last nine months of the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
The administration has repeatedly said it wants a deal to avoid indiscriminate cuts. But last week, as a precaution, it ordered agencies to lock in a plan for sharply reduced spending in case a deal does not come to pass.
Most federal agencies declined to describe their plans. But interviews with former government officials, a review of budget reports and Congressional testimony provide an outline of the severity the automatic cuts might have on regulatory agencies that protect the nation's borders, air travelers and food and drug safety.
A report by Representative Norm Dicks of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, found that the cuts could force the Department of Homeland Security to begin eliminating about 24,500 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force.
The United States Border Patrol could lose 3,400 agents over the rest of the fiscal year, or about 16 percent of its force. Over all, the patrol faces roughly $955 million in cuts from projected spending levels.
An additional 3,400 jobs for customs officers, or about 16 percent, might be eliminated, "significantly increasing wait times" at ports of entry, the report found.
The Transportation Security Administration could have to cut 7,240 security officers, the report found, affecting airport security and lengthening screening lines. The agency would lose more than $640 million from its anticipated spending.
During a news conference last month, the T.S.A. administrator, John Pistole, said the agency was considering redirecting money from some less crucial functions to ensure that security at airports was not compromised.
The plans would call for keeping as many screeners as possible to operate machines scanning passengers and luggage. But the cuts could force the agency to lose an unspecified number of plainclothes air marshals, who provide security aboard aircraft by blending in with passengers.
"We have made a number of plans in the event that sequestration does go into effect," Mr. Pistole said, using the technical term for the forced cuts. "The bottom line is for the entire Department of Homeland Security, and T.S.A. obviously included, is to make sure that the frontline operations are not affected by that."
Marion Blakey, a former administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the cuts could cripple air travel. The agency is facing $1 billion in anticipated reductions.
"The F.A.A. is going to keep its focus on safety," said Ms. Blakey, who is now the president and chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association, an aircraft manufacturers group. According to an association study, the agency could face "the prospect of having to furlough or cut 1,200 air traffic controllers," she said, or about one in 10. And the airlines "would have to cut back on the number of scheduled flights to deal with the reduction in staffing," she said. The F.A.A. would not comment.
White House documents show that the agencies that protect America's food and drugs would also take a significant hit under the proposed cuts. These would come on the heels of one of the deadliest food-borne outbreaks in the last 100 years - listeria bacteria on cantaloupes, which killed 33 people and sickened almost 150 late last year.
The budget for the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be reduced by about $86 million. The service inspects food at domestic and foreign meat and poultry processing plants.
A White House report in September said that under the cuts, the Agriculture Department's ability to "inspect food processing plants and prevent food-borne illnesses would be curtailed."
The Food and Drug Administration would have to cut $318 million from its budget, according to a White House report. The agency is currently trying to write new regulations for a food safety law.
Officials there said they might cut back on inspections and delay work on implementing the new law if the cuts take effect.
During a September symposium, Michael Taylor, the agency's deputy commissioner for foods, described the food safety budget as "thin" compared with its mission, and said across-the-board cuts would be a huge blow to its safety program.
"So anything that forces us to go backward, you can just imagine the effect that it would have," he said.

 6:16 P.M. | How a Fiscal Impasse, in 1990, Was Broken 
Back when leaders led, followers followed and the news media made less noise, the commanding figures of American government retreated to Andrews Air Force Base to forge a bipartisan budget compromise.
That 11-day summit meeting failed - despite the threat of deep automatic spending cuts, and despite the top Republican's acknowledgment that taxes had to go up.
A smaller group of negotiators later struck a deal inside the Capitol. That failed, too - defeated on the House floor by a coalition of liberal and conservative rebels.
History now recalls those events in the fall of 1990, and the agreement Congress eventually enacted, as the opening chapter of Washington's long, successful climb out of the deficit hole of the 1980s. And they offer a perspective on the current stalemate between a White House and a Congress struggling to repeat that achievement.
"There is a flow to these things," said William Hoagland, who was a top Senate Republican aide during the earlier negotiations. The bigger the deal, the greater the turbulence.
"There always seems to be little cooperation for a long time," said Robert Reischauer, a Democrat who led the Congressional Budget Office then. "And then things come together relatively rapidly."
That does not mean President Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner and other main players will succeed in achieving a consensus to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Neither Mr. Hoagland nor Mr. Reischauer voice much optimism.
But the 1990 experience provides a reminder that high-stakes budget negotiations can sometimes include high-velocity shifts from despair to deliverance. The prospect of an across-the-board increase in tax rates and automatic spending cuts, which could tip the economy back into recession, and a potential showdown over the debt limit next year provide powerful incentives for a breakthrough.
Similar forces helped propel the deal in 1990. The talks began in spring as annual budget deficits, which had topped $200 billion before declining during the latter part of Ronald Reagan's presidency, rose over that mark again under President George Bush.
A group of foreign central bankers visiting Washington warned Mr. Bush that he needed to strike a deal with the Democrats who controlled both houses of Congress. Without one, an earlier budget-reduction law was about to trigger automatic cuts even deeper than the so-called sequester looming now.
But the Republican president, long before Grover Norquist became famous, was hamstrung by his own unequivocal no-new-taxes pledge. Once Mr. Bush abandoned it - embracing higher revenues, though not higher rates, just as Mr. Boehner has - negotiations quickened.
Yet at the time the pace felt glacial. After talks in a Senate office building failed, participants moved to Andrews to escape the media spotlight.
Eventually, a smaller group of just eight negotiators, meeting in Speaker Thomas S. Foley's office, produced a $500 billion deficit reduction package that included $134 billion in taxes and substantial cuts in Medicare. Then Republican conservatives, led by Representative Newt Gingrich, joined liberal Democrats in blowing it up.
After a six-month slog, the White House, offering fewer spending cuts and more tax increases, won over enough Democrats to enact it. "The final agreement was reached largely out of exhaustion and convenience," former Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said at a recent panel discussion.
By some measures, this White House and Congress ought to be able to move faster. Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner began their postelection discussions having gone through all the labor of their near-miss "grand bargain" talks last year.
The president's chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, has experience in fiscal negotiations, including the 1983 deal between Speaker Tip O'Neill and President Reagan on Social Security and the 1997 budget-balancing agreement between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
But those eras were different. The two major parties were more ideologically disparate and less polarized. That extended from legislative leaders through the ranks of their staffs, which could quietly explore potential solutions with higher levels of trust and discretion.
"It allowed you to test things without risk" that premature publicity would quash them, said Sheila Burke, then the chief of staff for the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole.
As unwelcome as news coverage could be, it was a whisper compared with the nonstop 21st-century din on television and online. The talks took place as Mr. Bush prepared for war with Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait, substantially diverting public attention, whereas today the fiscal talks dominate the news.
The result: talks today combine louder public posturing with less-productive staff work behind the scenes.
"We're facing a much tougher and more difficult challenge than we had in 1990," Mr. Foley said at the panel discussion.
The Republican Party's anti-tax wing is stronger now. No one has forgotten that President Bush lost his 1992 re-election bid after breaking his no-tax pledge.
Even two values that all parties should be able to agree on - transparency and accountability - represent new obstacles.
Staff members and interest groups alike have ready access to sophisticated analyses of tax and spending changes, which they can use to instantly mobilize opposition.
And memories of this fall's campaign are still fresh. Though independent observers say a deal requires both Medicare cuts and higher taxes, Mr. Obama and Democrats ran as Medicare's protectors, Republicans as unflinching foes of tax increases.
"The more details you have, the harder it is to reach agreement," Mr. Reischauer said. And "we've just been through an election in which the members promised not to do what they have to do."

 9:04 P.M. | Obama Trusted on Economy 
When it comes to dealing with the country's economic problems, Americans give President Obama the upper hand, according to a national poll released Friday. Nearly half, 48 percent, said they trust Mr. Obama more to develop solutions to the nation's economic problems, compared with the 32 percent who trust Congressional Republicans more.
As for what would be effective in reducing the nation's deficit, about three in four Americans said raising taxes on family incomes over $250,000 would be. Nearly as many said reducing taxes and regulations to spur economic growth would be effective. Fewer, but still a majority of respondents, said increasing taxes on all Americans, reducing military spending and reducing programs that benefit the poor, like welfare and Medicaid, would be effective in getting the country's finances under control.
Just a third of Americans, however, say reducing spending on Social Security and Medicare would be effective.
The survey, the Heartland Monitor Poll, was conducted for Allstate and The National Journal.
Asked what they thought would most help the country improve over the next couple of years, 43 percent said "growing the economy and creating jobs through investments in education, training, infrastructure, and research, even if it means continued deficits and tax increases."
Fewer, 29 percent, said "growing the economy and creating jobs through tax cuts for businesses and individuals, even if it means continued deficits and cuts to public services." Fewer still, 22 percent, said "reducing the federal deficit, even if it means both tax increases and cuts to public services."
The national poll was conducted Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 by landline phones and cellphones among 1,000 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

 3:58 P.M. | Pentagon Begins Planning for Budget Cuts 
After months of refusing to plan for how the Pentagon budget could or should be trimmed further, senior Defense Department officials have begun examining in earnest how the military would respond to automatic spending reductions if a budget deal eludes President Obama and Congress past the end of the year.
Officially, senior Pentagon officials say their budget planning efforts, which began earlier this week, were set off by an order from the Office of Management and Budget.
But as the number of days in which to reach a deal dwindles, it seems clear that the government bureaucracy has surrendered to the practical impulse for prudent planning.
"Initial planning has begun on the 'fiscal cliff,' " George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, said Friday, using the Washington term of choice for the automatic, across-the-board cuts that would be ordered if there is no deal on taxes and spending.
The Pentagon could face reductions of $500 billion over the next 10 years, representing roughly 5 to 8 percent of its budget.
Even if there is a deal to avoid the automatic cuts, it is anticipated that the compromise package would impose additional budget cuts on the Pentagon. The Defense Department's reluctance to begin planning sooner seemed to reflect a fear that the effort to identify potential reductions would be tantamount to an invitation for Congress to cut military spending even more.
In public comments earlier this week, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta opened another front in the public relations campaign to avoid the automatic cuts, called sequestration, by warning of the severe impact on the military and on veterans.
"These cuts are across the board under this meat-ax approach that was developed in the sequestration formula," Mr. Panetta said. "And it is going to have a serious impact in terms of those coming home, the programs that serve them, the support system that we have - not only for them, but for their families."
Any number of Pentagon programs could be vulnerable to cuts, from personnel to training to procurement. But officials note that even if no deal is reached, and automatic cuts are initiated, the Defense Department and military would have weeks or even months to work out the details.

Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio did not rule out a rise in the top income tax rate below the level President Obama wants, indicating that he has more room to compromise on taxes if the White House comes forward with flexibility in other aspects of deficit negotiations.
"There are a lot of things that are possible to come from revenue, if the president seizes the opportunity," Mr. Boehner said when asked about a top tax rate increase short of the 39.6 percent level of the Clinton-era tax code. "But none of it is going to be possible if the president insists on 'my way or the highway.'"
Both parties seized on the November jobs report, which showed unexpectedly good numbers, to say the other side needs to show more flexibility ahead of a looming fiscal crisis. Next month, hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts are scheduled to kick in.
But Mr. Boehner put the onus on Mr. Obama to make the next move.
"This isn't a progress report because there's no progress to report," he told reporters Friday outside his suite of offices in the Capitol. "The White House has wasted another week."
Talks are continuing between Obama administration staff and Mr. Boehner's aides, but little progress is in evidence. A phone call between the president and speaker on Wednesday "was pleasant," Mr. Boehner said, "but it was more of the same."
On Thursday, the president's top liaison with Congress, Rob Nabors, again delivered the message that tax rates on the rich had to go up before a deal could be worked out.
"More of the same," as Mr. Boehner puts it, is Mr. Obama's steadfast insistence that tax rates go up on incomes over $250,000 in January as part of a down payment on deficit reduction that would lead to broader negotiations next year on overhauls of the tax code and entitlements such as Medicare.
The Labor Department on Friday said that the United States economy added 146,000 jobs last month, and that the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in October. Those numbers were unexpectedly bright given the impact of Hurricane Sandy and business fears about the "fiscal cliff."
Mr. Boehner continues to say his opposition to allowing the top two rates to rise to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, from 33 percent and 35 percent, stems from fears of the impact on small businesses that pay ordinary income tax rates, not the corporate tax rate. About 97 percent of small businesses do not turn enough of a profit to be affected, but Republicans note that more than half of small-business income - from the most profitable small businesses, partnerships and limited liability corporations - would be hit by the increases.
"The risk the president wants us to take with increases of tax rates will hit many small businesses that create 50 to 70 percent of the jobs in our country. That's the whole issue," he said.
Still, the speaker was given the chance to flatly reject any tax rate increase and he declined. A senior Republican leadership aide did say on Friday that the president's proposal to permanently diminish Congress's control over the government's statutory borrowing limit was "not going to fly" in the House.

 9:25 A.M. | Jobs Report Unlikely to Change Debt Negotiations 
The better-than-expected November jobs report released Friday seems unlikely to change the dynamics of the behind-the-scenes fiscal negotiations between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.
The report shows the unemployment rate falling to 7.7 percent, the lowest level since 2008, and employment rising by nearly 150,000 jobs. The figures indicate that the economy is improving, though sluggishly, with the phrases "unchanged" and "changed little" cropping up often.
The continued drop in the unemployment rate might undercut the White House's argument that the economy needs more stimulus in the immediate term - an argument that Republicans did not seem persuaded by in the first place. Indeed, Republican aides have brushed aside the Obama administration's request for more government spending on policies including mass mortgage refinancing and a payroll tax holiday, without outright rejecting the measures, by saying that negotiations need to focus on cutting the deficit. Then again, according to the survey of households within the report, the number of people counting themselves as employed dropped and the number of people not in the labor force soared in November.
The Labor Department also revised down the jobs figures for September and October.

 7:26 A.M. | Poll Shows Voters Want Compromise in Washington 
A new national poll released Friday finds voters on both sides of the political aisle calling for compromise in Washington.
About 6 in 10 Obama voters in the poll, or 59 percent, said President Obama should compromise with Republicans to get things done, even if it means accepting some policies that they don't necessarily agree with. Most Romney voters, 54 percent, said Congressional Republicans should compromise with President Obama and Congressional Democrats. The survey, the Heartland Monitor Poll conducted for Allstate and the National Journal, found that about a third of Obama voters and 4 in 10 Romney voters want their side to hold firm, even if that causes a stalemate and very little gets accomplished.
When it comes to dealing with the country's economic problems, Americans give Mr. Obama the upper hand, the poll finds. Nearly half, 48 percent, say they trust President Obama more to develop solutions to the nation's economic problems, compared with the 32 percent that trust Congressional Republicans more. 
As for what would be effective in reducing the nation's deficit, about three in four Americans say raising taxes on family incomes over $250,000 would be. Nearly as many say reducing taxes and regulations to spur economic growth would be effective. Fewer, but still a majority of respondents, say increasing taxes on all Americans, reducing military spending and reducing programs that benefit the poor, like welfare and Medicaid, would be effective in getting the country's finances under control.
Just a third of Americans, however, say reducing spending on Social Security and Medicare would be effective. 
Asked what they think would most help the country improve over the next couple of years, 43 percent say "growing the economy and creating jobs through investments in education, training, infrastructure, and research, even if it means continued deficits and tax increases." Fewer, 29 percent, say "growing the economy and creating jobs through tax cuts for businesses and individuals, even if it means continued deficits and cuts to public services." Fewer still, 22 percent, say "reducing the federal deficit, even if it means both tax increases and cuts to public services." 
The national poll was conducted Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 by landline phones and cellphones among 1,000 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

 4:25 P.M. | White House Says It Cannot Raise Debt Ceiling 
The White House flatly declared Thursday that President Obama could not unilaterally raise the nation's debt ceiling without Congress, rejecting liberal entreaties to bypass Republicans who may try to use the statutory borrowing limit as leverage in fiscal negotiations.
Some Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, have theorized that the president has the authority to raise the debt ceiling on his own, citing a clause in the 14th Amendment guaranteeing that the nation's debts "shall not be questioned." They have called on Mr. Obama to assert this power to deprive Republicans of a weapon in the current showdown over taxes and spending.
But Mr. Obama effectively renounced such an assertion of authority on Thursday through his spokesman. "I can say that this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling," Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters, reading from language that had been prepared for him.
Administration officials had long discounted the possibility that the president would claim such power but Thursday's statement seemed more definitive than in the past. When asked about it last year, Mr. Obama said: "I have talked to my lawyers. They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument." While dismissing the idea, his language at the time did not seem to categorically rule it out the way the new statement seemed to do.
The White House statement came as Senate Republicans and Democrats squared off on a different measure proposed by Mr. Obama meant to make it harder for Congress to stop the debt ceiling from rising. When Republicans tried to put it to a vote in hopes of embarrassing Democrats, the Democrats called their bluff and said they would allow the vote if the minority would let it pass on a simple majority and not filibuster it.
Under longstanding practice, Congress sets a cap on federal borrowing and from time to time has had to raise it to accommodate deficit spending previously approved by lawmakers and the president. While that has often been a politically painful vote for lawmakers, it became a tool in the hands of Republicans last year when they refused to pass such an increase without significant spending cuts.
With the approach of another year-end fiscal crisis, some Republicans have talked about conceding to Mr. Obama's demand to raise taxes on the wealthy in the short term but then coming back to the table once the current debt limit is reached when they can use it to force the president to accept their priorities. Mr. Obama sternly warned Republicans on Wednesday not to try that, saying he would "not play that game," leading some to think he might assert his own authority to raise the debt limit.
Some liberals have argued that the president does not need Congressional approval to raise the debt limit because of Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, which states: "The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payments of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned."
The provision was passed in the wake of the Civil War to ensure the payment of Union debts, but it has been imbued with meaning beyond its historical context. In 1935, Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes wrote that "its language indicates a broader connotation."
Mr. Clinton said publicly last year that he would invoke that provision "without hesitation" and "force the courts to stop me." Other Democrats have picked up the call this year, including Representative Peter Welch of Vermont, who said Mr. Obama should be willing to lift the debt ceiling by executive action.
If nothing else, some Democrats figured that the simple threat could help neutralize the Republican advantage once negotiators are backed against the debt limit again. On the other hand, by renouncing such authority on Thursday, Mr. Obama may be trying to avoid taking responsibility for such action on his own and perhaps making it easier for Republicans to refuse to raise the limit.
In his recent deficit reduction proposal to Congress, Mr. Obama included a different possible mechanism to avoid repeated clashes over borrowing. Under his proposal, a president could raise the limit unless Congress voted to disallow it; if Congress passed such a motion rejecting an increase, the president could veto it, meaning it would require a two-thirds vote to override and prevent the limit from going up.
Democrats are calling that the McConnell provision after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, who proposed the idea as a one-time way out of the clash that consumed Washington in the summer of 2011. The White House is hoping to win the support of business leaders to make such an approach permanent.
Another option is to pass a debt ceiling increase that would be large enough to accommodate borrowing for the next five years, as suggested by John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan and now president of the Business Roundtable.
"John is exactly right when he says the only thing that the debt ceiling is good for as a weapon is just to destroy your credit rating," Mr. Obama said in a speech to the Business Roundtable on Wednesday.
The White House noted that raising the debt ceiling was simply a way of authorizing payment on spending that had already been approved by Congress. "When you get a credit card bill, you don't just say, well, you know what? I'm sick of this, I'm not paying it anymore," Mr. Carney said. "I mean, you can do that, but there will be significant consequences for your personal financial future. Well, when the United States of America, when it gets its bills for items it has purchased, pays those bills."
But Republicans see the debt ceiling as the most useful way of imposing fiscal discipline on the president. "Why on earth would we even consider giving a president who's brought us four years of trillion-dollar deficits unchecked authority to borrow?" Mr. McConnell asked in a floor speech. "He's the last person who should have limitless borrowing power.
"Look, the only way we ever cut spending around here is by using the debate over the debt limit to do it," he added. "Now the president wants to remove that spur to cut altogether. It gets in the way of his spending plans. I assure you, it's not going to happen. The American people want Washington to get spending under control. And the debt limit is the best tool we have to make the president take that demand seriously."

 4:33 P.M. | The Return of the 'Tax Families' 
As a presidential candidate in 2000, George W. Bush regularly showcased what his team called "tax families" to present a human face for those who would benefit from his tax-cutting plans.
President Obama has adopted the idea of keeping those tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and now he has adopted the same technique. On Thursday, he visited a typical family that would benefit from renewing the tax cuts for the middle class.
"They've got dreams and ambitions," Mr. Obama said at the apartment of Tiffany and Richard Santana, who live with her parents, Velma and Jimmie Massenburg, in Falls Church, Va., outside Washington. "They've got a beautiful 6-year-old son, Noah, who's back with great-grandma. And they're keeping it together, they're working hard, they're meeting their responsibilities."
Now as then, of course, the fiercest debate is over tax cuts for the wealthy, not the middle class. But if the two sides cannot agree, then all of the tax cuts will expire, including those currently enjoyed by the Santanas and Massenburgs. Mr. Obama is trying to ensure that Republicans are blamed for that, not him.

 3:49 P.M. | Obama's Tax Plan Would Spare Many Affluent Families 
President Obama's insistence that marginal tax rates rise for families making more than $250,000 has convinced millions of affluent Americans that they are likely to be writing larger checks to the government next year.
But many of those families have no reason to fret.
A close look at the president's plan shows that a large majority of families making up to $300,000 - as well as hundreds of thousands of families with even larger incomes - would not pay taxes at a higher marginal rate.

 1:42 P.M. | Reid Calls a Bluff, And McConnell Objects 
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, appeared to get caught in his own trap on Thursday as lawmakers continued their work to avert the pending fiscal crisis.
President Obama, hoping to find a resolution and at the same time avoid another debilitating fight over the nation's statutory borrowing limit, has proposed a deficit-reduction plan that includes a measure that would permanently weaken Congress's control over the debt ceiling.
The plan, first dreamed up last year by Mr. McConnell, would allow the president to raise the borrowing limit on his own. Congress would be able to disallow the debt-ceiling increase, but would need a two-thirds majority to do so, since the president could veto the legislation blocking the rise.
Mr. McConnell, believing that some Democrats would vote against the president's proposal, moved Thursday to put it on the Senate floor for a quick vote. If it could not muster a majority, Republicans were ready to say that Mr. Obama could not even unify his own party.
But Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, called Mr. McConnell's bluff. He said he would put the debt-ceiling proposal to a vote if Mr. McConnell would let it pass with a simple majority, rather than a filibuster-proof 60 votes. Seeing he had overplayed his hand, Mr. McConnell objected.
"What we're talking about here is a perpetual debt-ceiling grant," Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor, concluding that matters of that magnitude needed 60 votes to pass.
"What we have is here a case of Republicans not taking yes for an answer," Mr. Reid replied as Mr. McConnell began a filibuster of his own bill.

 3:12 P.M. | White House Warns Agencies of Impending Cuts 
 The White House sent a notice to federal agencies this week telling them to prepare for the possibility of deep automatic spending cuts at the end of the year, but President Obama's spokesman said he remained confident he can reach a deal with Congress to avoid that.
 With just three weeks until the so-called sequester cuts are due to take effect, the White House presented its notice as simply prudent planning, not an act of pessimism or an attempt to raise the pressure on lawmakers. Under a law passed last year, about $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years are supposed to begin in January unless the president and Congress agree on a plan to avoid them.
 Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the notice sent out by the Office of Management and Budget should not be read "as a change in the administration's commitment to reach an agreement and avoid sequestration. O.M.B. is simply ensuring that the administration is prepared should it become necessary to issue such an order." 
 "O.M.B. will continue to consult with agencies and will provide additional guidance as needed," he added. "This is just acting responsibly because of the potential for this happening."
 The Budget Control Act of 2011 set out the automatic spending cuts not with the expectation that they would take effect but on the theory that they would be so painful that both parties in Washington would be motivated to find a bipartisan alternative. So far, that has not happened.
 If the sequester cuts take effect on Jan. 2, the first year would require $100 billion in military and domestic spending to be curtailed. Under the terms of the law, most military programs would be cut by 9.4 percent and most domestic programs by 8.2 percent. Medicare would be reduced by 2 percent and other social programs by as much as 10 percent, but Social Security would be excluded.
 According to a report issued by the White House in September, that would mean, as examples, that Army operations and maintenance would be cut by $7 billion and the Navy by more than $4 billion. Medicare payments to hospitals would be pared by $5.6 billion and diplomatic programs and embassy security would be cut by $1.2 billion.

 1:08 P.M. | Cantor Says House Will Not Adjourn Until Deal Reached 
The House is done with its business for the week, but apparently members should not get used to Wednesday slides. 
 Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, announced Wednesday that although the House was originally set to adjourn on Dec. 14, the House will be in session until Congress has resolved the fiscal standoff. 
This type of threat is common - leaders in both chambers often say they will keep members in town longer during the holidays - but rarely materializes. However, staff members in the House and Senate are preparing to work right up to Christmas to hammer out a deal. 
 "Members are further reminded that the House will not adjourn the 112th Congress until a credible solution to the fiscal cliff has been found," Mr. Cantor advised members in a memo from his office. At the same time, Mr. Cantor noted that the House will now adjourn next Thursday rather than staying through Friday. 
 Republican leaders said that members are going back to their districts to talk with constituents about the doings in Washington. Speaker John A. Boehner, Mr. Cantor and others say they are waiting on President Obama to respond to their proposal on how to resolve the fiscal crisis.
"House Republicans have already adjourned this week, went home and failed to pass the middle-income tax cuts," Nadeam Elshami, a spokesman for Representative Nancy Pelosi, said Wednesday. "Let's hope after talking to their constituents, they allow a vote and get to work with President Obama and Democrats on a fair and balanced agreement."

Admit it: Now you want to click on this link to a video, posted on YouTube on Wednesday, showing a long and lanky Alan K. Simpson creakily doing the internationally famous dance moves, lassoing and horse riding to urge young Americans to press Congress and the White House to compromise to reduce the long-term debt.
Mr. Simpson, co-chairman with Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, of the eponymous debt-reduction commission that President Obama formed in 2010, recorded the bit for The Can Kicks Back, a relatively new, nonpartisan anti-deficit group. The group's name is a play on the line "We can't keep kicking the can down the road" that older Washington insiders of both parties utter ad nauseam to express the need to act immediately to control projected deficits, often right before they kick the can down the road again.

 12:24 P.M. | Republicans Look to Use Debt Ceiling as Leverage 
There's a new idea out there to break the fiscal impasse in Washington: Congressional Republicans would agree to extend the Bush tax cuts for up to $250,000 in income, and then Congress would return to fight it out on the high-end tax cuts and numerous other fiscal issues in the New Year. 
In that case, Congress' drop-dead deadline would not be tied to the year-end tax increases and spending cuts. The deadline would be determined by the debt ceiling, a statutory borrowing limit that the United States will hit toward the end of the year and Congress needs to lift by sometime in late February or early March.
The idea is that by capitulating on the White House's demand for taxes to go up on about 2 percent of households, Republicans would take away the Democrats' current source of leverage, in the year-end expiration of all the Bush tax cuts. And they would gain the debt ceiling as a new lever of their own, and could threaten not to raise the ceiling unless they won some concessions from the other side. 
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner - who had the task of trying to calm financial markets as the United States blew past the debt ceiling and came close to defaulting on its obligations last year - does not like this idea one bit. 
Indeed, the Obama administration is pushing to take away most of Congress's authority over the debt ceiling. Mr. Geithner explained the proposal on "Meet the Press" on NBC on Sunday: 
"The president would have the obligation periodically of requesting an increase in the debt limit, and then Congress would have the chance, then, to express its views on the merits of that proposal by disapproving that. And then the president would have to decide, if a bill came to his desk, about whether to veto that or sign it. 
"Of course, he'd veto it in that context. And the virtue of that mechanism proposed by Senator McConnell, a man of impeccable conservative credentials," he said, referring to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, "is to make sure that the country is not left at risk of periodic threats of default. It's a very good idea. It was a Republican idea. And we're suggesting they extend it."
Republicans have flatly rejected the notion that they will cede any authority over the ceiling. But the White House has continued to push the plan. Indeed, the Treasury Department released an infographic on Wednesday underscoring that the proposal originally came from the other side of the aisle and showing how the new system would work. 
In remarks to executives convened by the Business Roundtable in Washington, President Obama warned that using the debt ceiling as leverage is a "bad strategy" for businesses and for America. "If Congress in any way suggests they're going to tie negotiations over debt ceiling votes and take us to brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation," he added, "I will not play that game."

 11:19 A.M. | House Republicans Call for Negotiations to Begin 
House Republican leaders on Wednesday implored President Obama to sit down with them and begin negotiating in earnest to head off a fiscal crisis, but with flattery and displaying aggravation, they made it clear they are now playing on his turf.
House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and his leadership team did not give an inch on their opposition to raising tax rates on the rich or their insistence that any deficit-reduction plan emphasize spending cuts. But the speaker sounded exasperated as he insisted he had moved toward the president's position by agreeing to $800 billion in higher tax revenue over 10 years.
"The revenues we're putting on the table will come from guess who? The rich," he told reporters, his voice rising. "There are ways to limit deductions, close loopholes and have the same people pay more of their money to the federal government without raising tax rates."
Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, a member of Republican leadership, appealed to Mr. Obama's own view of himself as a politician able to rise above partisanship, a characterization Republicans have rarely if ever agreed with.
"I've seen an attribute in President Obama when we served together in the Illinois State Senate, where he was able to rise above donkeys and elephants and transform some very controversial issues in a way that was powerful," Mr. Roskam said, imploring the president to eschew the politics of the victor and seize "an unbelievable opportunity to be a transformational president, that is to bring the country together."
On the substance of negotiations to avoid hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts next year, the parties remain far apart. The negotiations at the moment appear to come through dueling television interviews and news conferences, where one side blasts the other's latest offer and demands another proposal closer to its position.
In an interview Tuesday, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a retiring Republican, said only arduous, face-to-face negotiations over several days and behind closed doors, will resolve the impasse. Mr. Boehner called for just such meetings.
"I'll be here, and I'll be available at any moment to sit down with the president," he said.

 10:45 A.M. | Coburn Would Accept Compromise With Higher Tax Rates 
 11:19 a.m. | Updated Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a prominent Republican fiscal hawk, suggested on Wednesday that he would accept a budget compromise that raised tax rates, followed by overhauling the tax code next year.
"Personally, I know we have to raise revenue," Mr. Coburn said. "I don't really care which way we do it."
"Actually, I would rather see the rates go up than do it the other way, because it gives us greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future," he said.
Mr. Coburn, who was interviewed on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" show, said that raising taxes would be a drag on the economy no matter how the revenues are obtained. 
"I think they're arguing over semantics," he said of the budget negotiators, who remain at loggerheads on tax revenues. "$800 billion is $800 billion," he said, noting that he did not think Republicans would agree to larger increases than that, given the opposition from conservatives in their ranks.
He said he would prefer to raise taxes in ways that would not restrain investment in the economy.
President Obama has said he would like to raise $1.6 trillion in new revenues, mostly by raising tax rates on upper incomes; House Speaker John Boehner has offered an approach that would raise around $800 billion by limiting tax breaks, without raising anybody's rates. Absent a resolution of the dispute, tax rates are scheduled to rise across the board at the start of next year
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, was quick to seize on Mr. Coburn's remarks.
"Senator Coburn is an unquestioned conservative," he said. "If he doesn't provide cover for the Republicans to finally shift on tax rates, I don't know who does."
Mr. Coburn, long a proponent of cutting wasteful spending, also said some conservatives were turning a blind eye to the possibility of savings in military spending.
"There is so much waste in the Defense Department, it is unbelievable," he said, suggesting that another $40 billion or $50 billion could be saved there.

 3:59 P.M. | Polls Show Public Skeptical of a Deal on the Deficit 
Public opinion about the pending fiscal crisis has not changed in the past three weeks, according to the latest national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post.
As lawmakers in Washington appear far apart in negotiations that would prevent the automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for Jan. 1, many still doubt that an agreement will be reached. 
Forty percent expect that President Obama and Congressional Republicans will reach a settlement by the end of the year and 49 percent do not think they will. If there is no deal, 53 percent will hold the Republicans in Congress responsible; 27 percent said they will blame Mr. Obama. 
These opinions are essentially the same as seen in the poll conducted by Pew and The Post earlier last month. 
Democrats continue to be much more hopeful about an agreement than Republicans or independents. A majority (55 percent) of Democrats expect that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans will compromise in order to avoid the "fiscal cliff" before Jan. 1; only 37 percent of independents and 22 percent of Republicans agree. 
While few Americans say they have a good understanding of what would happen if Mr. Obama and the Republicans do not come to an agreement, the public continues to expect the outcome to have serious consequences - for the nation's economy and for their own financial well-being. 
About two-thirds say the national economy will be greatly affected, and most of them expect the results to be harmful. Fewer, about two-fifths, say their own economic welfare would be impacted by the automatic taxes and cuts, but most of them also anticipate a negative outcome. 
The telephone survey was conducted Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 with 1,003 adults using landlines and cellphones. The margin of sampling error for all adults is plus or minus 4 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

 2:02 P.M. | Obama Rejects G.O.P. Proposal 
President Obama flatly rejected on Tuesday a Republican proposal to avoid an end-of-the-year fiscal crisis through spending cuts and limiting tax deductions, insisting that he would agree to no deal that did not include an increase in marginal tax rates on the wealthy.
"We're going to have to see the rates on the top 2 percent go up," Mr. Obama told Bloomberg Television in his first television interview since his re-election last month, "and we're not going to be able to get a deal without it."
Mr. Obama's unbending demand for higher tax rates on income over $200,000 a year per individual or $250,000 per family was in keeping with what the White House has been saying in recent weeks, but it reflected a marked evolution in the president's own public statements.
Just last month, at a post-election news conference, he signaled openness to raising taxes by closing loopholes and limiting deductions rather than raising rates themselves. "With respect to the tax rates, I just want to emphasize I am open to new ideas," he said then. "If Republican counterparts or some Democrats have a great idea for us to raise revenue, maintain progressivity, make sure the middle class isn't getting hit, reduces our deficit, encourages growth, I'm not going to just slam the door in their face."
Now the door appears shut as Mr. Obama and advisers make the case that there is no politically palatable way to generate the amount of revenue he wants to help reduce the deficit without raising rates. However, in the interview, he did not say he would require that rates have to go all the way back up to where they were before the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush.
If Mr. Obama and Congress do not reach an agreement by the end of the year, tax rates would go up on all taxpayers. Mr. Obama has proposed keeping them the same on middle-class taxpayers and letting them expire for the top two brackets. If that happened, the top bracket would revert to 39.6 percent and the second highest bracket would revert to 36 percent.
Mr. Obama declined to say whether they had to rise all the way to those levels to satisfy him. But he outlined a two-stage process where they could go all the way up to their pre-Bush levels and then the next year could be spent working on a more comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that could eventually allow them to fall somewhat again at the end of 2013. 
"It's possible that we may be able to lower rates by broadening the base at that point," he said. "And I'm happy to work with them. In fact, I do believe that we can simplify the tax system and by closing some loopholes and deductions, and cleaning out some of the underbrush in the tax code that we can have a fairer, more efficient system."
 Mr. Obama's opening proposal in the fiscal negotiations would raise $1.6 trillion from the wealthy, most of it by allowing the rates to rise again. House Speaker John A. Boehner and other Republicans proposed in their opening bid to raise taxes by $800 billion through limiting deductions and closing loopholes. The Republican plan included more spending cuts than the president's.
In his interview, Mr. Obama said Mr. Boehner's plan was unacceptable. "Unfortunately, the speaker's proposal right now is still out of balance," he said. "You know, he talks, for example, about $800 billion worth of revenues, but he says he's going to do that by lowering rates. And when you look at the math, it doesn't work."
 Mr. Boehner retorted later in the day that Mr. Obama's plan as currently formulated would not pass either the House or Senate. "With our latest offer, we have demonstrated that there is a middle-ground solution that can cut spending and bring in revenue without hurting American small businesses," Mr. Boehner said. "The president now has an obligation to respond with a proposal that does the same and can pass both chambers of Congress."

 11:57 A.M. | Governors Urge Action on Looming Fiscal Crisis 
 A half-dozen governors emerged from meeting with President Obama on Tuesday to publicly urge him and Congress to resolve the pending fiscal crisis as soon as possible because the uncertainty, as one put it, "is creating havoc."
 "You've got to come together and get this done," said Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, a Republican. "This impacts the economy."
 Mr. Obama hosted the six governors, three Democrats and three Republicans, to discuss plans for dealing with the automatic tax increases and spending cuts due to take effect in the new year. The states have almost as much at stake because so many of them rely on federal money for their programs.
 The president assured the visiting governors that they would "have a seat at the table," according to Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat and chairman of the National Governors Association. Mr. Obama assigned Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to be their point of contact in the White House and the governors promised to communicate ideas about how to approach the crisis.
 Several of the governors told reporters outside the White House that they understood states would have to share in the sacrifice but they urged the president and Congress to give them more flexibility in how they run their programs if federal funds were going to shrink. The governors said they would not as a group endorse any of the specific tax-and-spending plans put forward in recent days by Mr. Obama and House Republicans.
 For many of the governors, time is of the essence because they are busy putting together their own state budget proposals now for unveiling in January or February. Without knowing how the federal government will act, they could veer between surplus and deficit in short order. "We have decisions that we have to make," said Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and the association's vice chairman.

 10:53 A.M. | Conservatives Push Back Against Boehner Proposal 
 2:56 p.m. | Updated John A. Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, is facing a backlash from his party's conservative wing after submitting a proposal to the White House on Monday that calls for collecting $800 billion more in tax revenue.
The fight over tax increases has threatened to divide the Republican Party between its more moderate wing, which has indicated support for closing tax loopholes but not for raising tax rates, and the hard-line conservatives, who are resisting any plans that would raise tax revenue.
Late Monday and Tuesday morning, the reaction started to roll in, and it was not good for Mr. Boehner.
Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, one of the more outspoken conservatives on Capitol Hill, called the plan "Speaker Boehner's $800 billion tax hike." In a statement released by his office, the senator was cutting. "This isn't rocket science. Everyone knows that when you take money out of the economy, it destroys jobs, and everyone knows that when you give politicians more money, they spend it. This is why Republicans must oppose tax increases and insist on real spending reductions that shrink the size of government and allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money."
And an influential Tea Party group financed with support from the Koch brothers, Americans for Prosperity, said the speaker's proposal failed conservatives.
"The president's proposal and Speaker Boehner's counteroffer fail to seriously deal with the reality of the problems facing the nation," said the group's president, Tim Phillips. "Conservatives are looking for a leader to fight against tax increases, to push back against wasteful government spending, and address the fiscal challenges in a bold way. Sadly this plan leaves conservatives wanting."
Americans for Prosperity is planning more than just stern statements. A spokesman for the group said Tuesday that it would target members of Congress in various ways, including sending volunteers to district offices and creating something similar to a "naughty or nice list" that shows which members are supportive of higher taxes.
It is a dynamic that has haunted Mr. Boehner throughout the 112th Congress and shows again how he can become caught between the imperative to govern and the need to satisfy the restive right. Any move toward compromise with the president on fiscal issues quickly comes under attack from conservatives as a sellout. One of the major stumbling blocks to reaching a similar deal with President Obama last year was a fear that he could not sell a proposal to his own membership.
The grumbling from the right also catches the attention of House Republican members. For many, their chief concern is not being attacked by Democrats for failing to compromise. It is the prospect of a primary challenge from the right on the grounds that they struck an unfair deal with Democrats and did not do enough to rein in government spending. The conservative critics of the Republican proposal are among those who have the means and experience to stir up primary trouble for Republicans they see as straying too far from Republican orthodoxy.
Another prominent conservative to add her voice on Tuesday to the growing number of Mr. Boehner's critics was Sarah Palin, who said Republicans who break their promises to voters would face repercussions. "We send good conservatives to D.C. to fulfill the promises they made to the electorate, and yet when they stay true to their word the permanent political class in their own party punishes them," Ms. Palin wrote in a post on her Facebook page, titled "C'mon Now, G.O.P., Don't Go Wobbly on Us." 
"This won't be forgotten come 2014. Right now the G.O.P. establishment is more concerned about the opinion of the media and the Georgetown cocktail circuit than they are 'we the people' who hired them."

 10:54 A.M. | Republicans Balk at Short-Term Stimulus in Obama Plan 
Republicans and Democrats are struggling to find common ground on a long-term debt deal. But as economic growth has weakened this quarter, they are at odds over what the flagging recovery needs in the immediate future, too.
The Obama administration is arguing that the sluggish economy requires a shot in the arm, and it included tens of billions of dollars of little-noticed stimulus measures in its much-noticed proposal to Congressional leaders last week. But Republicans have countered that the country cannot afford to widen the deficit further and have balked at including the measures in any eventual deal.
The stimulus measures in the White House's debt proposal stem from President Obama's long-since-scuttled American Jobs Act proposal, and include a continuation of emergency support for long-term unemployed workers, an extension of the payroll tax cut, billions in infrastructure investment and a mortgage-refinancing proposal.
"We have a very good plan, a very good mix of tax reforms" and savings, said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, on ABC News last weekend. "We can create some room to invest in things that make America stronger, like rebuilding America's infrastructure."

 9:37 A.M. | Obama to Meet with Governors to Discuss Budget Talks 
President Obama meets Tuesday morning with a half-dozen governors to discuss plans to avert a fiscal crisis at the end of the year, a session that will no doubt include plenty of pressure to avoid spending cuts that would wreak havoc on state budgets.
"Governors have a lot at stake in this process," said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. "They have an interest in seeing Washington get its fiscal house in order." He noted they also "have a stake in our health care entitlement programs, including, of course, Medicaid."
The meeting is the latest that the president has hosted with various constituencies with stakes in the current budget talks. Last week, he hosted a group of small-business owners and a collection of corporate chief executives, as well as a hand-selected assembly of ostensibly typical middle-class taxpayers.
Joining Mr. Obama for Tuesday's meeting will be Govs. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat and chairman of the National Governors Association, and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and the association's vice chairman. Also participating will be Govs. Mike Beebe of Arkansas and Mark Dayton of Minnesota, both Democrats, and Gary Herbert of Utah and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, both Republicans.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will join the president's side of the table in the Roosevelt Room. The White House decided to let news photographers take pictures before the meeting but said the president would not make public remarks. Mr. Obama is scheduled to give an interview later in the day to Bloomberg Television, his first television interview since his re-election last month.

 11:17 P.M. | Democratic Group to Offer Tax Plan With Huge Payoff 
Democratic luminaries with ties to the Obama and Clinton administrations, including two former Treasury secretaries and two former White House chiefs of staff, on Tuesday will enter the tax debate with an overhaul plan that would raise an additional $1.8 trillion in the first decade.
That is $200 billion more than President Obama has proposed and $1 trillion more than Republicans in Congress support. It would mostly result from a simplification of the tax code that produces higher taxes from the wealthy, but would also involve higher taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages and Internet gambling that would hit people of all incomes.
"This is from the team that brought you the last good economy," said John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, in reference to the Clinton-era pedigrees of many of the plan's sponsors. The recommendations are likely to influence Democrats in the White House and Congress in budget negotiations now and in the coming year.
Other authors include Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, both former Treasury secretaries to Mr. Clinton; Mr. Summers was Mr. Obama's first National Economic Council director. Others are William M. Daley, Mr. Obama's previous chief of staff; the investment bankers Roger C. Altman, a former deputy Treasury secretary, and Antonio F. Weiss; Leslie B. Samuels, a former assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy; and Neera Tanden, a former Clinton and Obama aide who heads the Center for American Progress, the left-leaning research organization that produced the report.
Like Mr. Obama, the group calls for letting the top marginal income-tax rate return to the Clinton-era 39.6 percent, as scheduled on Dec. 31, while keeping other rates at the lower Bush-era levels. But the higher rate would apply on income for individuals and couples of $422,000 and up; Mr. Obama would have the thresholds at $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.
The Democratic group also would limit deductions for high-income taxpayers, but not by as much as the Simpson-Bowles fiscal plan that Republicans approvingly cite, and all new revenue would go to debt reduction instead of using some for lower tax rates as Republicans demand.
The plan would set the top tax rate for capital gains, now 15 percent, at 28 percent, the level in place from the Reagan administration through the 1990s. Dividends, also currently taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent, would be taxed as ordinary income as they had been historically.
By reducing tax advantages for high-income taxpayers, the plan would allow for repeal of the alternative minimum tax and the so-called PEP and Pease limits on personal exemptions and deductions - complicated tax measures that were intended to ensure that wealthy taxpayers could not claim so many breaks that they avoided taxes.
The plan would also repeal the "carried interest" break that permits investment fund managers to have their income taxed at the lower capital gains rate instead of as ordinary income. It was the carried-interest rate primarily that allowed Mitt Romney to pay an effective tax rate as low as 14 percent.
To further tilt the code in a progressive direction, the group calls for replacing popular itemized deductions for mortgage interest and other items with an 18 percent credit so that the benefit is the same for middle-income and high-income taxpayers. Currently deductions provide significantly greater benefits to taxpayers paying the top marginal rates. The deduction for charitable giving, however, would be as high as 28 percent.
On average, households with less than $100,000 in annual income would see no tax increase, and those with from $100,000 to $500,000 would see small increases, the group said. Taxpayers with $1 million or more would see a 5 percent increase from their current tax liability on average.
 An earlier version of this item incorrectly characterized one of the group's proposals. The plan called for replacing itemized deductions for mortgage interest, not mortgage insurance.

 4:17 P.M. | Looming Fiscal Crisis Could Affect Timing of Dividends 
Wal-Mart, Cisco Systems and H.J. Heinz are among the lengthening list of companies paying early dividends, before the end of the year, to spare their shareholders from the higher tax rates that may take effect next year.
Yet one group of companies is notable by its absence: The "dividend aristocrats," 51 companies celebrated by Standard & Poor's because they have increased the amount of their annual dividends in every year for the last 25 years. They are, in other words, the companies that seem most concerned about the happiness of their shareholders. But according to the trade publication Tax Notes, only two of those companies - Wal-Mart and Leggett & Platt - have rescheduled dividends. 
Indeed, five companies on the S&P list have affirmed their plans to pay dividends early in 2013, potentially subjecting shareholders to higher tax bills.
Economists and analysts have cited the rash of dividend rescheduling as one of the clearest signs that mere proximity to the so-called fiscal cliff is changing corporate decision-making. The top individual tax rate on earnings from dividends will rise to 39.6 percent from 15 percent next year, barring a change in federal law.
So why would a company not choose to pay dividends early this year?
One possibility is that corporations are not particularly concerned about the welfare of their shareholders. Dividend rates were also scheduled to rise at the beginning of 2011, before Congress extended the tax break for two additional years. A recent study of 243 companies that generally pay dividends in January 2011 found only 26 rescheduled payouts for December 2010 to avoid the potential tax hit.
Strikingly, the study found that companies "largely held by insiders" were much more likely to reschedule dividend payments, benefiting those insiders.
A second possibility is that companies are watching and waiting. They may expect a last-minute deal - which is exactly what happened in 2010. And if not, companies still have time to reschedule. Tax Notes cites Dec.15 as an effective deadline.
There is a third explanation, particular to the "dividend aristocrats." Companies want to be on that list, and the price of membership is that next year's dividend needs to be higher than whatever the company pays this year. As a result, a company that wants to stay on the list cannot just pay its January dividend in December - it will need to make an even larger payment next year.
The price of being nice to shareholders, in other words, is higher than it seems.

 4:10 P.M. | Boehner Makes G.O.P. Counteroffer on Deficit Cuts 
Republican Congressional leaders countered President Obama's deficit reduction proposal with a plan to cut the deficit by $2.2 trillion over the next decade by raising $800 billion in revenue and cutting $1.2 trillion in spending.
Another $200 billion in savings would come from changing the way the government calculates inflation, which would slow benefit increases in programs from Medicare to Social Security and raise taxes by slowing the rise in tax brackets.
Speaker John A. Boehner, who was under pressure to come up with a Republican alternative to the president's plan, called his offer "a credible plan that deserves serious consideration from the White House." He dismissed what he described as Mr. Obama's "La-La-Land offer" as something that couldn't pass the Democratic Senate much less the Republican House. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said that he too backed Mr. Boehner's approach.

 1:55 P.M. | Obama to Take Fiscal Deadline Questions on Twitter 
Escalating his campaign-style effort to pressure Congress to follow his lead in the burgeoning debate over the nation's finances, President Obama plans to hold a Twitter chat on taxes on Monday afternoon. 
The White House has been using social media to rally supporters behind the president's proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy while extending Bush-era rates for the middle class as part of an overall plan to avert an end-of-the-year fiscal crisis. At 2 p.m. Eastern, the president will personally join in. 
More than 300,000 supporters have sent tweets using the hash tag #my2K to express support for extending middle class tax cuts, which amount to roughly $2,000 a year for a typical family, according to the White House. The focus has been almost entirely on the tax side of the equation; no similar effort has been made to enlist public support for the president's position on spending and Republicans have accused him of not being serious about reining in the cost of government. 
Mr. Obama in the last week has staged an event at the White House with what were presented as typical taxpayers, met with small business owners and corporate leaders and flew to Pennsylvania for a tax-the-rich speech at a toy factory with many of the trappings of the campaign that just concluded. On Monday, he tweeted out his plans for the virtual chat.

 7:24 A.M. | A Simpson-Bowles Refresher 
The longstanding criticism that the White House should have embraced the Simpson-Bowles plan for deficit reduction has come around again as the debt talks between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner have heated up. 
But Simpson-Bowles contains a number of policies that many in Washington are downright allergic to - increasing the gas tax and raising taxes on the middle class, for instance. Everybody talks about it. But nobody can seem to remember what is in it. Given that reality, here is a short primer. 
First, Simpson-Bowles assumes the extension of certain policies and the expiration of others, setting a baseline to judge its reforms against. That includes: 
 A "doc fix," to prevent deep cuts to physician reimbursements for Medicare patients.
 A "patch" to ensure that the alternative minimum tax does not hit millions more middle-class families.
 The extension for the Bush-era tax cuts for income under $200,000 for individual filers or $250,000 for households. 
To reiterate: Simpson-Bowles assumes that the tax cuts expire for the top 2 percent of households. Then, the big changes - really, huge changes - come into play over time. The plan proposes to: 
 Cap discretionary spending in the near term and seriously limit its future growth.
 Increase the gas tax.
 Cut military spending.
 Curtail tax breaks by eliminating all of them and then re-implementing new measures for things like charitable giving. 
 Tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income.
 Reduce the number of tax brackets and lower marginal tax rates, so the top rate is no higher than 29 percent.
 Repeal the alternative minimum tax. 
 Make significant cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.
 Reform Social Security, including an increase in the retirement age.
At the end of the day, the plan would have cut the deficit by about $4 trillion, with about $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax revenue. Millions of working families would have seen their taxes go up. And the changes to spending programs would have been significant, too. 
For more on the plan, see my colleague Jackie Calmes's great piece explaining the White House's reception to Simpson-Bowles or her checkup on what Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bowles - that's Alan K. Simpson, the former Republican senator, and Erskine B. Bowles, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton - are up to now.

 7:17 A.M. | Pushing G.O.P. to Negotiate, Obama Ends Giving In 
Amid demands from Republicans that President Obama propose detailed new spending cuts to avert the year-end fiscal crisis, his answer boils down to this: you first.
Mr. Obama, scarred by failed negotiations in his first term and emboldened by a clear if close election to a second, has emerged as a different kind of negotiator in the past week or two, sticking to the liberal line and frustrating Republicans on the other side of the bargaining table.
Disciplined and unyielding, he argues for raising taxes on the wealthy while offering nothing new to rein in spending and overhaul entitlement programs beyond what was on the table last year. Until Republicans offer their own new plan, Mr. Obama will not alter his. In effect, he is trying to leverage what he claims as an election mandate to force Republicans to take ownership of the difficult choices ahead.

 1:39 P.M. | Parties Defend Their Stands on Fiscal Crisis 
At a stalemate in their talks to avoid a self-imposed fiscal crisis at the end of this month, the lead negotiators for the White House and Congressional Republicans used the Sunday morning news shows to defend their positions and blame the other side for the impasse.
"Right now I would say we're nowhere, period. We're nowhere," House Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said on "Fox News Sunday."
"We've put a serious offer on the table by putting revenues out there to try to get this question resolved," he said. "But the White House has responded with virtually nothing."
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner countered Mr. Boehner on Fox and the four other programs by outlining President Obama's proposals for long-term deficit reduction and insisting that Republicans were blocking compromise by their opposition to letting the Bush-era tax rates on high incomes expire as scheduled by law on Dec. 31. Mr. Obama and Democratic lawmakers want to extend the tax cuts on household incomes below $250,000 a year, but not for income above that level, as the president vowed in his re-election campaign.

 1:36 P.M. | Jacob Lew, Low-Key Power Broker 
When President Obama was locked in painful spending negotiations with House Republicans last spring, his exceedingly meticulous budget director, Jacob J. Lew, went to the Oval Office to propose some complex budget changes. As Mr. Lew delved deeper and deeper into the numbers, Mr. Obama put up his hand, signaling him to stop.
"Jack, it's fine," the president said, according to Gene Sperling, Mr. Obama's economics adviser, who witnessed the exchange. "I trust your values. I trust your judgment on this."
Today Mr. Lew is the White House chief of staff (and on the shortlist to become the next Treasury secretary), and Mr. Obama has entrusted him with an even bigger task: guiding the White House through potentially treacherous negotiations with Congressional Republicans to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts on Jan. 1, which economists warn could throw the country back into recession.

 5:36 P.M. | If Deal Is Not Reached, the Impact Won't Be Instant 
If Washington fails to reach a tax and spending deal by Jan. 1, paychecks will shrink as rates rise. But defense contractors will keep working. Parks and monuments will remain open. Financial markets will either slump or not.
America's fiscal condition will be altered without a deal between President Obama and the Republicans in Congress. But not radically so, and in many cases not immediately.
This budget stalemate is unlike the many previous ones that threatened to cause a government shutdown. Agencies are not facing the immediate loss of authority to spend money. The danger of defaulting on the nation's financial obligations is not at great as it was during the 2011 impasse over raising the nation's borrowing limit. And some of the tax and spending changes would not be felt for months.
The president and his Democratic allies are still deeply nervous about life on the other side of the fiscal deadline, and they continue to say they are eager to avoid that possibility. But Mr. Obama's re-election victory and the few immediate implications from a breakdown in negotiations have emboldened them.
Democrats are betting that if Washington wakes up without a tax and spending deal on New Year's Day, the country will heap blame on Congressional Republicans. In recent polls, more people said that it would be the fault of Republicans if a deal could not be reached.
Democrats in the House will seek to make that point again this week by trying to force Republicans to vote on a bill to extend tax cuts for the middle class but not the wealthy.
"Tax cuts for the rich, which do not create jobs, just increase the deficit, heaping mountains of debt onto future generations," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, told reporters on Friday. She added that the economy would benefit greatly if "we do not go over the cliff."
But many Democrats also believe that failing to reach a deal for a brief period early next year would provide new leverage for Mr. Obama and a quick capitulation from Speaker John A. Boehner and his Republican colleagues on a package of tax cuts for the middle class and increased rates for the nation's wealthiest citizens.
Mr. Obama pressed his case confidently on Friday at a toy manufacturer in Pennsylvania. He warned that the Republicans' refusal to reach an acceptable deal by the end of the year would be "sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas."
And in a message to the millions of people subscribed to the White House e-mail list, David Plouffe, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, urged supporters to keep the pressure on lawmakers and warned of the dire consequences if the negotiators were unable to find common ground.
"Unless Congress acts, 114 million middle-class American families are staring down a tax increase starting January 1," Mr. Plouffe wrote in the e-mail.
But the lack of immediate consequences could also serve to empower Republicans to hold firm for days or weeks against a deal with the president, believing that the public would not exert the kind of political pressure that Democrats expect.
Without concrete ramifications, Mr. Obama's recent efforts to keep his campaign supporters energized about the tax and spending debate could fizzle.
Republicans could also conclude that people are more likely to blame Mr. Obama and his party for tax increases because it is Democrats who have been pushing for them.
In Washington at the end of last week, Republicans offered a defiant tone, scoffing at the president's proposal for $1.6 trillion in tax increases on the wealthy combined with new stimulus spending and other Democratic priorities. On Saturday, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah denounced what he called "radical" and "unserious" proposals by the president that he said represented an utter lack of leadership.
"Some on the other side of the aisle are advocating a disastrous 'Thelma & Louise' strategy," Mr. Hatch said in the weekly Republican radio address, referring to the movie heroines who drove their car off a cliff.
The ability of Republicans to maintain their position may depend on what actually happens if no deal is reached by the end of the year. Government officials, tax specialists and business representatives said they did not expect major implications right away.
Pentagon officials and military contractors said that billions of dollars in automatic spending reductions would be delayed for weeks, if not months, as they figured out where they needed to cut and by how much. Defense Department hiring would be stopped temporarily, officials said. But no one would be fired immediately, and no programs would end.
"While a hiring freeze is likely to be implemented quickly, it will take time to implement further budget cuts and the number and types of personnel to be furloughed," said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department.
Large companies that do business with the Pentagon are likely to wait for guidance before cutting back weapons programs or laying off civilian workers.
Parks, libraries and monuments would remain open in the new year, unaffected by the lack of a deal in the way that a budget stalemate threatens immediate closure. Government employees would show up for work whether or not they had been deemed "essential" to the operation of their agency.
Many workers would see their first paychecks in January shrink as employers adjust for higher payroll taxes. And the Internal Revenue Service would race to reprogram computers, possibly forcing an eventual delay in refunds. But tax preparation for 2012 would march forward as usual toward Jan. 22, when the I.R.S. is expected to begin processing electronic returns.
"There is this period in which Congress can continue to arm wrestle and wait for a settlement on this without affecting many people," said Bob Meighan, a vice president of TurboTax, which makes tax preparation software.
At the I.R.S., the biggest concern is about the alternative minimum tax, which would eventually force higher tax payments from about 60 million Americans unless the president and Republicans agree to adjustments like the ones that have been made regularly since 1969.
"There would be serious repercussions for taxpayers," Steven T. Miller, the acting commissioner of the I.R.S., wrote to lawmakers in November.
Among the murky uncertainties: what happens in the financial markets if a deal is not reached.
Some market watchers predict a huge sell-off of assets that would drain wealth from retirement plans and undermine consumer confidence. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped almost 600 points since September, in part because of uncertainty about the presidential election and the ability of politicians to reach a deal on taxes and spending this year.
But the stock market has rebounded somewhat in the last two weeks. On Friday, investors shrugged off heightened partisan bickering in Washington a day earlier.

 6:35 P.M. | Pelosi Backs Limiting Oversight of Debt Ceiling 
Representative Nancy Pelosi on Friday endorsed a proposal by the Obama administration that would require Congress to cede most of its authority over the debt ceiling, a statutory limit on the government's borrowing.
As part of the White House's bold opening bid in the negotiations to resolve the looming financial crisis, The Times reported Friday, the plan would significantly curtail Congressional purview over the debt ceiling, institutionalizing a proposal floated last summer by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, during negotiations over increasing the debt limit.
The ceiling itself is not strictly speaking necessary, and many other developed countries do not have one. Congress already determines the country's overall level of debt by budgeting how much tax revenue the government takes in and how much it spends. Rather, the ceiling acts as a secondary budgetary check - and often as a political football.
Back in 2006, for instance, a senator from Illinois took to the floor to bash Republicans for raising the ceiling without taking other efforts to right the country's fiscal course.
"Leadership means that the buck stops here," then-Senator Barack Obama said. "Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit."
Last year, Republicans staunchly refused to raise the ceiling without significant spending cuts. That led to a stand-off with the White House, a wave of anxiety running through financial markets and ultimately fruitless negotiations on a long-term debt deal, as well as the creation of the so-called fiscal cliff looming at the end of this year.
This time, some Republicans have said they would consider not raising the debt ceiling if Mr. Obama vetoed a bill passing the Bush-era tax cuts for all levels of income.
The administration, it seems, has had enough. Recently, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who presented the plan to Republicans this week, has argued for getting rid of the ceiling once and for all. On Thursday, he actually proposed doing it. Congress could pass a resolution blocking an increase in the ceiling, though a president could veto that resolution, aides told the Times. And many Democrats have argued that the president has the Constitutional authority to raise the debt limit unilaterally, under the 14th Amendment.
The White House might love to see the debt ceiling become a historical relic. But it seems exceedingly unlikely that Congress would agree to that sort of proposal, undercutting its authority. On Friday, Republican aides dismissed the idea out of hand.

 1:57 P.M. | Obama Hits the Road to Rally Support for His Tax Plan 
1:45 p.m. | Updated HATFIELD, Pa. - President Obama made a campaign-style foray on Friday to a toy factory in this Philadelphia suburb to rally the public behind his plan to increase taxes on the wealthy while casting Republicans in Congress as modern-day Scrooges.
"I've been keeping my own naughty and nice list for Washington," he told workers and others gathered at a plant that makes K'NEX toys. If Republicans hold middle-class tax cuts hostage to preserve them for the rich, he said, then everyone could end up paying more next year. "That's sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas. That's a Scrooge Christmas."
Mr. Obama's trip here was his first return to the road during a high-stakes effort to outflank his opponents on Capitol Hill in the looming crisis over the nation's finances. Rather than just sit down and negotiate with Congressional leaders, as he tried in the past to his disappointment, the president is pursuing a dual-track strategy that involves concentrating as much public pressure on lawmakers as possible even as his aides make the rounds on Capitol Hill.

 10:57 A.M. | Top Earners Have Seen Big Drop in Average Tax Rates 
One thing that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on is that the rich should pay more in taxes in the coming years - even if they cannot agree on whether to raise additional revenue through ending tax breaks or raising marginal rates.
A central piece of the Democratic argument for the tax increases is that average federal tax rates on high earners have fallen precipitously since the 1970s. Over the same period, those high-income households have earned a larger and larger share of overall income, too.
Average tax rates for about 95 percent of earners have remained in a narrow band for decades. But average tax rates for the top earners - and especially the very, very rich - have collapsed. (Binyamin Appelbaum and Robert Gebeloff wrote in Friday's New York Times that most Americans in 2010 paid far less in total taxes than they did in 1980.)
The data comes from Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, the noted French economists who have become two of the pre-eminent scholars of American income inequality in the past decade. Earlier this year, I profiled them and their work.

 7:06 P.M. | White House Analysis Is Skeptical of G.O.P. Plan 
The White House on Thursday released an analysis to buttress its argument that Republicans cannot raise sufficient revenues for deficit reduction simply by curbing popular deductions, unless the limits raise taxes for middle-income Americans too.
In budget talks now under way between the administration and Congressional leaders to avoid a fiscal crisis in January, President Obama has proposed raising nearly $1.6 trillion in the first 10 years - about $1 trillion by letting the Bush-era tax rates expire as scheduled Dec. 31 for higher incomes, and the rest by limiting deductions for affluent taxpayers.
The goal in both parties is a budget package that reduces annual deficits over a decade by about $4 trillion. Bipartisan commissions have suggested that at least $1 trillion of the total come from higher taxes and the rest from reduced spending. Republicans have not committed to a revenue figure that high, and they oppose raising any tax rates. They want to keep the current top rate at 35 percent rather than let it revert in 2013 to 39.6 percent, the top Clinton-era rate.
According to the White House analysis, a $25,000 cap on itemized income-tax deductions, as some Republicans including Mitt Romney have suggested, would raise between $450 billion and $800 billion depending on how it is written. Further complicating matters, the deductions in question are popular ones for mortgage interest, health insurance, charitable donations and local and state taxes.
A $25,000 deduction cap would bring in about $800 billion over 10 years, the analysis said, assuming it were limited to couples with more than $250,000 annually in adjusted gross income, and individuals with more than $200,000. If the cap applied to all taxpayers regardless of income, to raise more revenues would require higher taxes for 17 million Americans with incomes below those levels, the analysis showed.
About $650 billion in additional revenues would result if the cap were phased in gradually by income levels, as would be necessary to prevent millions of Americans at the $250,000 and $200,000 cut-off points suddenly being hit with a much larger tax bill, according to the analysis.
And the revenues to be raised would fall to roughly $450 billion, it said, if the cap exempts deductions for charitable giving. Many people in both parties say such an exemption would be all but certain given the lobbying power of universities, foundations and charities that are already mobilizing to protect the deduction they consider vital to their fund-raising efforts - just as they did in 1986, the last time the tax code was overhauled.
"Plausible tax-expenditure limitations that protect middle-class families and incentives to give to charity would raise far less revenue from the well-off than is needed for a major budget agreement," wrote the authors of the analysis, Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council, and his chief deputy, Jason Furman.
Raising revenues through deduction limits alone, and refusing to raise rates on high incomes, they concluded, "would inevitably force any tax reform designed to further reduce the deficit to raise taxes on middle-income families simply to preserve lower rates for the most fortunate."
While Congressional Republican leaders have acknowledged postelection that any deficit-cutting deal with Mr. Obama will call for additional revenues as well as spending cuts, they have insisted that the money come from limits on deductions and economic growth, not higher rates on the wealthy.
Mr. Obama, besides supporting expiration of the Bush tax cuts on high income, has proposed to limit deductions for affluent taxpayers but not by a cap.
Instead, he has proposed since the start of his term that the highest rate for deductions should be the 28 percent marginal tax rate, which covers most taxpayers. That would increase taxes for those in higher tax brackets by reducing their deductions. While the change would raise about $600 billion over 10 years, people in both parties have opposed it under pressure from charities, the housing industry and states and cities, among others.

 5:04 P.M. | Geithner Offers Plan to Boehner to Avert Fiscal Crisis 
House Republicans said on Thursday that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner presented the House speaker, John A. Boehner, a detailed proposal to avert the year-end fiscal crisis with $1.6 trillion in tax increases over 10 years, an immediate new round of stimulus spending, home mortgage refinancing and a permanent end to Congressional control over statutory borrowing limits.
The proposal, loaded with Democratic priorities and short on detailed spending cuts, was likely to meet strong Republican resistance. In exchange for locking in the $1.6 trillion in added revenues, President Obama embraced $400 billion in savings from Medicare and other entitlements, to be worked out next year, with no guarantees.
He did propose some upfront cuts in programs like farm price supports, but did not specify an amount or any details. And senior Republican aides familiar with the offer said those initial spending cuts might well be outnumbered by upfront spending increases, including at least $50 billion in infrastructure spending, mortgage relief, an extension of unemployment insurance and a deferral of automatic cuts to physician reimbursements under Medicare.
"The Democrats have yet to get serious about real spending cuts," Mr. Boehner said after the meeting. "No substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks."

 1:19 P.M. | What's the Plan? No Further Cuts Seen for Pentagon 
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower famously said that plans are nothing, but planning is everything because no war plan survives first contact with the enemy. Therefore, the military should hone its ability for continuous planning.
In the decades since, the Pentagon has excelled at nothing as much as planning for every conceivable - and sometimes inconceivable - contingency.
So it is more than a little surprising that a range of Defense Department and military officials say there is no formal planning under way on how the Pentagon budget could or should be trimmed further.
Cuts of $500 billion over the next 10 years, representing roughly 5 to 8 percent of the Pentagon's budget, would begin to take effect if the White House and Congress fail to reach an accord before the end of the year. The reductions would occur across the board. Even if there is a deal on taxes and spending to avoid the automatic cuts, it is a safe bet that the deal would impose additional budget reductions on the Pentagon.
Pentagon officials and military officers do not say it out loud, but their public inaction reflects a fear that any planning on cuts would amount to an invitation to Congress to make them. The Pentagon could then face larger reductions than it otherwise might as part of any deficit deal.
What programs could be vulnerable? Experts offer varying proposals, of course, depending on what branch of the military they think is most important and what sort of world they predict America will face.
Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, noted in a recent talk at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that there are only three large baskets of spending from which savings can be found: personnel costs; equipment costs, both for repairs and new orders; and training costs, like how many bullets are available for firing on practice ranges and how many hours can be logged in jet fighter training flights.
A study released this week by Todd Harrison and Mark Gunzinger of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington research group, recommended protecting a series of military capabilities, which it called "the crown jewels," necessary in a future combat environment. They included: Special Operations forces, cyberspace capabilities, underwater warfare systems and long-range surveillance and strike aircraft, both manned and unmanned.
Gordon Adams, a former Pentagon official in the Clinton administration and an advocate of further military cuts, has said there is unusual agreement among analysts across the political spectrum on the way ahead in military spending.
In an essay for the Web site of Foreign Policy magazine, Mr. Adams said that long-term wars of attrition and nation-building, like in Afghanistan and Iraq, were "over," allowing the ground forces to shrink. Analysts, he wrote, also agree that the United States can reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal, but that research and development should be protected.
Any future reductions for the Pentagon would come on top of $487 billion in spending cuts the Obama administration plans to make over the next decade.
After a decade of sharply rising military spending and revenues diminished by two tax cuts and two recessions, Pentagon officials say that they are aware that a new period has begun. Their goal is to limit the cuts they face to the ones that have already been planned, and to certainly avoid the across-the-board cuts that will start to take effect if Congress does not reach a deal by year's end.
 Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly identified the administration in which Gordon Adams served. He was a Pentagon official in the Clinton administration.

 12:47 P.M. | A Lengthy Conversation for Obama and Boehner 
 President Obama spoke for nearly a half-hour on Wednesday night with House Speaker John A. Boehner in at least their second call this week, aides confirmed, but it was unclear whether they are making progress toward a deal that would avoid a fiscal crisis in January.
 While administration officials declined to discuss the conversation, they did note the length of it to reject the characterization on the Web site Politico, which first reported the call, that the two men had a "curt" exchange. 
According to Politico, Mr. Boehner told Mr. Obama to drop his demand that Bush-era tax cuts for high income expire as scheduled on Jan. 1, and Mr. Obama said Republicans must specify - as he has in his budget - how much they would support both for raising revenues and for reducing future spending on Medicare and other benefit programs. 
 Administration officials, in refusing to address that description or offer details, cited an agreement with Congressional negotiators that the two sides should not leak to the news media.
 Mr. Obama had spoken over the weekend with Mr. Boehner and Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader. An official said the president simply was touching base with the leaders as the Thanksgiving break wound down, and negotiations were to begin in earnest.
 On Thursday, Mr. Obama's lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, and his chief liaison to Congress, Rob Nabors, were to meet with Mr. Boehner and other House leaders, including Representative Paul D. Ryan, the budget committee chairman and recent Republican vice-presidential nominee. They also were meeting separately with other Congressional leaders. 
 Advisers both on Capitol Hill and at the White House say this week is mainly devoted to political maneuvering, publicly and privately, and that next week must see progress on actual details of a compromise if the White House and Congress are to reach a long-term deficit reduction accord that would substitute for more than $500 billion in immediate tax increases for all Americans and across-the-board spending cuts.

 12:14 P.M. | Dividends May Decline as Potential Tax Rise Looms 
This week, The Times's Nathaniel Popper reported on how potential tax increases on stock dividends are prompting companies to consider other ways of making payouts next year to investors like stock buybacks.
The president has proposed increasing taxes on dividends to 39.6 percent from the 15 percent rate that was set for most investment income in 2003. But benefits derived from share repurchases would be subject to a smaller tax increase: to 20 percent from 15 percent. Both types of investment income would also be hit by a 3.8 percent surcharge tied to the new health care law.

 11:29 A.M. | Aid for Long-Term Unemployed Is on the Table 
We've heard about the tax increases. We've heard about the spending cuts. But expiring emergency aid for the long-term unemployed is also part of the so-called fiscal cliff, and analysts have started to sound the alarm.
At the end of December, more than two million workers will lose federal unemployment insurance if Congress does not act. Those payments often keep workers' heads above water while they search for a new job - still a daunting challenge, given the elevated unemployment rate and businesses' hesitancy to hire.
Unemployment insurance also benefits the broader economy, acting as a powerful stimulus. A new Congressional Budget Office report (PDF) estimates that if Congress were to extend its emergency jobless benefit programs, economic output would be 0.2 percent higher and 300,000 more Americans would be employed by the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with projections under current law.
But unemployment insurance comes with a hefty price tag. A full one-year extension of emergency programs - which bump up the number of weeks that workers can receive benefits - would cost about $30 billion, the budget office estimates.
The government has spent more than half a trillion dollars on unemployment insurance over the past five years.

 10:25 A.M. | With Higher Taxes Looming, Bonuses May Come Early 
Some highly paid workers may be getting an extra Christmas present this year: an early bonus.
Firms in bonus-heavy industries like finance, law and consulting typically pay their annual bonuses after Jan. 1, once the firm's (and employee's) previous calendar-year performance can be fully assessed. But now, anticipating higher income tax rates in 2013, some companies have decided to distribute their bonuses by Dec. 31 instead.
At Ares Management, a financial services firm, employees have been told they will receive bonuses in mid-December instead of mid-January. A spokesman for the company declined to comment about its compensation practices.
Paying bonuses early - not more, not less, just early - can save high-income employees quite a bit of cash. That is because a series of tax changes scheduled to kick in at the end of the year will cause income received in 2013 to be taxed at higher rates than income received in 2012.

 7:37 A.M. | Calculating the Potential Changes for Taxpayers 
Washington's policy debate about how to reduce the budget deficit has produced a dizzying whirl of hypertechnical proposals to adjust the nation's tax code.
But a new online calculator unveiled Wednesday will allow those who will be most affected by the outcome of the debate - taxpayers - to follow along at home and estimate the impact various plans might have on their personal finances.
The calculator, created by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, is based on four scenarios that have been discussed by President Obama and Congress:
- The extension of current tax policy and patching the Alternative Minimum Tax.
- The Senate Republican plan, which would extend the Bush-era income tax cuts for everyone but allow the 2009 credits and the temporary payroll tax cut to expire.
- Senate Democrats' proposal to extend tax breaks on income up to $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families and allow the payroll tax to expire.
- The automatic spending cuts and across-the-board tax increases that will be triggered if no agreement is reached.
Using an assortment of "sample taxpayers," the calculator underscores the fact that many Americans, even those in the lower income levels, are likely to face higher tax bills next year regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.
The calculator estimates that a hypothetical married couple with a combined income of $452,808 and two children under 13 would see its federal tax bill increase by $9,321 if the Democrats' plan is enacted (to $127,758 from $118,438). Under the Republican plan, that family's tax liability would increase by $6,891 - to $125,328. If the automatic spending cuts and tax increases take effect, the family's tax increase would be $17,438, and its total federal tax bill $135, 875.
For top earners the increases, and differences between the plans, are more dramatic. A married couple with income of $2,117,051 with two children would face a total tax increase of $95,000 under the Democratic plan, (to $600,110 from $505,239). If the Republican plan is enacted, that same family's total federal tax liability would climb more modestly - by $36,301 - to $541,540. But if the automatic tax increases go into effect, that increase would be $122,742, bringing its total federal tax liability to $627,981.
For a single taxpayer with an income of $46, 605 - which is near the national median - both the Democratic and Republican plans would bring an identical result: an increase of $864 (to $11,143 from $10,279). The automatic changes would bring a tax increase of $1,310, for a total federal tax bill of $11,590.
The same holds true for many taxpayers with lower incomes: while their income tax rates would remain unchanged under either the Democratic or Republican plans, the expiration of the payroll tax cut would bring an increase in their total federal tax bill.
The calculator does not address some of the more nuanced proposals now under consideration, such as plans to cap or eliminate deductions.
"There are just too many variables up in the air now for us to put them all in there," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the policy center.
But the calculator does permit users to customize the settings, allowing tax accountants and policy experts to approximate most of the initiatives now under consideration - and invent some that Congress and Mr. Obama haven't yet envisioned.

 7:58 P.M. | Conciliatory Obama Meets With C.E.O.'s 
President Obama met privately with some of the country's most important corporate titans on Wednesday to bury the hatchet from a rough campaign season and talk through the fiscal crisis confronting Washington.
Mr. Obama conceded that there had been friction between the White House and big business in the past, but he expressed hope that such rancor was now behind them, according to one chief executive who asked not to be named describing a private conversation.
"He said, 'I really want you guys to succeed, I don't have to campaign anymore,' " the executive said. "President Obama recognizes the severity of the moment and the opportunity to get America's fiscal house in order."
The meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House included the chief executives of 14 major American companies like Home Depot, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Marriott, State Farm, Merck and AT&T. Mr. Obama was joined by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The executives emphasized that the economy could get an unexpected boost if a quick resolution is found to the fiscal crisis and the country can avoid the full force of tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect automatically at the beginning of 2013. Most said they would not object to higher taxes as part of a balanced solution, even though they are among the wealthy Mr. Obama is targeting.
"He seemed flexible, but he said taxes should go up on the top 2 percent," the executive said. The president also said he was prepared to deal with entitlement programs.
The chief executives went around the room and spoke, beginning with Brian Roberts of Comcast and finishing with Marissa Mayer of Yahoo.
"We had a constructive meeting," Mr. Roberts said. "It's encouraging that the president and Congressional leaders are focused on coming to an agreement that if reached could unleash a real wave of optimism. The sense of the meeting was if this occurs, the economic growth in the new year may be even greater than many have predicted."
Muhtar Kent, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, called it a productive conversation. "We strongly support finding a solution to the fiscal cliff and encourage our leaders to work together to find a balanced and sustainable approach to keep our country moving forward with economic growth," he said.
Ms. Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, said before the meeting that it was essential for Mr. Obama and Congress to agree on a fiscal plan. "Businesses need certainty," she said, "so that we can continue to invest in innovation, a highly trained work force and ultimately in long-term economic growth."

 7:07 P.M. | Administration and Congressional Negotiators to Meet 
The White House's top negotiators on efforts to avoid the year-end pileup of tax increases and spending cuts are headed for some closed-door but high-visibility meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Rob Nabors, the White House director of legislative affairs, will make visits to the top Republican and Democrat in both the House and the Senate, the Treasury Department said.
The outreach from the top echelon of the administration comes as both sides are pushing their preferred plans for putting the country on a better fiscal path while avoiding the worst of the steep tax increases and deep spending cuts scheduled to start in January.
The so-called fiscal cliff threatens to throw the markets into a panic and the economy into a recession if Congress cannot find a compromise. Although a final deal remains out of reach, both sides are quietly insisting that they want to reach agreement before the end of December.
The trip to the Capitol by Mr. Nabors and Mr. Geithner is designed to ratchet up public pressure on Congress to make a deal - without divulging anything about the sensitive back-room negotiations, which aides who are involved said had so far proved genial but fruitless. The visits are certain to draw a lot of news media attention even if they do not produce much in the way of real developments.

The Obama administration is turning to social media to help build support for its approach to the so-called fiscal cliff, asking Twitter users to lobby members of Congress to raise taxes on people earning more than $250,000 while keeping tax cuts for those earning less. 
In a post on Twitter, the @barackobama account urged people to use the hashtag, #my2K on Twitter, a reference to what it says is the $2,200 in additional taxes that the average family of four would pay if all of the tax cuts from George W. Bush expired at the end of the year.
The administration is also asking people to tell their stories, in 140 characters or less, on what impact $2,000 in extra taxes would mean for their household budgets. The White House is retweeting some of them on the @whitehouse Twitter account and sharing them on the White House Web site page devoted to explaining President Obama's position on addressing the fiscal cliff.

 5:56 | Lessons Learned From a Bipartisan Budget Deal in 1990 
Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat, and John H. Sununu, a Republican, were two of the Big 8 who, in 1990, negotiated a landmark bipartisan budget deal between the White House and Congress. On Wednesday, they were in accord again, agreeing that President Obama and Congressional leaders face a tougher task reaching a compromise now, in more polarized times.
Mr. Foley, the genial House speaker 22 years ago, and Mr. Sununu, the pugnacious White House chief of staff to the first President Bush, joined other players from the 1990 budget negotiations on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to discuss what lessons that prolonged showdown may hold for current leaders, who have much less time to avoid the fiscal crisis bearing down in January.
Then, as now, the government was divided - Republicans held the White House and Democrats controlled Congress in 1990 - and officials faced a self-imposed deadline for a deficit-reduction agreement. Without a deal, huge across-the-board spending cuts would occur that would have jolted the economy, just as they would now. Republicans also opposed any tax increases then, yet without those increases Democrats would not agree to domestic spending cuts.
But as partisan as the environment seemed back then, Mr. Foley said officials benefited not only from occasional bipartisanship but also from what he called transpartisanship, personal relationships that transcended parties and are all but missing two decades later.
Mr. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor, agreed, noting that Mr. Bush during his days in Congress had gotten to know Mr. Foley and other Democrats, who by 1990 were Congressional leaders.
"The climate really was different" for the 1990 talks, Mr. Sununu said. But, he added, "it wasn't accidental." Instead, he said, the Bush White House "exploited as much as possible" the personal relationships among the central players.
For all the complaints about partisanship during Wednesday's panel discussions, which were hosted by George Mason University, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Deloitte & Touche, the participation of Mr. Sununu was evidence that some of the players in 1990 were no slouches at political brawling. (Later, George W. Bush was called in to fire Mr. Sununu from his father's team.) This year, as a highly visible adviser to Mitt Romney, Mr. Sununu was at the center of several controversies, for calling Mr. Obama "lazy" and "a bumbler" and once saying, "I wish this president would learn how to be an American."
The serious negotiations in the fall of 1990 followed months of maneuvering, including meetings at Andrews Air Force Base to escape reporters. What made success possible, both sides agree, was the president's written acknowledgment in midsummer that higher revenues had to be part of a deal, along with spending cuts.
That act violated Mr. Bush's "no new taxes" campaign vow in 1988. So, while the 1990 deal is widely considered a Bush achievement, and a factor in the prosperity and balanced budgets that followed in the Clinton years, it helped cost Mr. Bush re-election after many anti-tax Republicans mutinied. Even his son, running for president in 2000, all but ignored the achievement and explicitly ruled out a job in a presidency of his own for his father's budget director, Richard G. Darman, who has since died.
"No one should think George H. W. Bush didn't know what risks he was taking" as a first-term president who would soon face the voters, said Michael Graetz, a former Treasury official and now a Columbia Law School professor.
Picking up on that point, Philip Joyce, a former government budget analyst now teaching at the University of Maryland, said the lesson now for Mr. Obama was that "presidential leadership matters." And, he suggested, that should come easier to a president just re-elected, who never has to face the voters again.

 5:31 P.M. | Working on a Unified Republican Message 
A day after one of his most loyal lieutenants strayed from the ranch on expiring tax cuts, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio brought a stern message Wednesday morning to his House Republican troops: Stay unified.
At a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference, the speaker told members they needed to stay on message as negotiations heat up to head off a fiscal crisis in January, and that message must shift from which taxes need to rise to how President Obama intends to cut entitlement spending.
"The G.O.P. is trying to pivot from taxes back to Obama's lack of proposals on spending cuts," said one House Republican who was in the room.
On Tuesday, Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, told the Republican leadership's team of vote counters that the party should give in and pass legislation extending expiring Bush-era tax cuts for the 98 percent of all households earning $250,000 or less. Only then, he said, should Republicans take up the fight over what to do with the rest of the expiring tax cuts. On Wednesday morning, he was asked to defend that position to the conference, and he did not flinch.
Mr. Cole's voice is significant. He is a loyalist member of the House leadership, a conservative and a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee with finely tuned political antennas.
"I trust John Boehner in negotiations, and I'm not trying to undermine him," Mr. Cole said in an interview. But, he added: "People act as if us holding firm prevents the tax increases. It doesn't."
What Mr. Boehner wants is a change of subject, from taxes to entitlements. And he wants President Obama to make the next move, with a detailed and public proposal on how to reshape Medicare and Medicaid to put the programs on track for long-term solvency while keeping them from bleeding the government dry. That message was taken up with gusto after the meeting Wednesday, repeated by members and Boehner aides ad infinitum.
Announcing that the speaker will meet Thursday with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama's lead fiscal negotiator, Mr. Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said, "We accepted this meeting with the expectation that the White House team will bring a specific plan for real spending cuts - because spending cuts that Washington Democrats will accept is what is missing from the 'balanced approach' that the President says he wants."
Representative Charlie Bass of New Hampshire, a moderate Republican defeated in November with nothing to lose, said he would not accept a tax-cut extension of any kind that was not part of a comprehensive package to deal with spending, entitlements and the deficit.
Representative Steve LaTourette, Republican of Ohio and another lame duck, said that he too could not disagree more with Mr. Cole.
"Playing small ball, and by that I mean fixing this issue without dealing with the big picture, would be irresponsible," he said.
But both acknowledged that the Republicans, fresh from electoral defeat earlier this month, are back in a bad political spot.
"No question if we go over the fiscal cliff and Congress allows it to happen because we would not let taxes go up on the top 2 percent, that is not a battle we are likely to win," Mr. Bass said.

 4:38 P.M. | Aw Shucks and Straight Shooting 
Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the odd couple of deficit reduction superstardom, took their road show to reporters Wednesday morning, and while Mr. Bowles, a former Clinton White House chief of staff, doled out stern warnings and long odds for a deal to avert fiscal disaster, Mr. Simpson, a former Wyoming Republican senator, doled out his famous aphorisms.
Apropos of nothing, he distinguished between being naked and being nekked: "If you're naked, you don't have any clothes on. If you're nekked, you don't have any clothes on but you're up to something."
Mr. Simpson decried the lack of compromise in his political party, which he described as "rigid as a fireplace poker, without the occasional warmth," adding that anyone joining a legislative body without a will to compromise shouldn't be in a legislature or a marriage.
And he lashed out both at Grover Norquist, the keeper of the Republicans' pledge never ever to raise taxes, and AARP, the senior lobby holding out against any significant changes to Social Security and Medicare.
"As long as we're in the thrall of Grover Norquist and AARP, then we have a long, tough haul," Mr. Simpson said.
Between the aw-shucks stories, it was left to Mr. Bowles to dish out the spinach. He said both sides - especially the Democrats - needed to be more vocal about what kind of cuts they could embrace. He came away from meetings Tuesday with President Obama and his economic team convinced that the White House is serious about reaching a broad deficit reduction deal next month to head off hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts. But he gave negotiators only a one-third chance of success before the Jan. 1 deadline.
"We go over this fiscal cliff, you have bet this country," he warned.

 1:56 P.M. | Obama Asks Congress to Keep Tax Cuts for Middle Class 
President Obama called again on Congress on Wednesday to extend Bush-era tax cuts for all income under $250,000 and leave a broader restructuring of the tax code to next year, as he pressures Republicans to let tax rates rise for the wealthiest Americans.
Surrounding himself by supporters he presented as typical middle-class taxpayers, Mr. Obama said he hoped to resolve the tax and spending issues now confronting Washington by an end-of-the-year deadline. But he said lawmakers should not wait for such an agreement to pass legislation preserving current tax rates for 98 percent of Americans.
"My hope is to get this done before Christmas," he said of an agreement to avert deep spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take place automatically with the new year. "But the place where we already have in theory at least complete agreement right now is on middle-class taxes."
He said such an approach "would give us more time next year to work together on a comprehensive plan to bring down our deficits" and "streamline our tax system."

 12:05 P.M. | Boehner Challenges Cole 
Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio challenged one of his most senior lieutenants on Wednesday for favoring a plan that would allow tax rates to rise for households earning less than $250,000.
Mr. Boehner, speaking to reporters following a meeting with House Republicans, said that he had personally told Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma in a morning meeting that he thinks the congressman has the wrong approach.
"The goal here is to grow the economy and control spending," Mr. Boehner said. "You're not going to grow the economy if you raise tax rates."
He added: "It will hurt small businesses. It will hurt our economy. Why? This is not the right approach."
Preserving the Bush-era tax cuts that lowered rates for all taxpayers has been an inviolable cornerstone of the House Republican fiscal plan. But Mr. Cole made waves on Tuesday night when he said, breaking with the rest of the leadership, that the party should side with President Obama and allow the tax cuts to expire, and then battle later with Democrats over what the rates should be for the highest earners.
Mr. Cole expressed support for Mr. Boehner but said Republicans need to think first about preserving low tax rates for middle-income families.
"I trust John Boehner in negotiations, and I'm not trying to undermine him," Mr. Cole said in an interview Tuesday night. But, he added: "People act as if us holding firm prevents the tax increases. It doesn't. We should protect the overwhelming majority of the American people from any fallout from this debate."
Mr. Boehner, who on Wednesday called Mr. Cole "a wonderful friend of mine and a great supporter of mine," joined other top House Republicans, like the majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, in pressing the White House to put cuts in social welfare programs like Medicare and Medicaid on the table.
"It's time for the president and the Democrats to be serious about the spending problem that our country has," Mr. Boehner said, adding a note of optimism. "And I'm optimistic that we can continue to work here together to avert this crisis sooner rather than later."

 11:38 A.M. | A Look at Tax Rate Trade-Offs 
In Wednesday's New York Times, Jackie Calmes describes the touring road show of Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson:
Ladies and gentlemen, coming soon to your city or town (if they have not been there already, and maybe even if they have) are the latest odd couple of politics: the 67-year-old Democratic straight man, Erskine B. Bowles of Charlotte, N.C., and his corny 81-year-old, 6-foot-7 Republican sidekick, Alan K. Simpson of Cody, Wyo.
Since the perceived failure two years ago next week of the bipartisan fiscal commission they led for President Obama, they have been on the road, sometimes solo but often together, perfecting a sort of Off Broadway show that has kept their panel's recommendations alive, and made them a little money as well.
(How much money? As much as $40,000 per man per speech.)
For those interested in learning more about the report produced by Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson, it remains online. 
One part especially relevant to the current debate over raising tax revenue is a chart on Page 29. It shows that if the federal government eliminated all tax breaks - including the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance, the deduction for mortgage interest, the tax breaks for retirement savings - it could sharply reduce income-tax rates while still raising the same amount of money. 
The top rates, now 35 percent and 33 percent, could fall to 23 percent. The bottom rates, 10 percent and 15 percent, could fall to 8 percent. The report claimed that these changes would "maintain or increase progressivity" - that is, the balance of taxes paid by the poor, middle class and affluent.
No one believes a complete elimination of tax breaks will happen. As Annie Lowrey described in another recent article, even a partial elimination of tax breaks - focused on the affluent - is unlikely. But the chart in the Bowles-Simpson report gives a sense of how much money tax breaks cost the federal government. 
Although a plan as radical as the ones described in the Bowles-Simpson report are unlikely, White House officials and Congressional leaders are talking about smaller ways to reduce the deficit by limiting tax breaks.

 9:50 A.M. | Combating Inequality May Require Broader Tax 
Rarely have we experienced such a confluence of arguments in favor of raising taxes on the rich. After a hard-won re-election fought mainly over taxes and spending, President Obama arguably has a mandate from voters to tap the wealthy to address our budget woes.
What's more, raising more money from the wealthy might go a long way toward righting our lopsided economy - which delivered 93 percent of our income growth in the first two years of the economic recovery to the richest 1 percent of families, and only 7 percent to the rest of us.
Yet while raising more taxes from the winners in the globalized economy is a start, and may help us dig out of our immediate fiscal hole, it is unlikely to be enough to address our long-term needs. The experience of many other developed countries suggests that paying for a government that could help the poor and the middle class cope in our brave new globalized world will require more money from the middle class itself.

 7:16 A.M. | Teachers' Union Makes Lobbying Push on Fiscal Deadline 
Leaders of the nation's largest teachers' union from around the country will urge lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday to increase taxes on the wealthy and avoid large cuts in domestic spending and entitlement programs.
The lobbying blitz by the National Education Association is part of an effort by the White House and its allies to ratchet up the pressure on members of Congress during negotiations over how to avoid the looming fiscal deadline at the end of the year.
In particular, the teachers' union is aiming its lobbying clout at moderate Democratic senators who might be tempted to cut a deal with Republicans that includes deeper cuts in federal spending on education or major changes to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
"Congress should think very strongly before any changes are made to Medicaid," said Mary Kusler, the director of government relations for the group, which has about three million members.
Ms. Kusler said the teachers will be urging lawmakers to embrace a plan that increases tax fairness by having the wealthy pay more. She said they will also remind lawmakers that previous efforts to reduce the nation's deficit have already cut about $1.7 trillion from nondefense federal spending, which includes money for schools.
Any further cuts to education spending, she said, would dramatically affect programs that help the most vulnerable students.
"We really do believe that the revenue pieces are inextricably linked to students who have been historically underserved," Ms. Kusler said.
The officials from the teachers' union are coming from Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia.
They will join members of other liberal groups who are descending on Washington this week to help bolster Mr. Obama's own efforts to keep activists fired up on behalf of his position on taxes and spending. Mr. Obama will hold an event with middle-class taxpayers on Wednesday, followed by a private meeting with corporate leaders.

 7:08 A.M. | Obama to Meet With Business Leaders on Fiscal Issues 
 President Obama's campaign-style lobbying effort on the fiscal crisis continues on Wednesday with a public event featuring scores of ostensibly typical middle-class taxpayers. But the more interesting moment may take place behind the scenes when he meets privately with corporate leaders.
 Mr. Obama will be host to 14 chief executives in the Roosevelt Room to talk about the tax and spending decisions confronting him and Congress at the end of the year. After an election season in which Mr. Obama and big business often seemed to part ways, the president hopes to reassure the corporate titans that he is not antibusiness while insisting on his plan to raise taxes on the wealthy.
 Among the chief executives who will be in attendance, according to the White House, are Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Muhtar Kent of Coca-Cola, Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, Arne M. Sorenson of Marriott, Frank Blake of Home Depot and Ian Read of Pfizer.
 Others on the list include Joe Echevarria of Deloitte, Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck, Terry J. Lundgren of Macy's, Douglas R. Oberhelman of Caterpillar, Brian L. Roberts of Comcast, Edward B. Rust Jr. of State Farm, Randall L. Stephenson of AT&T and Patricia A. Woertz of Archer Daniels Midland.

 5:09 P.M. | The Naked Truth 
AIDS activists brought what they saw as the naked truth to the office of the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, on Tuesday, stripping down to their birthday suits to protest further spending cuts in any deal to head off a fiscal crisis in January.
Seven members of the group ACT UP - which saw its heyday in the 1980s - entered the speaker's personal office in the Longworth House Office Building, not the speaker's suite in the Capitol, took off their clothes and began chanting: "No more budget cuts on our backs. End AIDS with a Robin Hood tax," ostensibly a tax on the rich for AIDS research and treatment. 
Colorfully adorned with Robin Hood and gay-rights triangles on their skin, the group caused a stir. Then the staff called the Capitol police, who hauled them off, or as a Boehner aide said, "handled the situation from there."
Washington has come full circle: the struggle to avert the fiscal cliff in January has revived the causes of tax reform, last seen in the 1980s, balanced budgets, last seen in the 1990s, and now ACT UP.

 5:06 P.M. | Dueling Tours of Small Businesses 
President Obama may have Air Force One to ferry him around as he tries to sell his ideas for deficit reductions, but that doesn't mean House Republicans won't be on the move as well.
Over the next week, Mr. Obama intends to meet with the owners of small businesses and corporate leaders to press for his tax policy ideas, which include an increase in rates for high earners. On Friday, employing a tactic that served him well in his re-election campaign, he will fly to Pennsylvania to visit a factory where he will warn against the so-called fiscal cliff, hoping that the watching public will pressure their members of Congress to buy into his program.
House Republicans will answer with their own talking tours back home. Members are planning events including their own visits with local small businesses to push plans that include further cuts to government spending and increased revenues though unspecified closings of certain tax loopholes.
"Republicans understand that we must avert the fiscal cliff and have laid out a framework to do so that is consistent with the 'balanced' approach the president says he wants," said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner. "In contrast, Democrats in Congress have downplayed the danger of going over the cliff and continue to rule out sensible spending cuts that must be part of any significant agreement to reduce the deficit."
Stay tuned to find out who will win the race to find the face of Ace Hardware.

 3:18 P.M. | Despite Fiscal Shadow, Consumer Confidence Rises 
Despite stagnant incomes and the threat of fiscal contraction scheduled for the end of the year, consumer confidence rose again in November, reaching its highest level since February 2008.
Consumer confidence has been rising for the last three months, and the latest pickup was driven by more buoyant expectations for the economy, as opposed to consumers' assessment of current conditions. In fact, for the last four years, consumers have been consistently more positive about the future of the economy than its present, which is the reverse of their attitudes for most of the expansion that preceded the financial crisis.

 11:20 A.M. | Durbin to Stress Liberal Viewpoints in Speech 
Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democrat in the Senate, will make the liberal case for a major deficit reduction deal on Tuesday morning, arguing that it is in the left's interest to ensure the long-term viability of Medicare and Medicaid while using a "Grand Bargain" to win concessions on upfront spending to improve the economy.
What the senator does not say in the speech, at the Center for American Progress, may be as important as what he says, as he lays out what Democrats can and cannot accept in a deal to avert potentially crippling automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January.
According to excerpts from the speech, Mr. Durbin will say the deal "will not repeal or gut the Affordable Care Act." That language leaves open the possibility of money-saving changes to the health care law that Republicans are demanding. He will take off the table Representative Paul D. Ryan's first proposal to convert Medicare into a program where beneficiaries receive money to buy private health plans, and he will rule out turning Medicaid into a block grant.
But he pointedly will leave federal health care on the table for negotiations that could bring changes short of those proposals. Changes to Medicare and Medicaid should not be part of the initial "down payment" on deficit reduction that would be part of a framework laying out instructions for the harder legislative work that would happen next year, Mr. Durbin will say. But, he will add, "Progressives should be willing to talk about ways to ensure the long-term viability of Medicare and Medicaid," saying "putting the discussions off indefinitely makes our choices harder, our success less likely, and negative effects on current beneficiaries a near certainty."
Mr. Durbin's voice may hold particular weight because he has been in the trenches on deficit talks for more than two years. He served on President Obama's bipartisan deficit reduction Bowles-Simpson commission, known by the names of its chairmen, Erskine Bowles, President Bill Clinton's former White House chief of staff, and Alan K. Simpson, the former Republican senator Wyoming.
Mr. Durbin broke with some liberals in his party to vote for the Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction plan. And he was a founding member of the so-called Gang of Six, a bipartisan group of senators that has been trying to come up with a detailed deficit reduction plan that could bring in a majority from both parties.
His speech will lay down markers on the left likely to rankle Republicans. He will say any overhaul of the tax code must preserve the code's progressivity. He will say a deal should include investments' up front in education, infrastructure, clean energy, research and health care. And he will say Social Security should not be part of the talks. But he will also refrain from crowing about election results that kept a Democrat in the White House, expanded the Democratic majority in the Senate and chipped away at the Republican lead in the House.
"The election didn't give either political party a mandate," Mr. Durbin will say, according to the excerpts, striking the same conciliatory tone Republican leaders have. "What voters have both parties is a work order. They told us to work together to solve this problem fairly and wisely."

 6:09 A.M. | Obama Goes Back on the Trail Ahead of Debt Talks 
President Obama plans to try to ratchet up public pressure on Congress to accept his ideas for resolving the looming tax-and-spending crisis with a series of events at the White House and on the road this week.
Mr. Obama will meet with carefully selected small-business owners, middle-class taxpayers and corporate leaders over the next couple days, then fly to Pennsylvania on Friday to tour a toy manufacturer that he argues will be hurt if automatic tax increases take effect at the end of the year.
The White House released its public lobbying plans on Tuesday morning even as it had yet to schedule another meeting between Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders to hash out a deal. The strategy reflects a calculated decision by the president to emphasize public pressure over closed-door negotiations after he felt burned by failed debt talks last year.
As White House officials view it, the campaign-style approach has worked for Mr. Obama on several smaller issues over the last year and underscores the president's argument that he won a mandate with his 51 percent of the popular vote in this month's re-election. But his strategy could also exacerbate partisan tensions at a time when voters have said in polls that they want the two sides to work together to fix the nation's finances. Republicans have already complained that the president seems less interested in sitting down to talk than in scoring political points.
"Rather than sitting down with lawmakers of both parties and working out an agreement, he's back out on the campaign trail, presumably with the same old talking points we're all familiar with," Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on the floor on Tuesday. "Look, we already know the president is a very good campaigner. What we don't know is whether he has the leadership qualities necessary to lead his party to a bipartisan agreement on a big issue likes this."
He said Republicans have been willing to talk about increasing tax revenues but complained Democrats have not been serious enough about cutting spending, and he insisted that Mr. Obama's new health care program be included in reductions. "The first step to recovery is to admit you've got a problem," Mr. McConnell said.
Mr. Obama talked by telephone with Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican House speaker, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, over the holiday weekend, and the White House said the president will meet with the leaders "at the appropriate time," without saying when that might be.
"We continue to be optimistic that a balanced approach is achievable," Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Monday. "We know what the solutions are." Any final agreement, he said, has to "include both spending cuts and revenues and entitlement reforms." And while Republicans are open to raising taxes through closing loopholes and limiting deductions, Mr. Carney said that would not raise enough money to deal with the problem, meaning that tax rates needed to rise for the wealthiest Americans.
Mr. Obama's schedule for the rest of the week suggested he wants to prep the field before returning to the bargaining table with Congressional leaders. On Tuesday, he will meet at the White House with 15 owners of small businesses to argue that his tax proposals would help such firms. They include the owners of such businesses as Vintage Vinyl, a music store in St. Louis; and the New Glarus Brewing Company, a beer maker in New Glarus, Wis.
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will host an event at the White House where handpicked "middle-class Americans" will talk about how they would be affected by the automatic tax increases scheduled to begin in January. Separately that day, he will meet with corporate leaders at the White House.
Then on Friday, he will travel to Pennsylvania to tour the Rodon Group manufacturing plant in Hatfield, which makes K'Nex brand construction toys, including Angry Bird Building Sets.
"We are always looking for ways to engage the public in a debate like this because everyone here should be acting on the public's behalf," Mr. Carney said. "And hearing from them, hearing their voices and hearing their priorities is essential to helping compel this process forward."
Mr. Boehner's office said it agrees that a balanced approach is needed but said it is the Democrats who seem oblivious to that, citing some who have downplayed the risk of letting the automatic tax increases and spending cuts go into effect at the end of the year. "The target of the president's rallies should be the congressional Democrats who want to raise tax rates on small businesses rather than cut spending," said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner.

 5:23 A.M. | Business Community Split on Deficit Approach 
At least a half-dozen deficit-minded chief executives will meet with Speaker John A. Boehner and the House Republican leadership on Wednesday, trying to raise the pressure on Republicans to include significant revenue increases in a quick deal to avert a fiscal crisis.
At the same time, the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable met on Monday with the White House chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, carrying a harder-line message on taxes to a skeptical audience.
The round of meetings this week illustrates a growing split in the business community as negotiations to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January heat up.
"No question about it," there is a split, said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, who expressed exasperation with the business groups still opposing any increase in taxes.
The group of chief executives in the deep-pocketed Fix the Debt Coalition says any deal to avert the so-called "fiscal cliff" will have to include significant revenue increases, changes to entitlement programs and a new round of spending cuts.
The Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have called for all of the expiring Bush-era tax cuts to be extended before January. While both are pushing for a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code next year, neither has endorsed raising revenues through extensive changes in the tax code.
Jon Romano, a spokesman for Fix the Debt, described the Wednesday events on Capitol Hill as a major push. Chief executive officers, college students and activists from nine states will converge on Washington. Among them will be Erskine B. Bowles, the former Clinton White House chief of staff who was co-chairman of President Obama's deficit reduction task force; the chief of Caterpillar Inc., Doug Oberhelman; Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein; Thomas Wilson from Allstate; Aetna's Mark Bertolini; Greg Sherrill of Tenneco; and David Cote of Honeywell, another member of the president's deficit task force.
"People in both parties agree we need a 'balanced approach' to deal with our deficit and debt and help our economy create jobs," Mr. Boehner said in a statement announcing that he would attend the meeting. "As we've seen in recent days, the American people support an approach that involves both major spending cuts and additional revenue via tax reform with lower tax rates."
The group's association with Mr. Bowles has given it weight but has also aligned it with the politically freighted deficit reduction plan drafted by Mr. Bowles and former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican and the co-chairman of the president's deficit commission. That plan called for as much as $2 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years, along with significant changes to entitlements and more spending cuts.
Aides to Mr. Boehner chose to emphasize a separate proposal floated by Mr. Bowles alone, which appeared to take up the speaker's proposal to raise a more modest $800 billion over 10 years. It is not clear, however, whether that was Mr. Bowles's preferred option or whether he was merely saying the speaker's numbers, along with spending cuts and health care changes, could lead to significant deficit reduction.
In the tussle between the two business coalitions, Fix the Debt may have the political upper hand. The Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions of dollars in the 2012 election, especially against Democratic Senate candidates. In nearly all of the races it entered, its Republican candidate lost, and Democrats - especially in the Senate - are not going to be quick to forgive and forget, Mr. Durbin said.
"They lost their fannies," Mr. Durbin said.
White House aides said President Obama spoke over the weekend with Mr. Boehner and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. The president plans to meet with Congressional leaders again this week to resume negotiations, but no date has been released.

 6:08 P.M. | Mortgage Interest Deduction Is Under Scrutiny 
A tax break that has long been untouchable could soon be in for some serious scrutiny.
Many home buyers deduct their mortgage interest when assessing their tax bill, a perk that has helped bolster the income of millions of families - and the broader housing market.
But as President Obama and Congress try to hash out a deal to reduce the budget deficit, the mortgage interest deduction will likely be part of the discussion.
Limits on a broad array of deductions could emerge in any budget deal. It is likely that any caps would be structured to aim at high-income households, and would diminish or end the mortgage tax break for many of those taxpayers.

 3:24 P.M. | Congressional Proposal Could Create Tax Code 'Bubble' 
The coming Congressional debate over fiscal policy is sure to feature a wide array of proposals, some of which would hit certain taxpayers harder than others.
But one idea being floated by Congressional negotiators, as described in an article by The New York Times's Jonathan Weisman on Thursday, is hard to defend from the standpoint of rational public policy making.
Its arithmetic could require that the 300,000th dollar of income was taxed at a rate of about 50 percent - even while the three millionth dollar of income, or the three billionth, was taxed at a lower 35 percent rate instead.
The math behind these calculations is not all that complicated. It's just a matter of understanding how marginal tax rates work.

 3:00 P.M. | Awaiting Hints on the Fiscal Chill 
The fiscal impasse in Washington has certainly got Wall Street's attention. But how much has the issue begun to affect actual consumers and businesses?
 Tuesday should provide some important clues. The first hint about business performance will come when the Commerce Department reports on durable goods orders for October. Durable goods are products and equipment that last at least three years, and typically include items like industrial machinery and computer equipment, as well as household appliances and cars. 
 Nonmilitary capital goods orders, a subset of durable goods, have been weak in recent months, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. "If they get worse, it's a sign the fiscal cliff is biting harder," he said. 
 The consensus among economists is that overall capital goods orders, including the volatile military sector, are expected to fall by 0.3 percent. IHS projects that orders will rise by 1.4 percent on stronger aircraft demand. 
 As for consumers, Mr. Gault said he would be watching closely Tuesday when the Conference Board reports on consumer confidence in November. "If it comes in weak or we get a real jolt, then we could say the fiscal cliff is starting to influence people's thinking," Mr. Gault said. 
 IHS estimates that consumer confidence in November will drop by 0.2 points, to 72.0, from the October level, while the consensus calls for an increase to 73.1.

 1:23 P.M. | Polls Show Widespread Concern Over Possibility of Deal 
As negotiations begin in Washington over a potential deficit-reduction deal, the American public has a strong desire for its elected officials to cooperate and reach a settlement, according to recent polls, even as they are skeptical about the likelihood of an agreement. There is widespread concern about the financial consequences of the automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect in January.
The country will be faced with a crisis or major problems if negotiations to avert the "fiscal cliff" are not successful, according to two-thirds of the adults surveyed in a CNN/ORC International poll. 
In a USA Today/Gallup poll, 82 percent said it was important that President Obama and Congress come up with an alternative to the automatic tax increases and spending cuts. Two-thirds of the public - regardless of party identification - said the best result for the country would be for both sides to compromise equally. 
Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed by CNN said Mr. Obama should compromise with the Republicans to get things done, and the same share said Congressional Republicans should make concessions in their dealings with the president. 
But 70 percent said Congressional Republicans were not doing enough to cooperate with the president, and respondents were closely divided on whether Mr. Obama was doing enough to cooperate with the Republicans. 
A poll conducted for the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post also found Americans doubtful that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans would be able to get along enough to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts. About half said the two sides would not reach an agreement, while just 38 percent said they would. 
Republicans would receive more blame for the lack of an agreement, according to the CNN poll. Forty-five percent of respondents said Congressional Republicans would be responsible if the automatic tax increases and cuts went into effect, and 34 percent said Mr. Obama would be responsible. 
The spending cuts and tax increases that would take effect if there is no agreement would have a major impact on the national economy, according to two-thirds of those surveyed in the Pew poll. And most respondents expected the changes in taxes and spending to have mostly negative consequences for the economy. 
Fewer said their personal financial situation would be affected in a significant way. But most of those who expected to be personally affected said the lack of an agreement would hurt them financially. 
Republicans and Democrats have different views on the effect the spending cuts and tax increases would have on the economy and their own pocketbooks. 
Republicans have a gloomier outlook if the fiscal cliff is not averted. Eight in 10 Republicans predict a negative effect on the national economy, and three-quarters worry about a harmful impact on their own finances. Democrats are less pessimistic: about half say the effect of these spending cuts and tax increases would be negative for both the national economy and their own economic well-being.
The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted Nov. 16 to 18 with 1,023 adults. The USA Today/Gallup Poll was conducted Nov. 9 to 12 with 1,009 adults. The survey by the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post was conducted Nov. 8 to 11 with 1,000 adults. All three national polls used landlines and cellphones, and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

 1:01 P.M. | Norquist Says Some in G.O.P. Having 'Impure Thoughts' on Taxes 
Grover Norquist on Monday found a new way of dismissing the handful of Republican lawmakers - including the House majority leader - who are now publicly wavering about his pledge they signed not ever to raise taxes.
Mr. Norquist, the anti-tax crusader who urges every new lawmaker to sign the pledge, joked on CNN's "Starting Point" that "we've got some people discussing impure thoughts on national television." But he insisted that the vast majority of Republicans will pay them no mind.
"They all said this two years ago, when we were arguing over the debt ceiling limit," Mr. Norquist said in the interview. "We cut spending. We didn't raise taxes. So other Republicans did not listen."
Mr. Norquist's position as the chief enforcer of the Republican party's no-tax stance is under fire in Washington as President Obama pressures Republicans in Congress to reach a compromise that increases taxes on wealthy Americans.
Not wanting to be boxed in by Mr. Norquist's pledge, some key lawmakers are saying publicly that they might be willing to raise taxes - in certain circumstances.

HEADLINE: Dec. 17 Updates on Connecticut Shooting Aftermath

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Live coverage in the aftermath of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. 

 BODY:
 Two of the children killed in Friday's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., were buried Monday, as investigators continued to try to piece together the motive behind Adam Lanza's rampage, which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults at the school and Mr. Lanza's mother before Mr. Lanza killed himself. 
 8:15 P.M. | N.R.A. Facebook Page Vanishes 
Did you hear? Our #facebook page reached 1.7 million "likes" today! Thanks for being a friend! #NRA http://t.co/Dxni9hsv
- NRA (@NRA)13 Dec 12 
Two days after the National Rifle Association boasted on Twitter that its Facebook page had reached 1.7 million likes, the page vanished after the shooting on Friday in Connecticut left 20 schoolchildren, six teachers and staff members, and the gunman's mother dead. 
The page was still not up on Monday. And there have been no new posts on theassociation's Twitter accountsince Friday at 9:36 a.m., when it announcedauto emergency kits as a giveaway. The day before, the account posted: 
#Florida nears 1 million permits for concealed weapons http://t.co/sfKltC4U

While the debate over gun restrictions was shifting in some corners in Washington, as our colleagues report, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, avoided outlining specific measures to restrict guns on Monday. 
At an interfaith service Sunday in Connecticut, President Obama said he would "use whatever power this office holds" to engage citizens in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.
Meanwhile, a petition calling for President Obama to "immediately address the issue of gun control" was submitted Friday to the "We the People" platform run by the White House. 
By Monday, it has gained more than 160,000 supporters, making it the most popular petition since the program began in September 2011.

 8:08 P.M. | Malloy Asks for State Ban on High-Capacity Magazines 
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Monday that state lawmakers should try again to enact a ban on high-capacity gun magazines like the 30-round magazines that Adam Lanza used to fire off dozens of rounds in rapid succession at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
The federal assault-weapons ban, which expired in 2004, prohibited some high-capacity magazines. Last year, Connecticut's State Legislature considered a bill that would have banned magazines that held 10 or more rounds, but it died after hundreds of gun enthusiasts showed up for a hearing on the bill and thousands more contacted legislators, according to The Hartford Courant.
"We could be compliant with the previous assault-weapons ban limitation by going from a 30 magazine to a 10 magazine," Mr. Malloy said at a news conference in Hartford. "I think that is a common-sense piece of legislation that can be taken up in the next session."
But Mr. Malloy also said that "in the absence of a federal framework in which we limit really the explosive nature of the weapons and ammunition that's used, no state would ever be safe based on simply its own laws."
Connecticut has its own assault-weapons ban, dating to 1993, but the model of rifle Mr. Lanza used is not covered under it.
Mr. Malloy took time again to praise first responders in light of the news that Mr. Lanza had hundreds of rounds left when he stopped shooting at others as the police were closing in and turned one of his guns on himself.
"It's pretty clear now that their very quick response saved lives," he said. "We are grateful to them." 
Because the responders willingly risked their lives, Mr. Malloy added, "children went home and continued their preparations to celebrate Christmas or will celebrate Hannukah in the future."

 6:36 P.M. | Mother's Eulogy: 'Take Flight, My Boy' 
 Here is the eulogy delivered by Veronique Pozner at the funeral on Monday for her 6-year-old son, Noah, as issued by The Associated Press:
The sky is crying, and the flags are at half-mast. It is a sad, sad day. But it is also your day, Noah, my little man. I will miss your forceful and purposeful little steps stomping through our house. I will miss your perpetual smile, the twinkle in your dark blue eyes, framed by eyelashes that would be the envy of any lady in this room.
Most of all, I will miss your visions of your future. You wanted to be a doctor, a soldier, a taco factory manager. It was your favorite food, and no doubt you wanted to ensure that the world kept producing tacos.
You were a little boy whose life force had all the gravitational pull of a celestial body. You were light and love, mischief and pranks. You adored your family with every fiber of your 6-year-old being. We are all of us elevated in our humanity by having known you. A little maverick, who didn't always want to do his schoolwork or clean up his toys, when practicing his ninja moves or Super Mario on the Wii seemed far more important.
Noah, you will not pass through this way again. I can only believe that you were planted on Earth to bloom in heaven. Take flight, my boy. Soar. You now have the wings you always wanted. Go to that peaceful valley that we will all one day come to know. I will join you someday. Not today. I still have lots of mommy love to give to Danielle, Michael, Sophia and Arielle.
Until then, your melody will linger in our hearts forever. Momma loves you, little man.

 5:31 P.M. | Malloy Speaks Tearfully of Decision to Tell Families 
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy described with tears in his eyes Monday his decision to set investigative protocol aside on Friday and tell families who were anxiously awaiting news that their loved ones had in fact died.
"It was evident to me that there was a reluctance to tell parents and loved ones that the person that they were waiting for was not going to return," Mr. Malloy said Monday afternoon at a news conference in Hartford shortly after he attended the funeral of Noah Pozner, 6.
On Friday, Mr. Malloy said, families were kept in the dark, "well after there was any expectancy that families would be reunited."
"So I made a decision," he continued, "that rather than relying on traditional investigative policies that you actually have a child or adult identified as a particular victim before you inform someone -" The governor paused to compose himself.
"I made the decision that to have that go on any longer was wrong. I did it."
Mr. Malloy also spoke of the anguish he felt at Jack's funeral.
"The reality with respect to the relatives is you try to feel their pain, but you can't," the governor said. "You try to find some words that you hope will be adequate knowing that they'll be inadequate. 
"And you see little coffins and your heart has to ache."

 5:03 P.M. | From Far Away, Kindnesses Sent Through Newtown Store 
Amazing: guy from California calls general store in Sandy Hook CT. Buys coffee for the whole town of 27 000. http://t.co/HWAha9I9

Not exactly the whole town. But Tom Cavanaugh, a writer who works and lives in Los Angeles, gave $125 Monday at the Newtown General Store on Main Street for 100 cups to be handed out to people with his condolences. The store's owner, Peter Leone, thought it was such a good idea that he offered free coffee to everyone. 
I just bought 100 Cups of Coffee to be handed out with my condolences to the people of Newtown CT at the Newtown General Store. 203-426-9901
- Tom Cavanaugh (@TommyCinLA)17 Dec 12
Maxilene Ramos, manager of the Newtown General Store for the last 15 years, said that she had been fielding phone calls from people all over the world, asking how they could make a contribution to the people of Newtown through the store.
"We just got a call from New York from someone who donated hot chocolates," Ms. Ramos said. 
Another person, she said, paid $500 for food and snacks to be given to police officers and first responders. She said someone else donated candy to be handed out to children. Another caller contributed money to pay for 50 lunches earlier in the day. 
"Everybody here appreciates the kindness from people all over the world," said Ms.Ramos, who is putting together a list of the people who donated to put in the store window. "Everybody is thankful."

 4:52 P.M. | Finding Comfort at a Community Center 
NEWTOWN, Conn. - With the town center and places of worship inundated by the news media with the first funerals, the nonprofit Newtown Youth Academy recreation center became a "sanctuary" for the community to be together on Monday, said Marc Gold, a member of the Hawleyville Volunteer Fire Department. 
Until he arrived at the center and found young children playing with their friends and visiting with Santa, "I hadn't stopped crying" since Friday, said Mr. Gold, who had responded to the scene of the shooting. "This is the only thing that gave me any normalcy back."
Peter D'Amico, who lives in Newtown, said he built the recreation center four years ago as a nonprofit community organization. Over the weekend, Mr. D'Amico said he and the town's recreation and sports groups met with school officials and decided to open the center to the community on Monday. 
CNN's Don Lemon talks to organizers.
The organizations sent e-mails notifying the town and calling for volunteers. 
At 8 a.m., about 200 volunteers, many from the high school, including the cheerleading squad and soccer team, assembled to set up the food and drinks donated by Newtown's merchants, Mr. D'Amico said. "It's a very emotional thing for us to see," he said.
An hour later children and parents started to arrive, and by midafternoon, Mr. D'Amico estimated, there were about 2,000 people at the center. "We certainly did not expect, we didn't know what to expect, actually," he said. "It's been just unbelievable. I think the kids playing with their friends and laughing has been a great situation for them."
Tim Engel of Portage, Ind., drove for 15 hours with his dog, Barnabas, to be at the community event on Monday. He and other members of the Lutheran Church Charities Comfort Dog Ministry brought their dogs to cuddle with the Newtown children at the recreation center. Mr. Engel said a local church, Christ the King in Newtown, had invited the group.

 4:25 P.M. | Noah Pozner Wanted to Be Taco Boss - or Doctor 
 FAIRFIELD, Conn. - Noah Pozner loved tacos, so much so that he told his parents that when he grew up he wanted to be the manager of a taco factory, his mother remembered in a eulogy for her son on Monday. That way, he told her, he would be able to eat as many as he wanted.
He also wanted to be a doctor, she said.
 Such were the childish yet boundless aspirations of a 6-year-old life cut short, mourned in an afternoon service at a Fairfield funeral home. Relatives and friends, neighbors and total strangers crowded into two rows of wooden pews in the main room where Noah's body lay.
Others watched and listened from an adjacent room on a screen.
Speaking first after the family rabbi opened the service at 1 p.m., Veronique Pozner maintained a poise that those in attendance said was remarkable for a grieving mother in any situation, let alone one coping with a death as part of a national tragedy.
"She came out and just spoke so well - I think she was trying to help others," said Myrna Kaufman, who did not know the family but said she felt "as a mother" that she had to come to pay her respects.
Noah's teenage brother, Michael, also spoke, as did several other family members and Rabbi Shaul Praver of Temple Adath Israel in Newtown. 
A friend of Michael's, Scott Buchanan, 17, came with his father and mother. They recalled that the young man paused to console himself as he spoke for himself and Noah's twin sister. 
"We no longer have a brother," Diane Buchanan, Scott's mother, recalled Michael saying. "But we now have a guardian angel."
 She said that as Ms. Pozner spoke, "there wasn't a man, woman or child who had a dry eye, and it was beautiful."
Among those gathered were rabbis who had driven from as far as the Catskills and Brooklyn to attend the service in the Abraham L. Green and Sons Funeral Home, a prominent location for Jewish funerals in southwestern Connecticut.
 Rabbi Edgar Gluck, who splits his time between Krakow, Poland, and Borough Park in Brooklyn, said Ms. Pozner spoke of her son as both a good student and one who did not always rush to do his homework.
 "But the main thing that she left was one point," Rabbi Gluck recalled. "She said whenever she told him 'I love you,' his answer to her was 'Not as much as I love you.' "

 4:18 P.M. | Lanza Attended a Public University in Connecticut 
As a teenager, Adam Lanza, whom the police have identified as the gunman in the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, took six classes at Western Connecticut State University, according to a spokesman for the university. 
The spokesman, Paul Steinmetz, confirmed that Mr. Lanza was a part-time student from the summer of 2008 to the summer of 2009, but said the circumstances through which he came to the school were not clear. "We occasionally have high-school-age students taking classes here, sometimes if they're precocious and their high school teacher or counselor asks that they be allowed to take a class if they're too advanced for whatever they're being offered in high school," Mr. Steinmetz said. "Or sometimes it's a home-school situation, just one of the options that the parent is attempting to give the student as they educate them in an untraditional way. It probably was one of those two. But I don't know; as far as I know we have no record."
Asked if university files contained any record of concerns about Mr. Lanza, Mr. Steinmetz said: "I have not heard of any and I've not seen any, and I've not talked to anyone who's expressed any knowledge of that. As far as we know there were no concerns." He said he was not aware of the student's having visited the school's counseling or health services. 
Other news outlets have quoted Mr. Steinmetz as saying that Mr. Lanza got an A in a computer science class and an A-minus in a history class, and that he had a 3.26 grade point average, but Mr. Steinmetz said he could no longer comment on those details. "The attorney general's office has told us that we can't give out that information because of federal student privacy laws," he said.
Prof. Renate Ludanyi, director of the school's German Studies center, says that according to her grade books Mr. Lanza was a student in her class during the spring of 2009, but her recollections of him are faint. "If at all I remember a quiet kid, a quiet young man sitting by the door," she said. He dropped out of the class before final grades were distributed, but she says she does not know the reason. She characterized his grade to that point as "medium to not very good." 
Her inability to remember much about him offered some evidence, she said, of what he was like at the time. "Here or there you get a student who's angry," she said. "He certainly was not a violent person or not an angry person, or I would have noticed that. My classes are approximately 20 people, not more. Usually I know my students by name. I have conversations with them. He went by unnoticed."

 4:29 P.M. | Lanza and Mother Attended Firing Range Together 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has determined that Adam Lanza and his mother, Nancy, visited firing ranges together and separately in recent years, according to a federal law enforcement official. 
The official said the agency knew of only one occasion in which they had attended a firing range together. It has uncovered evidence that they both fired weapons at ranges, although it was not clear whether they had both fired weapons when they attended the range together. 
The official would not disclose the name or locations of the ranges. 
Ms. Lanza owned at least five guns. Mr. Lanza shot her dead with one of them before his rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
The A.T.F. has roughly 30 agents and other people in Connecticut investigating the shooting, according to the official. 
They are interviewing firearm dealers in Connecticut to "get a clear picture of what activities took place" before the shooting, according to the official.

 4:00 P.M. | Masked Man Arrested in 'Breach of Peace' Near School 
The police in Ridgefield, Conn. said they arrested a man who caused school lockdowns in two towns after he was spotted dressed all in black, wearing a mask and carrying what appeared to be a weapon towards Branchville Elementary School in Ridgefield.
Schools in Ridgefield, 20 miles southwest of Newtown, and three schools in neighboring Redding were locked down for less than an hour Monday morning, and students on their way to Branchville were diverted to a nearby middle school. 
The police said the object the man was carrying looked like a samurai sword, but turned out to be an umbrella. It's not clear why he was wearing all black and a mask.
The man, Wilfredo Seda, 22, of Redding, was charged by the Ridgefield police with breach of peace.
Messages left on Mr. Seda's home phone were not returned.

 3:41 P.M. | Fears of Stigmatizing People With Autism 
Amid reports from neighbors and classmates that the gunman in the shooting rampage in, Newtown, Conn., had an autism variant known as Asperger syndrome, adults with the condition and parents of children with the diagnosis are fighting what they fear may be a growing impression that it is associated with premeditated violence. 
Individuals with autism spectrum disorders, who are often bullied in school and in the workplace, frequently do suffer from depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. A divorce mediator who met with the parents of Adam Lanza, the gunman, during their divorce told The Associated Press that the couple had said that their son's condition had been diagnosed as Asperger syndrome.
But experts say there is no evidence that they are more likely than any other group to commit violent crimes.
 "Aggression in autism spectrum disorders is almost never directed to people outside the family or immediate caregivers, is almost never planned, and almost never involves weapons,'' said Dr. Catherine Lord, director of the Center for Autism and the Developing Brainat NewYork-Presbyterian hospital. "Each of these aspects of the current case is more common in other populations than autism."
Dr. Lord said that in an unpublished review of data tracking several hundred adults with autism over at least the past five years, she and fellow researchers had found no use of weapons. Among more than 1,000 older children and adolescents in that study, only 2 percent were reported by parents to have used an implement aggressively toward a nonfamily member - fewer than in a control group. That finding was repeated in another set of data that she analyzed over the weekend at the request of The New York Times. 
But some of the Twitter messages, electronic postings and media reports in the aftermath of the massacre that has horrified the nation have not reflected that characterization of autism. 
"Try curing the real disease, Autism, not the N.R.A.," wrote one individual on Twitter on Sunday night in response to calls for tighter gun control laws. 
 "Something's missing in the brain, the capacity for empathy, for social connection, which leaves the person suffering from this condition prone to serious depression and anxiety,'' said one psychologist on CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight."
In a widely circulated defense of the empathic powers of her 11-year-old son, who has an Asperger diagnosis, Emily Willingham, a science blogger, wrote that "he can't bear to watch people crack tree nuts, like pecans, because being something of a tree nut himself, he feels pain on behalf of the nuts." 
On the DailyKos, a blogger who identified himself as having Asperger syndrome worried that the actions of Mr. Lanza, 20, who killed 20 young children and 7 adults, including his mother, and was described by a classmate as having a "very flat affect," might be how "people with this disability are defined in the popular imagination.'' 
His own flat affect, he explained,does not mean that he has no feelings: "Our emotions don't naturally show on our faces,'' he wrote. "This is perhaps the most frustrating part of the Asperger experience, because people think you're not feeling when you may be feeling even more strongly than they are.'' 
The roots of autism, a developmental condition characterized by social impairment, communication difficulty and repetitive patterns of behavior, are not well understood. But it is a problem in processing social information, not an intrinsic inability to empathize, that underlies the condition, experts said.
"The media's continued mention of a possible diagnosis of Asperger syndrome implies a connection between that and the heinous crime committed by the shooter,'' said Lori S. Shery, president of the Asperger Syndrome Education Network, an advocacy group in New Jersey. "They may have just as well said, 'Adam Lanza, age 20, was reported to have had brown hair.'"
According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate, one in 88 children in the United States have an autistic spectrum disorder, whose symptoms range in severity. For a time, it seemed almost faddish to be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, or high-functioning autism, a condition in which individuals have normal or above-average language skills and intelligence but struggle to observe social rules, like when to make eye contact or to ask a reciprocal question, and to intuit the feelings of others.
Some young adults with the condition proudly branded themselves "Aspies.'' Temple Grandin, the renowned animal scientist who has the condition, was played by Claire Danes in a 2010 HBO biopic; Craig Newmark, the founder of CraigsList, speculated that he would qualify for the diagnosis; and armchair diagnoses were frequently made of Bill Gates and Sheldon Cooper, the theoretical physicist star of the CBS sitcom "The Big Bang Theory.''
The term, said New York Magazine in a recent issue, has come to denote anyone who is "some murky hybrid of egghead and aloof.'' 
But if there has been some easing of stigma for people with autism in a world that places a high premium on being socially adept, autism advocates worry that affected individuals may now have another reason to avoid disclosing their condition to teachers, employers and community members - often the first step in raising awareness and obtaining helpful accommodations.
 "When I tell someone I'm on the autism spectrum, there's always a fear that they will judge me in a negative way because of it,'' said Alex Plank, founder of WrongPlanet.net, a Web site where many individuals with Asperger syndrome have poured out their concerns in recent days. "Fortunately, people think 'Temple Grandin' or even 'Bill Gates' and make a connection in their mind. I'd hate to have someone think 'Adam Lanza.'"
 Some of the commenters on Mr. Plank's site reflected an insider's knowledge of life with an autism spectrum disorder:one wondered why the public school system was not providing Mr. Lanza with a "transition to adulthood" program through age 21, as required by federal law?
 One young man worried about spending Christmas with distant relatives who might have new prejudices about autism. Others used the outlet to express a sentiment that superseded all others.
"Words cannot express the depth of the pain I feel for those left behind who have to bear this loss,'' wrote Lee Anderson, 20, of Cookville, Tenn., whose WrongPlanet profile lists his diagnosis as "Have Aspergers" and his occupation as "Homeschool Student/Paintball Player." 
 "I wish there was some greater way I could help.''

 3:22 P.M. | Data on Lanza's Computer Might Not Be Recoverable 
Investigators recovered a computer from Adam Lanza's house, but it is so badly damaged that they are not optimistic they will be able to get any information from it, a law enforcement official said Monday.
The F.B.I., which has more expertise in computer forensics than Connecticut's state forensic laboratory, has been part of the effort to recover data from the computer, the official said.
"It looked like he took steps to damage it, he smashed it, it was smashed," the official said. "It was the computer he was using. It was the hard drive and it was damaged to the point that we took a look at it and couldn't get anything off it." 
Earlier Monday, a Connecticut State Police spokesman, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said that investigators "didn't have any difficulty collecting evidence at all" from Mr. Lanza's home.
Lieutenant Vance said he was not aware of anything missing that he would expect to be there, and not aware of any steps Mr. Lanza took to hamper evidence collection before his rampage, though the lieutenant cautioned that he was not privy to everything seized.

 2:58 P.M. | Eulogy for Noah Pozner, Wonderful Son, Loving Brother 
Here is the eulogy delivered at the funeral of Noah Pozner, 6, by his uncle Alexis Haller, of Woodinville, Wash.:
On Friday, Dec. 14, we tragically lost a most beloved member of our family. Noah was a 6-year-old little boy, and he was so dear to all of our hearts.
Words cannot express the unfathomable loss we feel.
Noah was a wonderful son and a loving brother. He was kind, caring, smart, funny and sometimes even a little mischievous. He liked to tell his sisters that he worked in a taco factory; when they asked him how he got to work, he would give them a funny look as if to say he knew something that they didn't.
Noah was a little kid. He loved animals, video games and Mario Brothers. He was already a very good reader, and had just bought a Ninjago book at a book fair that he was really excited about reading. He was also very excited about going to a birthday party he had been invited to. It was to take place on Saturday, Dec. 15.
Noah loved his family dearly, especially his mom, his dad, his big sisters, Danielle and Sophia; his big brother, Michael; and his dear twin, Arielle. He called Arielle his best friend, and she was - and always had been.
If Noah had not been taken from us, he would have become a great man. He would been a wonderful husband and a loving father. He would have been a backbone of our family for years to come. His loss, and our loss, are deep indeed.
It is unspeakably tragic that none of us can bring Noah back. We would go to the ends of the earth to do so, but none of us can.
What we can do is carry Noah within us, always. We can remember the joy he brought to us. We can hold his memory close to our hearts. We can treasure him forever. And all of us, including the family, the community, the country and the world, can honor Noah by loving each other and taking care of each other. That's what Noah would have wanted.
Noah, we love you so much, we miss you dearly, and we will never, ever forget you.
 2:50 P.M. | Outside a Funeral Home, Grief and Added Security 
FAIRFIELD, Conn. - Outside the funeral home where the body of Noah Pozner, age 6, lay, two bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled and police officers stood guard.
Lt. James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department said non-specific threats of protests at the funeral home and "stupid comments" on the Internet and on social media prompted a large police presence on Monday. 
Inside, the Pozner family greeted mourners from their temple in Newtown, Adath Israel, as others from surrounding communities - strangers brought together by tragedy - also paid respects.
Rabbi Yakov Barros drove two hours from the Catskills to add his voice to those offering comfort.
"There are not many flowers - it's a Jewish funeral," he said, "but there's a lot of warmth in there, tremendous warmth."
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy was inside, an aide to the governor said, as was Senator Richard Blumenthal.
Lieutenant Perez said he had been inside and had spoken with the family. "I can't even put words to the feelings that I felt in there," he said. "To see it be a child, it's just beyond . . . I didn't have any words for the family."

 2:36 P.M. | California Man Arrested in School Threat on Facebook 
Los Angeles - A Southern California man was arrested Sunday, accused of making threats against local schools on Facebook, the Los Angeles police said on Monday.
The man, Kyle Bangayan, 24, was arrested at his parents' home in Pomona, east of Los Angeles, after the police received a tip that he had posted threats on Facebook that he would shoot up schools. While the threats were not directed at any specific school, the police said, they did reference Friday's school shooting in Connecticut.
The police also seized nine firearms from the residence, including rifles, a shotgun, handguns and ammunition. No weapons or related evidence was found at Mr. Bangayan's own residence. 
"It was a general threat against after-school tutoring companies, not against a Los Angeles Unified school," said Commander Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. "We are going to take every one of these threats very serious in light of what happened." 
Charlie Beck, the Los Angeles police chief, was also expected to announce plans later on Monday to increase police presence at the city's public schools.

 2:20 P.M. | Bloomberg, Angered, Demands Action on Guns 
Video of Mayor Bloomberg News Conference
A visibly angry Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg demanded on Monday that the nation's lawmakers pursue aggressive new rules to curb the use of guns and firearms, decrying the Connecticut elementary school shootings as an outrage and stating, bluntly, that "we are killing each other."
"We are the only industrialized country that has this problem. In the whole world, the only one," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in New York's City Hall, where he was surrounded by more than two dozen men and women whose family members had been injured or killed by guns.
"Somehow or another, we've come to think that getting re-elected is more important than saving lives, that political power is more important than saving lives," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Enough."
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has started a super PAC to influence political contests around the country, suggested that he would not hold back on using his personal fortune to combat the spending of pro-gun lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association. "I'm going to do what I think is appropriate to try to impact the dialogue," he said. "Shame on me if I don't." 
An engineer by trade who prides himself on keeping a disinterested approach to his job, Mr. Bloomberg displayed an unusual degree of emotion on Monday, loosening his tie at one point and speaking in a gravelly monotone. He cited a litany of statistics on gun violence, including an estimate that 400,000 Americans have been killed by guns since 1968, more than died in World War II. 
Mr. Bloomberg appeared particularly moved as he watched a series of videos, produced by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national group that he co-chairs, that include pleas for increased gun control laws from relatives of victims of gun violence. Several of the men and women featured in the ads, which were released on the Web on Monday, stood beside Mr. Bloomberg at his lectern.

Mr. Bloomberg is a longtime advocate of gun control, and he laid out several policy goals, starting with the passage of a bill in Congress that would close a loophole allowing weapons to be purchased at gun shows and through private sellers without a federal background check. 
The mayor also repeated his call for a federal ban on the sale of heavy-duty weapons, including the types of assault rifles and high-capacity magazines that were used by Adam Lanza, the shooter who killed 20 children and 6 adults in Newtown, Conn., on Friday. The mayor also called for gun trafficking to be considered a felony under federal law.
"If this moment passes into memory without action in Washington, it will be a stain upon our nation's commitment to protecting the innocent, including our children," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
Expanding on remarks he made over the weekend on "Meet the Press," Mr. Bloomberg once again offered a scathing assessment of national politicians that he described as "cowed" by gun lobbyists.
On Monday, the mayor dismissed the suggestion that the fiscal cliff negotiations in Congress would distract from attempts to pass gun control legislation, saying, "If the Congress and the president can't focus on two things at once, who on earth did we elect?"
Mr. Bloomberg suggested that the young age of most of the victims of the Newtown killings could be an impetus for change.
"When you see 6- and 7-year-olds as the victims, somehow or another, it goes to your heart a little more," the mayor said. "My God, what kind of a society do you have?"

 2:33 P.M. | A Boy Cannot Believe His Friend Is Gone 
NEWTOWN, Conn. - After Jack Pinto's funeral, Nolan Krieger, 8, walked out of Honan Funeral Home rubbing his eyes.
"I used to do everything with him," Nolan said of Jack, who was 6. " We liked to wrestle. We played Wii. We just played all the time. I can't believe I'm never going to see him again."
With that, he headed for his parents' car, and the trip to the cemetery.

 2:24 P.M. | Eulogy for Jack Pinto, 6: Proud to Be a Little Brother 
NEWTOWN, Conn. - Here are more excerpts from the eulogy Mary Radatovich delivered for Jack Pinto, age 6. on Monday. 
From the time he could move, Jack wanted nothing more than to catch up with his big brother Ben. He was riding a scooter like a pro at 2 years old and then a two-wheeler shortly after.
He would get on Ben's nerves, as all little brothers do, but the truth is that he was a lot of fun to play with. He would have followed Ben anywhere. Now he will be with you, Ben, for the rest of your life. Think of him every time you catch a football, hit a baseball or hug your mom and dad. He was so proud that you were his big brother and I know that you will continue to live your life in a way that will make him proud.
Dean, Tricia and Ben, you are surrounded by love from all of your friends and your precious family. We will be right by your side through the dark days ahead. You have always been the ones who will help everyone else - this is the time for us to take care of you.
We love you so much and we all love Jack.
We cannot but feel the pain of losing him, but we will never forget the joy of loving him.

 1:58 P.M. | Eulogy for Jack Pinto, 6: 'I Am Something Special' 
NEWTOWN, Conn. - A woman who gave a eulogy at the funeral of Jack Pinto, age 6, on Monday was kind enough to share it with us immediately afterward. Her name is Mary Radatovich, she is a friend of the Pinto family, and here are some of the things she said.
From the moment Jack arrived in this world, he commanded all the attention in a room. Who could ignore that beautiful energy, the sparkle in his eye, or that spirit that clearly said, "I am here and I am something special"?
As soon as Jack started to move it was, "Look out, world! Here I come!" there were moments that seemed so scary at the time yet now seem so mundane.

 1:33 P.M. | Friends Describe a Mother Devoted to Her 'Troubled' Son 
On a morning television program on Monday, friends of Nancy Lanza - the mother of the gunman in the Connecticut shootings, and his first victim - described her as devoted to her son Adam, who shot and killed 20 students and 6 adults in Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday.
One of her friends, Russell Hanoman, said that she had taught Adam Lanza how to use the guns she owned. "She told me she had wanted to introduce them to the guns to teach, especially Adam, a sense of responsibility," hesaid on the NBC News program "Today." "Guns require a lot of respect, and she really tried to instill that responsibility within him, and he took to it. He loved being careful with them. I mean, it was a source of pride."
Another friend, John Bergquist, said that shooting was "one of her hobbies." 
"It wasn't her main hobby," he said. "She loved the arts, culture. She loved the finer things in life. She loved to go to Red Sox games, and that's the Nancy I knew.''
 Mr. Hanoman described Mr. Lanza as "clearly a troubled child."
"We know that he had Asperger's - Nancy mentioned that to me several times," he said. "He was very calm, very withdrawn, much like most kids with Asperger's are. I mean, he was typical in that regard.''
Another friend, Ellen Adriani, said there were times when Mr. Lanza "would isolate himself, things like that."
 Ms. Lanza "was very conscious of how she would react to him," Ms. Adriani said. "For an example, one time he was ill, and he just didn't want her in the room. So she stayed outside all night on the carpet of his bedroom, and he periodically would say, 'Are you there? Are you there?' And she'd always say, 'Yes I'm here.' So he wanted her there to some degree, but not in his exact, immediate space."

 1:21 P.M. | Cuomo Pledges Gun Legislation in New York 
ALBANY - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Monday that there were "significant flaws and significant loopholes" in New York's existing ban on assault weapons, and he suggested that he would propose new gun-control measures in his State of the State address next month, though he did not offer specifics.
"There's no question that the law needs to be improved in my mind," Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters in Albany. He cited as an example a provision in the state's ban on sales of high-capacity ammunition magazines that allows their sale if they were manufactured before September 13, 1994, calling it a "glaring omission."
New York's assault weapons ban permits the type of semiautomatic rifle used in Newtown, Conn., though such guns can be configured in a number of different ways, which would make some versions legal and some not. The State Assembly has approved a tightening of the ban four times since 2008, but it has met resistance in the State Senate.
At a news conference at the Capitol, the governor said the most effective way to combat gun violence was for Congress to take action, because guns can easily be transported between states. He said he hoped, as a first step, Congress would reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons.
"The most efficient, effective vehicle is a federal law," Mr. Cuomo said. "We have some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, as does Connecticut. But you can buy a gun in another state and drive several miles and that's that."
The governor described the problem of gun violence as a multifaceted one, saying lawmakers should also examine mental health services, and suggesting the popularity of violent video games played a role as well.
"I think there's a culture of violence, especially among young people," Mr. Cuomo said. "Maybe it's always been that way - you know, it was always 'cops and robbers,' or playing war games. But I think it's a more intense culture of violence. Some of the games, some of the videos, make it so graphic, and they're so pervasive, I believe that's part of this."

 1:21 P.M. | 'No Connection' Between Shooter and School, Police Say 
There was "no connection" between Adam Lanza and Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Connecticut State Police spokesman said Monday afternoon. There had been earlier reports that Mr. Lanza had attended the school as a child. It was not immediately clear if "no connection" meant that Mr. Lanza had not attended the school.
As the investigation into the shootings unfolds, the spokesman, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said at a news conference that investigators "did seize significant evidence" at the home Mr. Lanza shared with his mother.
He declined to elaborate, though, and when pressed by reporters about whether it was computer evidence, said only, "If there is computer evidence - and I strongly say that, if - we do have the computer crimes team in our state forensic laboratory that are expert at retrieving any kind of evidence and data."
Lieutenant Vance also said that two people had been wounded in their lower extremities in the rampage. Previous reports said that there was only one wounded survivor. 
Toward the end of the news conference, a reporter asked the lieutenant a blunt question. "A lot of people watching at home say, you know, there's no mystery here anymore," she said, "but there's so much effort being put into the investigation and they might say there'll never be justice, so who are the answers for that you're getting?"
"The answers are for the poor victims, the families, the people of Connecticut who need to know and see a clear picture as to exactly what happened here," Lieutenant Vance said. "There are many people, including first responders, including town residents, including people right in this audience, who have broken hearts over this."
 "We have to do everything it takes to uncover every bit of evidence," he added, "to paint a clear picture of exactly how and why this tragedy occurred."

 1:07 P.M. | MSNBC's Joe Scarborough Reverses Position on Gun Rights 
Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, a former four-term member of Congress from Florida and staunch supporter of gun rights, opened his "Morning Joe" program on Monday with a 10-minute monologue, calling for stricter measures on gun control in response to the massacre in Connecticut, saying "from this day forward, nothing can ever be the same again." 
 "You know me," Mr. Scarborough said, looking directly into the camera. "I am a conservative Republican who received the N.R.A.'s highest ratings over four terms in Congress. I saw this debate over guns as a powerful symbolic struggle between individual rights and government control." 
He added that things have changed now with "violent, mind-numbing video games and gruesome Hollywood movies that dangerously desensitize those with mental health challenges. And then add in military-styled weapons and high-capacity magazines to that equation, and tragedy can never be too far behind." 
Mr. Scarborough had invited Joe Manchin III, the pro-gun-rights West Virginia senator who drew attention in 2010 after running a commercial that showed him firing a rifle at an environmental bill, to the program on Monday morning. Senator Manchin announced that he was open to restrictions on guns. 
As our colleagues, Jeremy W. Peters and John H. Cushman Jr. report, politicians, lobbyists and policy experts continued on Monday to discuss the prospect of new limitations on firearms. 
On the "Morning Joe" program, Senator Manchin, a Democrat and an avid hunter with an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association, said "everything should be on the table" as gun control is debated in the coming weeks and months. "I don't know anybody in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle," Mr. Manchin said on the program. 
Mr. Scarborough said that it was time for Washington to stop trying to win "endless wars overseas while we're losing the war at home."
"Though entrenched special interests are going to try to muddy the cause in the coming days, the cause of this sickening mass shooting - like the others - is no longer a mystery to common-sense Americans. And blessedly, there are more common-sense Americans than there are special interests, even if it doesn't always seem that way."

 12:43 P.M. | Back at School, Facing a New Reality 
All over the country, students and parents returned to schools on Monday to confront a new, more fragile reality. At several school districts, armed police officers greeted visitors as education officials re-evaluated their security procedures. At many more, teachers navigated the tricky business of answering their charges' questions about the tragedy.
In Ridgefield, Conn., where the police received a call about a "suspicious" stranger dressed in all black walking around a local train station toward Branchville Elementary School just before 8 a.m., schools immediately went into lockdown. Buses carrying students to the school were diverted to a nearby middle school while police officers searched the area around the train station and school. They were allowed to trickle back around noon, after the police determined it was safe. 
The Ridgefield schools, just a half-hour drive from Newtown, were already on edge. The superintendent, Deborah Low, announced over the weekend that security guards would be stationed at every elementary school and one middle school for the rest of the year, and that an armed police officer would stand outside each school on Monday. Marked police cars were to patrol around all the schools throughout the week.
In western Pennsylvania, a judge issued a court order over the weekend to allow school police officers in two districts in Butler County to carry guns on Monday. The order expedited a process that had begun a week ago, when one of the districts voted to arm its school police - a measure that otherwise would have taken months to implement, according to The Associated Press.
Public schools around New York City already require visitors to sign in and show identification to school security guards. But on Monday, principals were asking the Department of Education for heightened security and holding meetings to discuss drills and what, if anything, to tell the children.
At Public School 261 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, on Monday morning, staff members convened for two hastily scheduled security meetings, meetings filled with questions that had taken on a sudden urgency: Where were the school's evacuation sites, its safety zones? What was the difference between a hard and a soft lockdown? What kinds of drills could the school run to practice for the possibility of an emergency during recess, when most students would be outside?
"We're living in a different world than we were last Monday," the principal, Zipporiah Mills, told her staff.

 12:49 P.M. | Outside Funeral Home, Mourning a 6-Year-Old Giants Fan 
NEWTOWN, Conn. - At Honan Funeral Home in Newtown, mourners streamed in carrying colorful flower arrangements and posters plastered with the image of Jack Pinto, a 6-year-old who loved to wrestle, loved football and almost always had a smile on his face, friends said.
"Jack was so full of life and energy, he always made us laugh," said Jessica Ward of Newtown, whose son Cameron was one of Jack's best friends. "He couldn't wait to get to the next thing. He was always jumping up and down, saying 'Let's do this, let's do that.' He was just full of excitement and wonder."
Shannon Krieger, a close friend of the Pinto family, held a poster board with photos of Jack in one hand and wiped tears with the other as she headed into the funeral home, a white Colonial with black shutters decorated with Christmas wreaths and bows. 
Ms. Krieger said that the outpouring of support for the family "has been so beautiful," and she added, "I can't believe what the New York Giants and Victor Cruz did for Jack." 
Mr. Cruz, the Giants' star wide receiver and Jack's idol, played yesterday's game in shoes on which he'd written "Jack Pinto 'My Hero'" and "R.I.P. Jack Pinto." 
Jack is reportedly being buried in a Victor Cruz jersey.
Jack Pinto will, in fact, be laid to rest in a Victor Cruz jersey. We will have more on this a bit later.

Ms. Krieger said her family regularly went on vacations with the Pintos to places like Walt Disney World and Martha's Vineyard.
"And we were just planning a trip to - " tears overtook her and she could not finish her sentence.

 11:34 A.M. | The Lanza Divorce Papers 
The divorce between the parents of Adam Lanza, the man the authorities say was responsible for Friday's shooting rampage at a Connecticut elementary school, provided generously for Mr. Lanza's care and offered no clues about any medical or mental health issues involving the man accused of carrying out the slaughter.
According to the divorce papers on file at Stamford Superior Court, the former Nancy Jean Champion filed for divorce from Peter John Lanza in late 2008 citing "irreconcilable differences." The action was classified as a "limited contested" action, meaning that "only financial or property issues" were being contested. The couple married in Kingston, N.H., on June 6, 1981, and had Ryan John Lanza on April 10, 1988, and Adam Peter Lanza on April 22, 1992. 
The court required both parties to attend parenting classes, and both showed proof of completion before the divorce was finalized in September 2009. According to the court-approved settlement, the couple shared joint custody over their minor child at the time, Adam, though his mother was empowered to "make all decisions with respect to the minor child after having consulted with the Father" and was given ultimate authority in the event of any disagreement. 
Adam Lanza was expected to "reside primarily with the Mother," while the father was promised "free and liberal access to the minor Child at the mutual convenience of the Wife and the Husband." 
The sweeping settlement they entered into provided generously for the wife and children and covered many details of the family's lives, down to the distribution of their pair of season tickets to nine Boston Red Sox games each year, according to the records. Mr. Lanza awarded the family home in Newtown to his former wife. He was also obligated to provide $240,000 a year in alimony in 2010 and increasing amounts in each year up through 2015, when the annual alimony was set at $298,800. After 2015 through 2023, the alimony figure was to be adjusted "by any increase in the cost of living," and between 2024 and the date of Mr. Lanza's retirement, the schedule called for the wife to receive $155,000 annually. 
According to an affidavit in the file, Mr. Lanza was the sole breadwinner at the time of the divorce, reporting gross income of $8,556 a week at the time of the divorce. 
Mr. Lanza was also responsible for the two children's four-year college education and graduate school programs and promised to "provide a car for their son Adam, if and when he shall wish to have one. He also promised to maintain a life insurance policy naming the wife as the beneficiary for $3 million through 2023, and $2 million thereafter.
The agreement also required Mr. Lanza to provide health, medical and dental insurance for the children, although the wife was obliged to pay "all unreimbursed medical, surgical, hospital, optical, psychiatric, psychological and nursing expenses, the cost of prescription drugs, dental and orthodontia expenses." 
The agreement also dictates that the couple "shall each be entitled to an equal share of the family photographs, home movies and other memorabilia."

 11:52 A.M. | Preparing Quietly for a 6-Year-Old's Funeral 
FAIRFIELD, Conn. - By 11 a.m., relatives and other mourners of Noah Pozner, 6, began gathering for a private service at a funeral home in Fairfield, Conn., about 25 miles south of Newtown. 
On a tree in front of the funeral home, Abraham L. Green and Sons, a handmade sign read "Our Hearts Are With You Noah." Bouquets of flowers had been laid at the base of the tree, and white balloons lined the street.
A public memorial was set to begin at 1 p.m. 
Early in the morning, workers at the funeral home readied the large back viewing room, shooing the growing number of reporters from the parking lot into an adjacent grassy island.
After the services, Noah is to be buried at B'Nai Israel Cemetery in Monroe, a slow drive north that on Monday was peppered with stone walls, garlanded fences and damp flags hanging at half mast.
The cemetery is a modest patch of land set off from a quiet road and bounded by a row of pine trees. The family would soon gather to bury their too-young son among the dozens of tombstones that described decades of life - an end no one anticipates, yet every parent now dreads.
The land there had settled into a fall quiet early on Monday. A single bird was the only sound.

 10:57 A.M. | Report of Armed Man Has Ridgefield Schools on Lockdown 
Schools in Ridgefield, Conn., about 20 miles southwest of Newtown, were put in lockdown Monday morning after someone called the police to report that they had seen a "suspicious" man possibly carrying a weapon near an elementary school, the authorities said.
No one has been arrested, the police said, though the Norwalk, Conn., newspaper The Hour reported that the Ridgefield police interviewed a man. 
The man was reportedly seen near Branchville Elementary School around 8 a.m., the police in neighboring Wilton said. 
The school day had not yet started at the Branchville school, so the police closed it, and students who arrived were taken to another school, the Ridgefield police said.
Other schools are open and are on lockdown with students inside, the Ridgefield police said.

 "Dear President Obama,
 The Newtown community is so thankful that you are coming to help us heal. In times of adversity, it is reassuring to know that we have a strong leader to help us recover.

 -Bob Pattison, Teacher." 
 President Obama responded on the board: 
 "You're in our thoughts and prayers." 
An earlier version of this post gave the wrong name of the boy whose funeral Gov. Dannel P. Malloy attended Monday. He attended Noah Pozner's funeral, not Jack Pinto's.

HEADLINE: A Big, and Risky, Energy Bet

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
RAS LAFFAN INDUSTRIAL CITY, Qatar -- The compact assembly of towers, tubes and tanks that make up the Oryx natural gas processing plant is almost lost in a vast petrochemical complex that rises here like a hazy mirage from a vast ocean of sand.
But what is occurring at Oryx is a particular kind of alchemy that has tantalized scientists for nearly a century with prospects of transforming the energy landscape. Sasol, a chemical and synthetic fuels company based in South Africa, is converting natural gas to diesel fuel using a variation of a technology developed by German scientists in the 1920s.
Performing such chemical wizardry is exceedingly costly. But executives at Sasol and a partner, Qatar's state-owned oil company, are betting that natural gas, which is abundant here, will become the dominant global fuel source over the next 50 years, oil will become scarcer and more expensive and global demand for transport fuels will grow. 
Sasol executives say the company believes so strongly in the promise of this technology that this month, it announced plans to spend up to $14 billion to build the first gas-to-liquids plant in the United States, in Louisiana, supported by more than $2 billion in state incentives. A shale drilling boom in that region in the last five years has produced a glut of cheap gas, and the executives say Sasol can tap that supply to make diesel and other refined products at competitive prices.
Marjo Louw, president of Sasol Qatar, says that his company can produce diesel fuel that burns cleaner, costs less and creates less greenhouse gas pollution than fuel derived from crude oil.
''We believe the planets are aligned for G.T.L.,'' Mr. Louw said during a recent tour of the Oryx plant. ''Other players -- much bigger players -- will follow.''
Perhaps. So far, however, the record for converting gas to liquids is spotty.
The newest and largest plant in operation, Royal Dutch Shell's giant Pearl plant, also in Qatar, cost the leviathan sum of $19 billion, more than three times its original projected cost, and has been plagued with unexpected maintenance problems. BP and ConocoPhillips built and briefly operated demonstration plants in Alaska and Oklahoma, but stopped short of full development of the technology. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips announced plans to build giant plants in Qatar, but backed out, putting their capital instead into terminals to export liquefied natural gas.
Today only a handful of gas-to-liquids plants operate commercially, in Malaysia, South Africa and Qatar. Together they produce only a bit more than 200,000 barrels of fuels and lubricants a day -- equivalent to less than 1 percent of global diesel demand.
''The reason you see so few G.T.L. plants is the economics are challenged at best,'' said William M. Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president of corporate strategic planning. ''We do not see it being a relevant source of fuels over the next 20 years.''
Many analysts and industry insiders say the technology makes sense only when oil and gas supplies and prices are far out of balance, as they are today in Qatar and the United States. When oil and gas come into alignment, gas-to-liquids ventures will become white elephants, these skeptics say. Environmentalists also say that the huge energy inputs required to transform natural gas into diesel or other fuels negate any greenhouse gas benefits.
Until recently, the method used to convert natural gas or coal to liquid fuel -- known as the Fischer-Tropsch process after the Germans who invented it -- had been used only by pariah nations desperate for transportation fuels when they had little or no oil available. For decades, South Africa defended its system of apartheid from international oil embargoes by producing synthetic oil from its rich coal resources. Nazi Germany did the same to fuel its military machine in World War II.
But with North Africa and the Middle East chronically unstable and natural gas cheap and plentiful in the United States, some say the technology is now an enticing option to produce various fuels without importing a drop of oil.
Shell may soon announce a tentative site for a gas-to-liquids plant on the Gulf Coast of the United States. Given what the company learned from its Qatar plant, executives say it would reduce costs in any new one by using different types of valves and alloys.
But Ken Lawrence, Shell's vice president for investor relations in North America, said the company was still two years away from a final decision on an American plant.
That leaves Sasol in the forefront of the gas-to-liquids effort.
Sasol is building a gas-to-liquids plant in Uzbekistan with the Malaysian oil company Petronas. It is working with Chevron to build another plant in Nigeria. The company says that a plan to build a plant in Canada has been shelved until after the Louisiana project, which could cost $11 billion to $14 billion, the largest single investment proposed in the state.
''It can be a game-changer,'' David Constable, Sasol's chief executive, said in an interview. He said the United States was a logical place for gas-to-liquids to take off because of the availability of cheap gas, the proximity of large markets and the availability of trained labor, modern industrial shops and friendly state governments along the Gulf Coast.
The American plant will build on knowledge the company acquired at the Oryx plant in Qatar.
The heart of the Oryx plant is a pair of 164-foot reactor towers that contain a patented system for transforming purified natural gas into so-called long-chain carbon compounds that can be refined into liquid fuels.
''Gas bubbles up through a cobalt slurry bed, and out comes the good stuff -- the sellable products,'' said Etienne Rademeyer, chief operations officer at the Oryx plant.
The process is challenging and complex. First a synthetic gas is made from pure oxygen and methane, the main component of natural gas, which is cleansed of sulfur, metals and other impurities, under intense pressure and heat. Then the synthetic gas is put in giant reactors that make a synthetic crude through the Fischer-Tropsch process. The process essentially forces heated synthetic gas to react with a catalyst, typically cobalt, to convert into a liquid hydrocarbon. Finally that liquid is refined into one fuel or another.
The process is far more complex than that at a typical refinery, so the plant is much more expensive to build and operate. Alfred Luaces, a refining specialist at the consultancy IHS, said a conventional oil refinery could be built for $50,000 per barrel of capacity, less than half of what Sasol says it is willing to spend on the proposed Louisiana plant.
The plant here is a maze of refining towers, reactors, evaporators, pipes and storage tanks. It employs about 120 workers from more than 30 countries to produce about 32,000 barrels of liquid fuel a day, less than a third of the amount it hopes to produce in Louisiana.
Rick Manner, a vice president at consultancy KBC Advanced Technologies who has contributed to gas-to-liquids studies for Sasol and other companies, estimated that the projects must keep capital costs at $100,000 for every barrel a day of production capacity to be worthwhile economically at current prices of about $100 a barrel for oil and $4 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas.
By that formula, Shell needed to cap costs at its plant in Qatar, which can make up to 140,000 barrels a day, at $14 billion. Instead, the project has cost at least $19 billion, which suggests that it will need a sustained crude price of about $125 a barrel, or lower natural gas prices, to be economic, Mr. Manner said. ''There's not a big future in it,'' he said.
Shell executives said they could make money in Qatar, though they would not be more specific except to estimate that the Pearl plant, including its adjoining liquefied natural gas facility, can generate $4 billion in annual cash flow from operations at an oil price of $70 a barrel, which determines at what price the refined products can be sold. ''It's a good solid project,'' said Marvin E. Odum, president of Shell Oil Company. ''We're very pleased with it.''
Mr. Louw, Sasol's Qatar president, said that the Oryx plant was designed to be profitable with oil at $25 a barrel. That implies a very low long-term price for the natural gas feedstock. He would not specify what Sasol pays its Qatari partner for gas, but he said it was ''not zero.''
Outside gas-rich Qatar, natural gas and diesel prices can be unpredictable, and if enough companies build gas-to-liquids plants or find other uses for natural gas, gas prices could rise with demand.
And environmental concerns exist. A 2008 Carnegie Mellon study estimated that plants in Qatar and Malaysia produced fuels that generated 20 to 25 percent more carbon emissions than conventional petroleum-based liquid fuels because the production process consumed so much energy.
''We're not talking about an environmental solution to the carbon problem,'' said Simon Mui, a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''G.T.L. will likely make the problem worse, unless the industry adopts effective safeguards on drilling and additional pollution controls on these refineries. Those are big ifs.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Optimistic About Ties With China

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Gary F. Locke, the United States ambassador to China for the past 16 months and the first American of Chinese descent to hold that post, spoke optimistically on Monday about the deepening relationship between the United States and China despite differences over issues including North Korea, human rights abuses and China's growing military assertiveness in Asia. 
He also said that the new Chinese Communist Party chief and civilian commander of the military, Xi Jinping, seemed ''more casual and at ease with people'' than his predecessors but that much remained unclear about Mr. Xi, one of seven members of the standing committee of the party Politburo, the highest authority in the country. ''We don't have a great sense of the policies of Xi Jinping,'' Mr. Locke said.
A former commerce secretary and governor of Washington State, he spoke at a sold-out forum at the Asia Society's New York headquarters in which he discussed the recent history of United States-China ties with Orville Schell, a China scholar and director of the group's Center on U.S.-China Relations.
Mr. Locke said that in the 40 years since President Richard M. Nixon moved to normalize relations with China, both countries had become inextricably linked to each other economically and that the relationship was bound to grow even more interdependent in the future. China has become the United States' most important export market outside North America, he said, and more than one million American jobs depend on the sale of American goods and services to China.
''Our economies are so intertwined, and Chinese leaders know that,'' Mr. Locke said. Chinese leaders have also grown more sophisticated, he said, in distinguishing differences within the American system of government, including the executive and legislative branches. ''I think they're beginning to understand that more and more,'' he said.
Mr. Locke also said Americans should welcome Chinese businesses that want to invest in the United States, much as Japan and Korea had done as their economies industrialized. ''We want that for China, too,'' he said.
The arrival of Mr. Locke in China in August 2011 created a minor sensation there because of his Chinese ancestry and American behavior. Much was made in the Chinese press and blogosphere about Mr. Locke carrying his own luggage, and a photograph of him at the airport buying his own coffee, something a Chinese official would never do, quickly spread on the Internet. Mr. Locke does not speak Chinese.
Asked about how he is perceived in China, Mr. Locke joked about it. ''It was rather overwhelming at first,'' he said. When he and his family visited the Great Wall outside Beijing, he said, ''we were asked by everyone for photographs.''
In China, he said, his ancestry ''is a source of great pride,'' but many Chinese mistakenly thought he would take the Chinese side on all issues and expressed disappointment when he did not. ''They called me yellow on the outside and white on the inside,'' he said. ''They called me a banana.''

HEADLINE: Obama Offers Fiscal Plan Close To G.O.P.'s, but Hurdles Remain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama delivered to Speaker John A. Boehner a new offer on Monday to resolve the pending fiscal crisis, a deal that would raise revenues by $1.2 trillion over the next decade but keep in place the Bush-era tax rates for any household with earnings below $400,000.
The offer is close to a plan proposed by the speaker on Friday, and both sides expressed confidence that they were closing in on a major deficit-reduction plan that could be passed well before January, when more than a half-trillion dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts would kick in. 
Senior Republican aides said the speaker was to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday morning to discuss the state of negotiations. But they cautioned that obstacles remained.
''Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction,'' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. ''We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem.''
The two sides are now dickering over price, not philosophical differences, and the numbers are very close.
Mr. Boehner had offered the president a deficit framework that would raise $1 trillion over 10 years, with the details to be settled next year by Congress's tax-writing committees and the Obama administration. In response, Mr. Obama reduced his proposal to $1.2 trillion from $1.4 trillion on Monday at a 45-minute meeting with the speaker at the White House. That was down from $1.6 trillion initially.
The White House plan would permanently extend Bush-era tax cuts on household incomes below $400,000, meaning that only the top tax bracket, 35 percent, would increase to 39.6 percent. The current cutoff between the top rate and the next highest rate, 33 percent, is $388,350.
On spending, the two sides are also converging.
The White House says the president's plan would cut spending by $1.22 trillion over 10 years, compared with $1.2 trillion in cuts from the Republicans' initial offer. Of that, $800 billion is cuts to programs, and $122 billion comes from adopting a new measure of inflation that slows the growth of government benefits, especially Social Security. The White House is also counting on $290 billion in savings from lower interest costs on a reduced national debt.
Of the $800 billion in straight cuts, the president said half would come from federal health care programs; $200 billion from other so-called mandatory programs, like farm price supports, not subject to Congress's annual spending bills; $100 billion from military spending; and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress's annual discretion.
To make all this happen, Mr. Obama proposed fast-track procedures to help Congressional tax writers overhaul the individual and corporate tax code and make changes to other programs.
Senior Republican aides made it clear that differences remain. For instance, they say the president is still pressing for $1.3 trillion in higher taxes because the change in the way inflation is calculated would not only slow the growth of spending but also raise more revenue by slowing the rate at which tax brackets rise each year with the cost of living. That would mean that incomes would probably grow faster than the rise in tax brackets, pushing people more quickly into higher tax rates.
They also disagree with the president over counting lower interest payments on the national debt as savings.
''A proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced,'' said another spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel, using the Republicans' calculation for the president's offer.
The president is also insisting on some protections for what he has called the ''most vulnerable populations,'' which Republican aides said they had not been expecting. The new inflation calculations, for instance, would probably not affect wounded veterans and disabled people on Supplemental Security Income.
And Mr. Obama is sticking by his request for additional upfront spending on infrastructure and an extension of expiring unemployment benefits.
He would also secure some tax and policy changes long sought by both parties but unattainable in the context of smaller budget deals. His proposal would permanently extend popular business tax breaks like the credit for corporate research and development, permanently stop the expansion of the alternative minimum tax so it does not affect more of the middle class, and stop a long-planned and deep cut to Medicare health providers, which Congress has never had the stomach to allow to kick in.
To keep the country from returning to fiscal showdowns, Mr. Obama wants the government's borrowing limit to rise high enough to take the issue off the table for two years, although he said that Congress could periodically weigh in and try to override a presidential lifting of the debt ceiling, should it want to.
Senior Republican aides made it clear on Monday night that the plan was not what the speaker had wanted. He had proposed higher income tax rates on income over $1 million. That revenue would be supplemented by reinstating a provision in the tax code -- phased out by the Bush-era tax cuts -- that automatically limits tax deductions and credits for the affluent. The speaker was also ready to accept a White House proposal from Mr. Obama's first days in office that would limit tax deductions to 28 percent, trimming back deductions for charitable giving and other activities from the top rate paid by the giver, 35 percent currently.

HEADLINE: Influx of Cash in Asia Raises Familiar Worries

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- To all the concerns that cloud Asia's growth prospects next year -- the fiscal measures set to take effect in the United States, the euro zone debt crisis and the uncertain growth trajectories of China and Japan -- add one more: a renewed flood of cash into some of the region's more dynamic economies.
Asia's fast-growing economies have weathered a tough 2012 relatively well, and economists say that unless the U.S. and euro zone economies take a sharp hit in 2013, the region could pick up steam again next year.
But that good news comes with a price tag. Analysts have begun to warn recently that Asia's relative economic buoyancy could once again attract large amounts of cash, possibly leading to a repeat of what happened two years ago. 
Back then, big inflows, mostly from the West, caused many emerging-market currencies to surge and prompted talk of ''currency wars'' as central bankers scrambled to keep their currencies from rising too fast.
Now, with growth in Asia picking up, and central banks in developed nations stepping up their efforts to oil the wheels of their beleaguered economies, the influx of cash is again starting to have worrying side effects.
Property prices, for example, have risen across much of the region. The South Korean won has climbed more than 5 percent against the U.S. dollar since late August. The Philippine peso has risen about 4 percent, to its highest level since early 2008. The Taiwan dollar, the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit also have strengthened.
''We could be heading back towards where we were in 2010,'' said Frederic Neumann, regional economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. ''Capital is pouring back into emerging Asia.''
Next year, said Rob Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia ex-Japan at Nomura in Hong Kong, ''could be a bumper year'' for net capital inflows. ''The stars are aligned.''
For many parts of the world, a tide of capital would be a blessing. The United States, Europe and Japan have spent much of the last four years trying to reinvigorate their economies by lowering rates and injecting cash into strained financial systems through purchases of financial assets.
More is in store.
Last Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would continue to buy large amounts of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until the job market improved.
Likewise, the Japanese central bank may step up its existing asset-buying and lending program at a policy meeting this week, analysts believe.
Over the years, some of that liquidity has seeped into parts of the world where growth is faster and returns are higher. The amounts of money flowing into developing Asia have, at times, been vast. During the rush in late 2009 and 2010, David Carbon, an economist at DBS in Singapore, estimated, the region saw inflows to the tune of $2 billion a day, for example.
Economists at the Japanese bank Nomura estimate that between early 2009 and mid-2011, net capital inflows to Asia, excluding Japan, totaled $783 billion -- far more than the $573 billion that came in during the preceding five years.
The renewed inflows in recent months have not been so large. Moreover, not all countries have attracted cash in equal measure. Investors have been wary this year of India's seeming inability to push through important economic overhauls, for example. That has caused the rupee to sag more than 11 percent since February. China, meanwhile, restricts incoming foreign investments to relatively small amounts.
Elsewhere in the region, however, there are signs of renewed pressure.
An index compiled by Nomura that gauges capital inflow pressures has risen in recent months, said Mr. Subbaraman, the Nomura economist. Although it remains below where it was during the spike in 2010, it is now at its highest since May 2011.
Said Mr. Neumann of HSBC, ''currencies have strengthened despite resistant central banks, real estate markets are frothing away, and lending to consumers and companies has accelerated.''
All of that has reignited the concerns that traditionally accompany major -- and potentially fickle -- capital inflows.
For exporters, stronger currencies are a headache, as they make the exporters' goods more expensive for consumers elsewhere.
For ordinary citizens, rising property prices make homes increasingly unaffordable. Soaring property prices are also vulnerable to painful reversals if conditions change.
Underscoring that point, the International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday that a sharp rise in house prices in Hong Kong raised ''the risk of an abrupt correction.''
Likewise, a big increase this year in corporate bond issuance -- while a positive in that it supports growth and diversifies corporate funding -- bears risks.
''There has been a huge amount of new debt in Asia this year,'' said Guy Stear, head of research for Asia Pacific at Société Générale in Hong Kong. ''We're building up a problem for two, three, four years down the line. It's an issue we need to watch.''
The Asian Development Bank, too, warned in a report last month that ''a surge in volatile capital inflows'' was a potential threat for the region's bond markets.
Policy makers, meanwhile, face a dilemma: The most effective way to combat asset bubbles and inflation would be to raise interest rates. But higher rates could simply attract yet more cash from abroad and cause currencies to appreciate even further -- an unpalatable development at a time when the global economic backdrop remains tough.
Instead, policy makers are likely to increase targeted regulatory measures as a way to curb inflows. Measures announced by various emerging economies in 2010 included a tax on foreign investment in government bonds in Thailand, for example.
Now, with liquidity again pouring in, policy makers are trying to find additional ways to stem the tide.
Last month, the authorities in South Korea announced a step limiting the foreign exchange debts held by banks -- a measure aimed at reducing the country's vulnerability to sudden capital reversals.
And in late October, Hong Kong introduced a new tax of 15 percent on home purchases by anyone who is not a permanent resident of the city -- including the many mainland Chinese investors whose cash has helped push up property prices in Hong Kong and has joined the tide of money from the West into Asian markets generally.
Targeted regulatory tweaks of this kind, analysts say, need not raise international hackles. In fact, said Mr. Subbaraman, international institutions like the I.M.F. and the Asian Development Bank now recognize that such measures have an important role to play.
The problem, however, is that over time, such measures are less able to stem the flows, and loopholes are often found.
Hong Kong's efforts to cool the property market are a case in point: A string of measures since late 2009 has failed to reverse the upward momentum.
Home prices have risen 20 percent so far this year and have doubled since a dip that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008. And after the recent imposition of new taxes on home purchases, speculative cash flowed into the market for parking spaces in private garages, which were not subject to the regulations, driving up prices there.
The danger, said Mr. Subbaraman, is that central banks ''ultimately find themselves behind the curve in tackling credit booms, asset price bubbles and inflation.''

HEADLINE: Fashion and Products for a Sustainable World

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES

 BODY:
LONDON -- ''Let's recreate the equivalent of the Met ball in Europe and, rather than for the museum, give the money to environmental causes,'' said the fashion world's energetic activist Jochen Zeitz, referring to New York's Metropolitan Museum's annual fund-raising event.
''Fashion is a logical place to start to raise awareness for sustainable causes,'' said Mr. Zeitz, who was formerly head of Puma and is now director of PPR, the French luxury group, and chairman of the board's sustainable development committee. ''We should bring in an environmental attitude, and I think luxury should automatically be about sustainability and quality.'' 
Mr. Zeitz is not dreaming of a ''green'' Christmas. He has a much wider vision of a world in which environmental consciousness and sustainability is a built-in factor to product sourcing and design every day of the year. ''We should make it part of the DNA of brand as a new definition of quality,'' Mr. Zeitz said.
The two projects which make the executive unique are the nonprofit Zeitz Foundation, founded in 2008, which supports ecologically and socially responsible destinations and programs across the world from its epicenter on its Segera reserve in Kenya.
That initiative was celebrated last month at the London Zoo, where the Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt offered his support and one of his yellow and green Jamaica running vests for the auction.
After nearly two decades, Mr. Zeitz stepped down last month from his role as chairman of Puma, where he took the helm in 1993 at age 30 and transformed the ailing brand from sportswear to leisure. He also embraced designers in the PPR group from Hussein Chalayan through Alexander McQueen to Stella McCartney.
The other innovation is The B Team, founded in October by Mr. Zeitz and Richard Branson on the proposal that modern business needs a ''plan B'' as a global initiative to help transform capitalism into a driving force for social, environmental and economic benefit.
Mr. Branson takes the line that ''business needs to move away from a focus on immediate profit to one where it invests and operates for the long-term good of people and the planet.''
Mr. Zeitz said leaders in the private sector should help to move toward an ''equitable and sustainable future.''
The mantra of each project is that sustainability does not need to come at the sacrifice of economic prosperity. But rather the opposite: that a holistic system integrates the four C's: conservation, community, culture and commerce.
For Mr. Zeitz, therefore, sustainability is for life, not a short-lived gift for Christmas -- and the new year is just the time to start good, sustainable practices.
THE MAKINGS OF THE MODERN CHRISTMAS TREE
Are green pine needles and conifer trees going out of fashion?
Anyone who has felt guilty that acres of pine forest are chopped down to satisfy Christmas consumers should have been at the auction of designer ''trees'' in Paris last week.
From digital projections, through the neon art works of Jean Charles de Castelbajac and Stella McCartney to the cluster of metallic poles by Elie Saab, it seemed that any Christmas tree is stylish -- as long as it is not cut from a living plant.
Marie Christiane Marek is the force behind 17 years of imaginative ''Sapins de Noël,'' which were put up for auction in favor of a cancer charity. Jean Paul Gaultier, whose tree was made of a stack of Coca-Cola tins, was on site to watch the bidding, along with Chantal Thomas, with her light-as-lingerie, white-feathered creation.
The Lesage tree, a black embroidered ''plant'' in homage by Hugo Barriere to the late embroidery king François Lesage, struck a wistful note; while Pierre Hermé's tree made up of multicolored macaroons won the children's vote.

HEADLINE: Bank Shares Lead a Gain After Signs of Progress in the Budget Talks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Wall Street on Monday as investors were encouraged by signs of progress in budget talks in Washington two weeks before tax increases and government spending cuts will take effect if no deal is reached.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.38 points to 13,235.39, its biggest gain this month. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 16.78 points to 1,430.36 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 39.27 points to 3,010.60.
Marc Chaikin, chief executive of Chaikin Analytics, a market research firm based in Philadelphia, said investors had become more optimistic about a resolution in the budget talks after the House speaker, John A. Boehner, made an offer to increase tax rates on high-income Americans. 
''The fiscal cliff is obviously foremost on everyone's mind,'' Mr. Chaikin said.
Banks were among the best-performing stocks. Citigroup gained $1.55, 4.1 percent, to $39.15 after Raymond James, the brokerage house, raised its target price on the stock to $52 from $44. In a note to clients, it reaffirmed its strong buy rating, citing the ''improving fundamental outlook.'' Bank of America was also higher, gaining 42 cents, or 4 percent, to $11.
Investors now prefer financial stocks to technology stocks, said Ben Schwarz, chief market strategist at Lightspeed Financial.
''The banks are ripping today,'' Mr. Schwarz said. ''People are looking for stability, and the tech sector hasn't given them any.''
Financial companies are the best performing industry group in the S.& P. 500 this year, according to FactSet Data. The group, which includes banks like Wells Fargo and insurers like Travelers, has gained 25 percent this year.
Apple rose $9.04, or 1.8 percent, to $518.83 after it said it sold more than two million iPhone 5 units in China in their first three days of availability, setting a record for that market. Apple stock has fallen 26 percent since closing at a record $702.10 in September and is trading close to its lowest since February.
In Washington, there appeared to be movement in long-stalled budget talks aimed at avoiding tax increases and government spending cuts set to take effect Jan. 1. The combination could lead to a recession.
Indexes opened higher after the news that Mr. Boehner, a Republican, had offered $1 trillion in higher tax revenue over 10 years and an increase on the top tax rate for people making $1 million a year, to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. The market moved higher still after reports shortly before noon that Mr. Boehner had gone to the White House to meet with President Obama.
Wall Street has been relatively calm in recent weeks, but David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds, said that by Friday the market will be ''squarely focused on what is or is not happening in Washington.''
He suggested in a note to clients that the markets will not have ''priced in'' any outcome, ''setting the stage for a market rally with an agreement and a slump with stalemate.''
Clearwire, an Internet access company, slid 46 cents, to $2.91, after Sprint announced terms of its buyout deal for the company. Sprint's price of $2.97 a share was below Clearwire's closing stock price Friday.
Japanese stocks rose after the country's Liberal Democratic Party regained power in a landslide election victory.
Brian Singer, a partner at William Blair, an asset management firm based in Chicago, said investors had been encouraged by the outcome, which gave the conservative party overwhelming control of Parliament. The Liberal Democrats have promised greater economic stimulus spending and more action to end a destructive cycle of declining prices.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 20/32, to 98 21/32, and the yield rose to 1.77 percent from 1.70 percent late Friday.
The American International Group, the insurance company, rose $1.01, or 3 percent, to $34.95, after it said it was selling its remaining stake in the AIA Group, a life insurer.
Tenet Healthcare gained 55 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $31.18 after Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation on the stock to buy from hold. The bank cited Tenet's ''compelling'' business and financial outlook over 12 to 24 months.

HEADLINE: Spending vs. Revenue: Simple Formula, But ...

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
It takes only two lines to explain the federal government's financial situation. The first shows federal spending, measured as a share of the nation's economic output. The second shows federal revenues. And the space in between - that's the deficit.
To be more precise, over the last half-century, federal spending on average equaled 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product, while revenues averaged 17.9 percent. 
As those figures suggest, the government almost always runs an annual deficit. Revenue has exceeded spending in just five of the last 50 years - in 1969 and from 1998 to 2001. The rest of the time, the government has borrowed some of the money that it needs. And the next year it borrowed even more, to cover the old debts and the new deficit. Every year the government runs a deficit increases the total amount of the federal debt.
Borrowing can be very good policy. It allows the government to provide Americans with a higher quality of life: more infrastructure, more services, more investment in the future. And as long as the economy continues to grow, the loans actually become easier to repay with time because doing so requires a smaller share of current revenue.
Inflation helps in the same way: more dollars to repay the same amount of debt.
Consider what happened after World War II. In 1946, the federal debt equaled 122 percent of the nation's annual economic output, the highest level on record. And over the next three decades, the amount the government owed almost exactly doubled.
As the accompanying chart shows, the government ran annual deficits in most of those years. But economic output, and inflation, rose even faster. By 1975, the federal debt was twice as large, but it equaled just 35 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
Or consider a person who makes $10,000 and buys a home with a mortgage that requires annual payments of $2,000. Over the following decade, the person gets a few raises and a new job. Add in some inflation, and the worker is now making $20,000. The mortgage debt, however, does not increase. The person still owes just $2,000 a year.
That's the sunny side, but deficits can cause problems too. Greater debt requires larger interest payments. Government borrowing can soak up money that might otherwise be available to businesses and consumers. The European debt crisis is a reminder that countries sometimes cannot borrow as much as they need.
And the federal government's needs are getting larger. The chart shows clearly that the gap between spending and revenue has yawned wider since the mid-1970s, save for that anomalous interlude in the late years of the Clinton administration.
In recent years, of course, the gap has grown even wider. The recession eroded revenues, and the government, seeking to stimulate the economy, increased spending.
Over the last five years, spending averaged 22.8 percent of the nation's annual economic output, revenues 16.3 percent.
What happens next? That is where the two charts diverge.
In the first situation, the government jumps from the so-called fiscal cliff. That has a certain appeal. As the chart shows, revenues would increase, spending would plunge, and the annual deficits would shrink. Economists, however, predict that the nation also would plunge back into recession. "The economy will, I think, go off a cliff," the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference last week.
In the second situation, the government makes almost no changes to current policy and annual deficits shrink slightly before expanding again. That, too, has an obvious benefit: it avoids an immediate dose of economic pain. But it leaves the larger issue unresolved. Annual deficits, and the debt, would continue to grow.
Both the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans would like to land somewhere in between: more revenues, yes, and less spending too, but not enough of either to eliminate deficits or undermine the economic recovery.
So far, they have not been able to agree where those lines should be.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Girding For Zombies

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Thank goodness we'll all be wiped out by the Maya doomsday by week's end. That will spare us the discomfort of having to go through the impending zombie apocalypse.
But just in case, the Discovery Channel is doing its part to equip us for life after the end of the world by offering a serious yet seriously absurd new wrinkle in the prepper-TV genre, a one-hour special on Tuesday night in which assorted people try to convince us that the zombie threat is real and that we should get ready for it. They are not, frankly, very persuasive, but don't say you weren't warned if the flesh-eating worst does come to pass.
The program, ''Zombie Apocalypse,'' is almost unwatchable at the moment because of the killings in Connecticut on Friday, since it is full of people detailing their plans for blasting away at zombies and discussing things like whether they would be able to shoot their own children if they were to become infected. 
Even without that backdrop, it's fairly tacky, taking as its starting point an incident in Miami in May in which a homeless man, Ronald Poppo, was attacked by a naked, deranged stranger named Rudy Eugene, who bit off parts of his face. Surveillance-camera images of the attack rocketed around the Internet, and Mr. Eugene, who was killed by a police officer, became known as the Miami Zombie.
The National Geographic Channel's ''Doomsday Preppers,'' among others, has already introduced viewers to people who go to seemingly extreme lengths to get ready for terrorist attacks, the collapse of the financial system, nuclear power plant disasters and more, so perhaps it's no surprise that, at least according to this program, there are some among us who are seriously preparing for a zombie attack. What makes this program different is that among clips of the preppers spewing nonsense about how to shoot a zombie, it intercuts interviews with credentialed academics who say that, yes, a virus or some such that attacks the brain could find its way into humans, disseminate rapidly and cause symptoms that would make us resemble all those zombies we know and love from the movies.
''It's something that, at least in terms of spread, is very likely,'' says Robert Smith of the mathematics department at the University of Ottawa. ''We have a lot of human contact. This means that a disease that works through just direct human contact can actually spread remarkably efficiently.''
Dr. Steven C. Schlozman of Harvard Medical School talks about how the brain works and which parts of it would probably be damaged if a zombie epidemic were to strike. ''The zombie brain has almost no activity in the frontal lobe,'' he explains helpfully.
The program also gives you the rare experience of hearing a professor (Daniel W. Drezner of Tufts University) described as the ''author of 'Theories of International Politics and Zombies' '' -- on Monday, No. 40 on Amazon's list of best sellers in its sub-sub-subcategory of international and world politics. And it provides a new entry for the list of you-must-be-joking organizations: apparently there actually is something called the Kansas Anti Zombie Militia.
But it's hard right now to take this program in the pop-culture way it was intended, especially the idiocy that comes out of the mouths of the various preppers. ''Some people's epiphany,'' says one, Matthew Oakey, ''is when they realize that the guy that lives on their block with all the guns and ammo isn't crazy.''
Hmm.

HEADLINE: Gun Reform Not a Cause On Wall St.

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
5:25 a.m. | Updated
Following the publication of this column, which was critical of the role of private equity firms' ownership of gun manufacturers, Cerberus announced that it was planning to sell its stake in Freedom Group."It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level," Cerberus said in a statement on Tuesday.
As the debate over gun control rages following the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Conn., one unlikely group is expected to play a central role in pushing back against any reform effort: the private equity industry. 
It is often overlooked, but some of the biggest gun makers in the nation are owned by private equity funds run by Wall Street titans. The .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that was used on Friday by Adam Lanza to massacre 20 schoolchildren was manufactured by the Freedom Group, a gun behemoth controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, named after the three-headed dog of Greek myth that guarded the gates of Hades. Its founder, Stephen A. Feinberg, hunts regularly on the weekends with a Remington Model 700.
Besides Cerberus, Colt Defense, a spinoff from the manufacturer of the .44-40 Colt revolver made famous by John Wayne, is jointly owned by Sciens Capital Management, a fund advised by the Blackstone Group and another fund run by Credit Suisse.
On Colt Defense's Web site, it markets weapons for law enforcement and the military, including a 9-millimeter submachine gun that looks like something out of the video game Call of Duty. These are weapons you hope never fall into consumers' hands.
And then there is MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm that once owned the diet company Jenny Craig that now controls Bushnell Outdoor Products. Bushnell makes just about everything for a gun except the gun itself, for both the hunting and "tactical" markets.
Need a laser scope for your semiautomatic handgun? Bushnell makes one called the Tactical Red Dot: First Strike. How about military-grade night-vision goggles? Yep, it has a subsidiary that makes them.
Looking for a "loader" for your AK-47? It has you covered. Or what about a magazine for bullets? One of its subsidiaries sells the Hot Lips 10-Round Magazine, which is marketed this way: "Put 10 rounds through your 10/22 faster than the blink of an eye, and reload with amazing ease." (Really, folks. It also makes a 25-round version.)
Perhaps it should not be a surprise, but Wall Street will hardly take a leadership position in the conversation about gun control. The more vocal stances could come from pension funds questioning their investments in gun makers, though they may be loath to take a stand.
Since the killings on Friday, the Freedom Group and other notable gun manufacturers have not commented on the tragedy - not even a basic, "We condemn such violence and pray for the families of Newtown."
When I called Mr. Feinberg, he declined to comment, as did others. About a year ago, the National Rifle Association issued this statement about Freedom and Cerberus: "The owners and investors involved are strong supporters of the Second Amendment and are avid hunters and shooters."
Cerberus and other funds with ownership stakes in the gun industry would be in an awkward position if they sought reforms that could hurt their investments. Cerberus invests money in companies like Freedom for other investors, including public pension funds. It has a fiduciary duty to maximize investors' returns.
However, some of its investors may be rethinking their position on investing in companies like Freedom, which was used as an acquisition vehicle to buy up brands including Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS Firearms, a leading maker of military-style semiautomatics.
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, which has a stake in Freedom through a $751.4 million investment in Cerberus's funds, said Monday it was reviewing its investment. "At this point our investment branch is examining the Cerberus investment to determine how best to move forward given the tragic events of last Friday in Newtown, Conn.," the company said in a statement to Reuters.
Private equity firms have a long history of investing in "sin" companies, including guns, alcohol, gambling and tobacco, in part because the companies often are inherently discounted. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired RJR Nabisco in 1988; the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was later spun off.
On Monday, Eliot L. Spitzer, the former governor of New York and the former New York State attorney general, called on Cerberus's investors to pressure it to try to reform the gun industry.
"While Cerberus, whose array of holdings is vast, is generally immune to public pressure and the opprobrium of trafficking in products that while legal may be marketed in a loathsome way, Cerberus would not be immune to pressure brought by its own investors," he wrote on Slate.
He added: "Every student at a university should ask the university if it is invested in Cerberus. Every member of a union should ask their pension-fund managers if they are invested. Information is the key first step. From there, action will quickly follow."
If Mr. Spitzer is right, the economic impact of such reform may be painful for its investors. About two years ago, when Freedom sought to pursue an I.P.O. (which was later shelved) it identified gun control as one of its biggest "risk factors."
"The regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future and any such development might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows," the company told potential investors. "In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tokyo to Take a Tougher Line With China

BYLINE: By JOHN LEE

 BODY:
The resounding victory by Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, led by Shinzo Abe, is more a vote against the incumbent Democratic Party of Japan than it is for the L.D.P. Even so, the perception that Abe's forthright and confident approach breaks the mold of the consensus-based bureaucratic style of many Japanese leaders will please many voters and Japan's security partners in the region.
This sentiment will not be replicated in Beijing. There is a groundswell of opinion within Japan that Tokyo should no longer be cowed by Chinese regional assertiveness. For many Japanese, Abe is the one willing to stand up to Japan's larger neighbor. 
Japan's deep history of rivalry and conflict with China is well known. Part of this is currently being played out in the dispute over the Japanese administered Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Of major concern is the realization that Beijing is prepared to link political and strategic issues with economic reward and punishment.
In September, China's vice minister for commerce, Jiang Zengwei, officially sanctioned and encouraged the boycott of Japanese goods and companies -- particularly cars and electronic products. Chinese-based travel agencies were leaned upon to cancel or postpone tours to Japan, leading to a 33 percent fall in Chinese tourist numbers to Japan in October. Japanese companies such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Panasonic reported damage to their operations and property as thousands of Chinese staged anti-Japanese protests. It would be unthinkable that these demonstrations occurred without the authorities having previous knowledge that they would occur.
Beijing's willingness to use trade as a strategic or political lever was deployed against Japan in 2010 over the same dispute when China halted the exports of rare earths to its neighbor. Beijing has behaved similarly to other countries, most recently when China temporarily halted the import of bananas from the Philippines due to the dispute over the Scarborough Shoal, threatening 200,000 Filipino jobs.
When Abe was prime minister from September 2006 to September 2007, he broke the contemporary tradition of softly-softly approaches to disputes with China. He was the personal driving force behind the now defunct Quadrilateral Initiative, a strategic partnership framework agreement between Japan, the United States, India and Australia. The initiative established the foundation for enhanced strategic cooperation and naval exercises among the four democratic powers. Formed at a time when regional states were still uncritically accepting the self-proclaimed rhetoric of China's rise, the initiative was premature and a little too provocative. Abe also argued for an enhanced strategic partnership with India. He was not backward about declaring that these proposals were all about retraining Chinese ambition and behavior -- probably the first modern Asian leader to openly say so.
Even in the lead-up to the recent election, Abe has been frank in saying that he will pursue an assertive alliance strategy, and in particular the deepening of the U.S.-Japan alliance. Concluding a security alliance with Australia would also presumably be high on his to-do list. Abe has also indicated that he would re-examine the self-imposed restriction that Japan spend no more than 1 percent of G.D.P. on defense. There are even indications that he would consider supplementing Japan's highly impressive defensive military capabilities with formidable offensive military assets such as ballistic missiles, strategic bombers and amphibious units. If so, this could necessitate a ''reinterpretation'' of Article 9 of the country's pacifist Constitution.
To be sure, Abe's first priority is reversing signs of deflation in the economy. But many will fear a deterioration of China-Japan relations, with uncertain economic repercussions for trade between the two countries and the region. If deterioration in the bilateral political and economic relationship in fact occurs, a more assertive Abe government may not be to blame. After all, when the center-left Democratic Party candidate, Yukio Hatoyama, rose to power in June 2009, Tokyo pursued a much more lenient line toward Beijing. Never a supporter of the U.S. naval base Okinawa, Hatoyama declared that Japan should put less emphasis on the U.S. alliance and more effort into an exclusive East Asian economic and strategic zone -- underpinned by closer strategic relations between Japan and China.
Beijing's diplomats applauded the softer Japanese line. But it preceded a year -- 2010 -- when China pushed its weight around, picking fights with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Australia -- causing the entire region to question the credibility of China's self-proclaimed peaceful rise.
Beijing's aggressive behavior over disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea may well be unrelated to Hatoyama's softer approach. But Tokyo's conciliatory line certainly didn't temper Beijing's behavior then, and even the outgoing center-left Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda toughened his stance against China.
Abe is nothing if not consistent. His calculation is that China will offer few economic favors or strategic concessions to a meek Japan. At the least, a stronger, firmer posture will certainly do no harm. And the gamble is that it may even cause Beijing to think twice about the cost of pushing its military and economic weight around East and Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: Incoming Leader's Plan: Not Repeating His Errors

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Shinzo Abe, set to return as Japan's prime minister after his party's landslide victory on Sunday, means it when he says he knows what it feels like to hit rock bottom. His last term in office was marred by political financing scandals, a nationalist agenda that seemed off the mark and rumors -- later confirmed -- that he had resigned over an intestinal ailment, an ignominious exit that prompted snide jokes about his condition.
Mr. Abe's impending comeback says more about the spectacular failure of the leaders who succeeded him than about a revival on his part. But Mr. Abe, 58, is in many ways a changed man. Though analysts say he remains deeply nationalistic at heart, he has toned down his hawkish language and instead has focused on reviving Japan's moribund economy.
It is still possible that China, which has been enmeshed in a territorial quarrel with Japan, could prompt Mr. Abe to show his nationalist colors. He said Monday that there would be no negotiation over Japan's claims to the set of islands in dispute, but he went no further than the incumbent Democrats, who have also asserted Japanese sovereignty over the islands. 
So far, Mr. Abe has reserved his tough talk for the economy, promising public spending largess, a far more aggressive stand against deflation and bolder measures to weaken the strong yen, which has stifled Japan's export-led economy. He peppered his campaign speeches with promises to rebuild a strong country, emphasizing resilience against natural disasters and economic downturns, rather than dwelling on North Korean rockets or the Chinese Navy.
The economic focus helped Mr. Abe lead his party, the Liberal Democrats, to victory while sidestepping difficult issues like nuclear power. The Liberal Democrats promoted nuclear power during their half-century of almost uninterrupted leadership until the Democrats ousted them from power in 2009, less than two years before the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 20,000 people and set off the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Markets have cheered on Mr. Abe's economic turn, and rallied on Monday after his party's decisive victory. The United States dollar reached as high as 84.48 yen on Monday, its highest level against the Japanese currency since April 2011. The Nikkei stock average, which surged 10 percent in the monthlong prelude to Sunday's elections in anticipation of Mr. Abe's economic policies, gained an additional 0.94 percent on Monday, rising to 9,828.88.
At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Abe said: ''I once fell to rock bottom and was hit with a storm of criticism. Now, I want to prove it's possible to start over again.''
Mr. Abe's first stint as prime minister, in 2006-7, began on a high note. The Japanese news media hailed him as the first prime minister born after World War II and the handpicked successor to a popular leader, Junichiro Koizumi.
But Mr. Abe made the mistake of focusing on a drive to instill patriotism in schools and elevate the military's status, an approach that appeared to be out of touch with a population more concerned about the state of the national pension system and other bread-and-butter issues. Mr. Abe quickly became an object of ridicule in the popular media, an embodiment of an expression popular at the time: ''K.Y.,'' for ''kuuki yomenai,'' which literally means ''can't read the air,'' or ''clueless.''
Mr. Abe's cabinet was weakened by gaffes and a series of money and pension-related scandals that led four of his ministers to resign and a fifth to commit suicide. Overseas, he was criticized for denying that Japan's wartime army had forced women into sexual slavery, despite historical documents and testimony. The controversy prompted United States lawmakers to pass a bill calling for an apology. And 10 months into his term, Mr. Abe's governing party suffered a humiliating defeat in elections for Parliament's upper house; two months later, he was gone.
With upper house elections expected this summer, Mr. Abe is determined not to make the same mistakes, analysts say. He will be especially cautious, they say, because his mandate is not as rock solid as the Liberal Democrats' supermajority in the lower house might suggest. The party won just 40 percent of the vote in the country's electoral districts, but benefited from a splintering of the opposition. If the opposition regroups or the Liberal Democrats stumble, the tables could quickly turn against them.
''In the beginning, he will keep a moderate tone,'' said Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a professor of political science at Keio University in Tokyo. ''He will avoid making waves by staying close to the United States. He knows he must focus on the economy first, for the upper house elections.''
Mr. Abe's promise to go much further to tackle deflation is particularly significant, economists say, given years of halfway measures. He has already pressured the Bank of Japan to print more money, urging that the inflation target double to 2 percent, and threatening to change laws to give the government more power in setting the bank's policy goals.
He has made clear that the bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, known for his cautious stance on inflation, will be shown the door when his term ends in three months.
Mr. Abe has also said he will kick-start growth with spending on public works, a promise that has rallied support for the Liberal Democrats across Japan's depressed countryside. Mr. Abe said Monday that a high priority would be redrafting next year's budget so that it amounts to a total of 10 trillion yen, or $119 billion, to allocate more on reconstruction and disaster prevention.
But these expansionary policies scare some economists. The country's public debt has mushroomed to more than twice the size of its gross domestic product, making it the largest public debt in the industrialized world. A return to large public spending would undo recent efforts to rein in that debt, while too much inflation could drive up borrowing costs and cause investors to lose confidence in Japan's finances.
For others, the focus on public works represents a return to the pork-barrel politics of the 1990s, when the Liberal Democrats promised extensive projects in return for votes, and racked up huge public debt. In their recent campaigns, Liberal Democratic lawmakers across the country courted farming and construction industry lobbies with promises of public works spending.
New pork-barrel ties could threaten steps Mr. Abe says are needed to revitalize the economy: for example, free trade agreements to improve Japanese exporters' access to overseas markets and open up industries at home to more competition.
Analysts do not expect Mr. Abe to make any concerted push that would alienate farming and construction groups, which represent heavily insular industries opposed to any free trade pacts.
''Infrastructure projects are like a drug,'' said Takayoshi Igarashi, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo and a former government adviser on public works. ''Once you start, it's difficult to stop. But all the spending leads to more and more debt.
''And when you promise everyone favors, you are left with little scope to do anything else.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Vote Will Change Policy Toward North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- No matter who wins South Korea's presidential election on Wednesday, the end is near for the hard-line policy on North Korea promoted by the departing president: the two top candidates both agree on a more moderate approach.
But the question of how much aid and investment South Korea should offer the North, and under what conditions, has become a major point of contention, one that could create discord with Washington.
The neck-and-neck race pits Park Geun-hye, the candidate of President Lee Myung-bak's conservative Saenuri Party, against Moon Jae-in, who represents the liberal Democratic United Party.
Their backgrounds are as different as those of any two Koreans could be. Ms. Park is the daughter of Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea with an iron fist from 1961 to 1979. Mr. Moon is a former student activist who was jailed in the 1970s for opposing Mr. Park's dictatorship. 
But both agree that Mr. Lee's policy of backing international sanctions to compel North Korea to end its nuclear programs and refraining from dialogue with the North has failed to tame its hostility toward the South. North Korea's successful launching of a three-stage rocket on Wednesday has not changed the candidates' promises to provide more generous aid to the North and to try to hold talks with its new leader, Kim Jong-un.
''The launch doesn't seem to be having much effect on the current presidential contest one way or the other,'' said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul who is an expert on North Korea. Here in the South Korean capital, not far from the North Korean border, ''most people don't see this rocket launch as a security threat, for the simple reason that North Korea can use quicker and more effective short- and midrange capabilities to strike the South, if it ever came to that,'' Mr. Delury said.
For the Obama administration, the timing of the transition of power in South Korea is problematic. After the rocket launching, American officials talked of imposing ''Iran-like sanctions'' on North Korea, suggesting curbs on investment and banking outside the country and on purchases of North Korean goods. Finding new sanctions that truly hurt will be difficult; the North is already one of the most penalized countries on earth.
But winning approval of those sanctions in the United Nations Security Council will be even more difficult if South Korea appears to be headed in the other direction. Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, clashed on Wednesday with her Chinese counterpart over whether the rocket launching merited a response at all; the Chinese argued it did not. Marshaling support among United States allies will be almost impossible if a new South Korean president is announcing renewed initiatives.
''This could put us back to where we were in the Bush administration,'' one American diplomat said, ''where the White House was going in one direction, imposing sanctions, and a South Korean president was going in the other.''
President Obama and President Lee have pursued a policy of ''strategic patience,'' isolating and penalizing North Korea for its provocations and hoping that China would rein in its ally. China never did.
''The United States is more than willing to let South Korea take the lead on North Korea -- as long as it is comfortable with the general direction,'' said David Straub, deputy director at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University. ''The Obama administration will only be willing to go so far unless and until Pyongyang signals a genuine willingness to negotiate away its nuclear and missile programs on reasonable terms.''
Mr. Lee's liberal predecessors, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, pursued a ''sunshine policy'' of reconciliation and economic cooperation with North Korea from 1998 to 2008. Billions of dollars of South Korean investment, aid and goods flowed into the North to encourage it to shed its isolation and hostility, and to try to reduce the economic gap between the two Koreas and the cost of reunification in the future.
When the political pendulum swung toward Mr. Lee, who took office in 2008, he reversed the policy and said the North would need to give up its nuclear weapons if it wanted South Korean largess to continue. In the years that followed, the North cut off all official dialogue, conducted its second nuclear test, launched a long-range test missile, was accused of sinking a South Korean warship and fired an artillery barrage at a South Korean island.
''Lee Myung-bak's policy did nothing to stop North Korea from expanding its nuclear capability or change its behavior -- it only worsened the problem,'' said Mr. Moon, who wants to revive the sunshine policy.
Koh Yu-hwan, the chief architect of Mr. Moon's North Korea policy, said that South Korea ''should take the lead'' to thaw relations on the Korean Peninsula, which could provide the Obama administration with the political cover it needed to engage the North. ''If we don't make a move first, nobody else will,'' Mr. Koh said.
Ms. Park, too, has promised more moderate policies toward the North. Like her liberal rival, Ms. Park said that if elected, she would separate humanitarian aid from politics and try to hold talks with Kim Jong-un.
But Ms. Park insists that any large-scale economic investments in North Korea, which the North considers crucial, be preceded by the ''building of trust'' with steps toward denuclearization.
The peace bought with the ''shoveling'' of unrestrained aid to the North under the sunshine policy was ''a fake,'' she said, citing the North's long history of using military threats to win economic concessions. North Korea has called Ms. Park a ''confrontational maniac'' and her talk of engagement a ''vote-winning trick.''
Mr. Moon sets no condition for such investments, arguing that economic cooperation and efforts to end the North's nuclear programs should proceed on parallel tracks; otherwise, he said, the cycle of provocation and punishment will repeat itself. If elected, Mr. Moon said, he would resume shipments of food aid and revive a 2007 deal that promised billions of dollars of investment in shipyards, roads and industrial parks.
Mr. Moon's opposition party has said that Washington's policy of advancing international sanctions to punish North Korean misbehavior while keeping a channel of communication open will not change North Korea's behavior.
While both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon emphasize the importance of their country's alliance with the United States, analysts said that Mr. Moon would be a potentially more contentious ally for the United States at a time when the Obama administration is seeking to expand its influence in Asia.
Mindful of China's growing power, Mr. Moon said he would readjust South Korea's diplomacy, which he called ''tilted too much toward the United States.''
''The American attempt to form a trilateral alliance with Japan and South Korea to contain China and North Korea may be O.K. for Washington and Tokyo,'' Mr. Moon said in a speech in June, ''but this is grossly inappropriate for us.''

HEADLINE: In Sign of Normalization, Pentagon To Reimburse Pakistan $688 Million

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID E. SANGER; Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon quietly notified Congress this month that it would reimburse Pakistan nearly $700 million for the cost of stationing 140,000 troops on the border with Afghanistan, an effort to normalize support for the Pakistani military after nearly two years of crises and mutual retaliation.
The biggest proponent of putting foreign aid and military reimbursements to Pakistan on a steady footing is the man President Barack Obama is leaning toward naming as secretary of state: Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. Mr. Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has frequently served as an envoy to Pakistan, including after the killing of Osama bin Laden, and was a co-author of a law that authorized five years and about $7.5 billion of nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan. 
The United States also provides about $2 billion in annual security assistance, roughly half of which goes to reimburse Pakistan for conducting military operations to fight terrorism.
Until now, many of these reimbursements, called coalition support funds, have been held up, in part because of disputes with Pakistan over the Bin Laden raid, the operations of the C.I.A., and its decision to block supply lines into Afghanistan last year.
The $688 million payment -- the first since this summer, covering food, ammunition and other expenses from June through November 2011 -- has caused barely a ripple of protest since it was sent to Capitol Hill on Dec. 7.
The absence of a reaction, American and Pakistani officials say, underscores how relations between the two countries have been gradually thawing since Pakistan reopened the NATO supply routes in July after an apology from the Obama administration for an errant American airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in November 2011.
Mr. Kerry's nomination would be welcomed in Pakistan, where he is seen as perhaps the most sympathetic to Pakistani concerns of any senior lawmaker. He has nurtured relationships with top civilian and military officials, as well as the I.S.I., Pakistan's most powerful intelligence agency.
But if he becomes secretary of state, Mr. Kerry will inherit one of the hardest diplomatic tasks in South Asia: helping Pakistan find a role in steering Afghanistan toward a political agreement with the Taliban. As the United States, which tried and failed to broker such an agreement, begins to step back, Pakistan's role is increasing.
For a relationship rocked in the past two years by a C.I.A. contractor's shooting of two Pakistanis, the Navy SEAL raid that killed Bin Laden and the accidental airstrike, perhaps the most remarkable event in recent months has been relative calm. A senior American official dealing with Pakistan said recently that ''this is the longest we've gone in a while without a crisis.''
Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, said, ''Pakistan-United States relations are settling down to a more stable trajectory.''
The interlude has allowed the United States to reduce the huge backlog of NATO supplies at the border -- down to about 3,000 containers from 7,000 when the border crossings reopened -- and to conduct dry runs for the tons of equipment that will flow out of Afghanistan to Pakistani ports when the American drawdown steps up early next year.
Moreover, the two sides have resumed a series of high-level meetings -- capped by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's meeting this month with top Pakistani officials in Brussels -- on a range of topics including counterterrorism, economic cooperation, energy and the security of Pakistan's growing nuclear arsenal.
Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, concurred. ''There's greater convergence between the two countries than there has been in eight years,'' she said. ''It's been a fairly quick kiss and make up, but it's been driven by the approaching urgency of 2014, and by their shared desire for a stable outcome in the region.''
The one exception to the state of calm has been a tense set of discussions about Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. United States officials have told their Pakistani colleagues that Islamabad's move to smaller, more portable weapons creates a greater risk that one could be stolen or diverted. A delegation of American nuclear experts was in Pakistan last week, but found that the two countries had fundamentally divergent views about whether Pakistan's changes to its arsenal pose a danger.
The greatest progress, officials say, has been in the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, after years of mutual recrimination. A high-level Afghan delegation visited Pakistan in November, resulting in the release of several midlevel Taliban commanders from Pakistani jails as a sign of good will in restarting the peace process.
The United States, which was quietly in the background of those meetings, approved of the release of the prisoners, but has still held back on releasing five militants from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, a key Taliban demand.
One American official said there was a ''big push'' to move the talks process forward during the current winter lull in fighting. The United States is quietly seeking to revive a peace channel in Qatar, which was frozen earlier this year after the Taliban refused to participate.
Despite the easing of tensions in recent months, there are still plenty of sore spots in the relationship.
Lt. Gen. Michael D. Barbero, who heads the Pentagon agency responsible for combating roadside bombs, known as improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s, told a Senate hearing last week that Pakistan's efforts to stem the flow of a common agricultural fertilizer, calcium ammonium nitrate, that Taliban insurgents use to make roadside bombs had fallen woefully short.
''Our Pakistani partners can and must do more,'' General Barbero told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing.
American officials have also all but given up on Pakistan's carrying out a clearing operation in North Waziristan, a major militant safe haven.
''Pakistan's continued acceptance of sanctuaries for Afghan-focused insurgents and failure to interdict I.E.D. materials and components continue to undermine the security of Afghanistan and pose an enduring threat to U.S., coalition and Afghan forces,'' a Pentagon report, mandated by Congress, concluded last week.

HEADLINE: Bring On the Fiscal Cliff

BYLINE: By DAVID A. SUPER. 
David A. Super is a professor of law at Georgetown.

 BODY:
Washington
DISCUSSING the federal budget negotiations should come with a warning label: ''Caution -- talk of the 'fiscal cliff' may induce hyperventilation, blurry policy vision and confusion.''
Take the last of these. According to a recent poll, Americans believe that, if there's no negotiated settlement between President Obama and Republicans in Congress, the budgetary changes set to take effect on Jan. 1 will enlarge the federal deficit. In truth, going over the cliff -- that is, accepting the ''last ditch'' spending cuts agreed to in August 2011 as well as the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts -- would have the opposite effect: it would reduce the deficit. That, after all, has been the aim all along.
But even those who understand this often misjudge the likely impact of these automatic program cuts, known as the sequester, and the tax changes. Indeed, a closer look at this much-feared budget buzz saw reveals it's better for the country than any likely deal would be. 
Those who warn feverishly about the danger of the ''cliff'' cite two reasons. First, they say that the total amount of deficit reduction is too great -- and, second, that huge federal spending cuts in the midst of a still-weakened economy would plunge us into recession.
Throw in the fact that the Federal Reserve has less ability to cushion the impact of these cuts by trimming short-term interest rates -- they're already close to zero -- and you have a recipe for Europe's economic malaise. You'll recall that the European Union likewise pursued an aggressive austerity policy and ended up with a double-dip recession.
To that argument, I say they're right -- but only to an extent. The cuts in the package are far too steep. But then, no plausible grand bargain is likely to lessen the economic impact that much. And if leaders do reach a deal -- like the latest, $1.2 trillion proposal President Obama delivered to House Speaker John A. Boehner on Monday -- the result will almost certainly be a less ''balanced'' package than the one slated to take effect. It could hurt the middle class and poor even more than the current one would.
Even if a last-minute deal moderates the scale of deficit reduction, some House Republicans loudly insist that they would refuse to increase the debt limit without extensive domestic spending cuts in return -- and these, presumably, would be much steeper than those ordained in the cliff.
Absent a radical change in the Republican position, then, we'd still be on course to replicate Europe's folly.
If we are going to have radical deficit reduction, the fiscal cliff may be the fairest, least harmful way it can be achieved. Expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts, for example, would restore rates on the top 2 percent of earners to the levels they paid during the 1990s boom. Any likely deal would raise those rates less, and require either other tax increases or spending cuts to offset the revenue loss. (You can guess who'll be hit hardest by those.)
Likewise, non-defense discretionary funding, which supports everything from national parks to Head Start -- and which was already slashed in the 2011 debt-limit deal -- would almost certainly face deeper cuts than those required in the sequester.
What the fiscal cliff would not do -- but a budget deal might -- is strip health insurance from millions of people or cut food stamps and other major safety-net programs, whose impoverished beneficiaries bore vastly disproportionate shares of deficit reduction under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
So what will happen if we go over the fiscal cliff? Will we be plunged into recession? Not necessarily. The economic contraction won't happen immediately.
After Jan. 1, stand-alone legislation to restore tax cuts for middle- and lower-income families would most likely be unstoppable: any politician seeking to hold it hostage for other policies would risk an immediate backlash. Next would come efforts to moderate the defense cuts. But because the sequester matches cuts in defense and non-defense dollar for dollar, any move to restore military reductions would very likely drive a comparable increase in domestic discretionary funding -- spending that Republicans might otherwise block. Some of the scheduled reductions in Medicare's physician reimbursements might be restored, offset by more sustainable Medicare savings.
The net effect of these three mini-deals, reached after the start of the year, would be to ease the economic shock of the fiscal cliff, giving us our best chance to avoid another recession.
Yet even if none of that happens -- even if the New Year's Day changes remain in full force -- the result would be sacrifice shared broadly among rich, middle-class and poor, and between domestic and military programs. Any bargain proposed to avoid the fiscal cliff should be judged against that standard.

HEADLINE: Reason to Hope After the Newtown Rampage

 BODY:
This is a country that has a history of facing tragedy and becoming better for it. It is a country that recoiled in horror at the Triangle shirtwaist factory and took steps to protect the lives of factory workers. It is a country able to rethink deeply seated beliefs -- as it did with discrimination against blacks and women and is now doing with antigay discrimination.
Americans are ready to shoulder burdens -- as we did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by accepting increased security when we travel and military actions we might previously have avoided. The current atmosphere in Washington -- where lawmakers looked at the challenge of a struggling economy and dissolved into partisan bickering -- is not the old normal, and there is no reason we should settle for it as the new normal. 
So we have found real reason to find hope in the determination to effect change that followed the murders of 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Conn., last Friday. President Obama said it unequivocally on Sunday -- the enormity of controlling the culture of guns and the epidemic of gun violence ''can't be an excuse for inaction.''
Yes, Mr. Obama has said that before, after two previous mass killings during his tenure, and did nothing. The hurdles are just as big as they were before, but there are signs that people are willing to rethink their views.
Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia, Democrats with ''A'' ratings from the National Rifle Association, have both said it is time to talk about restrictions on gun sales and ownership. Joe Scarborough, the former Republican congressman and now morning host on MSNBC, said Monday that the Newtown killings had changed his mind about gun control.
And some lawmakers are already preparing to take action, like Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who plans to submit a bill in the next Congress that would update and tighten the loophole-riddled 1994 assault weapons bill that she wrote and that remained law until it expired in 2004.
In that spirit, we are devoting this page to the gun epidemic, and the violence it has caused, and plan to return to the subject frequently, analyzing the challenge but mostly looking at solutions -- all of which start with the hard truth that it is past time for both sides of the gun debate to be less inflexible on the issue of a Constitutionally mandated right to bear arms.
Those who believe, as we do, that the Second Amendment does not provide each American with an absolute right to own guns, must recognize that this position can alienate sympathetic listeners and is not likely to prevail any time soon. We must respect the legitimate concerns of law-abiding, safety conscious gun owners, in order to find common ground against unyielding ideologues.
The challenge for the antigun-control side was put well by Mr. Scarborough, who said Monday that he had changed his view of the gun debate as a question of individual rights versus government control, and now sees it as an issue of public safety. There are no rights granted by the Constitution that are so absolute that they erase concerns about public safety and welfare.
There is reason, this time around, to hope that both parties can shake off the N.R.A. Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York pointed out on Sunday that the lobby had failed to defeat Mr. Obama this year. And Representative John Yarmuth, a moderate Democrat from Kentucky, said: ''The National Rifle Association has spent untold millions of dollars instilling fear in our citizens and our politicians. I believe it is more rational to fear guns far more than the illusory political power of the N.R.A.''
In fact, poll after poll has shown that N.R.A. members themselves are not opposed to measures like criminal background checks on gun sellers and gun buyers.

HEADLINE: Daniel Inouye, Hawaii's Quiet Voice of Conscience in Senate, Is Dead at 88

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, who went to Washington at the birth of his state in 1959, dominated public life in the Hawaiian islands for more than 50 years and became a quiet voice of national conscience during the Watergate scandal and the Iran-contra affair, died on Monday in Bethesda, Md. He was 88.
A statement by his Washington office said he had died of respiratory complications at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. His last word was ''aloha,'' the statement said.
A hero of World War II who lost his right arm in combat in Europe, Mr. Inouye, a Democrat, served two terms in the House of Representatives early in his career and was first elected to the Senate in 1962. He was the first Japanese-American elected to both the House and the Senate. 
After the death of his West Virginia colleague Robert C. Byrd in June 2010, Mr. Inouye became the Senate's senior member, with a tenure nearing 48 years, and president pro tempore, making him third in the line of presidential succession, after the vice president and speaker of the House. Mr. Byrd's death also made him the highest-ranking public official of Asian descent in United States history. Months later, he was elected by another overwhelming margin to his ninth consecutive six-year term.
The courtly, soft-spoken Senator Inouye (pronounced in-NO-ay) often deferred publicly to his outspoken and ambitious colleagues, seemingly content behind the scenes to champion Hawaii's interests. He funneled billions of dollars to strengthen the state's economy, promote jobs and protect natural resources.
But as crises arose from time to time, he was called upon to take center stage. In 1973, as a member of the Senate Watergate committee, which investigated illegal activities in President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, he won wide admiration for patient but persistent questioning of the former attorney general John N. Mitchell and the White House aides H. R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman and John Dean.
When the nationally televised hearings ended in 1974, a Gallup poll found that Mr. Inouye had an 84 percent favorable rating, even higher than the committee's folksy chairman, Senator Sam Ervin, Democrat of North Carolina. Months later, Nixon, facing certain impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate, resigned. Many of his closest aides went to prison for their roles in the conspiracy.
In 1976, after revelations of abuse of power by the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other agencies, Mr. Byrd, the majority leader, appointed Mr. Inouye chairman of the Senate Committee on Intelligence, which was established to come up with reforms and monitor clandestine operations. Mr. Byrd hoped Mr. Inouye could win the confidence of a skeptical public and a demoralized intelligence community.
Mr. Inouye largely succeeded. His panel wrote a new intelligence charter, which protected American citizens' rights, established rules for counterintelligence operations inside the United States, barred the use of journalists and clergymen as covert agents, and required the president to certify that covert actions were necessary for national security. President Jimmy Carter praised his ''professionalism and competence.''
Senator Inouye's reputation for integrity made him an ideal choice as chairman of the Senate committee that investigated the Iran-contra affair in 1987. The committee confirmed that high-ranking American officials, acting in violation of President Ronald Reagan's policies and the will of Congress, had secretly sold weapons to Iran and used the profits to support rebels fighting the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
In nationally televised hearings, a joint Senate-House panel, to avoid seeming prosecutorial, gave wide latitude to witnesses, including Lt. Col. Oliver North and Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter. The beribboned former national security officials used that latitude to portray themselves as patriots and their illegal actions as necessary for national survival in a dangerous world.
''That is an excuse for autocracy, not policy,'' an indignant Mr. Inouye said. ''Vigilance abroad does not require us to abandon our ideals or the rule of law at home. On the contrary, without our principles and without our ideals, we have little that is special or worthy to defend.''
He said Colonel North and Admiral Poindexter had deceived Congress and the American people, and were advocating ''a shadow government'' with its own military forces, ''free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself.''
Daniel Ken Inouye was born in Honolulu on Sept. 7, 1924, the oldest of four children of Hyotaro and Kame Imanaga Inouye, who had immigrated from Japan. He graduated from McKinley High School, enrolled in premedical studies at the University of Hawaii and was a medical volunteer at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked in 1941.
In 1943, when the United States Army lifted its ban on Japanese-Americans, Mr. Inouye joined the new 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the first all-nisei volunteer unit. It became the most decorated unit in American military history. In 1944, fighting in Italy and France, he won a battlefield commission to second lieutenant. He was shot in the chest, but the bullet was stopped by two silver dollars in his pocket.
On April 21, 1945, weeks before the end of the war in Europe, he led an assault near San Terenzo, Italy. His platoon was pinned down by three machine guns. Although shot in the stomach, he ran forward and destroyed one emplacement with a hand grenade and another with his submachine gun. He was crawling toward the third when enemy fire nearly severed his right arm, leaving a grenade, in his words, ''clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore.'' He pried it loose, threw it with his left hand and destroyed the bunker. Stumbling forward, he silenced resistance with gun bursts before being hit in the leg and collapsing unconscious.
His mutilated right arm was amputated in a field hospital. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, which was upgraded to the Medal of Honor, America's highest military award, by President Bill Clinton in 2000. (Members of the 442nd were believed to have been denied proper recognition because of their race.) He spent two years in Army hospitals, including one in Michigan where he met Bob Dole and Philip Hart, wounded veterans who would also become senators. Mr. Inouye was discharged as a captain in 1947.
He married Margaret Shinobu Awamura in 1949, and they had a son, Daniel Ken Jr. She died in 2006. In 2008 he married Irene Hirano, who is president of the U.S.-Japan Council, a nonprofit group in Washington. She and his son survive, as do a stepdaughter, Jennifer Hirano, and a granddaughter.
Mr. Inouye graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1950 and received his law degree from George Washington University in 1952. He plunged into politics in Honolulu and was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives in 1954 and to the Territorial Senate in 1958. When Hawaii became a state in 1959, he won the islands' first Congressional seat and became a protégé of Speaker Sam Rayburn and a celebrity in Washington. In 1967 he published a book about his early life, ''Journey to Washington,'' written with Lawrence Elliott.
In the Senate in 1963 Mr. Inouye forged a bond with the Democratic majority leader, Mike Mansfield. He supported the social and civil rights programs of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He also supported the Vietnam War, although he later turned against American involvement in Vietnam. He delivered the keynote address to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, and was mentioned as a possible future vice-presidential candidate.
Senator Inouye's voting record was moderate to liberal, favoring organized labor, consumer protections, abortion rights, education and environmental protections, but also military appropriations. In 1984, he opposed reparations for Japanese-Americans interned in the West during World War II because of suspect loyalties.
''It would be almost impossible to place a price tag on reparations,'' he said. ''It would be insulting even to try to do so.''

HEADLINE: In the Middle: Helping Unhappy Couples

BYLINE: SUSAN SELIGER


HIGHLIGHT: We have consulted marriage counselors and geriatricians to find out what caregivers -- either grown children or one of the spouses involved-- can do to help restore peace and balance to the relationship when a good marriage goes bad. 

 BODY:
A post on Monday discussed the forces that can make an older couple's good marriage suddenly go bad -- an array of subtle, and often-misunderstood, mental, physical and emotional factors that can upset the equilibrium of even the happiest marriages.
Now we have consulted marriage counselors and geriatricians to find out what caregivers -- either the grown children of the couple, or one of the spouses involved-- can do to help restore peace and balance to these relationships. The experts consulted uniformly agreed that even older people can at least take steps to reduce tensions and improve their relationship, even if they cannot actually change. (Really, who can, at any age?)
"Even though the situation may seem overwhelming, take heart," said Dr. Gordon Herz, a psychologist in private practice in Madison, Wisc., who specializes in neuropsychology and rehabilitation psychology. "Couples who have been together for 60 years tend to have worked out ways to manage conflict - or they wouldn't still be together." 
 Retreat to a neutral corner 
When grown children see their parents fight, many want to run and hide. But those who are assuming an increased caregiving role often feel impelled to jump in and "fix" the problem, as they do with the other caregiving issues. 
If you are so inclined, experts speak with one loud voice to advise: Don't!
Trying to act as emotional broker between your parents can backfire. (Now they tell me! Suffice it to say that after one such effort my sister said to me in not exactly the friendliest tone, "Well, that went well, didn't it?") 
"It's better if your parents can find somebody else to talk to than you," said Dr. Nancy K. Schlossberg, professor emerita of counseling psychology at the University of Maryland and the author of "Overwhelmed: Coping With Life's Ups and Downs." 
 Don't give up on marital therapy 
"Marital therapy for individuals over 65 years of age is difficult, since habits of a lifetime are deeply ingrained," stated a study in The Canadian Journal of Medicine, one of the few in the medical literature about marital therapy among older people.
"Yet, in a sense, marital therapy is more crucial for the elderly than for younger patients," the study continued. "At a time when they are least adaptable and most vulnerable to stress and are entering perhaps the most difficult period of their lives, the elderly must learn new methods of relating and coping" because of the physical and mental changes described in our earlier post. 
There's another reason learning to cope with life changes as a couple is even more critical for older couples: Unlike younger couples, the elderly are rarely in a position to leave the marriage and start over. 
 Help at least one spouse get counseling 
What if only half the couple is ready to seek counseling? Not a problem, therapists said. "You want to help the part of the couple that is suffering," said Dr. Elaine Rodino, a therapist in private practice in State College, Penn. "The other person may still be the curmudgeon, but I think of it as the law of physics: When you change one aspect of the formula, things change in the total." 
When dementia affects one of the spouses, therapy can help the caregiving spouse learn coping techniques, "which can reduce the marital discord and stress that can make conditions, especially cognitive difficulties, worse," said Dr. William Dale, chief of geriatrics at the University of Chicago Geriatrics Medicine.
 Consider the general practitioner or internist 
If the couple won't see a marriage counselor or therapist, can a family doctor be of any use? The experts had mixed responses. 
Many pointed out that general practitioners have neither the time nor the training to offer much relationship help, unless the origin of the problem is exclusively physical. Others thought they could be of use, if given a little direction from the family.
"I encourage the kids to talk to the doctor in advance and let him know something is going on - signs of depression or other problems the parents won't talk about," advised Dr. Dale, adding that a consultation with a geriatrician who is more familiar with problems of the aging might be even more productive. "Then the doctor can say, 'Gee, you sound really frustrated or down - are there any reasons we can explore?'" 
 Don't overlook the importance of intimacy 
"Mutually stimulating sexual relationships need care and feeding by both partners at any age, but especially in the geriatric years," according to a study on marital therapy for the elderly. "The need for physical contact, warmth and touching perhaps reaches a peak in this age of loneliness, decreased self-esteem and poor health." 
Forget the idea that elderly couples are too shy to talk about intimacy, insisted Dr. Rodino. "I saw a couple in their 80s, the husband was getting penile injections at the doctor's office, and then they hurried home to have sex."
But Dr. Rodino does concede that for older patients it is especially important to focus not only on sexual function and performance, but on "touching, and non-intercourse sexual relations; I help them rekindle the affection and emotional closeness," Dr. Rodino said.
 Address any neuropsychological issues. 
To find out whether the sudden marital conflict may stem from early mild cognitive impairment (M.C.I.) -or to rule M.C.I. out and find the real source of trouble -- make sure the spouse obtains a full neuropsychological evaluation. If it is M.C.I., "it convinces everybody that there is more than just abstinence, it's not a personality problem -- and they need to address it," said Dr. Dale.
 Don't overlook simple solutions 
"Sometimes a memory problem is something simple, like low vitamin B12, that is easily fixed," said Dr. Dale. "Or hypothyroidism, which is quite common, can affect memory."
In that case, doctors administer synthroid, a thyroid hormone replacement that Dr. Dale said is "very safe, with almost no side effects." Other changes in behavior can also be the result of a simple problem or be remedied by a change in medication. Don't assume the worst.
 Put an end to the blame game 
Help reframe the problem. "Even if dementia is involved, let them know it's not that their partner hates them, it's that he is having cognitive changes," said Dr. Linda Waite, director of the Center on Demography and Economics of Aging at NORC/University of Chicago. 
"When you re-frame it like that, it's easier for the spouse not to take it personally and not blame themselves and feel it's something they did," said Dr. Waite. "It can make a difference." 
A 2009 study in the journal Gerontologist supports this notion: "Care partners likely would benefit from strategies aimed at reducing self-blame, enhancing coping skills and communicating effectively with the person with M.C.I and significant others."
 Separate the anxiety 
Divide and conquer -- time away improves time together.
"Older couples, especially those with disabilities, spend way too much time together," said Dr. Lisa Gwyther, director of the Duke Center for Aging Family Support Program. "It would be a problem for any couple." 
Caregivers can best help by arranging for an activity or outing that each spouse can do separately so they can return to each other refreshed and more cheerful. "That can help a lot," said Dr. Gwyther.
 Dial down the tone 
For spouse caregivers, it is important to watch not just what is said, but how it is said. In any relationship, tone influences our interpretation of what our partner says. Those with M.C.I. will especially react to tone, rather than the substance of the exchange, Dr. Dale said. 
"Ratchet down the emotions, repeat things calmly," Dr. Dale said. The person with cognitive problems doesn't know he asked the same question five times -- he only knows that you sound angry at him for no reason he can fathom. One spouse's anger fuels the other's, and pretty soon there is a fight or withdrawal. 
 Zero tolerance for violence 
If a spouse becomes violent, "that's an entirely different issue," said Dr. Schlossberg. "Call in an expert on family violence" or the police. 
 Help them help others 
Nobody likes feeling dependent and having to ask for help. Finding a way to have your loved one volunteer, help others and continue to feel useful can improve moods and marital interactions - even if M.C.I. is involved.
With one couple Dr. Gwyther saw, the wife was not only "driving her husband nuts because she was asking him the same questions over and over," but she could no longer drive and deliver food in a mobile meals program as she used to. "So her husband agreed to be the driver -- and she took the meals to the doors," Dr. Gwyther recalled."It made her feel good to continue to do that -- and it made them feel good to do it together."
 Caregiver, heal thyself 
You have heard it a million times here and elsewhere but, unlike us, this advice never gets old.
If you are exhausted from caregiving, you are bound to be cranky, and that will make everybody around you edgy and irritable, too -- especially the spouse who requires your care. Taking the time to look after your own health and engage in activities that bring you pleasure can go a long way toward reducing stress and reestablishing a peaceful balance in a marriage.

HEADLINE: Energy Agency Sees Global Coal Boom Unabated, Europe's Binge Temporary

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The global coal surge continues, still led by emerging giants India and China. 

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency's Medium-Term Coal Market Report, issued today in Paris, is essential reading for anyone wishing to maintain a reality-based view of global trends in fuel use. While many energy forecasts end up wrong, on short time scales like this, that's less true.
Some bullet points: The proportion of global energy supplied by coal is approaching that for oil. China and India see unabated growth in coal burning through the next five years. The surge in exports of coal from the United States to Europe should peak soon. 
The news release -- appended below -- says it all, and the findings it describes reinforce my assertion awhile back that there's plenty of denial to go around in the arguments over climate and energy trends and policies. [Dec. 19, 7:34 a.m. | Insert | Tom Zeller Jr. has written a useful analysis of the report for Huffington.]
Anyone making the case that some magical application of a carbon price, in the United States or elsewhere, can ride to the rescue of the climate system is missing the primacy of real-time energy needs over long-term climate concerns.
That doesn't mean there's nothing to be done, of course. Some important advice comes from Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the energy agency, in a Huffington Post piece today:
 First, final energy can be consumed in a more efficient manner, which requires less primary energy, including coal.
 Second, existing technologies that use coal more efficiently can be deployed, particularly in the power sector, which accounts for two-thirds of global coal use. A single, large coal plant, if built with the best-available technology, can reduce emissions by the annual equivalent of taking a million cars off the road compared to the subcritical coal-plant technology still prevalent in most countries.
 Third, new technologies, such as underground coal gasification and especially carbon capture and storage, can - if given substantial financial support - reduce emissions substantially from coal use in power plants and industrial facilities.
 But the biggest hope for reducing emissions from coal may come from policies that encourage its replacement by lower-emission energy sources. A meaningful carbon price can do this, but so can cheap natural gas -- as recent U.S. experience suggests. The boom in unconventional natural gas has prompted U.S. power generators to switch from coal to gas en masse.
The U.S. experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fueled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, CO2 emissions and consumers' electricity bills, without harming energy security. China, Europe and other regions should take note. [ Read the rest. ]
For more, revisit my related post, "Can China Follow U.S. Shift from Coal to Gas?" There's excellent reporting in last month's feature in The Times, "With China and India Ravenous for Energy, Coal's Future Seems Assured."
[9:10 a.m. | Insert | More of the logic in expediting a shift from coal to natural gas in developing countries comes from the latest pollution mortality estimates, as reported in the Global Burden of Disease study in The Lancet.]
Here's an excerpt from the agency news release:
Coal's share of the global energy mix continues to rise, and by 2017 coal will come close to surpassing oil as the world's top energy source, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said today as it released its annual Medium-Term Coal Market Report (MCMR).
Although the growth rate of coal slows from the breakneck pace of the last decade, global coal consumption by 2017 stands at 4.32 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (btoe), versus around 4.40 btoe for oil, based on IEA medium-term projections. The IEA expects that coal demand will increase in every region of the world except in the United States, where coal is being pushed out by natural gas.
"Thanks to abundant supplies and insatiable demand for power from emerging markets, coal met nearly half of the rise in global energy demand during the first decade of the 21st Century," said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. "This report sees that trend continuing. In fact, the world will burn around 1.2 billion more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared to today - equivalent to the current coal consumption of Russia and the United States combined. Coal's share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year, and if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade."
China and India lead the growth in coal consumption over the next five years. The report says China will surpass the rest of the world in coal demand during the outlook period, while India will become the largest seaborne coal importer and second-largest consumer, surpassing the United States....
Amid concern about the impact of Chinese uncertainty on coal markets, the report offers a Chinese Slowdown Case. This scenario shows that even if Chinese GDP growth were to slow to a 4.6% average over the period, coal demand would still increase both globally and in China - indicating that coal demand is not likely to stop growing even with more bearish economic perspectives.

HEADLINE: Nielsen to Buy Arbitron for $1.26 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Nielsen Holdings has reached a deal to acquire Arbitron, the radio ratings company, for $1.26 billion. 

 BODY:
Nielsen Holdings said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire Arbitron, the radio ratings company, for $1.26 billion.
The offer of $48 a share in cash for each outstanding share of Arbitron represents a premium of 26 percent to Arbitron's closing price on Monday. 
The deal will unite two of the best-known measurement companies in the television and radio industries. More than 50 years after their creation, the Nielsen ratings still help determine the fate of many American TV shows. And Arbitron has been one of the top radio ratings watchers for decades.
 Both companies have been steadily remaking themselves in the Internet age, adding ways to track online and mobile programming to their offerings. In March, Nielsen announced the introduction of "cross-platform campaign ratings" that tracks advertising both on television and online.
And Arbitron has sought to capture newer forms of listening with its Portable People Meter, a pagerlike device that monitors codes embedded into both traditional radio and online broadcasts. 
Shares in Nielsen rose nearly 3 percent in premarket trading, to $30.50, while those in Arbitron leaped about 25 percent, to $47.38.
"U.S. consumers spend almost 2 hours a day with radio. It is and will continue to be a vibrant and important advertising medium," Nielsen's chief executive, David L. Calhoun, said in a statement. "Arbitron will help Nielsen better solve for unmeasured areas of media consumption, including streaming audio and out-of-home. The high level of engagement with radio and TV among rapidly growing multicultural audiences makes this central to Nielsen`s priorities."
The two companies have combined revenue of $6 billion and an annual profit of about $346 million. 
Nielsen expects the deal to add about 13 cents a share to its pro forma earnings per share beginning a year after it closes, with about $20 million in cost savings.
Nielsen says it has a financing commitment for the full amount of the transaction. 
One of Arbitron's biggest shareholders, Blue Harbour Group, said on Tuesday that it supports the deal. The hedge fund, whose 5 percent stake makes it the fourth-largest investor in the company, said that the sale to Nielsen will likely please the advertisers and programmers who are Arbitron's key customers.
"Not only is it a good transaction for shareholders, it really does what all these customers are asking for," said Robb LeMasters, a managing director at the hedge fund.

HEADLINE: Cerberus to Sell Gunmaker Amid Public Pressure

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management said on Tuesday that it would immediately sell its controlling stake in the Freedom Group. | Morgan Stanley is paying a $5 million fine for its role in Facebook's market debut. | Two former hedge fund managers were found guilty on Monday of fraud and conspiracy. | Banks are pushing for rules that would shield them from homeowner lawsuits. 

 BODY:
CERBERUS TO SELL STAKE IN GUNMAKER | The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management said on Tuesday that it would immediately sell its controlling stake in the Freedom Group, the company that makes the rifle that was used to kill 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., on Friday. "It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level," Cerberus said in a statement.
The move follows pressure from the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which said on Monday that it was reviewing its investment in Cerberus's funds. Cerberus said on Tuesday that the decision to sell its stake "allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so." Cerberus plans to retain a financial adviser to sell its stake and then return the capital to investors. 
A number of big gun companies are backed by Wall Street firms, which have a fiduciary duty to maximize investor returns, Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote in the DealBook column before Cerberus's announcement. "Perhaps it should not be a surprise, but Wall Street will hardly take a leadership position in the conversation about gun control." By selling its stake in Freedom, Cerberus may be able to sidestep the gun control debate and avoid unwanted publicity.
Eliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York and the former New York State attorney general, also put pressure on Cerberus on Monday. "Every student at a university should ask the university if it is invested in Cerberus," Mr. Spitzer wrote in Slate. "Every member of a union should ask their pension-fund managers if they are invested. Information is the key first step. From there, action will quickly follow."
MORGAN STANLEY FINED OVER FACEBOOK I.P.O. | Morgan Stanley is paying a $5 million fine for its role in Facebook's market debut, in the first major regulatory action related to the social network's I.P.O. The firm was accused by Massachusetts's top financial authority of improperly influencing the offering.
The regulator's claims center on a senior Morgan Stanley banker, Michael Grimes, who isn't named in the consent order, DealBook's Susanne Craig and Ben Protess report. William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, asserts that the senior banker coached Facebook on how to share information with stock analysts, potentially violating the regulatory settlement on stock research that Wall Street firms signed in 2003. Mr. Galvin says those actions hurt ordinary investors who didn't have access to the same research. "The broader message here is, we are going to use any means possible to enforce the strict code in place about giving out information," Mr. Galvin told DealBook.
The Morgan Stanley banker was portrayed by Mr. Galvin was being personally involved in crucial elements of Facebook's communication with investors. When a Facebook executive called analysts after the company filed an amended prospectus that detailed a slowdown in revenue, "Morgan Stanley's senior investment banker did everything but make the phone calls himself," the regulator said. "He not only rehearsed with Facebook's treasurer who placed the calls to the research analysts, but he also drafted the majority of the script Facebook's treasurer utilized." Morgan Stanley neither admitted nor denied the accusations, and Mr. Grimes has not personally been accused of wrongdoing.
2 MORE CONVICTIONS IN INSIDER TRADING CRACKDOWN | Two former hedge fund managers, Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, were found guilty on Monday of fraud and conspiracy, the latest convictions in the government's campaign to root out insider trading. Juries in Federal District Court in Manhattan have now convicted all 11 insider-trading defendants who have taken their cases to trial since 2009. Of the 72 people charged with insider trading crimes, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has secured 71 guilty pleas or convictions.
Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said Mr. Newman and Mr. Chiasson "join the ranks of high-level investment fund managers who are being made to answer for their extraordinarily bad risk-reward analysis about what is right and what is wrong." The firms where they worked were founded by former employees of SAC Capital Advisors, the hedge fund whose boss, Steven A. Cohen, has become a focus of the government's inquiry. The two defendants sat stone-faced as the jury foreman announced the guilty verdict on Monday. Their sentencing is set for April 19.
FOR BANKS, A SHIELD FROM HOMEOWNER LAWSUITS | DealBook's Peter Eavis writes: "As regulators complete new mortgage rules, banks are about to get a significant advantage: protection against homeowner lawsuits. The rules are meant to help bolster the housing market. By shielding banks from potential litigation, policy makers contend that the industry will have a powerful incentive to make higher quality home loans." But the fear is that borrowers are losing an important safeguard. "A lot of bad things are done in the name of expanding access to credit, as we found out," said Sheila C. Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and now a senior adviser to the Pew Charitable Trusts.
 ON THE AGENDA | A Senate Banking subcommittee holds a hearing on computerized trading at 9:30 a.m., asking, "What should the rules of the road be?" The Jefferies Group reports earnings before the market opens, and Oracle announces results this evening. John Mack, Morgan Stanley's former leader, is on CNBC at 8 a.m. Jeffrey Gundlach of Doubleline Capital is on Bloomberg TV at 11 a.m. The billionaire financier Kenneth Langone is on CNBC at at 4:30 p.m.
WAL-MART'S AGGRESSIVE BRIBERY IN MEXICO | Wal-Mart shut down an internal investigation into bribery at its Mexican subsidiary, but The New York Times "has now picked up where Wal-Mart's internal investigation was cut off." In the latest installment in a series, The Times "reveals that Wal-Mart de Mexico was not the reluctant victim of a corrupt culture that insisted on bribes as the cost of doing business. Nor did it pay bribes merely to speed up routine approvals. Rather, Wal-Mart de Mexico was an aggressive and creative corrupter, offering large payoffs to get what the law otherwise prohibited. It used bribes to subvert democratic governance - public votes, open debates, transparent procedures. It used bribes to circumvent regulatory safeguards that protect Mexican citizens from unsafe construction. It used bribes to outflank rivals."

HEADLINE: Jefferies Posts $71.6 Million Profit in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The investment bank said on Tuesday that it earned about $71.6 million in profit for the fourth quarter, up 48 percent from the same time a year ago as its core businesses showed marked improvement. 

 BODY:
The Jefferies Group is ending its life as an independent firm on a pleasant note: with a solid quarterly profit.
The investment bank said on Tuesday that it earned about $71.6 million in profit for the fourth quarter, up 48 percent from the same time a year ago as its core businesses showed marked improvement. 
It is the firm's last earnings report before Jefferies expects to complete its takeover by the Leucadia National Corporation, a conglomerate that patterned itself after Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Under the terms of that deal, the Wall Street firm will become a subsidiary of the bigger company, but will remain essentially intact.
The firm's top managers are staying in place, although Richard B. Handler, Jefferies' chief executive, will assume that role for all of Leucadia.
"As we end 2012, a new era is on the horizon for Jefferies," Mr. Handler said on a call with analysts. "We believe our imminent merger with Leucadia will result in an even stronger Jefferies, as well as making us more distinguished from our bank holding company competitors."
The management team spent much of the call talking about how well the firm performed in the three months that ended Nov. 30. Excluding a number of onetime expenses, including costs and donations to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, Jefferies earned about $81 million. That amounts to 35 cents a share.
Analysts on average expected a quarterly profit of 34 cents a share, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
The firm's trading division reported a more than sixfold increase in revenue, to $242.1 million, with its mainstay of buying and selling fixed-income products doubling its revenue from the year-ago period. 
Investment banking posted a smaller 8 percent increase, to $283 million, as raising equity and debt financing for clients more than covered a drop in deal advisory fees.
Jefferies' management team said on the call that being owned by Leucadia would present new opportunities, principally by giving the firm a much bigger balance sheet to extend its banking and trading businesses. The deep pockets of its new owner, executives said, would help bolster the firm at a time when bigger rivals were facing tougher regulatory pressure that could limit their profitability.
And the environment for Jefferies is improving as well. Mr. Handler cited a calming of the European debt crisis, an emerging recovery in the United States economy and companies having big cash piles to invest as positive factors for growth.

HEADLINE: How Local Tax Rates Affect High-Income Professionals

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: What impact do high state and local taxes have on Wall Street executives and fund managers? The example of professional athletes offers some insights. 

 BODY:
Jeremy Lin of the Houston Rockets returned on Monday night to Madison Square Garden, which used to be his home court in the days of Linsanity not so long ago. Mr. Lin thrived on the energy of the New York crowd, but one thing he probably doesn't miss is the taxes. 
Neither Texas nor Houston has an income tax, saving him about a million dollars a year. 
The prospect of higher marginal tax rates in states like New York and California raises concerns about the impact of taxes on the behavior of high-income individuals. Will Wall Street executives and fund managers flee to low-tax jurisdictions like Florida and Texas? 
 Some argue that higher state and local taxes are self-defeating, encouraging the rich to move to cheaper locales, work less or restructure investments to avoid tax. Others point out that higher taxes pay for public goods like better schools and public parks, making some locations more attractive places to live and work despite (or because of) the higher taxes. 
How sensitive are high-income individuals to marginal tax rates? One challenge in the research is finding good data on the salaries and the behavioral responses of the rich. People tend to hold salary information close to the vest. 
But there is one group of highly paid professionals whose salaries and relocation behavior are public: professional athletes. Two new papers in the Journal of Sports Economics use variation in state tax rates to test how sensitive these athletes' salaries are to state and local taxes. 
One paper, by the economists James Alm, Bill Kaempfer and Edward Batte Sennoga, investigates whether differences in state and local individual income taxes in major league baseball cities affects free-agent player salaries. It does. 
The extensive data on baseball player performance helps the econometric effort here: the study's model estimates what salary a free agent ought to be able to get on the open market, and then looks to see how much the variation in state and local taxes accounts for the variation from this estimate. As the authors point out, while the past statistical performance of baseball players isn't a perfect proxy for future performance, it is a pretty good predictor of future salary, which is what matters for the study. 
The authors' basic specification finds that each percentage point of an income tax raises free-agent salaries by $21,000 to $24,000. This means that low-tax locales like Florida and Texas have a "home field advantage" in the free-agent market. 
In other words, state and local taxes are capitalized into salaries, with teams in high-tax jurisdictions forced to offer higher pretax salaries. Free agents indeed negotiate with an eye toward after-tax income. At least in baseball, the presence of higher local taxes doesn't typically affect the quality of teams, as owners adjust the salary offers to account for tax. Those taxes do, however, put the owners of teams in high-tax jurisdictions at a competitive disadvantage in the sense that they must pay more to get comparable free agents.
In the N.B.A., the luxury tax acts as a more effective constraint on player salaries than it does in Major League Baseball. The second paper, by Nolan Kopkin, a Ph.D. student at Cornell University, looks at the effect that variation in state and local income tax rates have on the labor migration decisions of N.B.A. free agents. The study finds that an increase in the marginal income tax rate leads to a decrease in the average skill of the N.B.A. free agents that migrate to that team. Unlike in baseball, basketball teams in high-tax jurisdictions actually end up with a worse free-agent talent pool, all else equal.
These papers confirm the broader point that the economic incidence of a tax may not fall on the nominal taxpayer. In baseball, the players do not shoulder the burden of the tax. The economic burden may fall on the owners themselves, in the form of lower profits, or perhaps the fans in the form of higher ticket prices. While the players technically remit the tax, they are no worse off on an after-tax basis. 
In basketball, by contrast, taxes aren't fully capitalized into salaries. On the margin, the better players migrate to lower-tax jurisdictions. In a sense, the fans pay an implicit tax in the form of teams that perform worse. 
Of course, because of the unique nature of the data set, the broader policy implications of these papers are somewhat limited. For most employers outside professional sports, there is no luxury tax or salary cap. Most employers are probably more like a baseball team, with its relatively ineffective luxury tax, than an N.B.A. team. As state and local marginal tax rates rise, we can expect higher salaries to partially offset the higher taxes. 
On the other hand, behavioral responses to tax are constrained by frictions, like the cost of moving and the limited availability of comparable job opportunities. It's easier for Mr. Lin to move to Houston than it is for a star trader or investment banker. 
These papers do serve as a useful reminder that if the goal is to remedy income inequality, state and local taxes are a weak policy instrument. To the extent that tax policy is used to achieve redistribution, redistribution should take place at the federal level. (Few people will give up citizenship to avoid taxes.) State and local taxes should be used to pay for public goods like infrastructure, parks, law enforcement and schools. 
For further reading on the impact of state and local tax rates on player salaries, see James Alm, William Kaempfer, and Edward Batte Sennoga, Baseball Salaries and Income Taxes: The 'Home Field Advantage' of Income Taxes on Free Agent Salaries, and Nolan Kopkin, Tax Avoidance: How Income Tax Rates Affect the Labor Migration Decisions of NBA Free Agents, both in volume 13 of the Journal of Sports Economics (2012).

 Owners of Hyundai and Kia vehicles with overstated gas mileage ratings will have until at least the end of 2013 to register for compensation, The Detroit News reports. In letters to Senator Jay Rockefeller, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, the companies said owners have until December 2013 to register at the Web sites hyundaimpginfo.com or kiampginfo.com. There's also a possibility that the deadline will be extended, the South Korean automakers said. Owners will not have to waive their legal rights to get a reimbursement, and dealers will be compensated for participating in the program. (The Detroit News) 
 Despite the buffeting the economy has taken in the last few years, Americans are making their car payments on time, The Detroit Free Press reports. The 60-day delinquency rate for car loans is expected to reach a near-record low level of 0.36 percent at the end of this year, compared with 0.86 percent at the end of 2008, said Peter Turek, a spokesman for TransUnion, which based the delinquency rates on a random sample of 27 million anonymous consumer records. "Through the recession dealers and lenders, I think, learned something," said Mr. Turek. "Now they are putting consumers in the right vehicle with the right loan terms."(The Detroit Free Press)

Just last week, Honeywell announced that she had been elected to its board of directors. Her new G.M. appointment takes effect immediately. (Bloomberg News)
 An official in Smithtown, N.Y., is urging New York state legislators to pass a law requiring that cars damaged in Hurricane Sandy be scrapped for salvage so they cannot be sold without revealing the damage they suffered. "People all over the country are going to end up buying cars they think are good but were under three feet of water," Councilman Thomas McCarthy, a former auto dealer, told Newsday. "They should basically take every single one of these cars and just shred them." (Newsday)

HEADLINE: Manhattan Theater Club and Ars Nova Announce Recipients of Inaugural Commissions

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: The inaugural commissions will go to Thomas Bradshaw ("Job"), Samuel D. Hunter ("The Whale"), and Sharyn Rothstein ("The Invested"); a fourth commission will be shared by Adam Bock ("A Small Fire") and Justin Levine ("Bonfire Night"), who are developing a new musical. 

 BODY:
Two prominent New York theaters, Manhattan Theater Club and Ars Nova, announced on Tuesday that they have chosen five playwrights as the first recipients of their new Writer's Room commissions. The commissions are worth between $5,000 and $10,000 a piece and are geared to developing works for possible Off Broadway productions at the theaters. The inaugural commissions will go to Thomas Bradshaw ("Job"), Samuel D. Hunter ("The Whale"), and Sharyn Rothstein ("The Invested"); a fourth commission will be shared by Adam Bock ("A Small Fire") and Justin Levine ("Bonfire Night"), who are developing a new musical.
Such commissions are increasingly common as nonprofit theaters try to forge stronger ties with their favorite writers, enabling them financially to remain playwrights (rather than move into television and film work) and helping spur new works that might run in the theaters someday. Mr. Hunter, for one, whose Off Broadway play "The Whale" has made him a hot commodity, is juggling commissions for several theaters nationwide and is also already a member of the Playwrights Ensemble group at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago. 
The Writer's Room grew out of a collaboration in 2008 when Ars Nova turned to Manhattan Theater Club, which has larger budgets and facilities, about producing a new play by Liz Flahive, "From Up Here," that Ars Nova had developed but did not have the space and money to stage itself. "From Up Here" opened at the club that spring to good reviews, but the national economic recession that year limited the abilities of the two theaters (like many others) to spend money on new programs like the Writer's Room.
"We wanted to do this again, but on purpose this time," said Mandy Greenfield, the artistic producer of Manhattan Theater Club, in an interview on Tuesday. "And now we have four new commissions that would not have existed if we had not come together."
She said the commissions have been financed out of the budgets of the two theaters, but added that they would seek private and foundation support for the Writer's Room as well. The plan is to award four commissions annually, though the writers would not be expected to finish work in a single year. Full productions are not guaranteed, but Ms. Greenfield said she hoped some of the new works would run at the club's newly configured space, MTC Studio at Stage II, where the critically praised "Murder Ballad" just concluded its run. (Some theater producers have expressed interest in remounting "Murder Ballad" elsewhere in New York, but those discussions are nascent and Ms. Greenfield declined to comment on them.)
Ars Nova, a more experimental theater company than Manhattan Theater Club, recently had a critical and audience hit with "Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812," which also may re-open elsewhere next year. Jason Eagan, artistic director of Ars Nova, said that his small theater had only so much flexibility to extend shows like "The Great Comet" and produce newly commissioned works - hence the decision to team up with Manhattan Theater Club.
"We want Ars Nova to remain a very focused boutique theater," he said, "but we also want to commission more writers and not be limited by our producing resources."

HEADLINE: The True Burden of Government

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Conservatives believe there is a sharp line between taxes and spending, but some tax cuts are just a form of spending and some benefit cuts are the same as tax increases, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Famously, Milton Friedman always said that the true burden of government is what it spends, not what it taxes. While correct up to a point, his statement has unfortunately led many conservatives to believe that the budget deficit is of no economic importance. That is to say, they believe there is nothing to be gained by reducing the deficit unless it results from lower spending, because that and that alone reduces the burden of government, and reducing the burden of government is the only thing that will raise growth. 
However, as I explained last week, there is a cost from deficits in the form of interest on the debt. If government revenues are too low to finance the level of spending that voters insist upon, spending automatically rises. Eventually, interest on the debt can only be paid with higher taxes, even if all spending except for interest is abolished.
Put another way, the amount of future spending cuts or tax increases necessary to stabilize government finances will always have to be larger when spending increases or tax cuts are deficit-financed. That is because interest increases the size of the future fiscal adjustment. Compounding means that the longer an adjustment is put off, the larger it must eventually be. And of course, debt default is simply a form of tax that falls disproportionately on bondholders; inflation is a tax paid by everyone.

Additionally, government borrowing has effects on the economy independent of spending in general. The economic impact of spending depends on what it is for and that impact may be positive or negative. Conservatives often imply that all spending reduces growth by pre-empting resources that the private sector could use better. But unless one believes that anarchy maximizes growth, that is nonsense.
Government borrowing necessarily takes money out of capital markets, crowding out private investors who would otherwise use those funds for business expansion, new plants and equipment or other business purposes. Such crowding out may be modest today, mainly because a slowdown in growth has sharply reduced the demand for capital. Should growth strengthen, federal borrowing could become a major constraint on investment.
Obviously, many forms of spending greatly increase growth. Military spending protects us from threats from abroad, the police and courts protect our lives and property, schools raise the quality of the labor force, and public works like roads are vital to commerce, to name just a few examples.
Moreover, conservatives tend to believe that to the extent that taxation imposes a burden on the economy, it is largely in its aggregate form. That is, the total amount of revenue collected constitutes the burden of taxation; therefore, all tax cuts are per se stimulative to growth.
To the extent that the tax structure imposes a burden, it is only in the form of its effects at the margin, on the last dollar earned, conservatives believe. They deny that tax expenditures, special provisions of the tax code that cause individuals and businesses to spend or invest in particular ways, diminish growth.
Conservatives may acknowledge that tax expenditures are inferior to rate reductions in stimulating growth, but in practice conservative groups like Americans for Tax Reform, the misnamed organization run by the Republican tax guru Grover Norquist, support every single new tax expenditure because they think all tax cuts are per se good and always better than an equivalent government spending program for the same purpose.
Such groups also oppose any elimination of tax expenditures as a tax increase that will impose an unconscionable burden on the economy and diminish political pressure to cut spending. But in the real world there is no meaningful economic difference between direct spending and spending through the tax code.
If spending diminishes growth it has to be because resources are misallocated. But tax expenditures also misallocate resources. The idea that there is a significant difference between a misallocation resulting from the receipt of a government check and one resulting from a special tax deal is nonsense.
Conservatives cannot acknowledge this because it would lead them to accept the fact that eliminating tax expenditures, even if not accompanied by offsetting tax cuts, might raise growth for the same reason that cutting spending raises growth in their economic model.
Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, has been asserting for years that many tax expenditures are identical to spending in all but name and are nothing but giveaways with no economic benefit except to the recipients. On Dec. 13, he released a new list of egregious tax loopholes that should be abolished and raise $130 billion of additional revenue over the next decade.
His view has led to a war of words with Mr. Norquist for several years. Writing in The New York Times, Senator Coburn explained that the Norquist tax pledge, which opposes any tax increase for any reason, is ultimately counterproductive on Mr. Norquist's own terms. The deficit, Senator Coburn says, is a type of tax increase on future generations. And by increasing the likelihood of a future debt crisis, the pledge virtually assures future explicit tax increases in the form of higher interest rates and debasement of the currency.
Conservatives believe that slashing entitlement programs like Medicare is the key to avoiding a future tax increase. But for those who will have to work longer before qualifying for Medicare or spend more out of pocket to compensate for cuts in medical benefits, these effects are little different to them than the equivalent tax increase. What really is the difference to them of paying $1,000 more a year because of Medicare cuts or $1,000 more in taxes?
In short, the black-or-white distinction between taxes and spending, which conservatives believe to their core, is much more complex when looking at specific policies. Tax expenditures can be de facto spending and benefit cuts may be de facto tax increases.
The goal of public policy should be to use the policy instrument best suited to the nature of a problem. A tax incentive may simply work better than the equivalent spending program or vice versa. There is no reason to think, as conservatives do, that a tax cut is always superior to direct spending or that spending constitutes an economic burden while tax expenditures are costless.

HEADLINE: The Gentleman Action-Hero From Hawaii

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: R.I.P. Senator Daniel Inouye, who blended the virtues of political courage, dedication and modesty. 

 BODY:
It was odd but gratifying to see the way Senator Daniel Inouye, who died yesterday in Washington at age 88 after serving Hawaii in Congress for more than 50 years, was praised in multiple dimensions today. The New York Times obituarystressed his "quiet," "courtly," "soft-spoken" nature, painting a portrait of a deferential man plucked from obscurity now and then for various important jobs (like the Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings). Awestruck bloggers and commenters at sites like Reddit, meanwhile, focused more on the senator as an action hero, someone out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Many of them had apparently just found out what Mr. Inouye did in World War II-an amazing story that was in all the obits and on his Medal of Honor citation, and is now in Badass Digest, under the headline "The Time Daniel Inouye Pried a Grenade From His Severed Arm." 
The Senate has hardly lacked for combat-proven veterans; names that spring to mind include Cleland, Dole, Kennedy (John), Kerrey, Kerry and McCain. Mr. Inouye was unusual in belonging to a group of Americans who served after having been betrayed by their own country. One reason his unit, the all-Japanese-American 442d Regimental Combat Team, won a record number of battle citations-besides its members' bravery and skill, of course-was that it was treated as cannon fodder, sent on suicidal missions by leaders who considered these troops more dispensable than others. Mr. Inouye rose to the challenge, eager to prove a loyalty that should never have been questioned.

Mr. Inouye's service was long and distinguished and doesn't need repeating here. It's worth pointing out, though, how thoroughly he blended the virtues of political courage, dedication and modesty. He was a committee chairman with seniority and power, a disabled veteran with a stellar military pedigree, but he was a low-key fellow. For decades he was an unabashed deliverer of mountains of federal aid to Hawaii (Mr. Inouye was stubborn in defending the virtuous use of earmarks to poor, far-off states that need government help for infrastructure and other economic development). But you won't find the Inouye name on buildings, roads or bridges throughout the islands; he was not that kind of pol.

HEADLINE: Arbitron Deal Would Extend Nielsen's Reach Into Consumer Habits

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: Nielsen said the deal would increase the total amount of time in a given day it could track the listening and viewing habits of the average American to seven hours from the current five. 

 BODY:
 7:54 p.m. | Updated Consumers today are gleaners of information, moving swiftly from cellphones to newspapers, tablets to radio and social media to television. The question for advertisers is how to reach them across a fragmented environment.
The potential for tracking consumers wherever they go was the rationale behind the announcement on Tuesday that Nielsen Holdings, the company that decades ago standardized the television advertising market through its ratings system, had reached an agreement , Arbitron, for $1.26 billion. 
The deal, which is subject to approval by federal regulators, would expand Nielsen's already extensive portfolio of tools to analyze consumers' overlapping media habits. According to Nielsen, it would also increase the number of hours a day that it can monitor an average American's media consumption, to seven from the current five.
"That is a very big deal when your job is to measure how consumers ultimately form and change behaviors," David L. Calhoun, Nielsen's chief executive, said in a conference call with investors and Wall Street analysts.
Nielsen is best known for its TV ratings, but it also tracks sales of books, music and other consumer products, and measures media habits online. On Monday, the company announced a partnership with Twitter to rank television shows by their levels of social media chatter.
Its goal is to gain as thorough a picture of consumer behavior as possible to allow advertisers and media companies to make more effective investments.
"These integrated, innovative capabilities will enable broader measurement of consumer media behavior in more markets around the world," Steve Hasker, Nielsen's president of global media products and advertiser solutions, said in a statement.
So far, though, the idea of a complete picture of consumer media behavior is still elusive, and there is no guarantee that the addition of Arbitron would provide it.
"You want them to be able to stitch everything together as seamlessly as possible," said Jed Meyer, a former Nielsen executive who is the United States director of research at the Annalect Group, part of the Omnicom Media Group, the media division of Omnicom Group. "That's the promise, but the question for this and other mergers is whether they can execute."
The merger has the potential to bring together the two companies' complementary strengths. Nielsen collects a broad amount of data from television, retail and the Internet, and has wide global reach, but analysts say that it has had little success tracking consumers' habits while they are on the go.
Arbitron, however, does just a fraction of its business outside the United States but in recent years has been exploring new methods of mobile tracking. Its Portable People Meter, a pager-size device, has given the radio industry a far more detailed picture of its audience than was available before.
A combined Nielsen-Arbitron, several radio executives and analysts said, could help draw advertising to the medium. Last year ad spending was $17.4 billion, flat from the year before and still down about 18 percent from prerecession levels, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau.
Radio consumption has held strong in the Internet age, as people stay plugged in to their favorite stations, particularly while driving. According to Arbitron's most recent statistics, more than 241 million people in the United States, or about 92 percent of the population age 12 and over, listen to the radio each week. And unlike television, a large majority of the ads on broadcast radio are for local businesses.
The proposed merger has also drawn concerns about consolidation in the global media research field, which has become dominated by a handful of firms like Kantar Media, comScore, Ipsos and now potentially the combined Nielsen-Arbitron.
"Nielsen is no stranger to radio," said Paul Heine, a senior editor at the trade publication Inside Radio. "It has measured it before as an alternative to Arbitron, and there is some concern in the radio business that it further tightens the monopoly on measurement."
But several analysts said that given Arbitron's relatively small size, the deal was not likely to face major hurdles with regulators. Nielsen, active in more than 100 countries, had $5.5 billion in revenue last year. Arbitron had $422 million in revenue last year, but, with $53 million in net income, had wider profit margins.
Among the other hopes for the merger were that it could lead to more measurement of online services and link Arbitron's value for local advertising with Nielsen's more extensive, national data.
Despite the growth of Internet radio, services like Pandora, which has more than 60 million regular listeners, is not tracked by Arbitron and therefore lacks "apples to apples" audience data to lure potential advertisers. Such measurements have been sought after by advertisers, particularly as major broadcasters like Clear Channel Communications embrace online radio, but Arbitron has been slow to introduce a system that would put online and offline listening on equal footing.
Laura Martin, an entertainment and media analyst at Needham & Company, said that Nielsen's expertise and its aggressive push into online markets could be an advantage in exploiting Arbitron's local radio data.
"It's interesting that they will have the management I.Q. of Nielsen in charge of local advertising possibilities," Ms. Martin said. "The Internet is moving at the speed of light, and the next big promise of advertising cash is sitting in local. In Nielsen's hands those relationships may turn into something that Arbitron didn't think of."

HEADLINE: New Leader for Pearson Unit That Includes Financial Times

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: John Ridding, the current chief executive of the newspaper, will run the FT Group, a subsidiary of Pearson that includes the newspaper and half of The Economist magazine. 

 BODY:
John Ridding will take over as chief executive of the FT Group, a subsidiary of Pearson that includes The Financial Times and half of The Economist, the company said Tuesday. 
Mr. Ridding, who has served as chief executive of the Financial Times since 2006, will replace Rona Fairhead. Ms. Fairhead said last month that she would be leaving the London-based media conglomerate in April. Her resignation followed the departure of Marjorie Scardino, who had served as chief executive of Pearson for nearly 16 years.
A long-time newspaperman and Asia hand, Mr. Ridding previously served as editor and publisher of the Asian edition of The Financial Times, and chairman of Pearson in Asia. He spearheaded the development of the newspaper's Chinese language Web site and introduced China Confidential, a source of business intelligence related to Chinese trade.
Pearson's high-level departures have sparked speculation that the company could decide to sell The Financial Times. The FT Group has been slimmed down in recent years to include a handful of core assets.
Mr. Ridding's background and appointment signals that the group is firmly centered on the business daily, with its distinctive bisque-colored newsprint, and its prominence in fast-growing Asian markets. Both Bloomberg L.P. and Thomson Reuters have emerged as likely buyers. A Pearson spokesman has said the newspaper is not for sale.

HEADLINE: Kenneth Chenault's Crisis Years

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The White House is said to be considering Mr. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, for a post in President Obama's cabinet. If an offer materializes, the actions of American Express during the 2008 financial crisis will no doubt be closely examined. 

 BODY:
It is sure to come up: What did Kenneth I. Chenault do during the bailouts?
The White House is said to be considering Mr. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, for a post in President Obama's cabinet, according to Bloomberg News. The article mentions that the executive could be in the running for the Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary. 
If an offer from the White House materializes and Mr. Chenault accepts it, the actions of American Express during the 2008 financial crisis will no doubt be closely examined. 
So how might Mr. Chenault's actions be assessed? Pretty favorably, actually. 
As with many other banks, the government took an equity stake in American Express under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. While it received $3.4 billion under the program in January 2009, the company paid the money back six months later.
American Express participated in other types of bailouts, but, again, its participation was small compared to others. In one particularly advantageous program, the government guaranteed the bonds that financial companies issued. American Express tapped the program briefly at the end of 2008, raising $5.9 billion. That's nothing compared to General Electric's financial arm, which issued over $50 billion of the guaranteed debt, and used the program for many months. 
Then there was the alphabet soup of bailouts provided by the Federal Reserve. American Express participated in two of these. Under one of the programs, the Federal Reserve set up a special fund to buy short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. It bought $4.5 billion of American Express, far less than the $16 billion sold by General Electric's financial arm.
American Express's name also pops up on a Fed facility that gave loans to investors to buy bonds backed by things like loan repayments. The facility financed the purchase of $1.1 billion of bonds backed by American Express credit card loans. Almost nothing in the scheme of things.
But something happened in the heat of the crisis that might make Mr. Chenault vulnerable. In the midst of the 2008 panic, the Fed allowed American Express to become a bank holding company, a status that allowed the credit card lender to fully participate in government bailouts. 
Before the shift, American Express was part of the shadow banking system, the name given to financial companies that weren't regulated like banks. The Fed cited "exigent and unusual circumstances" in approving American Express's transition. 
One of American Express's weak spots going into the crisis was that it was overly dependent on potentially skittish short-term market borrowings to fund its business. When American Express became a bank holding company, Mr. Chenault acknowledged the need to change, saying, "We will continue to build a larger deposit base to broaden our funding sources." Deposits are considered less flighty than short-term market borrowing. 
American Express appears to have delivered on that. It has $37 billion of customer deposits today, versus $12 billion in 2008.
His detractors may find fodder for criticism elsewhere, like his compensation. In 2009, 2010 and 2011 combined he made a total of $57 million.

HEADLINE: Dietary Seat Belts

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Preventing chronic diseases is not a matter of technology or of miracles, but of policy. 

 BODY:
Here's some good news: Seat belts save lives[1] . So do vaccinations. The world's population is living longer. The childhood obesity rate has declined[2] in parts of the United States.
That's miraculous, because the policies for food, energy, climate change and health care are, effectively, "let's help big producers make as much money as they can regardless of the consequences."
Except for just after the most visible tragedies, public health and welfare are barely part of the daily conversation. When New York is flooded, climate change dominates TV news - for a week. When innocents are slaughtered with weapons designed for combat, gun control is a critical topic - for a week. When 33 people die violent, painful deaths from eating cantaloupe, food safety is in the headlines - for a week. When nearly 70,000 people die a year, from mostly preventable diabetes, most media ignore it. 
Forget the fiscal cliff: we've long since fallen off the public health cliff. We need consistent policies that benefit a majority of our citizens, even if it costs corporations money.

And guns are just the bloodiest public health menace to go virtually unregulated. [3] Preventable, chronic disease - to a large extent brought about by diet - is now the biggest killer on the planet. Soda kills more people than guns - more people than car wrecks - only less dramatically. What we need is the equivalent of a dietary seat belt.
When we hear about extended life expectancy on a global scale[4] , we're hearing about the triumph of public health policies - from municipal water treatment and delivery to sewer systems and immunizations. We're also hearing about health care that extends lives despite chronic disease, a triumph of expensive technology over thoughtful, less expensive planning.
And we're hearing about the failure of policy to address the leading public health challenge of the 21st century: not finding a "cure" for our leading killers - coronary artery and related disease, cancer, diabetes (which jumped from the world's 15th rated killer to its 9th in 20 years) - but taking easily defined action to prevent them[5] .
The global burden of disease report found an impressive decrease in childhood mortality and deaths from malnutrition but also found a doubling of deaths from diabetes since 1990. Stroke and heart disease - not exclusively the result of obesity, but tied to it - are together responsible for a quarter of all deaths worldwide.
Malnutrition in the form of overeating is now a bigger problem than starvation, and both are preventable by sane policy measures that could make decent and real food available to all. Contrary to the hysterical preaching of techno-agriculturalists, there already is enough real food to feed everyone on the planet; there simply isn't access[6].
Preventing chronic diseases - for the first time in history responsible for the majority of deaths - would not require massive public works programs like building water delivery or sewer systems but simply regulating the quality of our food and the quantity of the nonfood we allow ourselves to ingest. It is not a matter of technology or of miracles, but of policy[7] . Minor inconveniences and infringements that benefit everyone - like seat belts, gun control and limiting our "right" to smoke or drink - should take precedence over our "right" to kill ourselves and one another.
There is evidence not only in studies but also in the real world that public health policy measures can be successful. Why did the childhood obesity rate decline in such disparate places as New York City, Philadelphia, Mississippi and California? It's simple: These places aggressively tackled dietary issues in schools and elsewhere.
In 2007, Mississippi's Healthy Students Act mandated 45 minutes per week of health education (home ec, anyone?) and limited the kinds of food and beverages sold in school vending machines. California banned sugary drinks in schools in 2009 and limited unhealthy snacks in 2007.[8]
Philadelphia hasn't allowed soda or sugary drinks in vending machines in schools since 2004, and its schools no longer have deep-fryers; the Food Trust (as I wrote in 2011) has pushed healthier food in corner stores. And New York has, among other things, banned trans fats from restaurants, made it easier for low-income people to shop at farmers' markets and run a highly visible ad campaign that tells subway riders, for example, the number of miles they'd have to walk to account for that sugary drink.
Like Philadelphia, New York has come close to passing a soda tax, which has raised consciousness about the dangers of sugary drinks. The so-called Big Gulp Ban (which will not, sadly, affect actual Big Gulps) will be implemented in March; if it hangs around, New York's obesity statistics may slide even further below the national average before too long.
These are dietary seat belts, and seat belts save lives. And only a jerk would say: "It's a slippery slope toward telling me what to do. If I want to ride without a seat belt, it's my right!"
When we see something, we should do something. The something we can all see is this: Eating badly - consuming unprecedented amounts of nonfood, like soda - causes obesity. Obesity brings about chronic disease. Chronic disease kills, wrecks lives and wreaks havoc on our health care system and our economy. We have the power, collectively, to further reduce disease and improve longevity. Who's against that?
1. Something like 20,000 per year in the United States alone.
2. These numbers are slight but nevertheless encouraging.
3. That gun control is a public health issue as well as a political issue is obvious, and the case could not be made better than it was by Nick Kristof this past Sunday.
4. Might be worth noting that the country with the world's biggest economy - the U.S. - has the 51st highest life expectancy, just ahead of Taiwan and Chile, and roughly 20 places behind Jordan and Greece.
5. More and more people are talking about this, of course.
6. Perhaps this becomes most apparent by considering that about one in six Americans is undernourished at least some of the time, in this, the country which Big Food would have us believe provides us with the "safest, cheapest and most abundant" food supply. A food supply that has resulted in two-thirds of us being overweight or obese. Allowing for some overlap - you can be overweight and still be undernourished, even truly hungry - it's still safe to say that about three-quarters of us have nutritional issues.
7. I recognize that at this point smart public health policy may feel like it will take a miracle.
8. At least in part as a result, the state has a student body that consumes upwards of 150 fewer calories per day than those of states without such programs.

HEADLINE: When Trade Shows Were Both Grand and Central

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Building Blocks: A rezoning proposal rekindles memories of Grand Central Palace, the city's principal exhibition hall in the first half of the 20th century. 

 BODY:
In the preservation debate over Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's rezoning plan for east Midtown, one of the most conspicuous landmarks is a building that hasn't existed for almost half a century, yet still exerts a strong influence over the neighborhood.
Grand Central Palace, on Lexington Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, was New York's principal exhibition hall for 40 years: home of the International Flower Show, the Greater New York Poultry Exposition, the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, the Sportsmen's and Vacation Show, the National Photographic Show, the International Beauty Shop Owners Convention, the Frozen Foods Exposition, the National Plastics Exposition, the International Textile Exposition, the National Modern Homes Exposition, the American Medical Association Exposition, the city's Golden Anniversary Exposition of 1948 and - in the greatest annual generator of nautical daydreams and logistical nightmares - the National Motor Boat Show. 
(You think it's tough driving in Midtown? Try it in a 54-foot Wheeler cruiser with a flying bridge.)
In 1963, 52 years after Grand Central Palace opened and a decade after the last show was held there, the 13-story building was demolished. A 44-story office tower, 245 Park Avenue, took its place.
But even today, you can clearly follow the shadow of the Palace by walking up Lexington Avenue from 47th Street. Expositions and conventions brought thousands of travelers to town. Accommodations sprouted shoulder to shoulder along "Hotel Alley": the Winthrop (now the Roger Smith), the Lexington, the Shelton (now the Marriott East Side), the Montclair (now the W New York) and the Beverly (now the Benjamin). Across Lexington Avenue, and in a different league, were the Barclay (now the InterContinental Barclay) and the Waldorf-Astoria.
All but one of these hotels have been identified by the Municipal Art Society, the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Historic Districts Council as worthy of consideration for landmark status. (The Waldorf-Astoria is the exception. It already is an official landmark.) Preservationists fear that the increase in permissible building density envisioned in the mayor's rezoning plan would make it economically feasible to demolish structures like these.
Had there been a strong landmarks law in 1963, there surely would have been a fight over Grand Central Palace. A good case could have been made for its architecture, too. 
It was designed by Warren & Wetmore and Reed & Stem, who also worked together on Grand Central Terminal itself. The Lexington Avenue facade of the Palace had a portico of four colossal columns. A two-story arcade - illuminated at night - ringed the top of the building. The main exhibition area was ingeniously carved out of the second and third floors to create an interior volume 48 feet high. The main floor could accommodate 94 booths, typically about 320 square feet each. (I've lived in smaller apartments.)
But let's be honest. Grand Central Palace was not about architecture. It was a setting where adults could play out their fantasies under the pretense of doing business; that is, unless you'd been inducted there into the armed forces during World War II or had a dust-up with the Internal Revenue Service, whose New York headquarters were there in the 1950s.
Even the staid New York Times got into the spirit of things. "Grand Central Palace All A-Cackle With 7,200 Poultry Show Entrants," said a headline on Jan. 4, 1951, under a photograph of a young woman with a long-tailed bird on her shoulder: "Florence Awe using 'Lady Amhurst,' a pheasant, as a hat."
The perennial tangle between automotive and nautical traffic before and after the boat show also allowed Times copy editors to let down their hair a bit. "Boats Go Bounding O'er Main Streets," was the headline on Jan. 8, 1953, heralding the arrival of the show. 
Assessing the home furnishings show in The Times of Sept. 18, 1952, Betty Pepis wrote: "All the items that could - and, it seemed to this reporter, many things that shouldn't go into a home - will be displayed by more than 400 exhibitors." With a nod to the impending presidential election, Elizabeth Draper designed a study for Dwight D. Eisenhower in bold strokes of red, white and blue. Melanie Kahane's study for Adlai E. Stevenson was of muted gray and beige. You know how that turned out.
One of the greatest annual draws was the flower show, which offered azaleas, camellias, lilies, peonies, petunias, primroses, roses and tulips in early March, when such color and fragrance in Midtown would have been welcome. As a reporter, I imagine it was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Yet I don't envy the writer who had to describe it year in and year out.
"'Spring followed by summer' is the forecast today and all through the week for Grand Central Palace," was how she opened her account on March 5, 1951. Two years later, on March 9, 1953, her lead paragraph began, "'Spring leading into summer' is the forecast for one small part of New York this week." I'm not going to name names. We've all done it.

HEADLINE: An American-Made Business Model Has Less Success Overseas

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: With the slowdown in once-hot emerging markets, the tide is going out on foreign investing, baring all of the problems and issues associated with global deal-making. 

 BODY:
For years, the titans of finance have held out the promise that they could export their business model overseas and mint billions in the process. Yet, there are increasing signs that global deal-making was always a myth.
If you've been anywhere near a Wall Street conference in the last five years, you know the drill. Deal makers bemoan the United States as a mature and overregulated economy. They talk about heading abroad, as emerging market economies leave us far behind. To listen to them, one might think the rest of the world was a paradise out of "Atlas Shrugged," where capital flows and where private equity, investment banks and other investors can freely seek opportunities.
So what country is No. 1 in initial public offerings so far this year? Yes, it is the United States, according to Renaissance Capital, with 75 I.P.O.'s raising $39 billion in total. Compare this activity with China, where 41 I.P.O.'s raised just $8.1 billion. 
 And in mergers and acquisitions? Again, it is the United States, with 53 percent of the worldwide deal volume, up from 51 percent from last year, according to Dealogic. For investment banks, this means that the United States has a 46 percent share of the $63 billion in worldwide investment banking revenue, up from 34.6 percent in 2009.
With the slowdown in once-hot emerging markets, the tide is going out, baring all of the problems and issues associated with global deal-making.
China is a prime example. Huge amounts of foreign and state investment produced an economic miracle. And in that time, wealth was there to be had.
But let's be clear about where that wealth came from. In the United States, deal makers make money primarily by buying underperforming assets, adding some financial wizardry and riding any improvements in the stock market. Sometimes, they get lucky by making a quick profit, but often private equity works to squeeze out inefficiencies and make operating improvements in companies and then takes them public a few years later.
In China, what increasingly appears to have been a stock market and asset bubble spurred by hundreds of billions in direct investment has created some spectacular early profits for deal makers. The private equity firm Carlyle Group, for example, has made an estimated $4.4 billion on an investment in China Pacific Insurance, which it took public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
But now, with the Chinese I.P.O. market at a virtual standstill and the Shanghai market down more than 30 percent from its high last year, that avenue to riches is over. People are starting to say that investment in China resembles a "No Exit" sign.
Deal makers are left with a back-to-basics approach that looks to make money from companies through economic growth or improving their performance. Yet most of these investments are made with state actors and minority positions, meaning that there may be little opportunity to actually do anything more than sit and wait and hope. And you know what they say about hope as a strategy.
It appears that deal makers are starting to realize the problem. Foreign direct investment in China was down 3.67 percent from last year to $9.6 billion, and it is likely to remain on a downward trend.
And China has been among the friendliest places for deal makers. Other emerging markets have been less accommodating. Take India, which has been criticized for excessive regulation, high taxes and ownership prohibitions. David Bonderman, the head of the private equity giant TPG Capital, recently said that "we stay away from places that have impossible governments and impossible tax regimes, which means sayonara to India." The comment about India highlights another problem with foreign deal-making: it's foreign. Sometimes, the political winds change and local governments that initially welcomed investment change their minds. South Korea, for example, invited foreign capital to invest in its battered financial sector after the Asian currency crisis. But when Lone Star Investments was about to reap billions in profits on an investment in Korea Exchange Bank, a legal battle almost a decade long erupted as Korean government officials accused the fund of vulture investing.
And the political problems are sometimes not directed at foreign investors. South Africa, for example, is undergoing the kind of political turmoil that can stop all foreign investment in its tracks over treatment of its workers and continuing income inequality. Things are not much better in the more mature economies.
Europe is in the economic doldrums, and its governments are increasingly protectionist of both jobs and industry. France, for example, recently threatened to nationalize a factory owned by ArcelorMittal, which sought to shut down two furnaces. The national minister said the company was "not welcome." It's hard to see a deal maker profiting from buying an inefficient enterprise that it can't clean up without risking national censure.
Buying at a low is the lifeblood of any investment strategy - but this assumes that there will be an uptick, and on the Continent, that is uncertain given the state of Greece and the other indebted economies in Southern Europe.
This is all a far cry from the oratory vision-making at conferences. Now that the global gold rush has ended, the belief that the American way of doing deals is portable is being upended.
We are left with a fragmented world where capital moves not so freely, the problems of politics and regulation are more prominent and investing in emerging markets becomes what it always has been: the province of more specialized investors who are in tune with the political and regulatory requirements. Regardless, the easy riches that many thought these countries would bring are now far out of sight.
And the winner in all of this is likely to be the much-maligned United States, where the economic conditions and regulatory environment first gave birth to these deal makers.
This is not to say that there will still not be global deal-making or that American multinationals will not continue to expand abroad. Of course, there will still be profits in deals overseas. But the vision that deal-making will instantly and seamlessly go global is increasingly exposed as one that was more a fairy tale than reality.

HIGHLIGHT: Japan's new leader changes focus; a bad time to divorce in Spain; celebrities go green; and Jenni Rivera's music. 

 BODY:
 NEWS Shinzo Abe, Japan's presumptive new prime minister, whose earlier term ended in failure in 2007, is in many ways a changed man, shifting his focus from nationalism to the economy. Hiroko Tabuchi reports from Tokyo. 
If marriage is for better or worse, richer or poorer, then these are the worst of times for a poorer Spain. Couples are paying the emotional price, especially when they cannot afford the price of divorce. Dan Bilefsky reports from Sabadell, Spain.
The Pentagon quietly notified Congress this month that it would reimburse Pakistan nearly $700 million for the cost of stationing 140,000 troops on the border with Afghanistan, an effort to normalize support for the Pakistani military after nearly two years of crises and mutual retaliation. Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger report from Washington.
Park Geun-hye and Moon Jae-in, the top candidates in the South Korean presidential election, say they would take a softer approach toward North Korea than the departing president. Choe Sang-Hun reports from Seoul.
After a ferocious national debate that pitted family members against one another, and some faithful Catholics against their church, the Philippine Congress passed legislation on Monday to help the country's poorest women gain access to birth control. Floyd Whaley reports from Manila.
Banco Santander said Monday it would absorb Banesto, its main domestic subsidiary and once one of Spain's leading banks, as part of a plan to cut 700 branches, or about 15 percent of its retail network. Raphael Minder reports from Madrid.
When the automaker Fiat said recently that it would lay off a third of the work force in Tychy, Poland, or about 1,500 people, it was a harsh reminder: Even with the healthiest big economy in Europe, Poland cannot escape the Continent's economic downturn. Jack Ewing reports from Warsaw.
 FASHION Livia Firth, eco-fanatic, "facilitator" and wife of the actor Colin Firth, has a mission to motivate celebrities to environmental action. Suzy Menkes reports.
 ARTS A compilation of the Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera's music was released just days after her death. It makes abundantly clear why she was so beloved as a singer, symbol and spitfire. Jon Pareles reviews the album.
 SPORTS Barcelona could have the league title wrapped up before Christmas after it beat Atlético Madrid on the same day that Real Madrid tied Espanyol at home. Rob Hughes on soccer.

HEADLINE: Experts Warn Of Budget Ills For the State, Lasting Years

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
New York State faces long-term budget problems that are compounded by the teetering finances of its local governments, an aging infrastructure and the possibility of severe cuts in federal funding, a panel of fiscal experts said Tuesday.
The State Budget Crisis Task Force, a nonpartisan group, said that New York's problems had been ''papered over with gimmicks'' for decades, and that while Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had taken some steps to rein in spending, the state was still saddled with burdens that would leave it unable to make ends meet in the long run. Over the past decade, the report said, New York had postponed a reckoning by using one-time measures to produce $25 billion in revenue.
Former Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch, a co-chairman of the group, said the math spoke for itself. ''There are expenditures that are growing at a rate faster than revenues,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''As long as that happens, then we are on an unsustainable course.'' 
A report released on Tuesday by the panel, which was also led by Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered a sobering assessment of the state's finances, raising concerns about its outsize spending on health care and education, its vulnerability to the ups and downs of Wall Street, and the struggles of its local governments to pay retirement obligations.
As one major area of concern, the report highlighted the state's enormous Medicaid budget, which is larger than those of Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas combined. The report said that while the Cuomo administration had put in place a cap on annual increases in health care spending, it was not certain the measure would drive down costs over the long run.
The report also said that New York was uniquely vulnerable to the whims of the financial markets, given that its tax revenues rely in large part on high-income earners and the taxes they pay on capital gains. ''Albany has increased dependence on a small number of very wealthy taxpayers to keep the state going,'' said a member of the task force, Carol O'Cleireacain, a former New York City budget director and finance commissioner who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo's budget office, Morris Peters, said the governor, a Democrat, had ''been successful in unraveling many of the budget gimmicks made by previous administrations'' since taking office two years ago on the heels of the financial crisis.
''The major rating agencies have praised not only the governor's reforms, but believe the fiscal condition of the state to be stronger than at any point since the crisis,'' he said in a statement.
When Mr. Cuomo took office in 2011, he and the Legislature closed a $10 billion budget gap; in 2013, the state faces a shortfall of about $1 billion, although that projection does not include any of the costs from Hurricane Sandy.
The report said New York, which is heavily dependent on federal money to help pay for its health and social service programs, is particularly vulnerable to possible cuts in federal aid resulting from efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit.
Mr. Ravitch, who was lieutenant governor under Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Gov. David A. Paterson, said it would be particularly damaging to New York if the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes was capped or eliminated, given the state's high tax rates compared with other states; if such an action were taken, he said, high earners could be motivated to move elsewhere.
One of the loudest alarm bells sounded by the report was in response to the condition of local governments, a number of which have warned in recent months that, facing diminished revenues and soaring health care and retirement costs, they are on the precipice of financial disaster. The report said New York's local governments were ''facing a rapidly deteriorating fiscal future.''
As one example of the budget pressures cities are facing, Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said her city's annual pension costs had increased 50 percent since she took office in 2010, to $30 million from $20 million. ''If you say to the municipality, 'You're just going to have to figure out how to pay for it,' what you are saying is that now bad people aren't going to be arrested, fires aren't going to be put out,'' she said. ''Snow will not be plowed from the roads. Trash will not be collected. And where are we going as a society if we cannot provide those basic, essential services?''
The report also questioned a new borrowing mechanism that allows the state, local governments and public institutions to reduce their pension contributions in the short term in exchange for higher payments, with interest, over the long term. The report called the mechanism a gimmick that amounted to a ''slippery slope'' for the governments involved.
The state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, defended the borrowing mechanism as a necessary step during tough economic times, calling it ''an effort to deal with real-life challenges.'' But he praised the report as a road map for future reform and said he hoped it raised awareness about the state's financial challenges.
''Much of this is going to come down to some very tough choices that are going to have implications in a very direct way on the people of our state,'' Mr. DiNapoli said.

HEADLINE: New York Theaters Announce Commissions

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
Two prominent New York theaters, Manhattan Theater Club and Ars Nova, announced on Tuesday that they have chosen five playwrights as the first recipients of their new Writer's Room commissions. The commissions are worth between $5,000 and $10,000 a piece and are geared to developing works for possible Off Broadway productions at the theaters. The inaugural commissions will go to Thomas Bradshaw ("Job"), Samuel D. Hunter ("The Whale"), and Sharyn Rothstein ("The Invested"); a fourth commission will be shared by Adam Bock ("A Small Fire") and Justin Levine ("Bonfire Night"), who are developing a new musical.
Such commissions are increasingly common as nonprofit theaters try to forge stronger ties with their favorite writers, enabling them financially to remain playwrights (rather than move into television and film work) and helping spur new works that might run in the theaters someday. Mr. Hunter, for one, whose Off Broadway play "The Whale" has made him a hot commodity, is juggling commissions for several theaters nationwide and is also already a member of the Playwrights Ensemble group at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago. 
The Writer's Room grew out of a collaboration in 2008 when Ars Nova turned to Manhattan Theater Club, which has larger budgets and facilities, about producing a new play by Liz Flahive, "From Up Here," that Ars Nova had developed but did not have the space and money to stage itself. "From Up Here" opened at the club that spring to good reviews, but the national economic recession that year limited the abilities of the two theaters (like many others) to spend money on new programs like the Writer's Room.
"We wanted to do this again, but on purpose this time," said Mandy Greenfield, the artistic producer of Manhattan Theater Club, in an interview on Tuesday. "And now we have four new commissions that would not have existed if we had not come together."
She said the commissions have been financed out of the budgets of the two theaters, but added that they would seek private and foundation support for the Writer's Room as well. The plan is to award four commissions annually, though the writers would not be expected to finish work in a single year. Full productions are not guaranteed, but Ms. Greenfield said she hoped some of the new works would run at the club's newly configured space, MTC Studio at Stage II, where the critically praised "Murder Ballad" just concluded its run. (Some theater producers have expressed interest in remounting "Murder Ballad" elsewhere in New York, but those discussions are nascent and Ms. Greenfield declined to comment on them.)
Ars Nova, a more experimental theater company than Manhattan Theater Club, recently had a critical and audience hit with "Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812," which also may re-open elsewhere next year. Jason Eagan, artistic director of Ars Nova, said that his small theater had only so much flexibility to extend shows like "The Great Comet" and produce newly commissioned works - hence the decision to team up with Manhattan Theater Club.
"We want Ars Nova to remain a very focused boutique theater," he said, "but we also want to commission more writers and not be limited by our producing resources."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: City Study Finds No Clear Link Between 9/11 Debris and Cancer

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Six months after the federal government added cancer to the list of sicknesses covered by the $4.3 billion World Trade Center fund, a New York City health department study has found no clear link between cancer and the dust, debris and fumes released by the burning wreckage of the twin towers.
The study was by far the largest to date. It examined 55,700 people, including rescue and recovery workers who were present at the World Trade Center site, on barges or at the Staten Island landfill where debris was taken in the nine months after Sept. 11, 2001, as well as residents of Lower Manhattan, students, workers and passers-by exposed on the day of the terrorist attacks.
Over all, there was no increase in the cancer rate of those studied compared with the rate of the general population, researchers concluded after looking at 23 cancers from 2003 to 2008. The prevalence of three cancers -- multiple myeloma, prostate and thyroid -- was significantly higher, but only in rescue and recovery workers and not in the rest of the exposed population. But since the number of actual cases was small and the subjects of the study may have been screened more frequently for cancer than other people on average, the researchers noted that it was too early to draw any correlation to time spent at ground zero. 
In one of many counterintuitive findings, the incidence of cancer was not higher among those who were exposed more intensely to the toxic substances than among those who were exposed less.
The lack of clear evidence of a link between cancer and the debris from Sept. 11 casts into doubt the decision by the federal government in June to add 50 different types of cancer to the list of illnesses covered by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, signed by President Obama in early 2011. That decision meant that people with other sicknesses linked more strongly to ground zero were likely to receive less money.
Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the health commissioner in New York City, said in an interview on Monday that it was too soon to take the study as a repudiation of the government's decision.
''Cancers take 20 years to develop,'' Dr. Farley said, ''and we might see something different 20 years down the line.'' But echoing Dr. John Howard, head of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, who made the final decision on covering cancer, the commissioner added, ''You don't want to wait 20 to 30 years to get a definitive answer'' to people suffering today.
On Tuesday, Dr. Howard issued a statement that said, ''The W.T.C. Health Program welcomes this addition to the peer-reviewed scientific literature, and we have long encouraged the growth of such peer-reviewed research.''
Dr. Alfred I. Neugut, an oncologist and professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, said he was not surprised by the study. ''I think, given the time frame and the exposures,'' he said, ''that there wasn't a high likelihood that there would be an elevated risk, certainly for cancer, and to the degree that it was, it would not be for the cancers that they're finding.''
Dr. Neugut said he sympathized with people who had cancer they attributed to the disaster, but added that their emotional response was not necessarily valid scientifically. ''The 9/11 attack was a terrible thing, but it doesn't cause everything in the world,'' he said. ''Cancer is a very specific outcome, and in most exposures, you have to be exposed for an extended time before you get the cancer.''
Initially, the money set aside by the law -- $2.8 billion to compensate victims and $1.5 billion for monitoring and treatment costs not covered by health insurance -- covered mainly respiratory illnesses. (Mental health problems were included in the treatment fund but not the compensation fund.) Studies by the city health department have found asthma and post-traumatic stress disorder to be linked to the 2001 attacks. But cancer is expected to be far more expensive to treat than other qualifying illnesses, and the economic loss caused by cancer could require more compensation, since many cancer patients cannot work, and some have died.
The study was released on Tuesday, and was to be published in the Wednesday issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association -- too late to influence Dr. Howard's decision, but perhaps not too late to influence public opinion going forward or to affect whether Congress will decide to replenish the victim compensation fund should more money be needed.
The fund has not yet begun making payments, and it is supposed to make its final payments in 2016-17. In the meantime, some police officers and other rescue and recovery workers who worked at ground zero and have cancer have been receiving enhanced pension benefits based on a 2005 state law that said they were presumed to have contracted cancer from the ground zero substances.
Until now, the only systematic examination of cancer incidences and Sept. 11 was a study by the New York Fire Department that was released last year. It found a 19 percent higher incidence of all types of cancer for exposed firefighters compared with those not exposed. Most of the increase came from prostate and thyroid cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma.
The health department study found a 43 percent higher risk of prostate cancer, double the risk of thyroid cancer, and roughly triple the risk of multiple myeloma, a blood cancer of the bone marrow, in rescue and recovery workers. But the researchers cautioned that it was too early to know if the increases were related to Sept. 11 and that the number of people affected was small -- seven cases of myeloma, two or three of which would have been expected based on the normal cancer rate, making it all but impossible to tell which were related to the attacks and which were not. There were 13 cases of thyroid cancer, 7 more than expected, and 67 cases of prostate cancer, 20 more than expected.
Several factors made it hard to draw any conclusions from those results, including the possibility that the rescue and recovery workers were screened more routinely for prostate and thyroid cancer -- a factor researchers call ''surveillance bias'' -- than the population at large, and the absence of a correlation with the intensity of exposure.
The researchers also lacked information on other risk factors, like family histories of cancer and non-World Trade Center exposure to carcinogens.
''Cancer's always a bad thing,'' said Dr. Farley, the health commissioner. ''But the prostate and thyroid cancer was no more common in people who were more exposed, which is something you would expect if it was caused by the disaster.''
Prostate and thyroid cancers also have different origins, the study said, with thyroid cancer caused by ionizing radiation -- which is not believed to have been present in carcinogenic amounts at the World Trade Center site -- and prostate cancer's relationship to environmental factors being inconclusive. On the other hand, blood cancers like myeloma tend to develop faster than solid tumors and, therefore, could be an early indicator of cancer risk, the study said.
Part of Dr. Howard's rationale for adding cancer to the list of eligible illnesses was that the dust, smoke and fumes were known to contain potential carcinogens like asbestos, silica, benzene, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds and metals.
Patricia Workman, who volunteered at ground zero and has myeloma and melanoma, both on the federal list of qualifying cancers, said she was disappointed by the study's findings.
''It's like one thing comes out that's good, and then it's just a setback,'' said Ms. Workman, who has become an advocate for people with myeloma. She added that she had gone to the funerals of first responders who died of leukemia, and was surprised it was not one of the cancers the health department study linked to Sept. 11.
Ms. Workman suggested that the government might have unnecessarily invited criticism of the treatment and compensation program by covering so many types of cancer so soon.
''They gave too much away in the beginning to say every cancer was covered and everybody that was down there was covered,'' she said. ''You've got to prove that it's linked to being down there. But I hope that people will speak up and fight.''

HEADLINE: Arts as Antidote for Academic Ills

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Stationed in front of one of his large self-portraits, the artist Chuck Close raised his customized wheelchair to balance on two wheels, seeming to defy the laws of gravity.
The chair's unlikely gymnastics underlined the points that Mr. Close was making to his audience, 40 seventh and eighth graders from Bridgeport, Conn.: Break the rules and use limitations to your advantage.
The message had particular resonance for these students, and a few educators and parents, who had come by bus on Monday from Roosevelt School to the Pace Gallery in Chelsea for a private tour of Mr. Close's show. Roosevelt, located in a community with high unemployment and crushing poverty, recently had one of the worst records of any school in the state, with 80 percent of its seventh graders testing below grade level in reading and math. 
Saved from closure by a committed band of parents, the school was one of eight around the country chosen last year to participate in Turnaround Arts, a new federally sponsored public-and-private experiment that puts the arts at the center of the curriculum. Arranging for extra funds for supplies and instruments, teacher training, partnerships with cultural organizations and high-profile mentors like Mr. Close, Turnaround is trying to use the arts to raise academic performance across the board. ''Art saved my life,'' Mr. Close told the children. And he believes it can save the lives of others, too.
So now he was giving a pizza party and answering a question about why he started to paint.
''I wanted people to notice me, not that I couldn't remember their faces or add or subtract,'' he said, referring to the learning and neurological disabilities that set him apart from his classmates when he was growing up in Monroe, Wash.
A terrible writer and test-taker, Mr. Close used art to make it through school. Instead of handing in a paper, he told the children, ''I made a 20-foot-long mural of the Lewis and Clark trail.''
Starting in Pace's large central gallery, where his giant portraits of other artists like Philip Glass, Paul Simon and Laurie Anderson looked on, Mr. Close told the group that ''everything about my work is driven by my learning disabilities.''
Born with prosopagnosia, a condition that prevents him from recognizing faces, Mr. Close explained that the only way he can remember a face is by breaking it down into small ''bite-sized'' pieces, like the tiny squares or circles of color that make up his paintings and prints.
''I figured out what I had left and I tried to make it work for me,'' he said. ''Limitations are important.''
With Mr. Close were a few other members of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, which helped develop the Turnaround program. One of them, Damian Woetzel, a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet who is a mentor to two other Turnaround schools, picked up on his theme.
''In dance we limit ourselves, as well,'' he said. ''There are five positions and everything comes from that,'' he added, quickly demonstrating the basic ballet poses.
Filling out the cultural spectrum were the Broadway producer Margo Lion, a chairwoman of the committee, and the musicians Cristina Pato, Shane Shanahan and Kojiro Umezaki, all members of the Silk Road Ensemble, an international collaboration founded by the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is also a committee member and a mentor. One by one, they entered from different doors, startling the students with an impromptu concert featuring a tambourine, a gaita (a Spanish bagpipe) and a Chinese flute.
Clapping and stamping in time to the music, Mr. Woetzel soon turned the gallery's open space into a dance floor. A couple of students whipped out phones to record the proceedings, while others raced across the room to avoid getting pulled in as participants. One reluctant dancer, captured by Rachel Goslins, a filmmaker and the executive director of the president's committee, rolled his eyes and mouthed ''Oh my God'' as she circled him around the floor. Other students joined hands and began dancing as Ms. Lion and the school principal, Tania Kelley, her head flung back, swung each other around.
Mr. Close swerved through the crowd in his wheelchair.
''I never danced before,'' Carolyn Smith, 13, said excitedly when the music stopped. ''Usually I sing.'' Carolyn was the lead in the school's production of ''The Wiz'' last year. A brain tumor had caused her to miss so much school that her literacy teacher initially wanted her to turn down the part and focus on catching up, Ms. Goslins said. But being in the play -- and reading and memorizing the script -- helped her reading skills so much, Ms. Goslins said, that the literacy coach later told her, ''I'm a believer.''
The afternoon offered a series of firsts for many of the students. Most had never seen such instruments, heard of Mr. Simon or Mr. Glass, or even visited Manhattan.
''It's pretty cool to be in New York,'' said David Morales, 14, who later asked Mr. Close about his technique, explaining, ''I like how he makes it, how it comes all together.''
David, like the other Roosevelt students, had studied Mr. Close's work in class and met him when he visited the school last month. So Mr. Close patiently answered questions.
''Is it easy to make these pictures?'' (Well, it can take a while, Mr. Close replied.)
''How do you know what colors to use?'' (Trial and error.)
''Can you draw? (Yes.)
''There is no artist who enjoys what he does every day more than I do,'' Mr. Close told the group, setting off applause from the students. Repeating advice he often gives to young artists, he said: ''Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up for work.''
When the bus arrived for the return trip, Ms. Pato and Mr. Shanahan again took up their instruments, this time to lead a parade of clapping students and teachers out the door.
Carolyn Smith, a pink rose in her hair, paused at the doorway and turned to Mr. Close. ''I had a blast,'' she called out. ''Bye, Chuck. See you later.''

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Plans To Examine Data Broker Practices

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
It's getting tougher to be a data broker.
Companies that collect, analyze and sell billions of details about the activities of consumers for marketing purposes have increasingly found themselves under government scrutiny this year.
The latest salvo comes from the Federal Trade Commission, which said on Tuesday that it had opened an inquiry into the practices of nine companies that collect and resell or analyze consumer data.
The agency issued 15-page administrative subpoenas to the information resellers. The orders require each company to provide extensive details about how it collects consumer data and how it uses, stores, analyzes and shares that data. The agency also asked for information about whether the company allows consumers to see and correct the records held about them. 
After it reviews this information, the agency plans to issue a report to advise lawmakers on whether more regulation is needed; data brokers are currently largely unregulated.
The F.T.C.'s inquiry seeks far more comprehensive details than similar investigations this year in Congress. And executives at the companies may be more forthcoming about their practices with regulators because, unlike Congressional inquiries that often make their results public, the F.T.C. keeps the specifics it gathers confidential.
The subpoenas went to, among other companies, Acxiom of Little Rock, Ark., one of the world's largest information resellers, which manages customer databases for major banks, automakers and retailers; eBureau, a company in St. Cloud, Minn., which, on behalf of clients like credit card companies, lenders, insurers and educational institutions, evaluates and scores online consumers in the market for those companies' products; Intelius, a company in Bellevue, Wash., which offers people-search look-up services and background checks; and Peek-You, a company that analyzes social media sentiment.
''We are going to get a huge amount of data,'' David C. Vladeck, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the F.T.C., said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''We are going to get answers.''
In an e-mail, Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, the chief privacy officer of Acxiom, said the company had not yet received the F.T.C.'s letter, but was looking forward to cooperating with the inquiry. ''We consider this request as an avenue to promote a better understanding of why what we do is vital for the American economy as it creates enormous value for people and businesses while respecting and protecting consumers' interests,'' she wrote.
Gordon Meyer, the chief executive of eBureau, wrote in an e-mail that the consumer scoring company ''welcomes the opportunity to describe, to the F.T.C., its practices and the benefits we provide to businesses as well as consumers.''
Representatives of other companies did not return e-mails seeking comment.
Companies and organizations in the United States spend more than $2 billion a year on third-party data about individuals, according to a report last year on personal identity management from Forrester Research, a market research firm. That figure does not include spending on market research and customer data analytics, the report said.
Industry representatives argue that their practices benefit consumers. Data brokers, they say, collect information about individuals' purchasing histories, estimated salaries, property ownership, family size, leisure pursuits -- and sometimes also their race or ethnicity, age, gender, health concerns, online browsing history and social networks -- to help marketers tailor pitches to a person's demonstrated tastes. When these bespoke ad systems work properly, the companies argue, marketers can identify male Southern Californians who surf and show them ads for board shorts even as they avoid sending coupons for ski vacations to people who prefer Alaskan cruises.
But, as consumers conduct more of their personal and commercial lives online, that type of data collection has been steadily increasing, fueled by new online surveillance techniques and more sophisticated analytics. Some companies, for example, have compiled several thousand different pieces of information on a majority of adults in the United States. Regulators say they are concerned that such comprehensive data collection could be used to profile, score or segment consumers, with the potential to unfairly limit the kinds of financial, insurance, health, education or other marketing offers certain consumers receive.
Mr. Vladeck of the F.T.C. offered one possibility he worried about: a hypothetical consumer who buys a deep-fat fryer online may get typecast by data broker systems as a health risk, and then is passed over for marketing pitches for insurance or other services.
''Data brokers aggregate huge amounts of data on individuals and have the capacity to create powerful profiles combining information about what you do offline and online,'' Mr. Vladeck said. ''We worry that this information may be used in ways that could be harmful to consumers.''
Industry representatives disagreed, saying that their ethics guidelines prohibited companies from using consumer marketing data for eligibility decisions like credit, insurance or employment. Targeted marketing pitches based on data collection about an individual, they added, do not limit a consumer from seeking out financial, insurance or other services on their own.
''It changes what comes to you, what you will see in a banner ad or an ad along the side of your Web searches,'' said Jerry Cerasale, senior vice president for government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, an industry trade group. ''But it doesn't create a barrier for you to look elsewhere.''
In March, the F.T.C. issued a report on consumer privacy, calling on data brokers to make their practices clearer to the public. Some legislators and regulators say they are taking a harder look at the industry because of practices that are opaque to consumers.
Unlike consumer reporting agencies, for example, which are required by federal law to show consumers their credit reports and allow them to correct errors in their own records, data brokers who collect and sell consumer information for marketing purposes are not required to give individuals access to the records those companies hold about them. In a report earlier this year, the F.T.C. asked Congress to consider enacting regulations to give consumers some rights to data collected about them.
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who opened an examination of the industry in July, along with Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, said the investigations would help legislators and regulators develop a system of oversight, giving consumers more access to and control over data collected about them.
''Consumers should have the right to know what is being collected about them, notice that the information is going to be used for purposes other than originally intended, and the right to say no,'' he said. '' 'Knowledge, notice and no,' that has always been my motto.''

HEADLINE: American Business Model Proves Less Successful Overseas

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF.

 BODY:
For years, the titans of finance have held out the promise that they could export their business model overseas and mint billions in the process. Yet, there are increasing signs that global deal-making was always a myth.
If you've been anywhere near a Wall Street conference in the last five years, you know the drill. Deal makers bemoan the United States as a mature and overregulated economy. They talk about heading abroad, as emerging market economies leave us far behind. To listen to them, one might think the rest of the world was a paradise out of "Atlas Shrugged," where capital flows and where private equity, investment banks and other investors can freely seek opportunities.
So what country is No. 1 in initial public offerings so far this year? Yes, it is the United States, according to Renaissance Capital, with 75 I.P.O.'s raising $39 billion in total. Compare this activity with China, where 41 I.P.O.'s raised just $8.1 billion. 
And in mergers and acquisitions? Again, it is the United States, with 53 percent of the worldwide deal volume, up from 51 percent from last year, according to Dealogic. For investment banks, this means that the United States has a 46 percent share of the $63 billion in worldwide investment banking revenue, up from 34.6 percent in 2009.
With the slowdown in once-hot emerging markets, the tide is going out, baring all of the problems and issues associated with global deal-making.
China is a prime example. Huge amounts of foreign and state investment produced an economic miracle. And in that time, wealth was there to be had.
But let's be clear about where that wealth came from. In the United States, deal makers make money primarily by buying underperforming assets, adding some financial wizardry and riding any improvements in the stock market. Sometimes, they get lucky by making a quick profit, but often private equity works to squeeze out inefficiencies and make operating improvements in companies and then takes them public a few years later.
In China, what increasingly appears to have been a stock market and asset bubble spurred by hundreds of billions in direct investment has created some spectacular early profits for deal makers. The private equity firm Carlyle Group, for example, has made an estimated $4.4 billion on an investment in China Pacific Insurance, which it took public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
But now, with the Chinese I.P.O. market at a virtual standstill and the Shanghai market down more than 30 percent from its high last year, that avenue to riches is over. People are starting to say that investment in China resembles a "No Exit" sign.
Deal makers are left with a back-to-basics approach that looks to make money from companies through economic growth or improving their performance. Yet most of these investments are made with state actors and minority positions, meaning that there may be little opportunity to actually do anything more than sit and wait and hope. And you know what they say about hope as a strategy.
It appears that deal makers are starting to realize the problem. Foreign direct investment in China was down 3.67 percent from last year to $9.6 billion, and it is likely to remain on a downward trend.
And China has been among the friendliest places for deal makers. Other emerging markets have been less accommodating. Take India, which has been criticized for excessive regulation, high taxes and ownership prohibitions. David Bonderman, the head of the private equity giant TPG Capital, recently said that "we stay away from places that have impossible governments and impossible tax regimes, which means sayonara to India." The comment about India highlights another problem with foreign deal-making: it's foreign. Sometimes, the political winds change and local governments that initially welcomed investment change their minds. South Korea, for example, invited foreign capital to invest in its battered financial sector after the Asian currency crisis. But when Lone Star Investments was about to reap billions in profits on an investment in Korea Exchange Bank, a legal battle almost a decade long erupted as Korean government officials accused the fund of vulture investing.
And the political problems are sometimes not directed at foreign investors. South Africa, for example, is undergoing the kind of political turmoil that can stop all foreign investment in its tracks over treatment of its workers and continuing income inequality. Things are not much better in the more mature economies.
Europe is in the economic doldrums, and its governments are increasingly protectionist of both jobs and industry. France, for example, recently threatened to nationalize a factory owned by ArcelorMittal, which sought to shut down two furnaces. The national minister said the company was "not welcome." It's hard to see a deal maker profiting from buying an inefficient enterprise that it can't clean up without risking national censure.
Buying at a low is the lifeblood of any investment strategy - but this assumes that there will be an uptick, and on the Continent, that is uncertain given the state of Greece and the other indebted economies in Southern Europe.
This is all a far cry from the oratory vision-making at conferences. Now that the global gold rush has ended, the belief that the American way of doing deals is portable is being upended.
We are left with a fragmented world where capital moves not so freely, the problems of politics and regulation are more prominent and investing in emerging markets becomes what it always has been: the province of more specialized investors who are in tune with the political and regulatory requirements. Regardless, the easy riches that many thought these countries would bring are now far out of sight.
And the winner in all of this is likely to be the much-maligned United States, where the economic conditions and regulatory environment first gave birth to these deal makers.
This is not to say that there will still not be global deal-making or that American multinationals will not continue to expand abroad. Of course, there will still be profits in deals overseas. But the vision that deal-making will instantly and seamlessly go global is increasingly exposed as one that was more a fairy tale than reality.

HEADLINE: Once Web Only, Shopping Sites Hang Real Shingles

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Andy Dunn was fierce about the Internet-only model of his apparel company, Bonobos, after helping to found it in 2007. He gave a speech, ''The End of Apparel as We Know It,'' arguing that stores were a bad economic decision. As he told a news channel in 2009: ''We keep men out of retail stores when we know that men fundamentally don't enjoy shopping.''
How times have changed.
Recently, Mr. Dunn was looking with satisfaction around a Bonobos store in Manhattan, one of six the company opened this year. ''I was pretty puritanical about e-commerce only,'' he said, but found that about half of would-be customers would not order apparel online because they wanted to feel the merchandise. E-commerce is growing fast, he added, but ''that doesn't mean the offline world is going away -- it just means it's changing.'' 
After years of criticizing physical stores as relics, even e-commerce zealots are acknowledging there is something to a bricks-and-mortar location. EBay and Etsy are testing temporary stores, while Piperlime, the Gap Inc. unit that was online-only for six years, opened a SoHo store this fall. Bonobos plans to keep opening stores, and Warby Parker, the eyeglass brand, will soon open a physical location.
The companies say they are catering to customers who want to see what they are buying in person, and who see shopping as a social event. As they build the locations, though, the retailers are reimagining some long-established rules -- carrying less inventory, having fewer staff members and embracing small and out-of-the-way locations. In the process, they are creating what could be a model for efficient in-store operations: the store as a showroom.
''Well over 90 percent of sales still happen in physical stores, so there is a huge, compelling reason to think about the physical store as a driver of sales,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. She said Web retailers had advantages over traditional ones: they are not stuck with old cash registers and sales software, and the weak commercial real estate environment combined with their Web sales history allow them to get leases on good terms.
Faith Hope Consolo, a Manhattan retail real estate broker, said she was seeing more inquiries from online-only retailers about opening shops, particularly in smaller spaces.
''They'll show them a few products, lure them in and hopefully have them hooked,'' she said. ''They feel that, yes, people are online, people have apps, but there's nothing like the spontaneous face-to-face.'' Some stores take the revised model to an extreme. An eBay pop-up store in London that opened this holiday season has no actual merchandise, just scannable screens displaying gift suggestions.
Others try to give shoppers a semitraditional experience, but without all the costs. ''If you build it backwards, you rethink it,'' said Mr. Dunn, the Bonobos chief executive.
Mr. Dunn said the store idea stemmed from customers' requests to try on items before a purchase.
Though Bonobos suggested that customers order multiple sizes, that didn't fit with the ethos of good service he wanted. ''Clicking on six sizes and having them shipped to me is not a great experience,'' he said.
Also, he said, ''the cost of marketing a Web site and the cost of free shipping both ways was approximating a store expense,'' he said.
Bonobos added two sales representatives in the lobby of its Manhattan office last year to show clothes to customers, and Mr. Dunn said that within six months, each was on track to achieve more than $250,000 in sales. Based on that, this year, Bonobos struck a deal with Nordstrom to carry its clothes in its shop, and opened its first store.
For his own stores, Mr. Dunn did not want a typical retail model that required carrying a heavy inventory, staffing for heavy foot traffic and paying for prime real estate.
Instead, he took 700 square feet in Bonobos's existing fifth-floor office and converted it into a store, called a Guideshop. Customers make appointments, which generally last 45 minutes, so one or two employees handle the entire store at once.
Most retail stores have to carry each item in a range of colors and sizes, a significant cost, but Bonobos does not, instead using the Web site as its virtual back room. Customers do not leave the store with merchandise; instead, the employees place an online order that is delivered to the customer, often the next day.
That means the stores carry only items for fit and looks. It has a dark-khaki chino in all 11 waist sizes and four inseam lengths, for instance, and employees use that to figure out what size a customer wears in other pants. But it does not carry, say, a red boot-cut chino in all sizes.
Clayton McGratty, 29, bought a golf outfit, a sweater and two pairs of pants after a Guideshop appointment. ''It was a great way for me to introduce myself to their retail line without gambling on a particular style, or fit of pants, that I hadn't tried on before,'' he said.
Mr. Dunn said the average in-store transaction was $360, double what it is online, and first-time store visitors buy again in 58 days, versus waiting 85 days between Web site purchases. And, he said, he has cut Web marketing expenses in half as in-store purchases have increased.
One challenge for established e-commerce companies is how to translate the look of the Web site into a physical store. Piperlime, the six-year-old clothing and shoes site, opened its first store in September in SoHo.
Design was a focus, and white signs throughout the store give messages in the same fonts, color and language as the site's: ''Rachel Zoe's Picks,'' ''Girl on a Budget.'' Design details, like a pigeon eating birdseed, are rendered in the site's signature lime green.
Unlike its corporate siblings at Gap Inc., Piperlime uses its e-commerce distribution centers to get products to stores. It also carries light inventory that is replenished frequently.
Jennifer Gosselin, general manager of Piperlime, said the company added a physical store because customers wanted to go somewhere and do something together.
''No matter how connected a consumer is, there is a part of shopping that involves the experience itself. Particularly with millennial consumers, shopping is a hobby,'' she said. ''The trend is, people are going online more and more for everything they do,'' she said, but ''they still want a haven.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Shrinks Trade Deficit As Oil Falls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's trade deficit narrowed in the July-September quarter to the smallest level since late 2010, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. 
The deficit fell to $107.5 billion in the third quarter, down 9 percent from the second-quarter imbalance of $118.1 billion, the agency said. It was the lowest trade gap since the final three months of 2010.
The current account reported on Tuesday is the broadest measure of trade. It tracks the sale of merchandise and services between nations as well as investment flows. Economists watch the current account as a sign of how much the United States needs to borrow from abroad.
Many economists predict that the deficit will widen in coming quarters, in part because a global slowdown is limiting demand for American exports.
A debt crisis has pushed much of Europe into recession. The region accounts for about one-fifth of export sales from the United States. Other major export markets, including China, India and Brazil, have experienced slower growth.
The current-account deficit reached a record high of $800.6 billion in 2006. It then shrank after a deep recession cut into United States demand for foreign goods by a greater amount than American export sales diminished. The trade gap began widening again after the recession ended in June 2009.
The improvement in the current account in the third quarter reflected a decline in the deficit on goods and a small increase in the surplus on services, led by a gain in foreign earnings made by financial services, insurance and professional services provided by companies in the United States. The surplus on investment earnings narrowed to $50.8 billion, down from $52.1 billion in the second quarter.
The narrowing of the deficit in the third quarter left it at a level equivalent to 2.7 percent of the total economy, down from 3 percent in the second quarter. The third-quarter deficit represented the smallest percentage of the economy since the spring of 2009.
Paul Ashworth, the chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said that most of the improvement reflected a decline in America's foreign oil bill. He predicted that the deficit would remain close to 3 percent of the total economy or slightly below through all of next year.
The deficit in the monthly trade report, which tracks only merchandise and services, increased in October as United States exports fell by a larger margin than imports, a development that was seen as a sign that slower global growth was beginning to weigh on the nation's economy.
The overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the July-September quarter, but many economists say they believe that growth has slowed to less than 2 percent in the current quarter. They say consumers and businesses have become more cautious about spending and investing because of the uncertainty over what Congress will do about the tax increases and spending cuts that will occur automatically in January unless Congress and President Obama reach a budget deal to avert them. Economists have warned that the harm to the economy could be great enough to push the country back into a recession.

HEADLINE: Pussy Riot, Tupac And Putin

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
Moscow
I've been a regular visitor to Vladimir Putin's Russia, and, when I was describing what troubled me most about the place to a wise foreign policy friend, he urged me to read the play ''Three Sisters'' by Chekhov. It's the tale of the aspiring Prozorov family, whose three cultured and educated sisters -- Olga, Masha and Irina -- grew up in Moscow but for 11 years found themselves marooned in the countryside. The sisters are always waxing poetic about their plans to go back to Moscow (the Emerald City), but they never make it and their dream fades. 
Putin brings out the Three Sisters in me. Every time I come here, I expect to find that, this time, Russia is really pivoting from being a petro-state, with a heavy authoritarian gloss -- and a president who relies on anti-Western rhetoric to maintain his political base -- to a country that has decided to invest in education, innovation and its human capital and is ready to be a partner with the West. But it never materializes, and lately it has started to go backward. I wonder if Putin realizes how open the U.S. would be to partnering with Russia today to bring order to the Middle East or to serve as a counterweight to China -- especially when the European Union is so weak and America is so inwardly focused.
Yes, NATO expansion was a huge mistake, and it got America and Putin off on the wrong foot. But that's over. This time it is Putin who has locked himself, for his own cynical politics, in cold-war mode. His anti-Western trope plays well in the countryside, which has become his political base at a time when the rising urban middle classes have grown resentful of his perpetually autocratic rule. Russia would be so much more influential as America's partner than it would be as Iran's or Syria's patron. And its economy would be so much more resilient if Putin tapped his people and unlocked their creativity rather than just his oil and gas wells. But doing the latter would require a much freer political atmosphere. Putin may look like a strongman, but his policies are making Russia weaker. He needs to be careful. The good news for Russians today is that they can leave. The bad news for Russia is that they will.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development just completed a study of the Russian economy, reported by Bloomberg News. The article said that ''Russia, the world's largest energy exporter, is becoming increasingly dependent on commodities and failing to prepare for falling oil output in 20 years. ... Corruption, poor education, immigration barriers and state dominance in the economy, which curbs private innovation, all hinder diversification. ... The economy's dependence on energy is greater today than in the mid-1990s, when it represented less than half of exports. ... Russia's investment in promoting high-tech industries -- with public money accounting for 75 percent of research and development funding -- has yielded only limited results, the EBRD said.'' The reasons are obvious. Small businesses, start-ups and nonresource companies require strong intellectual property-rights protection, independent courts and trusted financial markets, and those require solid political institutions with regular rotations in power -- all things Putin's rule works against.
I am wrong to be so pessimistic, says Vladislav Y. Surkov, the deputy prime minister for modernization. I was in Surkov's office in the Russian White House here a few days ago. As I was interviewing him, it was impossible to ignore the two posters on his wall. One showed the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and the other Vladimir Zworykin, who served as director of the RCA Laboratories in Princeton in the 1950s and helped to pioneer television. ''O.K.,'' I asked Surkov, ''why are those two on your wall?''
''I want to send the message to the visitors to this office that Russia gave the world such geniuses,'' said Surkov. ''Their inventions have entered every household in the world, and the fact that these people, of our kin and our blood, managed to give such gifts to the world should fill our hearts with faith that Russia has a future as an innovative power.''
Surkov, once described as Putin's Machiavelli, is impressive, and his plans to stimulate innovation in Russia sounded real to me. But I couldn't resist noting that innovative cultures don't do things like throw the punk band Pussy Riot into prison for two years for performing a ''punk prayer'' in a cathedral. That sends a bad signal to all freethinkers. Surkov, who also keeps a picture of the American rapper Tupac Shakur behind his desk, pushes back. ''Tupac Shakur is a genius, and the fact that he was in prison did not interrupt either his creative juices or the innovative development of the United States.'' Pussy Riot is no Tupac Shakur, he added. ''Being orthodox myself, I feel really sorry for the girls from Pussy Riot, but [their situation] has no implications for the innovative developments of Russia.''
Pussy Riot probably is no Tupac, but the band members were iconoclasts who broke the mold, albeit in an offensive and obnoxious manner. Isn't that what critics said about Steve Jobs?

HEADLINE: The Emperor of All Identities

BYLINE: By PAMELA JONES HARBOUR. 
Pamela Jones Harbour, a member of the Federal Trade Commission from 2003 to 2010, is a lawyer at Fulbright & Jaworski, where she represents technology companies, including Microsoft.

 BODY:
Washington
A FEW years after it was founded, Google adopted a list of guiding principles it titled, ''Ten things we know to be true.'' No. 4 was ''Democracy on the Web works.''
That's a worthy sentiment -- though a bit surprising coming from the Web's emperor. 
For that, arguably, is what Google has become. Its search engine accounts for nearly 80 percent of all Web searches in the United States -- and a remarkable 98 percent of searches from mobile devices. In that role, Google is not just an eponymous verb but perhaps the most central conduit of information in the nation -- and, indeed, on the planet. No other search engine comes close.
News accounts suggest that the Federal Trade Commission will delay any decision on whether to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google until perhaps next year. That decision had been expected to come this week.
The F.T.C. has spent nearly two years investigating whether Google's search engine favors the company's own commercial endeavors over rival offerings, thereby stifling competition. And even now, some analysts believe that the commission might forgo any legal action against the company in exchange for Google's willingness to make some modest changes in the way it uses certain consumer information.
This would be a severe setback for Internet users. It will allow Google to continue to amass unbridled control over data gathering, with grave consequences for privacy and for consumer choice. (European regulators are conducting their own antitrust inquiry into Google.)
Google has been modest about its dominance in the modern information society, asserting that competing search engines, like Yahoo or Microsoft's Bing, are just ''one click away'' if people wish to use them. The Internet is an extraordinarily complex domain with equally powerful challengers, the company points out. Facebook makes Google's own social media platform look like a joke. Far more shoppers begin their online product searches through Amazon than Google. In short, there's enough competition out there, Google says, that consumers ought not to fear the company's mighty role in the information economy.
But we need to look at Google's market role -- and behavior -- through a different prism. Google is not just a ''search engine company,'' or an ''online services company,'' or a publisher, or an advertising platform. At its core, it's a data collection company.
Its ''market'' is data by, from and about consumers -- you, that is. And in that realm, its role is so dominant as to be overwhelming, and scary. Data is the engine of online markets and has become, indeed, a new asset class.
In March, when Google replaced the more than 60 privacy guidelines that governed its products and services with a single policy, it also moved to consolidate the personal data it collects. The company creates as much data in two days -- roughly 5 exabytes -- as the world produced from the dawn of humanity until 2003, according to a 2010 statement by Eric Schmidt, the company's chairman, who later declared that he didn't ''believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable, and recorded by everyone all the time.''
For now, Google uses the data to sell targeted ads, but who says the company's use of the data will be restricted to that purpose? Opt out of Google's data collection? Sure, you can do that -- but you'll also have to delete your Gmail account and leave Google's ecosystem. With Google's Android operating system -- which is activated in 1.3 million new mobile devices every day, and is used by more people than use Apple's iPhone -- that ecosystem is growing.
I've been concerned about Google's dominant role in data collection -- and the profound privacy concerns it raises -- since my time at the F.T.C. When the commission approved Google's 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick, I dissented -- because I was concerned that combining the two companies' vast troves of consumer information would allow Google, which was largely unchecked by competition, to develop invasive profiles of individuals' Internet habits.
Now, the F.T.C. has another chance to protect consumers, promote innovation and ensure fair competition online. In making its decision, it must understand that while Google may be the runaway leader in Web search and online advertising, its most troubling dominance is in the marketplace of private consumer data. If real competition in this area can be restored, I am confident that market forces will provide the incentives necessary for companies to offer attractive services and relevant, engaging ads without violating consumer privacy.
I am no longer an F.T.C. commissioner, but a lawyer representing companies -- including Microsoft -- that are concerned about Google's power as a data collector. Yes, there's some irony in that -- it wasn't long ago that Microsoft faced its own major antitrust lawsuit and had to change its anticompetitive practices.
But then, an emperor is an emperor. And when it comes to the Web, as Google's wise founders said, democracy works best.

HEADLINE: Renault to Build Assembly Plant in Algeria

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Renault will sign a deal with Algeria on Wednesday to build an assembly plant near the city of Oran, giving the French automaker wider access to one of the world's hottest car markets and a chance to further diversify beyond Europe.
The company will sign the pact, three years in the making, on the first day of a state visit by the French president, François Hollande, a Renault spokeswoman, Rochelle Chimenes, said Tuesday. 
That will pave the way for the construction of a factory to build Renault and Dacia cars to serve a market that grew 50 percent in the year through October.
Mr. Hollande is embarking on a two-day visit to smooth France's tricky relations with Algeria, a petroleum-rich country with about 37 million people. Algeria, administered as a French department in North Africa during the colonial era, won its independence in 1962 after a bloody war. France is nonetheless Algeria's largest trading partner.
Mr. Hollande, accompanied by a legion of French government and business leaders, is scheduled to meet with his Algerian counterpart, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and to address a joint session of the country's Parliament.
Algeria, which is the second-largest car market in Africa, after South Africa, is eager to reduce its dependence on the petroleum sector, which accounts for about one-third of its economy.
But restrictions on foreign investment that were enacted after the financial crisis and a failure to modernize the banking system continue to hold back the country's economic development, according to the U.S. State Department.
Oliver Masetti, an economist at Deutsche Bank, estimates that, depending on oil prices, the Algerian economy will grow up to 2.6 percent this year and as much as 3.4 percent in 2013 -- a modest increase by developing world standards.
Renault controls about 27 percent of the Algerian market, and its sales have soared about 57 percent there this year. Its Clio supermini car is the country's best-selling model.
In Morocco, Renault opened a factory this year in Tangier to make cars for export to European and Mediterranean markets.
Renault is better diversified globally than its ailing French rival, PSA Peugeot Citroën, thanks in part to its alliance with Nissan Motor.
But it is looking for growth outside the European Union, which is gripped by recession and faces the possibility that austerity measures will mean years of stagnation.
La Tribune, a French financial daily, reported Tuesday that Mr. Hollande would raise with his hosts the possibility that the Algerian government dip into its $200 billion of foreign reserves to take a stake in Peugeot, which is undergoing a painful restructuring to stay afloat. Any such request would probably fall on deaf ears, the newspaper cited an unidentified Algerian official as saying.
Cécile Damide, a spokeswoman for Peugeot, declined to comment.
Sales of new cars in the 27-nation European Union fell 7.6 percent in the first 11 months of 2012 from a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Sales declined in every major market except Britain, bringing absolute sales to a level last seen in 1993.
The Algerian government will hold 51 percent of the new factory, with Renault owning the rest, the French daily newspaper Le Figaro reported Tuesday, without identifying its source.
The company declined to comment on the details, but such an arrangement would be consistent with the standard foreign investment contract in Algeria. Le Figaro also said the plant would begin operation in 2014 with annual production of about 25,000 vehicles, which could grow to 75,000.

HEADLINE: Alex Moulton, 92; Creator of Quirky Small-Wheeled Bike

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Alex Moulton, a British automotive engineer who created a small-wheeled bicycle that fired a trend in the 1960s and became the forerunner of the collapsible, portable bikes of today, died on Dec. 9 in Bath, England. He was 92.
His death was confirmed by his grandnephew Shaun Moulton, the chief executive of the Moulton Bicycle Company, which Alex Moulton founded and which still makes by hand bicycles based on his original design in Bradford-on-Avon, where Mr. Moulton lived. 
Mr. Moulton, who had made a number of innovations in automobile suspension systems, began toying with a small-wheel design for an adult bicycle in the late 1950s. His interest was partly spurred by gasoline rationing in Britain during the Suez crisis, which began when Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, an act that threatened to halt oil shipments to Western Europe from the Persian Gulf.
But the design was also fostered by his own engineer's determination to make things better: ''The Moulton bicycle was born out of my resolve to challenge and improve upon the classic bicycle,'' he said.
His idea was to create a more efficient, all-purpose vehicle, suitable for errands and commuting at least as much as for recreation. He wanted it to have substantial carrying capacity, to be maneuverable in traffic, to roll smoothly and to be pedaled easily.
He came up with a bike with wheels 16 inches in diameter, high-pressure tires for minimum rolling resistance, front and rear rubber suspension systems for smooth riding on potholed or cobblestoned roads, and a step-through frame (that is, without the top tube of the traditional diamond-shaped frame) for easy dismounting (and more suitable for women wearing skirts). The small wheels left plenty of room for carrying briefcases, shopping bags or overnight luggage.
The early bikes could easily be taken apart for convenient stowing, though they were not really foldable; still, the small-wheel collapsible bikes of today owe a debt to the original Moulton. (Moulton now makes foldable bikes itself.)
Mr. Moulton completed the prototype in 1959 and offered to license it to the Raleigh bicycle company. When it turned him down, he began making them himself, introducing the bicycle at a London bicycle fair in 1962 and founding the Moulton Bicycle Company in Bradford-on-Avon in 1964.
The bicycles immediately took hold in 1960s Britain, where, because of their quirkiness and convenience, they became ''seen as a fashionable minibike,'' as the company says on its Web site, ''to go with miniskirts and mini cars.''
They were less popular in the United States, where the Huffman Manufacturing Company in Dayton, Ohio, began making them in 1965.
Life magazine referred to Mr. Moulton's invention as ''the first basic advance in bicycle design in 70 years,'' and the Raleigh company, after creating a competing design of its own and then scrapping it, eventually approached Mr. Moulton to acquire the rights it had failed to secure years earlier. Raleigh manufactured the Moulton bicycle from 1967 to 1974.
Alexander Eric Moulton was born on April 9, 1920, in Stratford-on-Avon. His great-grandfather founded a rubber company. His father, John Coney Moulton, was a zoologist and British army officer who spent years in Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, where he was curator of the Sarawak Museum and became chief secretary to the white rajah, Charles Brooke, Sarawak's head of state. John Moulton died when his son Alex was 5 or 6, leaving him to be raised by his mother, Beryl, and her family.
Alex Moulton graduated in engineering from Cambridge. During World War II he worked at the Bristol Aeroplane Company as the assistant to the company's chief engineer, a leading designer of aircraft engines. After the war he joined the family rubber business, Spencer Moulton and Company, and established a research department specializing in automobile suspension systems.
Mr. Moulton made his innovations in suspension systems using rubber cones instead of the coil or leaf springs that had been standard. Working with Sir Alec Issigonis, developer of the British Motor Company's popular economy car, the Mini, Mr. Moulton created a space-efficient system known as the Hydrolastic suspension.
It was incorporated in a number of cars made by B.M.C. and its successors, including the Mini, the Austin 1800 and the MG 1100. A next-generation suspension system, known as Hydragas and also a product of Mr. Moulton's work, was used on many other cars, including the Austin Allegro, a small family car; and a sports car, the MG F.
Spencer Moulton and Company was sold in the late 1950s, and Mr. Moulton founded his own design firm, Moulton Developments Limited. He never married and leaves no immediate survivors.
''Having spent most of my life involved in automotive engineering, I find it interesting to reflect that the automobile, with all its convenience of use and fascination to the engineer, was an inevitable evolution from the horse-drawn chariot; whereas the bicycle, with its human propulsion and single track, is an extraordinary and unlikely device to have been created!'' Mr. Moulton wrote in the mid-1990s, in a pamphlet titled ''The Moulton Bicycle: The World's Most Efficient Form of Transport.''
''The contrast in the activity of motoring and cycling could not be more profound,'' he continued. ''The driver, who sits in a low, enclosed, air-conditioned environment or 'cage,' is only sensually and nervously involved and is isolated from the surroundings; whereas the cyclist, with a high sightline and in the open air, is physically involved, and proceeds in that miraculous way entirely by his or her own effort of health-giving exercise, with nervous relaxation and spiritual uplift even!''

HEADLINE: U.N. Presents Grim Prognosis on the World Economy

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
World economic growth has weakened substantially this year and faces the confluence of a triple threat -- the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States, the European debt crisis and a sharp slowdown in China, the United Nations said in a report released on Tuesday. The worst case, the report said, could be a new global recession that mires many countries in a cycle of austerity and unemployment for years.
The report's main author, Robert Vos, director of the Development Policy and Analysis Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said it could take until at least 2017 just to recoup the jobs lost in the United States and Europe since the 2008-9 recession. 
He forecast world growth for 2013 at 2.4 percent, ''a significant downgrade'' from the United Nations' midyear forecast of 3.1 percent. He said the 2012 growth rate was 2.2 percent, versus the midyear forecast of 2.5 percent.
''I'm afraid this time around we're not very optimistic about how things are moving,'' Mr. Vos said at a news conference at United Nations headquarters.
''A worsening of the euro area crisis, the 'fiscal cliff' in the United States and a hard landing in China could cause a new global recession,'' Mr. Vos said in the report, ''World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013.'' He said the forecast growth was ''far from sufficient to overcome the continued jobs crisis that many countries are still facing.''
The report's proposals to avoid that outcome -- more government programs that focus on job growth, fiscal coordination and aid to developing countries -- are not likely to be widely embraced by policy makers in the United States and Europe, where the preoccupation is on budget cuts and spending discipline. Still, the report provides one of the most complete assessments of the world's economic trends and reflects what United Nations experts view as the most pressing areas of concern.
Shamshad Akhtar, assistant secretary general for economic development, who introduced Mr. Vos's report, began by reciting a list of maladies, including record unemployment in Europe, a decline in global trade, volatility in the flows of capital and low food stocks in many poorer countries that have made prices in those countries unpredictable.
While she and Mr. Vos acknowledged the news reports on progress in the debt-reduction negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans to avoid dire automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would take effect in January, what has been called the fiscal cliff, they erred on the side of assuming the worst. Both said the shock of those drastic fiscal changes would further weaken economies elsewhere.
''Even if we don't get to the fiscal cliff, what's on the table now is not too far from what would happen if the United States goes over the cliff,'' Mr. Vos said. ''That is reason for some concern.''
He criticized the focus in developed countries on austerity, calling it ''detrimental to their own economic recovery,'' and said cuts ''should not come at the expense of the development efforts of the poorest nations.''
During the economic crisis four years ago, China helped to cushion the impact with huge doses of stimulus spending, but there is no single savior this time. If China's growth rate of 7.5 percent this year slows to 5 percent or less, Mr. Vos said, ''that would have major global ramifications.''
He said growth rates in 2012 fell sharply almost everywhere except Africa, where economies grew in the 5 percent to 6 percent range, helped by strength in oil-exporting countries, spending on basic infrastructure improvements and expanding ties with Asian economies.
But he said Africa remains plagued by armed conflicts and many other challenges, and the strong growth will not hasten the end of the continent's poverty.

HEADLINE: In Effort to Gain a Fuller Picture of Media Consumers, Nielsen Plans to Buy Arbitron

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
7:54 p.m. | Updated Consumers today are gleaners of information, moving swiftly from cellphones to newspapers, tablets to radio and social media to television. The question for advertisers is how to reach them across a fragmented environment.
The potential for tracking consumers wherever they go was the rationale behind the announcement on Tuesday that Nielsen Holdings, the company that decades ago standardized the television advertising market through its ratings system, had reached an agreement to buy its radio industry counterpart, Arbitron, for $1.26 billion. 
The deal, which is subject to approval by federal regulators, would expand Nielsen's already extensive portfolio of tools to analyze consumers' overlapping media habits. According to Nielsen, it would also increase the number of hours a day that it can monitor an average American's media consumption, to seven from the current five.
"That is a very big deal when your job is to measure how consumers ultimately form and change behaviors," David L. Calhoun, Nielsen's chief executive, said in a conference call with investors and Wall Street analysts.
Nielsen is best known for its TV ratings, but it also tracks sales of books, music and other consumer products, and measures media habits online. On Monday, the company announced a partnership with Twitter to rank television shows by their levels of social media chatter.
Its goal is to gain as thorough a picture of consumer behavior as possible to allow advertisers and media companies to make more effective investments.
"These integrated, innovative capabilities will enable broader measurement of consumer media behavior in more markets around the world," Steve Hasker, Nielsen's president of global media products and advertiser solutions, said in a statement.
So far, though, the idea of a complete picture of consumer media behavior is still elusive, and there is no guarantee that the addition of Arbitron would provide it.
"You want them to be able to stitch everything together as seamlessly as possible," said Jed Meyer, a former Nielsen executive who is the United States director of research at the Annalect Group, part of the Omnicom Media Group, the media division of Omnicom Group. "That's the promise, but the question for this and other mergers is whether they can execute."
The merger has the potential to bring together the two companies' complementary strengths. Nielsen collects a broad amount of data from television, retail and the Internet, and has wide global reach, but analysts say that it has had little success tracking consumers' habits while they are on the go.
Arbitron, however, does just a fraction of its business outside the United States but in recent years has been exploring new methods of mobile tracking. Its Portable People Meter, a pager-size device, has given the radio industry a far more detailed picture of its audience than was available before.
A combined Nielsen-Arbitron, several radio executives and analysts said, could help draw advertising to the medium. Last year ad spending was $17.4 billion, flat from the year before and still down about 18 percent from prerecession levels, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau.
Radio consumption has held strong in the Internet age, as people stay plugged in to their favorite stations, particularly while driving. According to Arbitron's most recent statistics, more than 241 million people in the United States, or about 92 percent of the population age 12 and over, listen to the radio each week. And unlike television, a large majority of the ads on broadcast radio are for local businesses.
The proposed merger has also drawn concerns about consolidation in the global media research field, which has become dominated by a handful of firms like Kantar Media, comScore, Ipsos and now potentially the combined Nielsen-Arbitron.
"Nielsen is no stranger to radio," said Paul Heine, a senior editor at the trade publication Inside Radio. "It has measured it before as an alternative to Arbitron, and there is some concern in the radio business that it further tightens the monopoly on measurement."
But several analysts said that given Arbitron's relatively small size, the deal was not likely to face major hurdles with regulators. Nielsen, active in more than 100 countries, had $5.5 billion in revenue last year. Arbitron had $422 million in revenue last year, but, with $53 million in net income, had wider profit margins.
Among the other hopes for the merger were that it could lead to more measurement of online services and link Arbitron's value for local advertising with Nielsen's more extensive, national data.
Despite the growth of Internet radio, services like Pandora, which has more than 60 million regular listeners, is not tracked by Arbitron and therefore lacks "apples to apples" audience data to lure potential advertisers. Such measurements have been sought after by advertisers, particularly as major broadcasters like Clear Channel Communications embrace online radio, but Arbitron has been slow to introduce a system that would put online and offline listening on equal footing.
Laura Martin, an entertainment and media analyst at Needham & Company, said that Nielsen's expertise and its aggressive push into online markets could be an advantage in exploiting Arbitron's local radio data.
"It's interesting that they will have the management I.Q. of Nielsen in charge of local advertising possibilities," Ms. Martin said. "The Internet is moving at the speed of light, and the next big promise of advertising cash is sitting in local. In Nielsen's hands those relationships may turn into something that Arbitron didn't think of."
Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Social Security Checks Enter the Debate

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - As part of a deal being negotiated by President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner to avert the worst of the year-end tax increases and spending cuts, Social Security payments might be lower in the future for millions of Americans.
On Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans were examining a multitrillion-dollar deficit reduction package put forward by the president, though the two sides were trading barbed remarks and aides were emphasizing that nothing was final until the whole deal was done. 
But the White House seemed willing to make a concession to Republicans with a switch in the formula that ensures that Social Security payments keep up with the pace of inflation - an idea that immediately proved unpopular with its liberal base.
"Any talk of shrinking the program to save money is flawed from the start because Social Security is not part of the national budget in the same way as military spending," Representative Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona said in a statement. "It's paid for through a dedicated payroll tax separate from general budgeting."
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York was among many on the left who echoed that sentiment. "Everyone has a grandparent, a friend or a neighbor who relies on the Social Security benefits they earned to pay for medical care, food and housing," he said in a statement. "A move towards chained Consumer Price Index would be a long-term benefit cut for every single person who receives a Social Security check."
Democrats and Republicans are considering switching Social Security payment adjustments to a "chained" Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index tracks the price of a basket of commonly purchased household goods. A chained index accounts for consumers' tendency to substitute similar items for one another as prices fluctuate. A consumer might buy more apples when the price of oranges increases, for instance.
Though it sounds like nothing more than a technical fix, adopting a chained index would squeeze benefits over time. The chained index ends up, in a given year, about 0.3 percentage points lower than the unchained index. That difference accumulates, so after five years, it might be 1.5 percentage points lower. Using a chained index would cut Social Security spending by about $112 billion over a decade, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.
AARP, the lobbying and research group for older Americans, immediately criticized the proposal. "We would rather see a broader discussion addressing retirement security," said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP. "We object to the context in which it's being discussed, which is a few weeks before Christmas, without people understanding what the change really means."
Because the payment reductions would accumulate over time, AARP and other groups argue that they would hit the oldest Americans disproportionately hard. They might also unduly burden women, who tend to live longer than men, and the lowest-income older people, who are most dependent on Social Security checks, the groups warned.
Some economists and policy experts have also argued that both the current and the chained indexes underestimate the inflation that older Americans experience. The government produces an experimental "elderly index," for instance, that tries to capture the consumption habits of people over 62 more accurately than other measures. For instance, older people buy more health care and less education than the average family, so the elderly index puts more weight on the former and less on the latter.
In no small part because of spiraling health care costs, inflation as measured by the elderly index has grown faster than inflation as calculated by the standard index that Social Security uses. That implies that the purchasing power of Social Security payments linked to a chained index would erode more over time, given what older Americans buy.
Still, other economists and policy experts from across the political spectrum have argued that a chained index is a more accurate measure of the inflation that households actually experience, and therefore is a better policy tool. They note that the elderly index is still experimental, and that not just older people receive or spend Social Security payments.
"We know that the current measure of inflation is not adequately measuring experienced inflation, and we should hence go with the better measure," said Christian E. Weller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group based in Washington, and the author of a plan to modernize Social Security.
Both liberals and conservatives have at times argued against making changes to Social Security outside the context of a broader overhaul. Many analysts - particularly Democrats - argue that Social Security does not contribute to long-term deficits because it has its own financing stream in payroll taxes. But it does have a long-term fiscal challenge, as payouts would eventually overwhelm its trust fund and revenues.
"Back when the system started, the demographics were really favorable," said Andrew G. Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning research group in Washington. "You could provide decent benefits for the rich and poor alike at low cost. You can't do that anymore, mathematically. We could provide decent benefits for the rich and the poor by raising taxes a lot, but we need to raise taxes for other things."
Mr. Biggs said Social Security changes that provided more ample benefits to vulnerable low-income older people and less to the well-off might prove to be a better path forward.
"We oppose chained C.P.I.," Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said in an interview. "But I think all of us are waiting to see the details in the final package, and we'll make our determination then."

HEADLINE: A Suburban Wasteland in Virginia Gets a Modern Urban Feel

BYLINE: By ALISON M. RICE

 BODY:
MERRIFIELD, Va. -- To see Merrifield, Va., today, with its sleek white Target, its narrow 1920s-style streetscape of specialty food shops along Glass Alley and the rest of the $542 million mixed-use Mosaic District is to nearly forget this unincorporated area's former life as an uninviting industrial suburban crossroads.
But Gerald E. Connolly has not forgotten. Mr. Connolly, who is a second-term member of the United States House of Representatives and a former local official for this corner of Northern Virginia, is familiar with Merrifield's past and present. He remembers thinking to himself, ''What a waste of land,'' after being elected in 1995 to the Fairfax County board of supervisors. ''We have this aging movie theater that's surrounded by acres of surface parking,'' Mr. Connolly said.
Devising a solution required some imagination. When Mr. Connolly and others first began talking about redeveloping Merrifield, the area was known for its clogged traffic, fast-food restaurants, a dilapidated auto repair shop with quirky decorations, an industrial equipment rental business, a multiscreen movie theater and a huge regional post office. 
That is slowly starting to change. The auto body shop and fast-food restaurants have vanished, swept away into a long-anticipated $120 million road project designed to smooth the car-choked intersection at Lee Highway and Gallows Road, used by 80,000 vehicles a day. The Lee Highway Multiplex, which was the site of a gang-related incident in 2005, is now gone, its land sold after its owner, National Amusements, scrambled to respond to a debt crisis with its bankers.
A street grid populated with more modern buildings is beginning to emerge in the Mosaic District, which is the core of the new town center plan, and beyond. ''There's more to be done, but you can see the final result in your mind's eye without too much effort,'' Mr. Connolly said.
The company behind the latest stage in Merrifield's evolution is Edens, a private retail developer based in Columbia, S.C., that owns more than 130 shopping centers. ''This was the right project, in the right place, at the right time, by the right developer,'' said Barbara Byron, director of Fairfax County's Office of Community Revitalization. ''The vision that they presented was exactly what the county was looking for as the Merrifield Town Center.''
Edens found Merrifield, which is about 15 miles from Washington, enticing. ''There are very few sites left in the country that are undeveloped and that have the density and strength of a permanent and daytime consumer base within a 10-minute drive time,'' said Jodie W. McLean, the president and chief investment officer for Edens, who found the local market statistics -- 10 million square feet of office space within a mile and an average household income of $173,338 within a five-mile radius -- irresistible.
The result was the 31-acre Mosaic District, which opened this fall with shops and restaurants, an Angelika Film Center, a 150-room Hyatt House hotel, and 73,000 square feet of office space. While much of the retail has been leased, the offices are still awaiting the first tenants. Named Mosaic to refer to the many different Northern Virginia neighborhoods that encircle Merrifield, the project is divided into four geographic districts: fashion and retail; film and dining; market, which includes specialty food shops; and residential.
Eventually, the LEED-certified development will include a total of 500,000 square feet of retail and 1,000 residential units. The housing will be built by rental apartment developers AvalonBay and Mill Creek Residential, with townhouses for sale built by the home builder EYA of Bethesda, Md. A handful of the residences will be designated as affordable housing for qualified applicants.
All those components add up to the largest development that Edens has ever done. ''We spent a long time understanding the consumer,'' said Ms. McLean, whose team drew up profiles of what they see as crucial Mosaic District visitors, from the baby boomer mom whose youngest child is leaving for college soon to young, single women who love to shop. Based on that research, Edens decided that the district would need to become a destination that offered convenience and a unique consumer experience.
So Edens built a one-acre park and erected a supersize outdoor movie screen overlooking the park for public events to serve as a gathering place for the surrounding community.
To be more accessible to drivers than nearby Tysons Corner Center, a large regional mall with its own traffic problems, Edens specifically designed the district's parking for speedy entry and exit.
And to provide an experience, not just transactions, to shoppers who always have the Internet for low prices and fast shipping, Edens carefully vetted restaurants and retailers to find distinctive shops and restaurants. ''Consumers want to spend time where it feels unique and special,'' said Ms. McLean, whose firm wants the district to become at least a twice-weekly visit for its core customers.
As a result, the mix of retail and restaurant tenants is an untraditional combination of national retailers like Anthropologie and tiny local shops like the upscale Dawn Price Baby store and Artisan Confections, a chocolatier. But to capture them, Edens had to overcome the area's formerly downscale image and lack of identity.
''When Mosaic approached us, we had just begun to think about opening a second store,'' said Cary Kelly, owner of Ah Love Oil & Vinegar, which sells more than 30 different varieties of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. ''I thought, 'Merrifield? Where is that?' But we were really impressed by the product mix, the intentional aspect of it, and the big emphasis on local businesses.''
In the Mosaic District, Edens grouped its tenants by type, clustering specialty grocers such as MOM's Organic Market close to a butcher, fish market and wine shop, for example. ''Mixed use has relied on food of all kinds as its primary anchor, from Whole Foods to Harris Teeter and restaurants of all types,'' said Maureen McAvey, a retail specialist with the Urban Land Institute in Washington. ''As bookstores closed, food has become even more important'' to retail development.
As the district comes together, though, one piece remains stubbornly hard to fit: walkability. Intended as a pedestrian-friendly town center and less than a mile from a Metro station, Mosaic is still best reached for many visitors by car or bus, rather than on foot, because of traffic on nearby roads.
''You have to retrofit what you already have, and Gallows Road and Lee Highway were already in place,'' said Linda Q. Smyth, who represents Merrifield on the county's board of supervisors. She remembered just how insufficient Merrifield's infrastructure used to be, recalling that ''we had pieces of street that faded into nothing.''
Such a mixed bag of infrastructure takes time to convert into a walkable neighborhood. Elected officials say recent road improvements intended to divert traffic away from known Merrifield bottlenecks should help. So should many of the residential projects under construction in the area, which will expand the sidewalk network and create the new street grid, they said.
But some people are not interested in waiting to see what happens. At EYA, sales are running ahead of projections. The builder had expected to sell 48 of its town homes in the district in 2012, but as of mid-December, the builder had already sold 71, at prices starting in the $600,000s. ''They want walkable living and there's some sense of being an urban pioneer,'' Preston Innerst, EYA's vice president of sales and marketing, said of the Mosaic District buyers. ''They see a lot of upside potential, and they like the feeling of being in on the ground floor before it really takes off.''

HEADLINE: Agricultural Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''U.S. Agricultural Research Is Faltering, Report Warns'' (Green blog, nytimes.com, Dec. 10) sheds light on a pressing issue: the urgent need to finance agricultural research. But as the Agriculture Department's chief scientist, I disagree with the characterization that our research is faltering. 
Agricultural science has led our country to be the global leader in feeding the world. It has also returned more than $10 to our economy for every $1 invested in research. Continued innovation and investment are critical to maintaining our leadership and our competitive edge.
Our research is focused on the grand challenges of the 21st century -- providing food security while meeting other demands placed on agriculture for fiber, fuel and other feedstocks; preserving natural resources; and adapting to climate change -- and on fostering a culture of open science internationally.
Despite financial constraints, the quality of our work remains of high quality and value.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Government, Under Either Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
As President Obama and Speaker John Boehner negotiate to resolve the looming fiscal crisis, Americans might be forgiven for believing that the nation's problems would be solved if they could only agree on whether to raise $1.2 trillion or $1 trillion in new taxes over the next 10 years, or whether they should cut $850 billion rather than $1.2 trillion more in government spending.
This is not, unfortunately, the case. The frenzied partisan horse-trading has glossed over what is arguably the central issue of any debate over long-term fiscal policy: the kind of role we expect the government to play in the nation's future. Not only have our political leaders failed to lay out a vision of what they hope the budget will achieve, they are pulling the wool over Americans' eyes about the kind of budget we are about to get. 
The truth is that both the president and House Republicans have agreed to shrink a critical part of the government to its smallest in at least half a century. This is regardless of which trillion-dollar proposal gains the upper hand.
Consider the president's budget, which by law must include projections of taxing and spending over the next decade. Loath to raise taxes on the middle class yet unwilling to cut deeply into the budgets for Social Security or Medicare, the president and his advisers proposed cutting the discretionary part of the budget devoted to everything except defense and other security agencies to 1.7 percent of economic output by 2022, down from 3.1 percent last year.
This is not irrelevant spending. It accounts for every government expenditure except entitlements, security and interest. It pays subsidies for higher education and housing assistance for the poor. It finances the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It pays for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and training programs for unemployed workers. Without such spending, the government becomes little more than a heavily armed pension plan with a health insurer on the side.
House Republicans are equally if not more frugal. The House budget resolution, the Republicans' last detailed proposal about taxes and spending, refers to discretionary spending except national defense, a broader category than that considered in the president's budget. They too cut it to the bone: to about 2.1 percent of economic output in 2022, from 4.3 percent last year.
To put it in perspective, this would cut the government's civilian discretionary budget to the smallest it has been as a share of the economy at least since the Eisenhower administration -- when a quarter of the population lived under the poverty line, thousands of children still contracted polio each year and fewer than one in 12 Americans older than 25 had a college degree. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, even going over the so-called fiscal cliff would not cut it as deeply.
''This is no way to run a $3.7 trillion enterprise,'' said a Columbia University economist, Jeffrey Sachs, referring to the size of the federal government. ''It is President Obama's responsibility to put forward a plan and give us a comprehensive view of what is the strategy.''
The numbers for civilian discretionary spending shrink so much under both the president's and the House Republicans' budget proposals that even those who wrote them seem to have a hard time believing they will come true.
Rather than specify how all the required cuts would affect spending on specific programs, like housing assistance, Pell grants or the National Science Foundation, the budget writers put hundreds of billions of unspecified savings under a hazy budget line called ''allowances'' -- which essentially means cuts to be determined later, in the course of the decade. They are what Richard Kogan, a tax expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, calls ''the magic asterisk.''
President Obama's budget has almost $200 billion worth of allowances. The House Republican proposal included almost $1 trillion. ''In my personal opinion, the defense and nondefense spending caps won't hold until 2021,'' Mr. Kogan said. ''At some point the deficit will look small enough and the pressure to provide services and benefits will appear large enough that Congress will find ways around them.''
Mr. Sachs's critique comes from the president's left, where there is widespread belief that the nation needs more tax revenue to avoid sacrificing important government programs. But economists to the president's right share the concern over an opaque budgeting process that fails to address the central issue of our time.
''Either we reform entitlements or we accept large tax increases or we crowd out everything else the government does,'' noted R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, who advised the Republican nominee Mitt Romney during the last presidential campaign. ''People need to have that discussion.''
We've had this debate several times before. President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was based on the proposition that government should play a much bigger role to guarantee Americans' economic security. In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson asserted the government's responsibility to alleviate the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Three decades ago, President Ronald Reagan changed course, ushering in an era of government retrenchment that persisted pretty much unabated until we were walloped by the Great Recession.
Today, our public finances are caught between these two appetites: our preference for lower taxes and our unwillingness to accept cuts to entitlements set up in our bygone Big Government era. The average federal income tax rate is at its lowest in more than 30 years. Still, nearly half of all Americans say their income taxes are too high. And most Americans do not want government to cut spending on Medicare or Social Security.
Unwilling to confront voters with the tension between these choices, it is perhaps natural that our leaders would take the ax to discretionary spending outside of defense, the easiest part of the budget to cut. It might also explain why they are so loath to tell us what they are doing. But this reticence does not make for a fruitful debate about the role of government in our future.
Mr. Sachs recalls confronting Gene Sperling, who heads President Obama's National Economic Council, about how civilian discretionary spending shrinks in the president's budget. Mr. Sperling's reply suggests the president knows the cost-cutting is getting out of hand: ''Jeff, we have a problem with that number, too.''

HEADLINE: After Recession, More Young Adults Are Living on Street

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- Duane Taylor was studying the humanities in community college and living in his own place when he lost his job in a round of layoffs. Then he found, and lost, a second job. And a third.
Now, with what he calls ''lowered standards'' and a tenuous new position at a Jack in the Box restaurant, Mr. Taylor, 24, does not make enough to rent an apartment or share one. He sleeps on a mat in a homeless shelter, except when his sister lets him crash on her couch.
''At any time I could lose my job, my security,'' said Mr. Taylor, explaining how he was always the last hired and the first fired. ''I'd like to be able to support myself. That's my only goal.''
Across the country, tens of thousands of underemployed and jobless young people, many with college credits or work histories, are struggling to house themselves in the wake of the recession, which has left workers between the ages of 18 and 24 with the highest unemployment rate of all adults. 
Those who can move back home with their parents -- the so-called boomerang set -- are the lucky ones. But that is not an option for those whose families have been hit hard by the economy, including Mr. Taylor, whose mother is barely scraping by while working in a laundromat. Without a stable home address, they are an elusive group that mostly couch surfs or sleeps hidden away in cars or other private places, hoping to avoid the lasting stigma of public homelessness during what they hope will be a temporary predicament.
These young adults are the new face of a national homeless population, one that poverty experts and case workers say is growing. Yet the problem is mostly invisible. Most cities and states, focusing on homeless families, have not made special efforts to identify young adults, who tend to shy away from ordinary shelters out of fear of being victimized by an older, chronically homeless population. The unemployment rate and the number of young adults who cannot afford college ''point to the fact there is a dramatic increase in homelessness'' in that age group, said Barbara Poppe, the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness.
The Obama administration has begun an initiative with nine communities, most of them big cities, to seek out those between 18 and 24 who are without a consistent home address. New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Boston are among the cities included in the effort.
''One of our first approaches is getting a more confident estimate,'' said Ms. Poppe, whose agency is coordinating the initiative.
Those who provide services to the poor in many cities say the economic recovery has not relieved the problem. ''Years ago, you didn't see what looked like people of college age sitting and waiting to talk to a crisis worker because they are homeless on the street,'' said Andrae Bailey, the executive director of the Community Food and Outreach Center, one of the largest charitable organizations in Florida. ''Now that's a normal thing.''
Los Angeles first attempted a count of young adults living on the street in 2011. It found 3,600, but the city had shelter capacity for only 17 percent of them.
''The rest are left to their own devices,'' said Michael Arnold, the executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. ''And when you start adding in those who are couch surfing and staying with friends, that number increases exponentially.''
Boston also attempted counts in 2010 and 2011. The homeless young adult population seeking shelter grew 3 percentage points to 12 percent of the 6,000 homeless people served over that period.
''It's a significant enough jump to know that it's also just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Jim Greene, director of emergency shelters for the Boston Public Health Commission.
In Washington, Lance Fuller, a 26-year-old with a degree in journalism, spent the end of last month packing up a two-bedroom apartment he can no longer afford after being laid off. Mr. Fuller said he had been unable to keep a job for more than eight months since graduating from the University of Florida in 2010.
''Thankfully, I have a girlfriend who is willing to let me stay with her until I get back on my feet again,'' said Mr. Fuller, who writes a blog, Voices of a Lost Generation. ''It's really hard for people in my generation not to feel completely defeated by this economy.''
Mr. Taylor, the fast-food worker in Seattle, said he felt lucky when he could find a coveted space at Roots, a shelter for young adults in a church basement. Such shelters are rare.
For generations, services for the homeless were directed to two groups: dependent children and older people. There was scant attention focused on what experts now call ''transitional age youth'' -- young adults whose needs are distinct.
''I see them coming back day after day, more defeated, more tired out, wondering, 'When will it be my turn?' '' said Kristine Cunningham, executive director of Roots. ''And it's heartbreaking. This is the age when you want to show the world you have value.''
They need more than just clean clothes and shelter to move into a secure adulthood, experts say. ''They want a way out,'' said Ms. Poppe, whose agency is also gathering evidence on what kinds of programs and outreach work best. ''They want an opportunity to develop skills so they are marketable in the long term.''
''A more individualized approach seems to work,'' she added.
But two obstacles stand in the way: young adults, eager for independence, are reluctant to admit that they need help and housing. And shelters designed with young adults in mind -- those with career and trauma counseling, and education and training programs -- are usually small.
Roots holds only 35 people, and a nightly lottery decides who gets a spot, which includes meals, laundry services and counseling. It is expanding to 45 beds.
Anna Wiley, 20, and her boyfriend, Bobby Jollineau, 24, spent several nights at Roots two weeks ago, but were unable to get in one night in November. ''We ended up sleeping outside,'' Mr. Jollineau said. ''I have a sleeping pad and a really warm sleeping bag. There's a couple of nooks and crannies that are safe around here, but you have to be careful. It can make for a rough night.''
Asked whether she could go to her parents' home, Ms. Wiley said that her father is unemployed and that her mother works in a deli, making about as little as she does.
''I don't like relying on other people too much, anyway,'' she said.
Across town, Roman Tano, 20, woke up recently at YouthCare's James W. Ray Orion Center, another shelter for young adults that offers training programs. In October, its capacity grew to 20 beds from 15.
Two months ago, Mr. Tano gave up an apartment in his native Dallas after losing his job. He sold his Toyota and sought opportunities in the Pacific Northwest.
He rented a room and set out with his résumé (expertise: fund-raising). But when his $2,000 in savings withered to nothing, ''I ended up sleeping on the street for the first time in my life,'' he said. ''I just kind of had to walk around and try to stay warm.''
Mr. Tano found the YouthCare shelter online, and has been staying there for a month. He has a new job as a canvasser for an environmental organization.
''Coming into it, I was, like, completely out of my element,'' he said of YouthCare. ''But in the time I've been here, it's a pretty diverse group of people. There are a lot of people just trying to work to get out of this.''
''After I get my paycheck,'' he said brightly, ''I should be on my way.''

HEADLINE: Boehner Plan Addresses Taxes but Delays Fight Over Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jennifer Steinhauer and Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republican leaders struggled on Tuesday night to rally their colleagues around a backup measure to ease the sting of a looming fiscal crisis by allowing tax rates to rise only on incomes over $1 million.
The plan would leave in place across-the-board spending cuts to military and domestic programs that Republicans have been warning could have dire consequences, especially to national defense.
Speaker John A. Boehner unveiled what he dubbed ''Plan B'' less than 24 hours after President Obama offered a more comprehensive deal that would raise tax rates on incomes over $400,000 and, over 10 years, produce $1.2 trillion in tax increases and cut $930 billion in spending.
Mr. Boehner pledged to continue negotiating on a broad deficit-reduction deal but called the president's plan unbalanced and insufficient. 
''What we've offered meets the definition of a balanced approach, but the president is not there yet,'' Mr. Boehner said Tuesday.
The Boehner proposal was intended to raise the pressure on Democrats to compromise further still by embracing a tax increase on millionaires first pushed by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.
Confronted with her past support for raising income taxes only on millionaires, Ms. Pelosi said that effort had merely been ''a plan to smoke out'' Republicans.
But a protracted meeting of the House Republican Conference on Tuesday night made it clear that passage of Mr. Boehner's proposal would be difficult. Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he was not sure he could support a bill that would allow $500 billion in military cuts over the next 10 years and indicated that other Republicans on his committee shared his concern.
Representative John Fleming, a conservative Republican from Louisiana, dismissed the speaker's plan as a pointless ''messaging exercise.''
''Why go on record raising taxes on anybody if it won't cut spending and won't even become law?'' he asked. ''I haven't found a way of supporting that.''
Ms. Pelosi was leaning hard on House Democrats to stay united in their opposition. If she succeeds, the speaker could afford about only 18 Republican defections, fewer than he has had on any major fiscal vote since Republicans took control two years ago.
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta was unsparing on Tuesday in his criticism of lawmakers resisting a deal to stop the military cuts.
''It is unacceptable to me that men and women who put their lives on the line in distant lands have to worry about whether those here in Washington can effectively support them,'' Mr. Panetta said in a speech at the National Press Club. ''We're down to the wire now. In these next few days, Congress needs to make the right decisions to avoid the fiscal disaster that awaits us.''
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, an influential Republican, said the Pentagon cuts would damage not only military readiness but also the fragile economy.
House Republican leaders on Tuesday night sought to assess whether the speaker's proposal could be brought to the House floor on Thursday. Under that plan, the House would take up take up tax legislation and consider two amendments. The first would mirror a Senate-passed bill to extend the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for incomes below $250,000. That would be expected to fail, as a show to the president that his initial offer cannot pass.
A second amendment would raise that threshold to incomes below $1 million. The House may also vote on some middle ground, like the president's $400,000.
Mr. Boehner told House Republicans that he would also like the bill to include provisions to prevent the existing alternative minimum tax from expanding to impact more of the middle class and to extend existing low tax rates on inherited estates.
But he said the bill would not cancel across-the-board spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- that are scheduled to total $110 billion in 2013 and more than $1 trillion over 10 years.
Republicans would resume the fight for broad spending cuts, especially to entitlement programs like Medicare, in late January or February, when the government will face raising its borrowing limit and when, many Republicans believe, they will have much more leverage than they do now.
The White House came out strongly against the speaker's plan. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said that it could not pass the Senate and ''therefore will not protect middle-class families'' from large tax increases schedule to begin on Jan. 1.
''The president has put a balanced, reasonable proposal on the table that achieves significant deficit reduction and reflects real compromise,'' he said, ''by meeting the Republicans halfway on revenue and more than halfway on spending from where each side started.''
It is not clear whether the Boehner plan is a serious alternative or primarily a bargaining tactic to extract more concessions from Mr. Obama. Rob Nabors, the president's chief liaison to Congress, met with House Democrats on Tuesday and said talks were moving forward.
But privately, he expressed pessimism that Mr. Boehner could sign on to any deal, according to people familiar with those conversations.
In spite of talk to the contrary just a week ago, House Republicans seemed almost uniformly resigned on Tuesday to some sort of tax rate increases on the nation's highest earners, though they remained committed to keeping that group as small as possible. ''The principle of trying to limit the increases is a good one,'' said Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah. ''But now we've got to see more spending cuts.''
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said the speaker's approach could not pass the Democratic-controlled Senate.
''Now is the time to show leadership, not kick the can down the road,'' he said in a statement. ''Speaker Boehner should focus his energy on forging a large-scale deficit-reduction agreement. It would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the Tea Party, as they have time and again.''
The president said Monday that he would come down to $1.2 trillion in tax increases over 10 years from his initial $1.6 trillion. He also said tax rates should rise on incomes over $400,000 a year, up from the $250,000 level he has pushed for more than four years.
The White House says its offer amounts to $1.2 trillion in tax increases and $1.22 trillion in spending cuts. Mr. Boehner says the real balance is $1.3 trillion in higher taxes and $850 billion in spending cuts. That is because the White House is counting $290 billion in lower interest costs on a smaller national debt as ''spending cuts'' and is not counting higher taxes that would be paid if, as Mr. Obama wants, a new method of calculating inflation is instituted.
In past deficit deals, including last summer's agreement that set up the automatic spending cuts to force a broader budget accord, Mr. Boehner had also counted interest savings as a spending cut.
The new method of calculating inflation would slow increases in some government benefits, especially Social Security, but it would also slow the annual rise in tax brackets, pushing some people into higher tax brackets faster as their incomes rise faster than the brackets rise.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Is in the Middle of Argentina's Long Battle With Its Creditors

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Gramercy Funds Management is not exactly a household name in the investing world. But in recent weeks it has emerged as a major player in Argentina's long-running battle against creditors.
The fight is over how much Argentina will pay to cover its 2001 default of $82 billion in sovereign debt. Thomas P. Griesa, a federal judge in Manhattan, has ordered Argentina to pay $1.3 billion to investors who hold the defaulted debt and who refused to participate in the country's subsequent debt restructurings. Argentina has declined to pay.
A group of investment funds that hold Argentine debt created in the restructuring has filed briefs on behalf of the country. 
They are led by Gramercy, a $3.4 billion hedge fund that specializes in emerging market investments and that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. While Gramercy is an advocate for Argentina in court, past legal problems at the firm are coming into focus. They relate to a number of tax problems experienced by clients of Gramercy Advisors, an affiliate that ceased operations in 2011.
According to federal and state court filings, Gramercy Advisors arranged deals involving distressed Brazilian debt that the Internal Revenue Service later ruled to be sham transactions.
Hundreds of millions of dollars in tax losses in these deals have been disallowed for Gramercy's clients.
Sean F. O'Shea, a lawyer who represents Gramercy, called the tax cases against the firm ''stale and meritless.'' He added: ''No court or regulator in over 10 years has found any merit whatsoever to any allegations raised against Gramercy in connection with these cases.''
Robert S. Koenigsberger, founder and chief investment officer of Gramercy Funds Management, was a principal at Gramercy Advisors, regulatory filings show. He declined to comment, but according to the firm's Web site, he started Gramercy in 1998 and ''led Gramercy's efforts in conceiving, organizing and facilitating the successful restructuring of Argentina's defaulted debt,'' in 2010.
An article in The Financial Times that year said Gramercy was believed to be the largest investor in Argentine debt securities.
The Gramercy investments that created tax problems for its clients were known as Distressed Asset Debt deals or DADs. They involved the purchase of old and uncollected Brazilian consumer debt obligations belonging to several retailers. According to the I.R.S., the obligations were purchased by Gramercy clients at a price far in excess of their worth and at a value determined by Gramercy. When the debt was subsequently sold at market value -- for pennies on the dollar -- the clients using the investment strategy reported sizable tax losses.
The deals were made in the early 2000s. But after the I.R.S. ruled that the shelters did not have an economic purpose other than to generate a tax benefit, back taxes and penalties were levied. About 50 investors in the Gramercy Global Recovery Fund were affected.
Some of these clients have sued the firm. One complaint with fraud accusations was filed against Gramercy by two investors in New York State Supreme Court in September 2011.
Echoing the I.R.S.'s assessments, the investors contend that Gramercy's investment strategy involved false valuations of worthless instruments; they also say the deals generated illegitimate profits to the firm. The judge heard arguments on a motion to dismiss the matter several weeks ago. She has not yet ruled.
The federal government also took action last year against Gramercy Advisors for failing to provide 1,300 pages of documents subpoenaed in a case related to dubious tax deals like those arranged by Gramercy.
''Gramercy was caught withholding relevant and responsive documents,'' the government said in an April 2011 filing. ''The transaction the United States is requesting documents for is not an 'investment' but an elaborate scheme to claim artificial tax losses for the sole purpose of avoiding large tax liabilities owed by its clients,'' the government said.
J. Robert Young, Gramercy's managing director for accounting, testified that the firm had ''sold 'tax solutions' to multiple clients to generate approximately $700 million in false losses'' for 2002 alone, the government's filing noted.
Mr. O'Shea, the Gramercy lawyer, disputed the government's statement. ''Mr. Young has never given that testimony and Gramercy has never sold tax solutions, period,'' he said.
A lawyer for the government overseeing that case said Gramercy had produced the documents it requested after a United States magistrate judge in Connecticut ordered it to do so.
Gramercy's role in the Argentine dispute does not involve the kind of tax shelters that have drawn I.R.S. scrutiny. Instead, Gramercy is one of the firms holding debt that was exchanged in the post-default restructuring by Argentina. In 2005, some 91 percent of $82 billion in bonds were exchanged for new debt worth 25 percent to 29 percent of the original value.
But some investors did not agree to the restructuring. Known as the holdouts, they include thousands of Italian pensioners and two large hedge funds, Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital Management. The hedge funds have sued Argentina to try to secure payment of what they are owed.
Judge Griesa in New York federal court sided with the holdouts this year, ruling that the terms of Argentina's debt require it to pay them when it pays interest on the restructured bonds.
Gramercy is leading the charge to overturn the judge's ruling, which has been stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In court filings, Mr. Koenigsberger stated that his firm owned significant amounts of the nation's restructured debt on behalf of clients like public pension funds, charitable organizations and foundations.
Investors holding the restructured debt have argued that they will be hurt if Argentina pays the holdouts.
Gramercy sent a letter last month to clients announcing the introduction of a new fund. It also said in the letter that its Distressed Opportunity Fund, which invested in troubled corporate and sovereign debt, generated a compound annual return of 14 percent for the three years ending last March. The fund is returning capital to clients, the letter said.
The Argentina debt imbroglio has rattled the market for the nation's debt. And the uncertainty will continue for several months. Gramercy and others appealing Judge Griesa's ruling must file their arguments with the court by Dec. 28. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 27.

HEADLINE: Led by Energy and Technology, Shares Rise on Hopes for Budget Accord

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rallied on Tuesday, capping off the Standard & Poor's 500's best two-day run in a month, on confidence that a deal would be struck in Washington to avoid spending cuts and tax increases that could hurt the economy. 
Banks, energy and technology led gains as investors remained confident that lawmakers would reach an agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff early next year, when tax increases and spending cuts are scheduled to take effect.
The PHLX oil services sector index rose 3.1 percent, with eight of its 15 components up 3 percent or more.
''The view is that the economy is getting better, and that is always good for energy demand,'' Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton Beach, Fla., said.
Mr. Hackett said the United States would avoid ''whatever the cliff means'' for the economy, allowing investors to focus on growth.
President Obama's most recent offer to Republicans in the continuing budget talks made concessions on taxes and social program spending. The House speaker, John Boehner, said the offer was ''not there yet,'' though he still hoped for an agreement. Senate Democrats, however, have expressed concern about cuts to Social Security.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 115.57 points, or 0.87 percent, to 13,350.96. The S.& P. 500-stock index gained 16.43 points, or 1.15 percent, to close at 1,446.79. The Nasdaq composite index added 43.93 points, or 1.46 percent, to 3,054.53.
It was the S.& P. 500's first back-to-back gain of more than 1 percent since late July.
Stocks of smaller companies outperformed the broader market, with the Russell 2000 up 1.5 percent.
Shares of firearms makers sank after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Friday that killed 20 young children and six adults.
Smith and Wesson fell 10 percent to $7.79 on very heavy volume, though it was still up about 77 percent this year. Sturm Ruger slid 7.7 percent to close at $40.60.
The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management said it would sell the Freedom Group, a gun maker whose Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was used in the Connecticut massacre. Dick's Sporting Goods suspended the sale of certain semiautomatic rifles in its stores nationwide.
Technology shares rose, led by Apple, up 2.9 percent at $533.90 after losing nearly 13 percent in the last two weeks. The S.& P. Information Technology Index rose 1.7 percent.
Arbitron, the media and marketing company, surged 23.6 percent to $47.03 after Nielsen Holdings agreed to buy the company for $1.26 billion. Nielsen rose 4.4 percent to $30.92.
The S.& P. financial sector added 1.5 percent.
Financial stocks rose as traders bet on a greater demand for loans and a steepening of the yield curve. Government debt sold off. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 13/32, to reach 98 8/32. The yield rose to 1.82 percent from 1.77 percent late on Monday.

HEADLINE: Search for More Savings in Medicare Now Tackles How Much, and Where

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and REED ABELSON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As President Obama and Congress try to thrash out a budget deal, the question is not whether they will squeeze money out of Medicare, but how much and who will bear the brunt of the cuts.
Republicans say that some of the savings should come from beneficiaries, and they are pushing proposals like raising the eligibility age or increasing premiums for people with high incomes, who already pay more than the standard premium. Even President Obama has proposed higher premiums, increasing the likelihood that the idea could be adopted. But any significant tinkering with the benefits for older Americans comes with significant political risks, and most Democrats in Congress strenuously oppose raising the age when Medicare coverage begins.
With growing pressure to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by the end of the year, some consensus is building around the idea that the largest Medicare savings should come from hospitals and other institutional providers of care.
''Hospitals will be in the cross hairs for more cuts,'' said Lisa Goldstein, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service, which follows nonprofit hospitals that issue bonds. While hospital executives fiercely defend the payments their own institutions receive, many acknowledge that Medicare is spending too much and growing too fast. 
Those executives point out, however, that they have already agreed to $155 billion in cuts over a decade as part of the Affordable Care Act and they face billions more in additional cuts as part of the current negotiations. They argue that such large cuts to hospitals will ultimately affect beneficiaries.
''There is no such thing as a cut to a provider that isn't a cut to a beneficiary,'' said Dr. Steven M. Safyer, the chief executive of Montefiore Medical Center, a large nonprofit hospital system in the Bronx.
Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner continued trying on Tuesday to reach an overall budget agreement, which would call for significant savings in Medicare and would avert a deep cut in Medicare payments to doctors, scheduled to occur next month.
Mr. Boehner said that an increase in the eligibility age for Medicare, favored by many Republicans, could wait until next year.
''I don't believe it's an issue that has to be dealt with between now and the end of the year,'' Mr. Boehner said Tuesday when asked about a possible change in the eligibility age. ''It is an issue, I think, if Congress were to do entitlement reform next year and tax reform, as we envision, if there is an agreement, that issue will certainly be open to debate in that context.''
The starting point for the current negotiations is President Obama's most recent budget request, which proposed legislation that would save $300 billion, or 4 percent of projected Medicare spending, over 10 years.
By contrast, Republicans in Congress are seeking savings of $400 billion to $600 billion, at least some of which should come from beneficiaries, they say.
Members of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an influential panel that advises Congress, see many opportunities to rein in costs, and they say that financial pressure on providers could make them more efficient without harming the quality of care. At a meeting of the panel earlier this month, one commission member, Scott Armstrong, president of Group Health Cooperative, a nonprofit health system in Seattle, said Medicare spent ''too much'' on inpatient hospital care -- $117 billion last year. ''In an efficient system,'' he said, ''we wouldn't be spending that kind of money on hospital services.''
Although Congress may leave the details of Medicare savings to be worked out next year, there is already discussion of cutting special payments to teaching hospitals and small rural hospitals. Lawmakers are also considering reducing payments to hospitals for certain outpatient services that can be performed at lower cost in doctors' offices. Medicare pays substantially higher rates for the same services when they are provided in a hospital outpatient department rather than a doctor's office. The differential added $1.5 billion to Medicare costs last year, and as hospitals buy physician practices around the country, the costs are likely to grow, the Medicare commission says.
The savings contemplated by Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner are substantially larger than the Medicare savings that would be produced by automatic across-the-board cutbacks scheduled to start next month if Congress does not intervene. Those Medicare savings have been estimated at $123 billion from 2013 to 2021. Some hospital executives favor the automatic cuts as more equitable -- and less painful -- than some of the specific reductions being contemplated.
Hospital administrators and others warn of potential hospital closings, shutting down of unprofitable services like hospitalization for psychiatric care and less access to medical care for the most vulnerable if the cuts are too deep. Nancy M. Schlichting, the chief executive of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, says severe cuts might make it harder for hospitals like hers to treat patients without insurance. ''It's a big question whether we can continue to do that,'' she said. ''We would have to make tough decisions.''
Many rural hospitals are worried about a reduction in certain special payments they received because they treat relatively few people and depend heavily on Medicare as a source of revenue. The payments were put in place after Medicare changed the way it paid hospitals in the 1980s and hundreds of rural hospitals disappeared, said Alan Morgan, the chief executive of the National Rural Health Association in Washington.
''We have really struggled in the last couple of years to improve our financial condition,'' said Jodi Schmidt, the chief executive of Labette Health, a small hospital in Parsons, Kan. The hospital was able to provide trauma services to people in nearby Joplin, Mo., after a tornado devastated the hospital there. ''With more cuts, the reality is we're going to have to really cut services,'' she said.
Urban teaching hospitals, which are already receiving some reduced payments for treating poor people under the federal health care law, say they, too, will have difficulty managing if there are significant cuts to medical education programs to train physicians and to the higher payments they get for outpatient care. Some of the hospitals say they have created integrated systems of doctors and hospitals, already delivering care at lower costs, that will suffer.
And any significant reduction in payments is likely to increase the pace of mergers among hospitals as they combine to become more efficient -- and try to negotiate better rates with insurers, industry analysts say.
Other providers that could see cutbacks include home health agencies. Glenn M. Hackbarth, the chairman of the Medicare payment commission, said they provided invaluable services but were receiving ''high levels of payment, way above costs'' in many cases.
Complicating the negotiations is also a fundamental disagreement over where the savings should go. Republicans want to use Medicare savings to reduce federal budget deficits. By contrast, many Democrats and health policy experts would prefer to use the money to pay doctors.
Under current law, doctors face a 26.5 percent cut in their Medicare fees on Jan. 1. Just to block that cut and freeze payments to doctors would cost $11 billion next year and more than $240 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.
Lawmakers are considering other alternatives, including raising the Medicare eligibility age, a top Republican priority. Republicans say an increase in the Medicare eligibility age is justified because life expectancy has increased significantly since the program was created in 1965. Congressional Democrats say the change would shift costs to older Americans and increase the number of uninsured.
Mr. Obama considered such a proposal in budget negotiations last year and again in the last month. On Thursday, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, said he understood that the idea of increasing the Medicare eligibility age was ''no longer one of the items being considered by the White House.''
The Congressional Budget Office analyzed a proposal to increase the eligibility age by two months a year until it reached 67, up from the current 65. Under this proposal, the budget office said, the federal government could save $113 billion over 10 years.
Besides hospital cuts, negotiators are considering a proposal that would require drug manufacturers to provide deeper discounts on prescription drugs dispensed to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. Obama and many Democrats say this could save more than $150 billion over 10 years. But many Republicans and drug companies oppose it as a form of price controls.
Another proposal being debated would impose a surcharge on Medicare premiums for older Americans who buy the most generous private insurance to cover their deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs. The White House and some economists say such Medigap insurance encourages the overuse of medical care. But many beneficiaries are willing to pay for the extra protection.
A White House proposal to impose the surcharge on new beneficiaries would save $2.5 billion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office says that another option, setting more stringent limits on Medigap policies, could save more than $50 billion.
But hospitals say they are worried that, in the end, Congress will turn to them for a large share of the savings. Montefiore's chief executive, Dr. Safyer, said hospitals like his had already made significant changes, focusing much more on keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital. ''We've become much more efficient,'' he said. ''We've had price compression. We're innovating and changing.'' Those changes take time, he said, but he said he was convinced that they would result in lower spending in the long run.
Dr. Safyer refused to speculate on what Montefiore might do if it faced additional cuts, which could easily total 6 percent of Montefiore's revenue. ''This is not crying wolf,'' he said. He added, ''I don't have a Plan B.''

HEADLINE: Obama Facing Critical Choice After Shooting

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For President Obama, the massacre of schoolchildren in Connecticut has upended standard political calculations and has presented a choice that goes to the heart of his approach to governance, not just on guns but also on issues like climate change, immigration and even taxes.
Should he invest his energy and the stature he won with his re-election last month in a fight he may believe in but is not sure he can actually win? And with his last election now behind him, is he willing or even able to shift the dynamics in Washington to make such fights winnable?
To his core supporters, this is a moment that will define what a second-term Obama presidency will look like -- whether it will be closer to the soaring aspirations that set liberal hearts aflutter in 2008 or more like the back-room deal making that characterized the four years that followed. Advocates on the left have long lamented that Mr. Obama was too quick to compromise, even as those on the right see him as a champion of a radical agenda. 
From his point of view, Mr. Obama has been pragmatic, making cleareyed if cold assessments about when the votes were there and when they were not. Mr. Obama does not accept the notion that he has not pursued goals that seemed hard to achieve, most notably the historic health care program he pushed through. The economic crisis invariably forced other priorities onto the shelf.
But with the election over, outside events have now presented Mr. Obama with a series of decisions. Vote counts might suggest that he is still a long way from passing significant legislation on climate change, immigration and gun control. But Hurricane Sandy, last month's Latino turnout for Democrats and now the Newtown shootings have also given him openings to make new arguments.
The developments in his fiscal negotiations with Republicans, overshadowed momentarily by the gun control debate, underscore the same tension. After agreeing to renew Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy in his first term, Mr. Obama has stood firm against it on the eve of his second and forced Republicans to accept raising rates on high income. But he compromised this week by agreeing to exempt many of those he has deemed wealthy and faces a test on whether he will stick to that even as House Republicans readied an alternative proposal.
Although he has spoken out for gun control without putting muscle into it before, his emotional speech at a memorial service in Newtown on Sunday declaring that there was no longer any ''excuse for inaction'' suggested that this time may be different. The pressure is high from pundits who compared the speech to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and suggested that Newtown may be what Birmingham was to John F. Kennedy in inspiring civil rights action.
''This moment is so pain-filled and there is such a desire -- I think you can feel it building -- to move forward in a common-sense way that he sees the imperative,'' said Melody Barnes, the president's former domestic policy adviser. ''I've looked at the pictures of his face, and I think he sees that there's no other course than to move forward. The situation demands it.''
Yet the normally sure-footed White House has seemed uncertain how far the president intends to go. Aides who normally offer expansive explanations of Mr. Obama's thinking have declined to return phone calls. On Monday, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, generally stuck to repeating the president's words from his speech to avoid boxing him in, and he tamped down expectations of instant action by using the phrase ''in coming weeks'' 16 times.
Then, later in the day, the White House confirmed that Mr. Obama had met with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and three cabinet secretaries to discuss gun control and other responses to the tragedy, but declined to provide details. Even the simple question of whether the president put Mr. Biden in charge of developing a response went unanswered by a half-dozen White House aides questioned on Tuesday.
The White House opened the window a little on Tuesday, hinting at the kinds of gun measures Mr. Obama would embrace. In the past, he has endorsed the reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons, but this time, Mr. Carney said the president would be ''actively supportive'' of a new legislative effort. The president will also support reversing the exemption from background checks for gun show purchases in certain circumstances and ''potentially'' limits on high-capacity ammunition clips of the sort used in Newtown, Mr. Carney said.
But Mr. Carney said the president hoped to forge a broader response, including looking at mental health, education and cultural issues.
These decisions are made on a scale of trade-offs that may be unique to the White House. President Bill Clinton made big pushes in his early days for priorities that did not have the votes, or that helped cost Democrats control of Congress in his first midterm election, including the assault weapon ban that later expired and left the party feeling burned for nearly two decades. Then Mr. Clinton adjusted and focused more on making incremental progress toward his goals.
President George W. Bush scorned what he considered Mr. Clinton's ''small ball'' approach and prided himself on bold initiatives like cutting taxes, remaking education, expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs and combating AIDS in Africa. But by his second term, he pursued big goals like overhauling Social Security and immigration only to lose.
''There certainly can be a cost to it,'' said Peter Wehner, an adviser to Mr. Bush who worked for Mitt Romney this year. ''You can fight for something and lose and be a weakened figure. On the other hand, sometimes there's honor in loss. You may lose but in the process you advance a cause in the eyes of history.''
Mr. Wehner and other conservatives consider the groundswell for gun control to be understandable but more a symbolic gesture than an effective response. But he said Mr. Obama had been smart about picking the terrain he fought on. ''He has waited until the stars aligned before he acted,'' he said.
In the end, the stars have not aligned before for Obama priorities like legislation on climate change and immigration. He took office amid the worst economic crisis in generations and pursued a historic health coverage expansion that had eluded his predecessors. By the time he pushed that through, enacted a stimulus package, toughened Wall Street regulations and lifted limits on gays in the military, he had lost the House and did not think the new Republican majority would agree to gun legislation.
''The president always had a personal commitment to the issue,'' said Phil Schiliro, who was Mr. Obama's first legislative affairs director. ''But given the crisis he faced when he first took office, there's only so much capacity in the system to move his agenda.''

HEADLINE: It's Not Just a Job; It's a Musical

BYLINE: By DAVID ROONEY

 BODY:
In addition to having been recorded by James Taylor, its composer, ''Millwork,'' a haunting slice of blue-collar melancholia, has been covered by artists from Emmylou Harris to Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen to Bette Midler. But as performed with a gorgeous sorrowful twang by Marie-France Arcilla in ''Working: A Musical,'' at 59E59 Theaters, this evocative ballad belongs unequivocally to the woman standing before us, a mother of three who toils as an assembly-line steam-press operator in a luggage factory, reflecting on her ''wasted'' life.
Embellished with the choreographer Josh Rhodes's dreamily robotic movements, the song is the high point of this revised production of the 1977 musical, adapted by Stephen Schwartz and Nina Faso from the 1974 Studs Terkel book, ''Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do.'' That seminal oral history compiles interviews with Americans across a broad spectrum of regions and occupations. 
More a revue than a book musical, the show features songs by a handful of composers. It was a commercial misfire on Broadway, running for just 24 post-opening performances in 1978. But ''Working'' has gone on to have a robust life in regional, high school, college and community theater productions. In a country chronically obsessed with success, the musical's celebration of even the most seemingly marginal contributions as intrinsic elements of nation-building gives it stirring resonance.
That quality shines even in an uneven presentation like Gordon Greenberg's production for Prospect Theater Company, in which the sociological too often gives way to the sentimental.
The writers and Mr. Greenberg have updated the material to acknowledge changes in working conditions and high unemployment: more tasks have become automated, more jobs have been outsourced and many artisanal skills have faded into obsolescence. Occupations like hedge-fund manager, tech-support assistant and philanthropic fund-raiser are now incorporated, though these elements frequently are given patronizing handling that seems out of character with Terkel's nonjudgmental project.
The show is best in intimate, contemplative mode: Donna Lynne Champlin as a veteran schoolteacher wondering how her methods became so ill-suited to today's unruly, overpopulated classrooms in the Mary Rodgers-Susan Birkenhead song ''Nobody Tells Me How''; or Kenita R. Miller vowing in Micki Grant's ''Cleanin' Woman'' that her daughter will break the family tradition of domestic work.
Three songs by Craig Carnelia are quietly affecting. In ''Just a Housewife'' Ms. Miller apologizes for the modesty of her role while reaffirming its importance; Jay Armstrong Johnson gives a soulful account of the pride that goes into stonework in ''The Mason''; and Joe Cassidy conveys the disconcerting loss of self-definition that retirement brings in ''Joe.''
In the more dynamically presentational numbers the material tends to flounder. Ms. Champlin is an accomplished musical performer but her jazz-handsy, jokester waitress in Mr. Schwartz's ''It's an Art'' belongs in another show. The same goes for one of two new songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, ''Delivery,'' a stridently peppy comic confessional by a McDonald's employee, sung by Nehal Joshi.
Mr. Miranda's other contribution, ''A Very Good Day,'' parallels the experiences of an elder-care worker (Mr. Joshi) and a nanny (Ms. Arcilla), both of them immigrants serving families other than their own. It's a touching mini-narrative, but it veers toward schmaltz, and again, is not quite in sync with the show's overall tone.
Beowulf Boritt's minimal set features a rear dressing room visible behind a scrim through which the actors can be seen preparing for their roles -- theirs is a profession like any other. Mr. Greenberg underlines that connection by frequently having the cast transition between characters in full view of the audience, with Ms. Miller's housewife becoming a prostitute, or Mr. Cassidy's ironworker a money manager.
''Working'' has been called the nonshowbiz counterpart to ''A Chorus Line.'' Its journalistic roots are what make the show an intriguing piece of late-20th-century musical history, even if efforts to drag it into the 21st deliver mixed results.

HEADLINE: Scientists See Big Impacts on U.S. Ecosystems from Global Warming

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: From fisheries to forests, American ecosystems are feeling the effect of human-driven climate change, with more to come. 

 BODY:
A new analysis by dozens of scientists provides a useful update on measured and anticipated impacts of human-driven climate change on ecosystems from western forests to coastal waters. The report, "Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services," is one of a suite of studies feeding into what will be the third National Climate Assessment, an overarching analysis of impacts on everything from transportation systems to public health. (Periodic assessments were requested by Congress in 1990; the previous two are here.) The previous two reports were the subject of political and legal tussles.
Here's the nut of the report's summary, with a link to the rest:
Biodiversity and ecosystems are already more stressed than at any comparable period of human history. Climate change almost always exacerbates the problems caused by other environmental stressors including: land use change and the consequent habitat fragmentation and degradation; extraction of timber, fish, water, and other resources; biological disturbance such as the introduction of non-native invasive species, disease, and pests; and chemical, heavy metal, and nutrient pollution. As a corollary, one mechanism for reducing the negative impacts of climate change is a reduction in other stressors. 
Climate change is causing many species to shift their geographical ranges, distributions, and phenologies at faster rates than previously thought. Changes in terrestrial plant and animal species ranges are shifting the location and extent of biomes, and altering ecosystem structure and functioning. These rates vary considerably among species. Terrestrial species are moving up in elevation at rates 2 to 3 times greater than initial estimates. Despite faster rates of warming in terrestrial systems compared to ocean environments, the velocity of range shifts for marine taxa exceeds those reported for terrestrial species. Species and populations that are unable to shift their geographic distributions or have narrow environmental tolerances are at an increased risk of extinction.
There is increasing evidence of population declines and localized extinctions that can be directly attributed to climate change. Ecological specialists and species that live at high altitudes and latitudes are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Overall, the impacts of climate change are projected to result in a net loss of global biodiversity and major shifts in the provision of ecosystem services. For example, the range and abundance of economically important marine fish are already changing due to climate change and are projected to continue changing such that some local fisheries are very likely to cease to be viable, whereas others may become more valuable if the fishing community can adapt.
Range shifts will result in new community assemblages, new associations among species, and promote interactions among species that have not existed in the past. Changes in the spatial distribution and seasonal timing of flora and fauna within marine, aquatic, and terrestrial environments can result in trophic mismatches and asynchronies. Novel species assemblages can also substantially alter ecosystem structure and function and the distribution of ecosystem services.
Changes in precipitation regimes and extreme events can cause ecosystem transitions, increase transport of nutrients and pollutants to downstream ecosystems, and overwhelm the ability of natural systems to mitigate harm to people from these events. Changes in extreme events affect systems differentially, because different thresholds are crossed. For example, more intense storms and increased drought coupled with warming can shift grasslands into shrublands, or facilitate domination by other grass types (for example, mixed grass to C-4 tallgrass). More heavy rainfall also increases movement of nutrients and pollutants to downstream ecosystems, restructuring processes, biota, and habitats. As a consequence, regulation of drinking water quality is very likely to be strained as high rainfall and river discharge lead to higher levels of nitrogen in rivers and greater risk of waterborne disease outbreaks.
Changes in winter have big and surprising effects on ecosystems and their services. Changes in soil freezing, snow cover, and air temperature have affected carbon sequestration, decomposition, and carbon export, which influence agricultural and forest production. Seasonally snow-covered regions are especially susceptible to climate change as small changes in temperature or precipitation may result in large changes in ecosystem structure and function.
Longer growing seasons and warmer winters are enhancing pest outbreaks, leading to tree mortality and more intense and extensive fires. For winter sports and recreation, future economic losses are projected to be high because of decreased or unreliable snowfall.
The ecosystem services provided by coastal habitats are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise and more severe storms. The Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts are most vulnerable to the loss of coastal protection services provided by wetlands and coral reefs. Along the Pacific coast long-term erosion of dunes due to increasing wave heights is projected to be an increasing problem for coastal communities. Beach recreation is also projected to suffer due to coastal erosion. Other forms of recreation are very likely to improve due to better weather, and the net effect is likely a redistribution of the industry and its economic impact, with visitors and tourism dollars shifting away from some communities in favor of others.
Climate adaptation has experienced a dramatic increase in attention since the last National Climate Assessment and become a major emphasis in biodiversity conservation and natural resource policy and management. Federal and State agencies are planning for and integrating climate change research into resource management and actions to address impacts of climate change based on historical impacts, future vulnerabilities, and observations on the ground. Land managers have realized that static protected areas will not be sufficient to conserve biodiversity in a changing climate, requiring an emphasis on landscape-scale conservation, connectivity among protected habitats, and sustaining ecological functioning of working lands
and waters. Agile and adaptive management approaches are increasingly under development, including monitoring, experimentation, and a capacity to evaluate and modify management actions. Risk-based framing and stakeholder-driven scenario planning will be essential in enhancing our ability to respond to the impacts of climate change.
Climate change responses employed by other sectors (for example, energy, agriculture, transportation) are creating new ecosystem stresses, but also can incorporate ecosystembased approaches to improve their efficacy. Ecosystem-based adaptation has emerged as a framework for understanding the role of ecosystem services in moderating climate impacts on people, although this concept is currently being used more on an international scale than within the United States.
Ecological monitoring efforts need to be improved and better coordinated among Federal and State agencies to ensure that the impacts of climate change are adequately observed as well as to support ecological research, management, assessment, and policy. As species and ecosystem boundaries shift to keep pace with climate change, improved and better-integrated research, monitoring, and assessment efforts will be needed at national and global scales. Existing monitoring networks in the United States are not well suited for detecting and attributing the impacts of climate change to the wide range of affected species at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales.

HEADLINE: Treasury to Sell G.M. Stake Within 15 Months

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BILL VLASIC


HIGHLIGHT: An end to "Government Motors": The Treasury Department plans to sell off its entire 32 percent stake in the auto maker, eliminating another reminder of the bailouts precipitated by the financial crash of 2008. 

 BODY:
 11:13 p.m. | Updated 
For months, General Motors executives have been pressing Washington to sell its stake in the company, desperate to rid itself of the yoke of being called Government Motors.
Nearly four years after what became a $49.5 billion bailout, the Treasury Department announced on Wednesday that it would sell 200 million shares back to the company for $5.5 billion, then sell an additional 300 million shares by early 2014.
Currently, the exit would produce a loss of more than $12 billion for taxpayers - one of the few major bailouts that did not produce a return. Yet, after the sale of its remaining stake in the American International Group last week, the government can now claim that it has largely unwound the huge, politically contentious corporate rescues it undertook amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
 "This can't happen soon enough," said Henry T. C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. "You don't want an industrial corporation being subject, in effect, to government limits." 
The Treasury's presence in G.M. disturbed investors and prompted some consumers to avoid its products in an increasingly competitive United States auto market. Independence, however, will leave the company with no excuse as it battles domestic and foreign rivals, many of whom did not turn to the government for a lifeline.
When G.M. was given its first loans by the Bush administration, the company was still the industry leader, with a 22 percent share of the market in the United States. After bankruptcy and its re-emergence as a public company, that dominance has eroded.
As of the end of November, G.M.'s market share had slipped below 18 percent this year, and it was struggling with hefty inventories of some major models like the Silverado pickup and the Malibu midsize sedan.
And while General Motors has benefited from shedding debt and four brands in bankruptcy, it has considerable work ahead to rebuild a product lineup that withered during its financial crisis. For one, its hometown rival, Ford Motor, earns more money in North America despite selling fewer vehicles.
"There's no doubt that General Motors is in a better position now than it was four or five years ago," said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com. "The key is to watch and see if the company falls back into old habits."
G.M. executives say that the company has changed its ways.
"As today's news travels around the world, the question will be asked, 'Did G.M. truly learn the lessons of the bankruptcy?' " Daniel F. Akerson, the chief executive, wrote in an internal memo. "Our results show that we are changing the company so we never go down that path again."
The sale is expected to bolster morale inside the company.
"It's probably more significant on the employee front than on the automotive side," said Mike Wall, director of analysis at the research firm IHS Automotive. "After what they have gone through the past four years, this is an emotional event and a rallying point for the future."
Executives were eager to shed the government's 32 percent ownership stake, but the election in November delayed any talk of a share buyback. But soon after President Obama's victory, G.M.'s chief financial officer, Daniel Ammann, called Timothy G. Massad, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial stability, to begin negotiations, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
An offer to buy back a substantial number of G.M. shares at the market price - no premium for the Treasury - was rejected. Several weeks of start-and-stop negotiation followed, during which the company demanded a firm timetable for the government's exit.
By about 5 p.m. Tuesday, G.M.'s board had voted to offer $27.50 for the Treasury stake, an approximately 8 percent premium to the stock price at that day's close. By about 7:30 p.m., the sides signed off on the deal.
Despite the relief of reaching an accord, G.M. executives planned no celebration or new marketing campaign, feeling that might look unseemly or even arrogant.
Wednesday's deal all but guarantees a loss for taxpayers. The remaining shares need to be sold at close to $70 each to break even. But a Treasury official argued that the company's stock hadn't surpassed $27.50 since the government was legally cleared to sell additional shares after G.M.'s initial public offering.
The Obama administration has long argued that the rescue was always about saving the American auto industry, not making money. On Wednesday, Treasury claimed to have saved more than one million jobs through the bailout.
The administration is hoping to offset the losses from the G.M. rescue with the profits from its A.I.G. investments and the bank recapitalization program, which together have reaped about $46 billion for taxpayers.
The Treasury Department has also long favored a quick exit from its investments rather than turning a profit. It has already divested its stake in Chrysler, selling it last year to Fiat, the Italian carmaker that was a crucial ally during Chrysler's bankruptcy.
"The government should not be in the business of owning stakes in private companies for an indefinite period of time," Mr. Massad, of the Treasury Department, said in a statement. "Moving to exit our investment in G.M. within the next 12 to 15 months is consistent with our dual goals of winding down TARP as soon as practicable and protecting taxpayer interests."
But the government still owns large portions of other firms, including 74 percent of Ally Financial, G.M.'s former lending arm.
Being a ward of the state has cost G.M. more than its reputation. The company has been subject to a number of restrictions that it claims have hampered its ability to attract fresh talent. Some of those limits, including the use of corporate aircraft, will be lifted after the stock buyback.
But the biggest, a cap on the compensation of top executives, will remain in place until the government sells off its entire stake.
The news was welcomed by some of G.M.'s biggest investors. Among them is Greenlight Capital, a prominent hedge fund that has called the company an "ugly duckling" underappreciated by the market.
"We applaud G.M. management for unlocking shareholder value by releasing excess capital and beginning a resolution of the government stake overhang," David Einhorn, the head of Greenlight, said in a statement.
G.M. has improved in several respects. Its annual profit has risen over the last two years, and as of the end of the year will have about $38 billion in cash and credit lines to draw upon.
But much hard work remains. Ford has had a head start on G.M. in globalizing its products and spreading out development costs. And during its bankruptcy, G.M. had to delay some new models, costing it valuable time in reacting to market trends
Given the challenges that lie ahead for G.M., the company cannot appear to be celebrating or placing too much emphasis on the government's ultimate exit.
"They have to keep their head down and keep plugging away and executing their strategy," Mr. Wall of IHS Automotive said. "It is the beginning of the end of government ownership, but way too soon to celebrate anything."

HEADLINE: UBS's Record Settlement Over Rate Rigging

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: UBS is paying a combined $1.5 billion in fines and its Japanese subsidiary is pleading guilty over its role in a scheme to manipulate interest rates. | By deciding to sell its stake in a gun maker, Cerberus Capital Management is displaying concern about an investment's societal impact. | Mark Zuckerberg is making donation of Facebook stock worth about $500 million. | The Knight Capital Group agreed on Tuesday to sell itself to a rival, according to reports. 

 BODY:
UBS PAYS $1.5 BILLION FINE OVER RATE RIGGING AS UNIT PLEADS GUILTY | The Swiss bank UBS announced a record settlement with global authorities on Wednesday over its role in a scheme to manipulate interest rates. The bank is paying a combined $1.5 billion in fines, and its Japanese subsidiary is pleading guilty. "The UBS subsidiary, which agreed to plead to a single count of wire fraud, is the first unit of a big bank to agree to criminal charges in more than a decade," DealBook reports.
The complaints describe a scheme spanning from 2005 to 2010 in which UBS reported false rates to make more profit and allay concerns about its health. "The findings we have set out in our notice today do not make for pretty reading," Tracey McDermott, the enforcement director for the Financial Services Authority of Britain, said in a statement. 
The Financial Services Authority published colorful e-mails between UBS traders and brokers outside the firm. For one trader, trying to manipulate rates was somehow heroic. "Be a hero today," this trader asked in 2009, in all caps. Another wrote in September 2008, "I need you to keep it as low as possible," promising to pay "whatever you want. I'm a man of my word." 
The British regulator says UBS's misconduct was more serious than that of Barclays, which paid $450 million over similar accusations this summer. Reuters' Felix Salmon writes: "After the Barclays revelations, I actually thought that I couldn't be shocked about the extent of Libor manipulation. Boy, was I wrong."
CERBERUS'S CHANGE OF HEART | The decision by Cerberus Capital Management to sell its stake in the gun maker Freedom Group "is a rare instance of a Wall Street firm bending to concerns about an investment's societal impact rather than a profit-at-all-costs ethos," DealBook's Peter Lattman writes. It came after an influential investor raised concerns about Cerberus's ownership of the company that made the rifle used in the Connecticut school shooting.
An official from that investor, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, called Cerberus on Monday, Mr. Lattman reports. "While concern from Cerberus's investors - as well as a swirl of media attention - had an impact on the decision to sell, the leadership of the private equity firm debated through the weekend how to respond to the tragedy and its potential fallout, according to a person familiar with the firm's discussions. On Monday evening, a small group of Cerberus's top executives sat around a conference room table and weighed a range of options to respond to the tragedy, including making a large donation to the Newtown community or promoting mental health research and education. Ultimately, Cerberus decided to make a clean break and sell the gun company."
With shares of gun makers falling, it's not clear whether the private equity firm will find a buyer for the Freedom Group. "Several foreign gun manufacturers, including Forjas Taurus of Brazil and Heckler & Koch of Germany, could be possible acquirers, according to a banker familiar with the weapons industry." Mr. Lattman continues: "Though the Freedom Group was unable to complete its initial public offering, the deal has been largely successful, with Cerberus already making a small profit via a dividend payment, a person briefed on the investment said."
ZUCKERBERG'S $500 MILLION GIFT | Mark Zuckerberg is making another big donation, this time using publicly traded stock. The chief executive of the social network announced a gift of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a donation valued at about $500 million based on the closing price on Tuesday. "We will look for areas in education and health to focus on next," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. The donation follows Mr. Zuckerberg's gift of $100 million worth of Facebook shares to Newark public schools in 2010, when the company was private. He also signed on to Warren E. Buffett's Giving Pledge that year.
ON THE AGENDA | A Senate Banking subcommittee conducts a hearing at 10 a.m on consumer credit reports. Navistar International, FedEx and General Mills report earnings before the market opens. Bed Bath & Beyond announces results this evening. Data on housing starts for November are released at 8:30 a.m. Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors and Glenn Hutchins of Silver Lake Partners are on CNBC at 8 a.m. Donald Drapkin, the onetime associate of Ronald O. Perelman and current chairman of Casablanca Capital, is on CNBC at 1:30 p.m. Kevin Rose, a general partner at Google Ventures, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m.
 KNIGHT SAID TO AGREE TO GETCO DEAL | The board of the Knight Capital Group agreed on Tuesday to sell the trading firm to a rival, the Getco Holding Company, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News. The reported price of $3.75 a share represents a 13 percent premium to Knight's closing price on Tuesday. The deal values Knight at about $1.8 billion, according to the Journal. Through a reverse merger structure, the privately held Getco will gain a public listing, the reports said. An agreement would end a difficult chapter for Knight, after a computer glitch caused crippling losses this summer. Getco's offer, which beat an all-cash proposal from Virtu Financial, is one-third composed of stock, according to Bloomberg.
THE MYTH OF GLOBAL DEAL-MAKING | There has been plenty of talk in the last few years of exporting Wall Street-style business to emerging market economies around the world. "Yet, there are increasing signs that global deal-making was always a myth," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. The United States has led the world so far this year in initial public offerings and in volume of mergers and acquisitions, according to Renaissance Capital and Dealogic. "With the slowdown in once-hot emerging markets, the tide is going out, baring all of the problems and issues associated with global deal-making. China is a prime example," Mr. Davidoff writes.

While it received $3.4 billion under the program in January 2009, the company paid the money back six months later."

HEADLINE: General Grant's Infamous Order

BYLINE: JONATHAN D. SARNA


HIGHLIGHT: Why the Civil War leader expelled Jews from the Department of Tennessee. 

 BODY:
"I, a peaceable, law abiding citizen, pursuing my legitimate business at Paducah, Kentucky, where I have been a resident for nearly four years, have been driven from my home, my business, and all that is dear to me, at the short notice of twenty-four hours; not for any crime committed, but simply because I was born of Jewish parents," said a young merchant named Cesar Kaskel to reporters in late December 1862. The accompanying headline disclosed why Kaskel was so abruptly ordered out. It read: "Expulsion of Jews from General Grant's Department."
The order, known as General Orders No. 11, expelled Jews from the territory under Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's command - which stretched from Northern Mississippi to Cairo, Illinois and from the Mississippi River to the Tennessee River. It was issued on Dec. 17, 1862, and came directly from Grant's headquarters in Holly Springs, Miss. It read: 
The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled from the department within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order. 
Post commanders will see that all of this class of people be furnished passes and required to leave, and any one returning after such notification will be arrested and held in confinement until an opportunity occurs of sending them out as prisoners, unless furnished with permit from headquarters.
No passes will be given these people to visit headquarters for the purpose of making personal application for trade permits.
By order of Maj. Gen. U.S. Grant
JNO. A. RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General
For months, Grant had been worried about cotton speculators and smugglers in the area under his command. His department seethed with blockade runners who traded "upon the miseries of the country." Canny traders could turn $100 into $2,000 by smuggling Southern cotton to Northern ports and quinine, bacon and finished goods in the other direction. If he could just put a stop to the smuggling, Grant thought, he could put real economic pressure on the South and the terrible war would end sooner. 
Such trade was, of course, illegal, and some of the smugglers that Grant's men caught were Jews. America's Jewish population had ballooned from about 15,000 in 1840 to some 150,000 in 1860, mostly immigrants from Central Europe. Large numbers of those immigrants became peddlers and merchants, marked by their European accents and foreign ways. Some of them, during the war, peddled contraband. 
Lots of non-Jews, including many soldiers, likewise pursued fast money by trading in illicit goods. Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana (who himself secretly speculated in cotton) reported in early 1863 that "every colonel, captain of quartermaster is in secret partnership with some operator in cotton; every soldier dreams of adding a bale of cotton to his monthly pay." In Memphis, the leading city in Grant's territory, "the amount of plunder & bribery" was "beyond all calculation," according to Dana. "Honesty is the exception and peculation" - that is, embezzlement - "the rule." 
Nevertheless, in the eyes of Grant and of many other Americans, all smugglers and speculators and traders were Jews, whether they were actually Jewish or not - just as Southerners dubbed all Northerners "Yankees," whether or not they hailed from New England. Grant wanted as few of them as possible in the area under his command.
In July 1862, Grant ordered the commander of the District of the Mississippi to "examine all baggage of all speculators coming South," and to turn back those who were carrying gold. "Jews," he admonished, "should receive special attention." In August, a soldier newspaper quoted Grant as calling Jews "a nuisance" that he had plans to "abate." On Nov. 9, as he prepared to move South in preparation for the decisive battle at Vicksburg, Grant tightened his regulations against Jews: "Refuse all permits to come south of Jackson for the present," he ordered. "The Isrealites especially should be kept out." The very next day he strengthened that order: "no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the Rail Road southward from any point. . . they are such an intolerable nuisance that the Department must be purged" of them. Writing in early December to Gen. William T. Sherman, whose quartermaster had created problems by selling cotton "to a Jew by the name of Haas," Grant explained that "in consequence of the total disregard and evasion of orders by the Jews my policy is to exclude them so far as practicable from the Dept." 
But until Dec. 17, Grant had not gone so far as to expel Jews from his department. Indeed, when Col. John Van Deusen Du Bois on Dec. 8 angrily ordered "all Cotton-Speculators, Jews and other Vagrants having no honest means of support, except trading upon the miseries of their Country" to leave Holly Springs, and gave them "twenty-four hours or they will be sent to duty in the trenches," Grant insisted that the Draconian order be rescinded. "Instructions from Washington," he reminded Du Bois, "are to encourage getting Cotton out of the country." Notwithstanding his private opinions and actions, Grant understood that he still had publicly to uphold official government policy, which permitted those loyal to the Union to trade in cotton.
All that changed on Dec. 17. Grant, according to multiple sources, received a visit that day from his 68-year-old father, Jesse R. Grant, accompanied by members the prominent Mack family of Cincinnati, significant Jewish clothing manufacturers. Harman, Henry and Simon Mack, as part of an ingenious scheme, had formed a secret partnership with the elder Grant. In return for 25 percent of their profits, he agreed to accompany them to his son's Mississippi headquarters, act as their agent to "procure a permit for them to purchase cotton" and help them secure the means to transport that cotton to New York. 
According to the journalist Sylvanus Cadwallader, a witness, General Grant waxed indignant at his father's crass attempt to profit from his son's military status, and raged at the Jewish traders who "entrapped his old father into such an unworthy undertaking." He refused to provide the permit, sent the Macks homeward "on the first train for the north" and, in high dudgeon, immediately issued the order expelling "Jews as a class" from his territory. 
Fortunately for the thousands of Jews who lived in the territory under his command, Grant was soon distracted. Less than 72 hours after his order was issued, his forces at Holly Springs were raided by 3,500 Confederate troops. Simultaneous raids to the north inflicted significant damage to Grant's lines and tore up 50 miles of railroad and telegraph lines. Communications to and from Grant's headquarters were disrupted for weeks. As a result, news of Grant's order spread slowly, sparing many Jews who might otherwise have been banished.
To be sure, some Jewish traders in the vicinity of Grant's army were treated roughly. A "Mr. Silberman" from Chicago, temporarily in Holly Springs, was reportedly imprisoned for 12 hours for the "crime" of seeking to telegraph General Grant to find out if the expulsion order he received was genuine. An unnamed young Jewish trader and his fiancée, traveling through Grant's department on their way east, described in The Jewish Record how they were detained, forbidden to change out of wet clothes, robbed of their horses and buggy and verbally abused, and also had one of their trunks burned and their pockets picked in the wake of the order. Their expulsion, if not their mistreatment, was explained by Brig. Gen. James Tuttle, commander of the Union garrison in Cairo, Ill., with the utmost simplicity: "you are Jews, and neither a benefit to the Union or Confederacy."
But it was only when Grant's order reached Paducah, Ken., 11 days after it was issued, that a whole community of Jews found itself expelled. On Dec. 28, Paducah's provost marshal, L.J. Waddell, sent Cesar Kaskel and every other Jew in the city an official notice ordering them to leave within 24 hours. Women and children were expelled, too, and in the confusion - so it was recalled years later - one baby was almost forgotten, and two dying women had to be left behind in the care of neighbors. (The historian John E.L. Robertson of Paducah recounts, somewhat dubiously, that citizens of his city hid some Jews to prevent their being sent away. "One soldier," he reports, "is said to have knocked on the door of a Jew and demanded, 'What are you?' The resident of the house answered truthfully, 'Tailor.' To which the not-too-bright soldier replied, 'Sorry to bother you, Mr. Taylor, but I'm looking for Jews.'")
As they prepared to leave their homes, Kaskel and several other Jews sent a telegram to President Abraham Lincoln describing their plight and pronouncing themselves "greatly insulted and outraged by this inhuman order, the carrying out of which would be the grossest violation of the Constitution, and our rights as good citizens under it." 
Lincoln, in all likelihood, never saw that telegram, as he was busy preparing to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. The irony of his freeing the slaves while Grant was expelling the Jews was not lost on some contemporaries. The Memphis Daily Bulletin published the two documents one above the other. The juxtaposition of these events also shaped the responses of several Jewish leaders to Grant's order. They feared that Jews would replace blacks as the nation's stigmatized minority. 
Fearing the worst, Kaskel wasted no time. "On my way to Washington, in order to get this most outrageous and inhuman order of Major General Grant countermanded," he announced to reporters. He begged the journalists to whom he told his story "to lend the powerful aid of the press to the suffering cause of outraged humanity" and "to blot out as quick as possible this stain on our national honor."
Arriving in the nation's capital just as the Jewish Sabbath was concluding on Jan. 3, Kaskel called at once upon Cincinnati's departing Republican congressman, John Addison Gurley, who enjoyed ready access to the White House. Together, they immediately went over to see President Lincoln. 
Lincoln turned out to have no knowledge whatsoever of the order, for it had not reached Washington. According to an oft-quoted report, he resorted to biblical imagery in his interview with Kaskel, a reminder of how immersed he was in the Bible and how, like many 19th-century Americans, he linked Jews to Ancient Israel, and America to the Promised Land.
"And so," Lincoln is said to have drawled, "the children of Israel were driven from the happy land of Canaan?" 
"Yes," Kaskel responded, "and that is why we have come unto Father Abraham's bosom, asking protection."
 "And this protection," Lincoln declared, "they shall have at once."
Even if no such conversation actually took place, Lincoln did instantly instruct the general-in-chief of the Army, Henry Halleck, to countermand General Orders No. 11. Halleck seems to have had his doubts as to whether the order Kaskel has showed him was genuine, so in writing to Grant, he chose his words carefully. "If such an order has been issued," his telegram read, "it will be immediately revoked." Two days later, several urgent telegrams went out from Grant's headquarters in obedience to that demand: "By direction of the General in Chief of the Army at Washington," they read, "the General Order from these Head Quarters expelling Jews from this Department is hereby revoked." 
In a follow-up meeting with Jewish leaders, Lincoln reaffirmed that he knew "of no distinction between Jew and Gentile." "To condemn a class," he emphatically declared, "is, to say the least, to wrong the good with the bad. I do not like to hear a class or nationality condemned on account of a few sinners."
The revocation of Grant's order by no means ended the controversy. Democrats in Congress sought, unsuccessfully, to censure Grant. The New York Times called upon its readers to remember that "All swindlers are not Jews. All Jews are not swindlers." Most of all, Jews discussed the matter among themselves, seeking to understand how, even in wartime, such an order could have been issued at all. 
Grant himself never defended General Orders No. 11 and later omitted the episode from his "Personal Memoir." According to his son, Frederick, who assisted his father with those memoirs, the omission was deliberate. "That was a matter long past and best not referred to," he quoted his father as telling him. Julia, Grant's wife, proved far less circumspect. In her memoirs, she characterized General Orders No. 11 as nothing less than "obnoxious." The general, she recalled, felt that the severe reprimand he received for the order was deserved, for "he had no right to make an order against any special sect."
Had Grant himself expressed such sentiments in the wake of the order's revocation, his run for the presidency, in 1868, might not have proved so contentious. As it was, General Orders No. 11 became an important election year issue. For the first time, a controversy involving Jews stood front and center in a presidential campaign. 
Grant's opponents insisted that a man who could expel "Jews as a class" for his war zone was unfit to be president. His supporters insisted that Grant was "steadfast" in his "adherence to the principles of American liberty and religious toleration," and that General Orders No. 11 was "directed simply against evil designing persons whose religion was in no way material to the issue."
When the votes were finally tallied, Grant emerged the winner by more than 300,000 votes and a healthy 134-electoral-vote margin. The Jewish vote, whose size pundits at the time greatly exaggerated, scarcely made much difference. 
With the election behind him, so nobody could accuse him of pandering for votes, Grant released an unprecedented letter that told his supporters and nervous Jews just what they wanted to hear from the president-elect: "I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit. Order No. 11 does not sustain this statement, I admit, but then I do not sustain that order."
During his eight-year presidency, Grant went out of his way to prove just how unprejudiced he had become. He appointed more Jews to public office than all previous presidents combined, became the first president to attend a synagogue dedication and actively intervened on behalf of persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania. After he left office, he maintained friendships with many Jews, became the first president to visit the land of Israel and, in 1881, placed his name atop a call for a public meeting of protest when anti-Jewish violence broke out in Russia. One senses that whenever he interacted with Jews, and especially when he saw them persecuted, embarrassing memories of General Orders No. 11 flooded into Grant's mind. 
As for Cesar Kaskel, he returned to Paducah after General Orders No. 11 was countermanded. He subsequently moved to New York, where he established an upscale clothing store at Broadway and Bleecker Street. In later years, he regaled customers with the story of his Civil War expulsion and its aftermath. He particularly recalled his vigorous and definitive response to the post commander who demanded to know by whose order he had returned to Paducah so soon after Grant had expelled him. It was, he replied, "by order of the president of the United States."

HEADLINE: At Year's End, News of a Global Health Success

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The stunning drop in global child mortality is proof that poor countries are not doomed to eternal misery. Here's how it happened. 

 BODY:
At this time of awful news of the needless death of children, there comes reason for optimism about the health of the world's youngest.
Sierra Leone, Malawi, Laos, Bangladesh and Nicaragua are among the poorest nations in the world. The state of countries like these is often cited to illustrate the failures of development, the persistence of poverty. But here's what has changed: Bangladesh dropped its death rate of children under 5 by two-thirds between 1990 and 2010. Child mortality is down by 56.5 percent in Malawi since 1990, 63.8 percent in Sierra Leone, 55.6 percent in Laos, and 61.9 percent in Nicaragua.

As remarkable as these gains may be, more remarkable still is the fact that they are far from alone. A massive study published last week called the Global Burden of Disease report found that in the past 20 years, the death rate of children under 5 has dropped in every country in the world save three - Kuwait, Tonga and Zimbabwe. Stunning gains took place in all regions, under all economic and political systems and at all income levels: El Salvador, China, Oman and Portugal all saw drops of more than 70 percent. Even North Korea did just about as well as South Korea - a 49.9 percent drop in the North, 55.1 percent in the South. 
What's more, the gains are accelerating: from 1990 to 2000, according to Unicef (which uses different measures in its own reports, and so comes up with somewhat different numbers), global decline was 1.8 percent per year. Since 2000, the rate has dropped 3.2 percent per year.
The Global Burden of Disease report, coordinated by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, assembles data on all diseases, in all countries, for all ages. It is so big that its first set of papers and comments takes up the entire issue of The Lancet medical journal (the first time any study has occupied the whole journal) and has 486 unique authors from dozens of countries. The study sorts out what kills, sickens and disables us. Last week the study released overall numbers. It will be supplemented next year by numbers that examine the impact of each disease in each country.
The headlines: compared with 1990, the last time the study was done, child deaths have dropped precipitously, but deaths of young and middle aged adults are rising. People are living much longer, but those lives are not as healthy. Chronic diseases, like diabetes, hypertension and cancer - formerly known as diseases of the wealthy - have overtaken the classic infectious diseases of the poor, like diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria as the leading cause of death everywhere except in sub-Saharan Africa. Obesity is the new hunger.
Some of the bad news is a side effect of the good news. Chronic diseases now take a larger percentage of lives (that's bad) because deaths from infectious diseases have declined (that's good). As life expectancy increases (that's good), the chronic disease of old age become more common (that's bad.) 
But there are worrisome factors as well. The death rate in young adults is high in part because of AIDS and rising rates of violence. And as obesity spreads, chronic illnesses like diabetes and stroke are killing younger and younger people.
In the Fixes column, we focus on what works and why. What produced the incredible drop in child mortality?
The gains did not come by conquering the celebrity diseases of malaria and AIDS - those produced the two most important jumps in child deaths, although the death rate from malaria did drop by 85 percent in South Asia. (That does not mean that the vast and successful global effort to fight these diseases is failing; a million more children would be dead if not for the malaria push over the last decade. But it is not enough.) Instead the big drops came in deaths from measles, diarrhea, pneumonia, malnutrition, tuberculosis and neonatal tetanus. 
This achievement is not a product of increasing wealth; researchers believe that's only a small part of the reason children are doing so much better everywhere. Economic growth is clearly a huge factor in China, but some of the biggest gains in child survival have come in countries that are stagnating economically. "You can still make quite substantial improvements in child survival without decreasing poverty levels," said Mickey Chopra, Unicef's director of health. "Countries such as Nepal, Rwanda, Niger - all of whom have not had much economic growth per capita - have more than halved their child mortality rates. That means there's no excuse for not making faster reductions in child mortality."
More important are a series of fairly cheap global programs - vaccines, nutritional supplements, family planning, oral rehydration salts to treat diarrhea, bed nets, improved hygiene and sanitation, cleaner water, antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. We take a lot of this work for granted now, but every one of these efforts is fairly new. Unicef and the World Health Organization began their global effort to vaccinate children against common diseases only in 1985.
Some of these programs, like vaccines, have been relatively straightforward to deliver. (Not as straightforward as they should be, however - this week, the Taliban assassinated five women delivering polio vaccine in Pakistan.) But programs that require long-term behavior change have been more difficult. Still, there has been considerable success promoting breastfeeding, showing mothers when and how to use oral rehydration therapy, and boil water, and teaching people about handwashing and digging and using pit latrines.
The foundation for many of these programs is the democratization of health care. Historically, governments have spent their health budgets on urban hospitals - serving people with money and political clout. In the last few decades, however, governments have also expanded health care to the rural poor - often through the training of community health workers.
This saves lives with acute care - in sub-Saharan Africa, according to Unicef, the percentage of child pneumonia cases where families sought appropriate medical care rose since 2000 to 46 percent from 36 percent. But the real impact has come in the change community health workers have wrought in everyday habits. Children are now more likely to survive pneumonia not only because they are more likely to get antibiotics, but also because they are in general healthier - breastfed for longer, better fed, drinking cleaner water.
Community health workers have also been key to the drop in neonatal deaths. In villages with community health workers, fewer women give birth unattended or attended by midwives who lack modern medical knowledge.
Perhaps the single most important reason for the drop in child deaths is not a health campaign at all. Researchers analyzing education and child mortality patterns concluded that just over half of all gains in child survival are the product of increases in women's education. (Economic growth, by contrast, accounts for just 7.2 percent of the gains since 1970.) With every extra year of education for women of child-bearing age, child mortality drops by 9.5 percent.
Educated women are more likely to know about and adopt better health practices. They postpone childbearing and have fewer children. They are more likely to take a sick child to see a doctor or health worker. Educated mothers are more likely to survive and be there for their children.
The improvements in child survival have been dramatic, yet they do not seem to have altered many people's fatalism about development or willingness to write off much of the world as doomed to eternal misery.
A new book, "Getting Better," by the economist Charles Kenny, explains the disparity: when we measure how countries are doing, we measure income or economic growth. In most of the world, those figures have been dismal - especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
But Kenny argues that income and growth measures don't capture the tremendous gains in quality of life. Someone who lives on two dollars a day today has far better health, education, gender equality, security and human rights than someone who earned two dollars a day in the past. For example, a poor African child had virtually a zero chance of being vaccinated in 1974. Today an equally poor child in an equally poor country would have a 77 percent chance.
Kenny credits the global spread of new technologies and ideas - but also rising expectations. For hundreds of millions of people, marrying off their 13-year-old was just what was done. Now sending her to school instead is the new normal. People are demanding more services from their governments - and governments are demanding more of one another. Why have advances in child survival sped up since 2000? One plausible reason is that that was the year the United Nations set the Millennium Development Goals - ambitious targets to be met by 2015. The M.D.G.'s were not just United Nations blather - what gets measured gets done. "The M.D.G.'s have been a key factor," said Chopra. "They have been very important in drawing political attention, which in turn has been one of the critical success factors."
Millennium Goal 4 is a reduction of under-5 child deaths by two-thirds compared with 1990 figures. It will probably not be met; 7 million children will still die this year from preventable causes. Yet there is no doubt we know how, and it is hard to think of a more sweeping accomplishment than the results so far.
Happy holidays, everyone.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Welfare States

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Britain's determination to unify its antipoverty programs and the United States' creation of more programs will offer a sharp contrast in policy making, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
In "A Tale of Two Cities," Dickens wrote, "It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness." The governments of the United States and Britain are embarking on different approaches to helping their poor and unemployed, and one of them may regret its policy decisions.
As recently as 2010, Britain had a complex system of antipoverty programs ranging, including housing benefits, job seekers' allowances and mortgage-interest assistance. With so many benefits available, many people found they could make almost as much from the combined programs as they could from working, even while any one of the benefits might not have been all that significant by itself. As Britain's Department for Work and Pensions described, beneficiaries remained "trapped on benefits for many years as a result." 
Beginning next month, Britain will strive to put its welfare system on a different path by unifying many programs under a single "universal credit" system, what the department describes as an "integrated working-age credit that will provide a basic allowance with additional elements for children, disability, housing and caring." The department forecasts that its "universal credit will improve financial work incentives by ensuring that support is reduced at a consistent and managed rate as people return to work and increase their working hours and earnings."

In the United States, the welfare system includes dozens of federal programs, enumerated by Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation as those "providing cash, food, housing, medical care, social services, training and targeted education aid to poor and low-income Americans." Beginning in 2014, more programs will be added and expanded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: new health-insurance premium-support programs, new cost-sharing subsidies for out-of-pocket health expenditures, financial hardship relief from the new individual mandate penalties, new subsidies for small businesses employing low-income people and expansion of Medicaid.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Affordable Care Act's means-tested subsidies and cost-sharing will implicitly add more than 20 percentage points to marginal tax rates on incomes below 400 percent (see Page 27 of the C.B.O. report) of the poverty line (a majority of families fit in this category) by phasing out the assistance as family incomes increase, although a number of families will not receive the subsidies because they already get health insurance from their employer.
These marginal tax-rate additions are on top of the marginal tax rates already in place because of personal income taxes, payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, food stamps and other taxes and means-tested government programs. In 2014, some Americans will be able to make almost as much from combined benefits as they would by working, and sometimes more.
In summary, the United States intends to move in the direction of more assistance programs and higher marginal tax rates, while Britain intends to move in the direction of fewer programs and lower marginal tax rates.
Either country, or both, may ultimately fail to fully carry out the new programs by granting waivers and exceptions, refusing to administer them or by rewriting its new laws. But if both do follow through, perhaps future empirical economic research comparing the United States and Britain will reveal which country is living an age of wisdom and which one in an age of foolishness.

HEADLINE: In Most Rich Countries, Women Work More Than Men

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: If you count unpaid work, that is. 

 BODY:
In most of the developed world, women spend more time working each day than men do, if you include unpaid work.
According to the latest report on gender and employment from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, across the developed world and in other countries tracked by the organization, men spend more minutes per day in paid work than women do. 
In the United States, for example, men spend 5 hours and 8 minutes working on the average day, whereas women spend 4 hours and 2 minutes. 
But when it comes to unpaid work -- activities like child care and cleaning -- women spend vastly more time than men in every country the organization included in its analysis. 
Women perform a disproportionate share of unpaid work regardless of whether they are employed. In couples where both partners have paid jobs, women spend more than two hours per day in unpaid work, the report says, and that gap "hardly narrows" even when you restrict the sample to couples with both partners working full time. Among couples in which the woman works and the man doesn't, men do only as much housework as the women, and spend far less time in child care. 
The biggest gender gaps in unpaid work, in fact, involve taking care of children: working mothers devote about 50 percent more time to child care than nonworking fathers do.
When you look at time spent in paid and unpaid work together, women edge out men in most countries included in the analysis. 
The chart above shows how much more time women spend than men on unpaid work (light blue bars); how much less time women spend than men on paid work (medium blue bars); and how much time over all women spend compared to men on paid and unpaid work combined (dark blue diamonds). 
As you can see, across the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, women spend 21 minutes more time, on average, in total work per day than men do. 
The gap is exactly the same in the United States. Of the countries surveyed, the gap is biggest in India, where women spend on average 94 minutes more time than men on total work each day. 
In a few countries analyzed, though, men do spend slightly more time than women on total work per day: Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and New Zealand. In Britain and Germany, the two sexes spend almost equal time on total work each day, although the composition of that work falls along traditional gender lines, with men spending more of their time on paid work and women more on unpaid work.
For whatever reason, the traditional division of labor appears deeply ingrained, in both rich countries and poor ones. The report observes also that policies intended to help promote work-life balance, such as parental leave options, often counterintuitively have the effect of reinforcing gender roles at home:
[M]others generally make much wider use than fathers of parental leave options, part-time employment opportunities, and other flexible working time arrangements like teleworking. It is primarily mothers, for example, who avail themselves of long parental leave - and they are frequently reluctant to give up leave to their partner's benefit. The result is a reinforcement of traditional gender roles. In fact, even when policies allow or encourage women to change the nature of their participation in employment or their hours of work, inequalities at home and in contributions to home life have a tendency to remain. A vicious circle is thus established: as long as mothers reduce employment participation when they have (young) children in the household, employers have an incentive to invest less in their female than in their male workers.

HEADLINE: Obama Talks Tough

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama warned John Boehner that he would veto his Plan B for the fiscal cliff. And he appointed Joe Biden to lead a task force on guns. 

 BODY:
In the course of just a few hours, President Obama warned House Speaker John Boehner that he would veto his so-called Plan B for the so-called fiscal cliff. And he appointed Vice President Joe Biden to lead a task force on guns. That's not terrible for a guy who makes even his most ardent supporters wonder if he's willing to fight for tough causes. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Boehner told his caucus that he would ignore a series of concessions from the president on taxes and spending, and propose his own bill that would extend the Bush tax cuts for incomes below $1 million a year. He also said he would push serious discussion of spending cuts and other revenue into 2013, at which point he could use the debt ceiling as leverage. (Remember that it's necessary to raise the ceiling in order to pay for debts already incurred by Congress.) Meanwhile, he would let unemployment benefits and a significant payroll tax break expire.

In a statement, Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's communications director, said that if Congress passed such a horrible bill, Mr. Obama would veto it:
"The Congressional Republican "Plan B" legislation continues large tax cuts for the very wealthiest individuals-on average, millionaires would see a tax break of $50,000-while eliminating tax cuts that 25 million students and families struggling to make ends meet depend on and ending critical incentives for our nation's businesses. It would also cut off a vital lifeline of unemployment assistance to 2 million Americans fighting to find a job just a few days after Christmas, while deeply cutting Medicare."
With that fight ongoing, Mr. Obama held a news conference at the White House to announce that Mr. Biden's new task force will come up with concrete proposals on curbing gun violence, and send them to Congress next month.
Mr. Obama also signaled his support for new limits on high-capacity clips and assault weapons, as well as an end to the gun show "loophole." Mr. Obama said broadening access to mental health care is also part of the solution.
Of course these positive indicators aren't proof that Mr. Obama has learned how to muscle through his agenda. The fiscal cliff proposal that led to Mr. Boehner's Plan B was full of significant, arguably unnecessary concessions that the Republicans-predictably-ignored.
And did Mr. Obama really need to bother with a task force? Politicians love special commissions and blue ribbon panels, because they make them look serious. But the solutions these groups identify are generally obvious. Here's a tip for Mr. Biden: Google "Bloomberg" and "guns" and then read Mayor Mike's "6 ways to stop gun madness" Op-Ed in USA Today.

HEADLINE: Turkey's Nagging Whodunit

BYLINE: ANDREW FINKEL


HIGHLIGHT: In full conspiratorial mode, Turkey unearths the corpse of one of its old presidents. 

 BODY:
ISTANBUL - I've long suspected that governments cling to conspiracy theories like some children cultivate imaginary friends. It's a way of coping with events outside their control. If only reality were as dramatic or as clear-cut or even as fun as the fantasy.
And yet - to quote Henry Kissinger quoting Golda Meir - even paranoids have enemies. Strange things do happen, and some mysteries are hard to resolve. 
Turkey's unexplained whodunit concerns President Turgut Ozal, who died in 1993, ostensibly of a massive heart attack. No autopsy was conducted at the time, but then one hardly seemed necessary. The president was overweight. He had undergone a triple by-pass at Houston Methodist Hospital. And the year before, he'd been operated on for prostate cancer.

Yet his wife, Semra - a cigar-smoking platinum blonde with a penchant for jewel-encrusted revolvers - thought otherwise. She said her husband had been served tainted lemonade at a reception at the Bulgarian Embassy the night before his death.
At the time, her suspicions seemed like an Oliver Stone take on J.F.K.'s assassination, but they took root over the years, as Turkey began to peer into the activities of the deep state, which had become a law unto itself.
Today, the country is in full conspiratorial mode. The courts are creaking their way toward a verdict in the Ergenekon trial, in which senior army officers and a slew of alleged civilian collaborators (including journalists) stand charged with forming a secret organization to take over the Turkish state. The defense argues that the trial itself is a conspiracy - a witch hunt by the government against its detractors.
In such a climate it seemed inevitable that doubts over the death of Ozal would come back onto the political agenda. The president is seen as the spiritual father of the current pro-free-market government, a man who challenged the military-backed old guard in the name of cultural conservatism and hit bump after bump on the road to social and economic reform.
When Turks speak of the "Ozal Years" they are referring to a stagnant, inward-looking country opening up to the globe. Ozal gave close support to the United States during the First Gulf War, and he understood that Turkey's ability to reshape the Middle East depended on its proving that it could make reforms at home.
Was Ozal an early victim of an ultra-nationalist conspiracy that wanted to keep the Kurdish issue bottled up and Turkey's shutters to the outside world wedged tight?
Turkey's State Supervisory Board, acting under orders of the current president, recently decided to find out. In early October Ozal's body was exhumed from a mausoleum in Istanbul.
According to the latest forensic report, Ozal, who was operated on by the famous heart surgeon Michael Debakey in 1987, may have subsequently fallen into the hands of some latter day Dr. Crippen, the infamous poisoner. Ozal's body contained a rich cocktail of noxious substances, including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, more commonly known as DDT, and a DDT by-product called DDE, which damages the liver, as well as cadmium and the radioactive elements americium and polonium.
Then Zaman, a newspaper that campaigns for the prosecution of the Ergenekon suspects, leaked the president's final medical report from Houston, which said his ticker was working just fine.
Yet the final report is inconclusive. The presence of toxins in the president's body does not in itself prove that he had been poisoned. Ozal's final resting place is a mausoleum beside a busy Istanbul highway, and after 19 years there the body might have become contaminated.
And so Turgut Ozal's ultimate contribution may be to teach Turkey that coming to terms with the past means accepting a lack of certainty.

HEADLINE: Putin Under Fire From International Rights Groups

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Ahead of the EU-Russia summit on Thursday, activists are calling on European leaders to put muscle behind their criticism of Vladimir Putin's crackdowns on Russian freedoms. 

 BODY:
LONDON - An alliance of international human rights and citizen action groups has accused Vladimir V. Putin of cracking down on Russia's civil society since he returned to office as president in May.
Eight organizations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty, and the corruption watchdog Transparency International, urged the European Union to raise their concerns at a summit meeting with the Russians this week.
They cited current and pending legislation that they said called into question Russia's relationship with fellow European states and with the European Court of Human Rights. 
"Since Putin's return to the presidency in May, Russia's Parliament has adopted a series of laws that imposed new restrictions on public assemblies and raised financial sanctions for violations to the level of criminal fines, re-criminalized libel, and imposed new restrictions on Internet content," according to Human Rights Watch.
The rights groups said that new laws branded nonprofit groups that received money from abroad "foreign agents," while a new, broader definition of treason could potentially criminalize human rights and political activism.
Fines of up to $32,000 against those taking part in protests deemed illegal had had a "chilling effect on the right to peaceful assembly." Other new measures threatened to control the Internet and curb free speech, according to the rights groups.
And a proposed law aimed at anyone "promoting" homosexuality to people under 18 was condemned as homophobic by Human Rights Watch.
Looking to the regular summit meeting of Russia and the European Union opening in Brussels on Thursday, Hugh Williamson, the Human Rights Watch director for Europe said, "The E.U. should convey a clear sense of alarm at the crackdown of the past six months on Russia's vibrant civil society. 
"And the E.U. should press the Russian leadership to stop trying to choke off free speech and assembly and any sign of dissent."
The joint appeal comes as Washington and Moscow are embroiled in a controversy over a new U.S. law that would punish alleged Russian human rights abusers.
The law, signed by President Barack Obama last week, bars those accused of rights abuses from traveling to the United States and from owning real estate or other assets in the country. 
As my colleagues David M. Herszenhorn and Andrew Roth wrote this week, "It infuriated Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, who pledged to retaliate." Russian lawmakers on Wednesday were considering a ban on adoptions of Russian children by American citizens.
How far the European Union can or will seek to go in reversing Russia's alleged bad behavior is a moot point. Friday's summit is expected to focus on economic issues rather than human rights.
European officials have nevertheless spoken out on Russia in terms not that different from the rights groups. 
Catherine Ashton, the Union's foreign affairs chief, has said that since May, "we have been seeing less and less dialogue and openness on the side of the authorities, and rather more intolerance of any expression of dissenting views."
In a speech to the European Parliament in September, she said, "Instead of stronger safeguards for the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, we have seen a string of measures all chipping away at them."
International and domestic criticism has thrown at least some Russian officials on the defensive.
In a televised interview this month, Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, denied that the Kremlin had begun "tightening the screws" since Mr. Putin replaced him as president.
"I don't consider these laws reactionary," he said of the contentious legislation. "If they are wrong, if they hurt citizens' interests, then they have to be corrected. But that's not the case yet."

HEADLINE: Obama Chosen as Time Magazine's Person of the Year

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: In a choice likely to surprise few, Time magazine has named the newly re-elected President Obama as its Person of the Year for building through his winning coalition a presidency that "spells the end of the Reagan realignment that had defined American politics for 30 years." 

 BODY:
In a choice likely to surprise few, Time magazine has named the newly re-elected President Obama as its Person of the Year for building through his winning coalition a presidency that "spells the end of the Reagan realignment that had defined American politics for 30 years."
"We are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes, and Obama is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new America," wrote Time's editor, Rick Stengel, in the new issue. He concluded: "For finding and forging a new majority, for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union, Barack Obama is Time's 2012 Person of the Year." 
Mr. Stengel noted also that Mr. Obama was the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win more than 50 percent of the vote in consecutive elections and the first president of either party since 1940 to win re-election with an unemployment rate above 7.5 percent. 
"He has stitched together a winning coalition and perhaps a governing one as well," Mr. Stengel wrote. But that theory is being tested even now, a month before Mr. Obama is to be sworn in for his second terms, on issues of the budget and gun control. 
Right now the president is engaged in what has to be the final days of negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican House leader, toward a compromise deficit-reduction deal that could bring tax revenues and spending closer into alignment for decades to come - if they succeed - and could usher in a truce in the deficit wars that have divided the parties since the early days of the George W. Bush administration. Yet success is hardly assured, and given a looming year-end deadline, many people in both parties are predicting the two sides will retreat to some minimalist fallback, and continuing fighting next year. 
Also on Wednesday morning, Mr. Obama is to make an announcement about the process that his administration will follow to devise policy responses to the kind of mass murders that occurred horrifically last Friday in Newtown, Conn. One of the exclusive photos in the magazine shows Mr. Obama attending his daughter Sasha's ballet rehearsal on Sunday but writing the speech he delivered to the Newtown community that night. 
The cover photo portrait shows a pensive president in a sidelong view, the shot taken so close that every hard-earned crease in his face is clear and the gray hairs accentuated after four eventful, often stressful years in what has been called the hardest job on the planet.
In an interview, Mr. Obama told Time that, "2012 may have been more satisfying a win than 2008."
"I think it was easy to think that maybe 2008 was the anomaly, and I think 2012 was an indication that, no, this is not an anomaly. We've gone through a very difficult time. The American people have rightly been frustrated at the pace of change, and the economy is still struggling, and this president we elected is imperfect, and yet, despite all that, this is who we want to be. That's a good thing."
Mr. Obama said his winning coalition reflected "the much-noted demographic shift in this society," and that one of his points of pride of the first term is, "I think I've helped to solidify this incredibly rapid transformation in people's attitudes around L.G.B.T. issues - how we think about gays and lesbians and transgender persons."
Though Mr. Obama presumably is just at his presidency's halfway point, he said of his legacy, "What I'd want people to say is that having come in at a time when our economy was on the brink of collapse, when we had gone through a decade in which middle-class families were doing worse and worse, and the ladders of opportunity into the middle class for people who were willing to work hard had begun to deteriorate; at a time when, internationally, we were embroiled in two wars but our leadership around the world was being questioned, that we had steered this ship of state so that we once again had an economy that worked for everybody; that we had laid the foundation for broad-based prosperity; and that internationally we had created the framework for continued American leadership in the world throughout the 21st century."
When asked why he keeps a diary, Mr. Obama turned to the example of Abraham Lincoln, another writer-president. He said that in his own life, like Mr. Lincoln's apparently, "writing has been an important exercise to clarify what I believe, what I see, what I care about, what my deepest values are."

HEADLINE: Ireland Passes Law to Bolster Housing

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The bill overhauls several aspects of Ireland's consumer debt laws, including a measure that would let stressed borrowers work with banks to write down the value of their mortgages. 

 BODY:
Ireland's Parliament passed a sweeping new law on Wednesday that could let thousands of borrowers reduce the amounts they owe on their mortgages.
The impact of the so-called personal insolvency bill, which overhauls several aspects of Ireland's consumer debt laws, will be closely watched in other countries still grappling with housing busts. 
The bill contains a groundbreaking measure that would let stressed borrowers work with their banks to write down the value of their mortgages. The intent is to make the loans more affordable and avoid a wave of foreclosures.
In America and Europe, officials have generally shied away from policies that would make mortgage write-downs a major part of efforts to clean up their housing messes.
In a news release, Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality, which handled the legislation, said the bill was "a fundamental part of the government's strategy to return this country to stability and economic growth."
The department acknowledged that the part of the bill that could lead to write-downs was unorthodox, saying it introduced "a concept unique in international insolvency law."
The law, however, may not translate that readily to the United States.
There have been very few foreclosures in Ireland. The government owns large stakes in the biggest mortgage banks, and officials instructed the banks to refrain from repossessing large numbers of homes. As a result, uncertainty hangs over struggling households and weighs on the banks. The new bill aims to resolve that limbo.
Banks are expected to work with borrowers to make their mortgages payable. Where deals are possible, the borrower and the bank will be on a much more certain footing. Where there is too much debt, the banks will have more leeway to foreclose.
Nearly 18 percent of Irish mortgages on first homes were in default at the end of September, according to the Central Bank of Ireland. Ireland has nearly $150 billion of mortgage debt on first homes. Defaults are also high on mortgages taken out on investment properties, a big part of Ireland's housing market.
Though the new law was constructed carefully to avoid unintended circumstances, it still carries significant risks.
It could prompt borrowers to default even if they can afford to repay the loan. That could lead to unexpected losses for Ireland's banks, which could undermine their ability to finance a recovery. In a letter in September, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, expressed concern about the potential costs the bill could place on Ireland's banks.
The banks could still decline mortgage write-downs even when they may help borrowers. As the law is written, a majority of creditors have to agree to a write-down. Consumer advocates have criticized this part of the bill, saying it tips the balance of power in favor of the banks.
Alan Shatter, Ireland's minister of justice, responded to those concerns on Wednesday. In the department's news release, he said, "The reality is that it is in the best interests of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement."

HEADLINE: The Liberation of General Motors

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: The federal government's divestment of its ownership stake in G.M. will end an uncomfortable and distinctly un-American period of our nation's economic history. 

 BODY:
Like Willy the whale, General Motors has finally been freed - or nearly so.
Today's announcement that the Treasury Department had agreed on a process to extricate the government from its ownership stake in G.M., the world's largest automaker, is welcome news.
For General Motors, the separation will conclusively remove the appellation of "government motors," a stigma that the company had argued affected the buying decisions of a meaningful segment of consumers. 
The divorce will ultimately also liberate G.M. from a number of government-imposed restrictions, importantly including those relating to executive compensation. These restrictions adversely affected G.M.'s ability to recruit and retain talent. Now, compensation decisions will be made by the company's board of directors, just as they are in every other public company in America. 
From Washington's point of view, divesting its remaining shares will end an uncomfortable and distinctly un-American period of government ownership in a major industrial company.
Neither the George W. Bush nor the Obama administrations volunteered to bail out G.M., Chrysler and other parts of the auto sector. Both subscribed firmly to the longstanding American principle that government should resolutely avoid these kinds of interventions, particularly in the industrial sector. 
However, in this case, that was simply not possible, as Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama both concluded. I and the other members of the Obama administration's auto task force determined that the industry's crisis was caused not only by the financial and economic meltdown but, equally, by poor management that had run these American icons into the ground and exhausted their cash resources. 
We were faced with a classic market failure: Not a penny of private capital was willing to provide the financing essential for these companies to keep running. Those (like Mitt Romney) who contend that G.M. and Chrysler could have been restructured without government involvement simply don't understand the facts.
The only alternative to government stepping in would have been for the companies to close their doors, terminate all their workers and liquidate. That would have led to huge failures and layoffs among the suppliers. Even Ford would have had to shut down, at least for a time, because of the unavailability of parts.
Here's another important lesson of the auto rescue: It would not have been possible without the existence of the much-hated $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Without TARP, we could not have provided the $82 billion to these companies without Congressional approval. And given the dysfunction of Congress, I don't believe there was any chance that the legislature would have acted within the few weeks that we had before the companies would have collapsed. 
In a perfect world, I would not be a seller of G.M. stock at this moment. For one thing, the company is still completing the reworking of its sluggish management processes in order to achieve faster and better decisions and lower costs.
For another, G.M.'s financial problems slowed its development of new products during 2008 and 2009. Now, a passel of shiny new models offering great promise is about to hit showrooms.
And in my view, G.M. stock remains undervalued, trading at about 7 times its projected 2013 earnings, compared with nearly 13 for the stock market as whole.
But as my former boss in the White House, Lawrence H. Summers, kept reminding us in 2009, this intervention needed to be the opposite of Vietnam: We wanted to have as small a footprint as possible while the government was a shareholder and to get out as quickly as practicable.
While the government still retains (temporarily) a majority stake in Ally, G.M.'s former finance arm (formerly known as GMAC), the scorecard for the auto rescue is nearly complete.
Of the $82 billion that the two administrations pumped into the auto sector, Treasury is likely to recover all but about $14 billion.
No doubt, bailout haters will focus on this loss of taxpayer money. But remember two key points:
First, the $17.4 billion initial round of bridge loans that was provided at the end of 2008 was necessary only because GM and Chrysler had been utterly derelict in not preparing for restructurings through bankruptcy that were clearly inevitable. G.M., in particular, wallowed in an irresponsible state of denial. Had the companies been properly prepared, the loss of that $17.4 billion could have been avoided.
Second, for $14 billion - 0.4 percent of the government's annual expenditures - more than a million jobs were saved at a time when unemployment in the Midwest was well above 10 percent.
The auto industry has not only survived but it is flourishing. Car sales, which had sunk as low as 10.4 million in 2009, are now running at an annual rate of more than 15 million. As many as 250,000 new workers have been added. Disastrous past industry practices - from bloated inventories to excessive sales incentives - have been curbed. As a result, G.M. earn more in 2011 than in any year in its 104-year history.
Finally, let's keep well in mind the most important lesson of the auto rescue: While government should stay away from the private sector as much as possible, markets do occasionally fail, and when they do government can play a constructive role, as it did in the case of the auto rescue.

HEADLINE: Agency Will Pay $1.7 Million for False Job Placement Claims

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: The agency, which falsely claimed to place 1,400 New Yorkers in jobs, routinely falsified entries in government job placement databases. 

 BODY:
A nonprofit agency that once was among Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's favorite contractors has agreed to pay $1.725 million to the federal government for falsely claiming to place 1,400 New Yorkers in jobs.
Most of those New Yorkers in fact found jobs on their own, or remained unemployed.
Federal prosecutors announced the settlement on Wednesday of a civil fraud lawsuit against Seedco. The agency, according to prosecutors with the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, routinely falsified entries in government job placement databases. 
"In addition to being illegal, it is insensitive to the people who desperately need employment help to exploit public funding for these programs," said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. "We will not tolerate the abuse of federally funded programs."
Barbara Gunn, the president of Seedco, has acknowledged for at least a year that agency officials made serious ethical errors. "Over a year ago, Seedco terminated a number of employees after an extensive internal investigation following allegations that Seedco employees had falsified data entry," the agency said Wednesday.
Among those who resigned was Francine Delgado, a former senior vice president for the agency.
The New York Times first revealed the abuses in the summer of 2011, after a former deputy director at Seedco, Bill Harper, approached the newspaper with more than 400 examples of false placements. Later, six other Seedco employees told The New York Times that managers had pressured them to produce thousands of false job placements.
The fraud came as a blow to Mr. Bloomberg, who has long touted his administration's success in finding jobs for unemployed New Yorkers. Seedco, which now holds no city contracts, stood at the heart of many mayoral programs, from job placement and cash grants for welfare clients to loan programs for small businesses.
But the claims of success in the Seedco program relied on a pressure-cooker atmosphere at the nonprofit, former employees said. They spoke of unrelenting pressure from the Bloomberg administration and the Department of Small Business Services to produce more and more job placements; each year city officials raised the target for placements, even in the teeth of a severe recession.
The Bloomberg administration handed out "performance-based" bonuses to agencies which produced high numbers of jobs. Seedco employees told city Department of Investigation agents that they feared for their jobs if they failed to reach these goals.
Robert W. Walsh, the commissioner of the city's Department of Small Business Services, said early on that he had "no apologies" for setting aggressive targets, and insisted that the city's third party verification contractor - which called a small numbers of clients and simply asked if they were employed - would catch most problems.
His confidence was misplaced. His agency has since strengthened contract terms and officials say they count only placements that can be verified directly with employers. They have similarly tightened data practices and say they have made it more difficult to tamper with customer records.
Mr. Harper, the Seedco whistle-blower, now lives in Seattle. As part of its settlement with federal prosecutors, Seedco also settled with Mr. Harper. Agency officials had attacked him personally in The Times's first article, and Seedco agreed to issue a full retraction of its comments.

HEADLINE: To Japan-China Row, Add One Potential Provocateur

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The way ahead in the East China Sea - combat or compromise - could conceivably hang on one man, Shinzo Abe, who will be sworn in next week as prime minister of Japan. One Japan scholar said of Mr. Abe, "If he follows through on what he's been saying, we could have serious problems." 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The idea that armed conflict could break out in the Pacific over a handful of godforsaken islands is almost unthinkable, not only for the violence involved but also for the potentially calamitous economic and political repercussions. Political leaders, military officials and security analysts can barely utter the W-word out loud for fear they might be unbottling the genie.
But the dispute between China and Japan in the East China Sea took another harrowing turn last week when a Chinese plane overflew the islands and Japan scrambled some fighter jets in response. The Japanese Defense Ministry said it was "the first known violation of Japanese airspace by a Chinese plane" in half a century, as my colleague Hiroko Tabuchi reported. 
Naval vessels from both countries have been patrolling the islands, which are known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. Bilateral tensions have been high enough that a bumping or brushing incident at sea - even an accidental one - might well lead to actual fighting.
Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the dispute "has left both countries deeply suspicious of each other, and public antipathy on both sides of the East China Sea is running high." In China there have been nasty anti-Japanese riots.
The way ahead - combat or compromise - could conceivably hang on one man, Shinzo Abe, 58, who is due to be sworn in next week as the new prime minister of Japan. 
The entire region, along with the United States, is waiting to see which of Mr. Abe's political personalities emerges most forcefully - the conservative, nationalistic politician with a provocative streak when it comes to China, or the pragmatic statesman who would pull himself and his party back from the fire-breathing campaign rhetoric of recent weeks.
Worryingly, Mr. Abe appeared ready to add a ground dimension to the confrontation at the islands by pledging to station government workers or Coast Guard personnel there. 
"If he follows through on what he's been saying, we could have serious problems," Gerald L. Curtis, an expert on Japanese politics at Columbia University, told my colleague Martin Fackler. "Who the heck wants to go to war over the Senkakus?" 
Naturally, Mr. Abe's posture in the region also concerns Washington, which is treaty-bound to defend Japan. "American analysts say the United States might balk at risking war with China if Japan is the one provoking a confrontation over the disputed islands," Martin wrote.
Japan also has a separate but equally emotional and volatile dispute with South Korea: Both countries claim an atoll in the South China Sea known as the Dokdo islands in Korea and the Takeshima in Japan. (South Koreans went to the polls in a national election on Wednesday.)
Mr. Abe has "promised to push for a constitutional revision to convert Japan's Self-Defense Forces into a full-fledged military," said Ayako Doi, an associate fellow at the Asia Society. 
In the wake of the landslide triumph of Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week, the principal state-run news media in China have already been promising a tougher foreign policy line from the government, especially over the islands. The editorial tone has been almost baleful. 
One sample, from Global Times, a daily newspaper affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party: 
Once Abe takes office, China should let him know about its firm stance. Only with such pressure will Abe hold China in esteem, otherwise he will think China is in a weak position. In recent years, every time Japan has switched to moderate policy toward China, it has been the result of China's strong stance rather than its concessions.
Beijing could understandably be anticipating a harder line from Tokyo. Mr. Abe has serious credentials as a nationalist, even a provocative and unapologetic one. In a previous tenure as prime minister, from 2006-7, he denied that the Japanese military had forced women, many of them Koreans, into sexual slavery during World War II. 
He also has suggested a revision of Article 9 of the Constitution might be in order, the section that says "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." The article also says that "land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained."
Mr. Abe has visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a Shinto temple that holds and honors the souls of Japan's war dead - among them a number of convicted Class A war criminals. These visits cause diplomatic apoplexy in Beijing and Seoul, as both capitals consider Japan to be insufficiently repentant about its military's atrocities in the war. 
In 2007, as prime minister, he gave $425 for the planting of a 6-foot ceremonial evergreen at the shrine. 
Mr. Abe went to Yasukuni two months ago in his role, as he pointed out, as the head of the Liberal Democratic Party. And in a nod to his pragmatic side, he walked back an earlier promise that he hoped to visit the shrine one day as prime minister. 
"In view of current Japan-China and Japan-South Korea relations, it's better not to say whether I will visit if I become prime minister," he told reporters at the time.
In his first press briefing following the election this week, Abe the Conciliator showed up, saying, "China is an indispensable country for the Japanese economy to keep growing. We need to use some wisdom so that political problems will not develop and affect economic issues." 
But Abe the Provocateur also emerged, at the very same briefing, saying that the Senkaku/Diaoyu remain "the inherent territory of Japan."
"We own and effectively control them," he said. "There is no room for negotiations about that."

BYLINE: JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR.


HIGHLIGHT: They say they expect more money to flow in over the coming weeks. 

 BODY:
The 12-12-12 last week has raised about $50 million for people affected by Hurricane Sandy, the producers announced on Tuesday night. They said that they expected more money to flow in over the coming weeks from the sales of albums, merchandise and more donations, and that the first $50 million in aid would be distributed immediately. 
With a lineup featuring stars like Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney, the event raised more than was collected during the Concert for New York, a similar show staged by the same producers after the Sept. 11 attacks. (That show brought in $35 million -- adjusted for inflation, the equivalent of about $45 million today.) 
 But the benefit's tally fell short of other recent telethon-style fund-raisers, like the Hope for Haiti concert that was broadcast on MTV in January 2010, which raised about $61 million. It also did not exceed the $55 million gathered in 1985 (about $118 million in 2012 dollars) for famine victims at the Live Aid concerts, according to BBC news. Those concerts drew tens of thousands of fans to stadiums in London and Philadelphia. 
 David Saltzman, the executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, said the money would be distributed to about 140 groups that are providing aid to people whose homes and businesses were destroyed when Hurricane Sandy swept through the region in late October. Among other things, those groups have been providing hot meals to people in devastated areas, legal and psychological counseling to storm victims, cash grants to college students unable to pay their bills and home furnishings to people whose houses were destroyed. 
 "Our hope is that Robin Hood will continue to put boots on the ground in the hardest hit communities, to get people what they need now," Mr. Saltzman said. 
 The concert was marred by reports that thousands of tickets were resold for a profit on StubHub, the ticket resale site. StubHub donated its fees from these sales -- about $1 million -- to the Robin Hood Relief Fund, but it appears most of the profits from those secondary sales went into the pockets of professional ticket brokers and individuals, rather than to the charity, said Glenn Lehrman, a StubHub spokesman. 
 Since Stubhub charges a 25 percent fee, the total cost of the tickets sold on the resale site is estimated to be about $4 million. The tickets were listed for many times their face value, prompting some calls in Albany for a ban on reselling tickets to charitable events.
 The large number of tickets that were resold for profit also drew fire from the concert's producers -- James Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company; John Sykes, the president of Clear Channel Entertainment Enterprises; and the filmmaker Harvey Weinstein. 
 Mr. Saltzman said about $30 million of the total had come from the initial sale of 13,500 tickets and donations from corporate sponsors, chief among them J.P. Morgan Chase & Company, which also underwrote the production costs.
 The rest of the proceeds -- some $20 million -- flowed in from other sources: donations given over the telephone, online donations to Robin Hood and the sale of merchandise. 
 The charity is also receiving money from the sale of an album of the concert, which has been distributed by Columbia Records. That recording was listed at No. 3 on the iTunes album chart on Tuesday afternoon. 
 Funds are also being raised through an auction of memorabilia from the show, mostly instruments and clothing signed by the celebrities who took part. A Fender bass autographed by Mr. McCartney, Mr. Springsteen, Roger Daltrey and several other rock figures was being auctioned for more than $40,000. The drumsticks used by Dave Grohl during his appearance are being sold for more than $6,000.
A previous version of this post misspelled the name of a StubHub spokesman. It is Glenn Lehrman, not Glen Lehrman.

HEADLINE: Hands Off My Clothes, Mommy

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
TRADITIONAL rules of retailing hold that popular adult brands, like the Gap and J. Crew, will inevitably create a children's line (Gap Kids, Crewcuts). Even designer labels like Fendi and Marc Jacobs have joined in, with coral tulle baby dresses and $150 bootees for those who cannot yet walk.
Now some companies are seeking a profitable path in the opposite direction, as parents press the retailers that make their favorite kids' and baby products to cater to them, too.
''We'd have our customers e-mail us and say, 'Oh, I want the Josie pant for me, can you make that next year?' Or, 'The Ava top is so great; you have to make this in women's. I would buy five of them!' '' said Stacey Fraser, the founder of Pink Chicken, a girls' clothing line. Her first full women's collection will be in boutiques and the brand's Madison Avenue and Amagansett, N.Y., stores in January. 
Pink Chicken, known for its bohemian-chic patterned dresses and separates, is in good company. Tea Collection, a San Francisco brand whose internationally inspired designs are popular among boys as well as girls, introduced a women's line two years ago. Aden + Anais, a Brooklyn company whose muslin swaddling blankets quickly shot to the top of the newborn accessory hot list, has created a blanket for adults, with a full bedding line in the works. Petunia Pickle Bottom, known for its array of ornate diaper bags, is planning to roll out a line of purses under the label Petunia this spring.
''When we realized the gravity of some of the decision-making that goes into selecting their diaper bag, we really realized the opportunity to stay with that customer,'' said Korie Conant, an owner of Petunia Pickle Bottom, in Ventura, Calif. ''We've received letters from our customers saying, 'I was so sad when I didn't get to use my diaper bag anymore.' We are just answering that call.''
It is not the first time such calls have come in, or that companies have answered. Hanna Andersson, a children's clothing company in Portland, Ore., famous for its striped cotton long johns and girls' dresses, has sold adult clothing for years. Rachel Riley, a designer of upscale children's clothing who splits her time between London and France, introduced a women's line in 1997.
According to Ms. Riley's company Web site, ''Rachel's customers would tell her, 'My children are better dressed than me!' Of course she wanted to help.''
Branding experts offer a spate of reasons behind the phenomenon. Among them: Parents' own desire for a little coddling in this rough economy. An influx of successful ''mompreneurs'' who are keenly attuned to what their customers want for themselves as well as for their progeny. A children's market that has exploded in recent years, leading to the creation of pieces so appealing that they transcend age and life stage.
''The cart is leading the horse,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, a market research company. ''We've gone over the top and around the other side.''
As parenthood gains a certain fashion cachet ''it's almost like an elitist club,'' Mr. Cohen said, in which ''all new moms or all moms that really get the concept are going to carry this bag or wear that sweater.''
Plus, today's parents have an almost insatiable desire to connect with their children.
''What used to be a generation gap is now a generation bond,'' Mr. Cohen said.
Because customers become acquainted with these products around the same time they first encounter their children, the brands can tap into a well of emotions, hopes and dreams, said Jane Buckingham, president of Trendera, a trend forecasting and consulting company.
''That is a moment when all possibilities exist, all things are good, all things are pure,'' she said. ''What better time to grab a mother's brand loyalty?''
Maria T. Bailey, whose books include ''Power Moms: The New Rules for Engaging Mom Influencers Who Drive Brand Choice,'' said that millennial mothers, who are in their early 30s and under, generally have positive associations with their own childhood, so they may want to recapture those emotions. They also ''savor celebrations,'' she said, going on ''babymoons'' while pregnant and holding ''gender-reveal parties'' at which the unborn child's gender is disclosed, in grandiose fashion.
''If they associate a brand with a moment in time that felt good and that they could celebrate, they're likely to stay loyal to that brand and utilize it again and again,'' Ms. Bailey said.
Kristen Cook, 45, a mother of three boys in Lynchburg, Va., first spotted Pink Chicken dresses five years ago, in the window of a children's clothing store in Charlottesville, Va. She was drawn to the unusual patterns and silhouettes, which struck her as sophisticated yet whimsical. She bought a few dresses as gifts, then called the company with a question she had never before posed to a children's designer.
''Are y'all ever going to do anything for adults?'' she recalled asking. ''Because I want these!''
As Pink Chicken has expanded its women's offerings from a few pieces each season to, recently, a collection with shirts, tunics, pants and dresses, Mrs. Cook has watched, and shopped, approvingly.
Devotees of Petunia Pickle Bottom diaper bags already use them as purses and travel totes.
''I get compliments on them all the time, even from strangers,'' said Ashley McKinley, 27, who regularly heads into her office in Sacramento with a Petunia Pickle Bottom bag (she has 15) slung over her shoulder. ''When I tell them it's a diaper bag, they're shocked.''
The new Petunia purses are designed to appeal to ''that 20-something who only wants a really nice handbag'' as well as mothers who may want to mark the transition out of the diaper bag phase of their lives, Ms. Conant said. When a child grows out of diapers, ''it is truly kind of a sad moment,'' she said, ''but it's another rite of passage into, 'I can have anything I want. I don't need a changing pad anymore, I don't need all of these compartments anymore.' ''
Raegan Moya-Jones, a founder and the chief executive of Aden + Anais, was ecstatic when the company's muslin swaddling blankets caught on among new parents. Then she started seeing women wearing the blankets as scarves, and hearing from parents eager to drape their own beds and couches in Aden + Anais.
So she took the fluffy Dream Blanket -- ''ideal for snuggling,'' the company's Web site says -- and super-sized it for adults.
''We have just been harassed by mothers, saying, 'Why do you just stop at the baby?' '' Ms. Moya-Jones said. '' 'I want this blanket, and I want this for me, and I want that for me.' ''
Scarves, beach cover-ups and a full adult bedding line are in the works.
Julie Panebianco, 36, an English teacher in San Francisco, discovered Aden + Anais blankets while shopping for baby gifts for friends. By the time she gave birth to her daughter, in August, the brand had expanded; she loaded her registry with Aden + Anais crib sheets, burp cloths and extra-soft bamboo muslin blankets.
She began craving a muslin blanket of her own.
''I literally contemplated sewing some squares together to make one for me,'' she said.
Instead, Ms. Panebianco recently e-mailed the company to inquire about adult sizes. ''Not the type of thing I would normally do,'' she added.
It's just that the blankets, she explained, were so ... soft.
She paused.
''Maybe it's that I have such a lack of sleep right now,'' she suggested. ''Eight hours of sleep with those blankets would make my life.''

HEADLINE: Guilty Plea in Grade-Fixing at Baruch

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
He was the kind of school administrator some college students might have considered themselves lucky to encounter, someone who was willing to raise grades issued by professors when the students' marks fell short of graduation requirements.
But to make those changes, the administrator, Chris Koutsoutis, forged the signatures of professors and his superiors at Baruch College. He also made up reasons for the changes, most often saying that the student had finally turned in missing work.
Mr. Koutsoutis, 56, who was director of executive programs at the college's Zicklin School of Business, appeared in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday and pleaded guilty to 21 felony forgery charges and 10 misdemeanor charges of falsifying business records. 
He received no money or favors for making the changes, according to court papers. When Justice Larry Stephen asked him to explain his motivation, Mr. Koutsoutis quietly said that he just wanted to give the students their best chances to succeed.
''I wish I had a better answer for you,'' he said.
Outside of court, his lawyer, Mark A. Bederow, said Mr. Koutsoutis had not suggested that pressure from above, or concern for his job, led him to help failing students stay in the program.
''He was approached by students who were not meeting the academic standards of Zicklin, and he tried to help them,'' Mr. Bederow said.
There has long been suspicion that some graduate schools inflate grades to keep programs with high tuitions full.
Christina Latouf, a spokeswoman for Baruch, said the college had discovered Mr. Koutsoutis's actions and fired him this year.
Five other professors who were aware of his actions are going through a disciplinary process, Ms. Latouf said, though she said she could not elaborate on those personnel matters. She said the college was pleased with the outcome of the case.
''It sends a message that you can't defraud our students,'' Ms. Latouf said.
In court, Mr. Koutsoutis read through a lengthy account of what he had done to help eight students, including changing one grade from an F to an A-minus and falsely noting on the grade change form that the student had ''completed missing course work.'' Mr. Koutsoutis admitted that he had repeatedly forged the signature of Frank Fletcher, executive director of graduate programs at Zicklin.
For some students who did poorly in a class, he arranged with professors to allow them to sit in on classes for which they had not paid.
''Though the substitute course was not interchangeable with the required course originally taken, I nevertheless doctored the students' original grades,'' he said.
Under the plea deal, Mr. Koutsoutis agreed to serve six months in jail and five years on probation. He remains free until his formal sentencing, which is scheduled for February.
The three programs at Zicklin where trouble was found allow midcareer professionals to continue working while pursuing executive master's degrees. The 22-month executive master's of business administration program, for example, meets once a week, mostly on Saturdays, and costs a total of $75,000.
Baruch, which is part of the City University of New York system, reported the forgeries to the office of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney.
''This defendant was entrusted with guiding students, but instead abused his position by falsifying records to show grades that did not reflect students' performance,'' Mr. Vance said in a statement.
It was not Mr. Koutsoutis's first conviction. In 2000, he pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court in Queens to filing a false instrument and was sentenced to six months in jail. The charge was related to practicing law without a license.
He was hired by Baruch the same year. Ms. Latouf did not respond to messages on Wednesday evening asking whether he had disclosed the prior conviction before being hired.

HEADLINE: Back in the Pink

BYLINE: By TIM MURPHY

 BODY:
DESPITE repeated pleas, Betsey Johnson would not sit still.
The tiny 70-year-old designer -- legendary in the fashion world for ending her runway shows with cartwheels and a split -- paced nervously in her small studio on West 37th Street in Manhattan, crammed with hot-pink vintage knickknacks and a rainbow of tulle skirts that hung from the ceiling.
She pulled out old pictures and fiddled endlessly with her abundant yellow hair extensions. She laid out plastic bags of salted almonds, dried cranberries and Twizzlers. She passed around plastic cups of Korbel sparkling wine.
''I hardly eat anything except those,'' Ms. Johnson said, legs akimbo in her pink chintz chair. Skinny and flexible, in heavy eye makeup, tight vintage T-shirt (her own design) and ripped black jeans, she looked like a punky, rag-doll version of Dolly Parton, minus the ample breasts. As for the midday bubbly? ''I've got to have a little to calm down,'' she said. ''I'm the it's-always-5-o'clock-somewhere girl.'' 
Nevermind it was 2 p.m. Ms. Johnson's loopiness is well known and beloved. But there is one realm where she has been ruthlessly focused. Last April, Betsey Johnson LLC filed for bankruptcy, which resulted in the closing of all 63 stores including the original flagship in SoHo and the firing of 350 employees. So at an age when her peers are retiring, Ms. Johnson has set about resurrecting -- and reinventing -- her fashion empire, dress by colorfully wacky dress.
Next month, with the retailer Steve Madden as her new parent company, she is introducing a lower-priced line of Betsey Johnson frocks at department stores. In the spring, she and her 37-year-old daughter, Lulu Johnson, will be starring in their own reality TV show. And, this summer, her third fragrance, Betseyfied, hits stores.
But even as her brand changes, her trademark look has not. For nearly 35 years, her new-wave colors, skintight party dresses and prom-queen-gone-rogue petticoats have barely wavered. Her new collection hews to the same codes.
''I stick to my guns, my sheaths and my sexpots,'' she said. ''And I've always kept the price of a dress at or below the price of a round-trip weekend in Puerto Rico. That's been my formula.''
That formula has inspired younger designers who brought similarly outrageous looks to the runway, including Heatherette, Jeremy Scott and the Blonds. Her comeback is a test not only of her resilience but also, to a broader extent, of whether independent designers, birthed in the cradle of New York's downtown creative scene, can still compete in the era of fast fashion.
''She's built a huge brand based on youthfulness and rebellion,'' said Sophia Amoruso, 28, who designs the vintage- and punk-inflected Nasty Gal line. ''Her clothes were never too-cool-for-you. They just said that it's fun to be a girl.''
THE road to bankruptcy was paved with candy colors. At her label's height in the mid-2000s, Ms. Johnson had $150 million in annual sales, 400 employees and lucrative licensing deals in footwear, handbags, sunglasses and fragrances. In 2007, looking to take her brand bigger, Ms. Johnson sold a majority stake in her company to Castanea Partners, a private equity firm in Boston. A dozen stores soon opened in San Francisco; Chicago; Austin, Tex.; and elsewhere.
But the expansion collided with declining store sales, and the company found itself defaulting on a $48 million loan. In 2010, Steve Madden stepped in to take over the loan and, with it, ownership of the Betsey Johnson brand. So why the tumble? Ms. Johnson, not one to focus easily, had a hard time answering. ''We were bogged down in five-year projections,'' she said, haltingly. ''Or maybe it all began when stores started knocking off my $250 prom dresses for $49.''
Whatever the case, profits plunged by half and last April, unable to find a buyer after approaching 22 investors, Betsey Johnson filed for bankruptcy, with more than $4 million in debt.
Industry observers blamed the poor timing: the expansion coincided with the 2008 financial crisis. ''They went into a licensing frenzy,'' said Fern Mallis, a fashion consultant. ''There was not a category she didn't have her name on, and there was maybe not the infrastructure to manage that carefully.''
Steve Madden, the shoe and fashion mogul who is now effectively Ms. Johnson's boss, put it more bluntly. ''They had delusions of building a huge company and going public,'' he said. ''So they borrowed a lot of money, they had too many stores, and their rents were too high.''
Analysts also saw a consumer shift. ''When you're selling avant-garde expensive products in an economically challenged environment, things get difficult,'' said Marshal Cohen, a chief analyst for the NPD Group in Port Washington, N.Y., which tracks the fashion industry. ''The younger women that buy her don't even have jobs anymore, let alone income.''
With that in mind, the ever-upbeat Ms. Johnson -- she marked the bankruptcy, after all, by toasting her staff members with sparkling wine and cupcakes -- decided to go lower-priced. If the old benchmark was a weekend trip to Puerto Rico, Ms. Johnson's new formula is to offer playful party dresses for the price of a day trip to the Mohegan Sun.
Simply called Betsey Johnson, the new line of girlie dresses will be sold at select Macy's and other retailers, including Nordstrom, starting in February for $99 to $249. ''They'll be young in spirit like Betsey is, but accessible for women up to 40 years old,'' said Lisa Andriulli, a vice president of Macy's.
Ms. Andriulli added that the dresses have classic Johnson touches like fun prints and petticoats, but are sized more generously.
And to stay in the spotlight, Ms. Johnson and her daughter, Lulu, are filming a reality TV show that follows Lulu's efforts to start her own fashion line called Lulu Johnson. Set to have its premiere on the Style Network in March, it is called ''The Betsey and Lulu Show.''
Filming has been nonstop since August, with crews practically camped out in Ms. Johnson's studio. ''The producers keep telling me to stop playing to the camera,'' she said, as aides darted about. ''But I think they might let me get away with it.''
Just as she's always gotten away with her boy-craziness. She confessed to having a hopeless crush on one cameraman, a scruffy 30-year-old named Ben. Though married three times, Ms. Johnson is currently single and lives on the Upper East Side with Lulu and her granddaughters, Lela, 6, and Ella, 4.
''Ben's the cutest and sweetest man I've ever met!'' Ms. Johnson said.
It's that kind of ditsy flirtiness, with a touch of St. Marks Place sex-bomb, that has fueled Ms. Johnson's brand all these decades. Born in 1942 into what she calls a ''very WASPy Protestant family'' in Wethersfield, Conn., the daughter of a mechanical engineer and a guidance counselor, Ms. Johnson made her first garment when she was 4.
''It was an apron with a doggy print on it,'' she said. Her childhood love of dance informed her view of fashion as performance. ''Makeup; glitter; Sleeping Beauty; Pinocchio; butterscotch candy; oh, and Mitzi Gaynor, 'Honey Bun'; ... oh, oh, and um, peanut butter!'' is how Ms. Johnson remembers those early years.
After graduating from Syracuse University, Ms. Johnson found her way to New York in the Swinging Sixties, where she designed things like silver miniskirts for Paraphernalia, the mod boutique on Madison Avenue. At night, she ran with the Warhol crowd at the club Max's Kansas City. She briefly married John Cale, a Velvet Underground member, in 1968, and enlisted Edie Sedgwick, the model and Warhol muse, as her fit model.
''We were a bunch of poor, frantic, lonely creative kids,'' Ms. Johnson recalled. ''Everyone was taking speed. Not me -- I only took diet pills.'' Ms. Johnson looked perplexed when everyone in the studio laughed, before laughing along with an oh-what-the-heck shrug.
In the '70s, Ms. Johnson did freelance designing for Butterick patterns and Alley Cat. But it was not until 1978, when the punk scene at CBGB's raged, that Ms. Johnson and her friend Chantal Bacon, a former model, cobbled together $100,000 to form the Betsey Johnson label. The following year, they opened the first store at 130 Thompson Street in SoHo.
''We wanted to make clothes for us and our friends -- the kind of stuff we were wearing at Mudd Club,'' said Ms. Bacon, who stayed with the company until 2010. ''We were doing a lot of pink and black striped Lycra when everyone was doing the earth-toned Annie Hall thing.''
Kim Hastreiter, the co-editor of Paper magazine, remembers Ms. Johnson then as a kooky original. ''Back then, you were either uptown or downtown, and Betsey and I both were definitely downtown,'' she recalled. ''She put rock chicks on roller skates for her fashion shows and was constantly eating popcorn and licorice. She always had a boyfriend and then sometimes she'd get married.''
Sales grew steadily through the decades and Ms. Johnson's runway shows, which riffed on playful themes like ''The Little Rascals'' and '50s beauty parlors, were whimsical parties amid the seriousness of Fashion Week.
''She's always been either the youngest old fashion designer in the world, or the oldest young one,'' Ms. Mallis said. In 1999, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, then helmed by Ms. Mallis, gave Ms. Johnson its Timeless Talent award.
It was the same year that Ms. Johnson underwent a lumpectomy for breast cancer, enduring radiation while preparing for a show. She didn't let it spoil the fun. ''I only found out about the cancer because one of my breast implants deflated,'' Ms. Johnson said, cracking herself up.
It was typical of how she turns bad news into fun-filled romps. During Fashion's Night Out in September, five months after declaring bankruptcy, she gave a street party outside her shuttered SoHo flagship, holding court in a sparkly tiara.
That same week, she managed to show her latest collection. Part career retrospective and part 70th birthday party, the show featured her pal Cyndi Lauper performing.
And it ended, of course, with a cartwheel and a split. ''I'll be so depressed when I can't do them anymore,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''At that point, you may as well just put me in a wheelchair.''
Mr. Madden said he was confident that the new line, which will also sell on betseyjohnson.com, will put her name back into the black. ''There's a girl in every town that identifies with Betsey,'' he said. ''It just means more Betsey for all of us.''
And Ms. Johnson is determined to give more Betsey. On a rainy, cold night on Long Island last month, she was at a '50s-style diner she had rented to shoot new images for her Web site, vamping with two 20-something models wearing her new crinolined dresses. The reality TV crew was also on hand to capture every zany moment.
While the models, their hair shellacked into Eisenhower-era cotton candy, pouted away, Ms. Johnson strode onto the set -- a balloon-strewed dance floor -- wearing a vintage studded-leather jacket, a velour Alaïa minidress (also vintage), fishnet stockings and black bootees with seven-inch spike heels. While everyone waited, she couldn't help but clown around with the TV crew -- there was no Ben, that night, alas -- who were snapping photos with their iPhones.
''Betts, can we focus so we can get out of here?'' a weary producer who looked half Ms. Johnson's age asked in a monotone. The stylist on the shoot appeared visibly dismayed when Ms. Johnson undid the bangs of a model's carefully coifed hair to create a bad-girl runaway tendril.
''Let's make it a little more rock 'n' roll,'' Ms. Johnson said, before spontaneously breaking out into the twist in front of a jukebox. ''Who's gonna rock around the clock tonight?''
She was ready to party.

HEADLINE: On Guns, America Stands Out

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Sometimes I think the best argument is raw data. This is one of those times.
In the wake of the horrible school shooting in Connecticut and on the heels of politicians finally being smoked out into the open to talk seriously about sensible gun control policies, it's important that we understand just how anomalous America is on the issues of guns and violence among developed countries. This table shows how shamefully we measure up against other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the O.E.C.D. countries that the World Bank groups as ''high income,'' America has the highest gun homicide rate, the highest number of guns per capita and the highest rate of deaths due to assault. In fact, America has more homicides by gun than all of the other high-income O.E.C.D. countries combined. 
It's just shameful.

HEADLINE: A Conservative Whose Supreme Court Bid Set the Senate Afire

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Charlie Savage contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Robert H. Bork, a former solicitor general, federal judge and conservative legal theorist whose 1987 nomination to the United States Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in a historic political battle whose impact is still being felt, died on Wednesday in Arlington, Va. He was 85.
His death, of complications of heart disease, was confirmed by his son Robert Jr.
Judge Bork, who was senior judicial adviser this year to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, played a small but crucial role in the Watergate crisis as the solicitor general under President Richard M. Nixon. He carried out orders to fire a special prosecutor in what became known as ''the Saturday Night Massacre.'' He also handed down notable decisions from the federal appeals court bench. But it was as a symbol of the nation's culture wars that Judge Bork made his name.
It is rare for the Senate in its constitutional ''advice and consent'' role to turn down a president's Supreme Court nominee, and rarer still for that rejection to be based not on qualifications but on judicial philosophy and temperament. That turned Judge Bork's defeat into a watershed event and his name into a verb: getting ''borked'' is what happens to a nominee rejected for what supporters consider political motives. 
The success of the anti-Bork campaign is widely seen to have shifted the tone and emphasis of Supreme Court nominations since then, giving them an often strong political cast and making it hard, many argue, for a nominee with firmly held views ever to be confirmed.
Until the end of his life, Judge Bork argued that American judges, acting to please a liberal elite, have hijacked the struggle over national values by overstepping their role, especially in many of the most important decisions on civil rights and liberties, personal autonomy and regulation of business.
He advocated a view of judging known as ''strict constructionism,'' or ''originalism,'' which seeks to limit constitutional values to those explicitly enunciated by the framers and to reject those that evolved in later generations. He dismissed the view that the courts had rightly come to the aid of those neglected by the majority. By contrast, he felt that majorities, through legislatures, should be empowered to make all decisions not specifically addressed in the Constitution.
He most notably took issue with the Supreme Court's assertion in the 1960s and '70s that the Constitution implicitly recognizes a right of privacy that bars states from outlawing abortion or the use of contraceptives by married couples.
That position, along with his rejection of court-mandated help to minority groups, led a coalition of liberal groups to push successfully for his Senate defeat, motivated in no small part by their sense that he cared more about abstract legal reasoning than the people affected by it. They contended that his confirmation would produce a radical shift on a closely divided Supreme Court and ''turn back the clock'' on civil and individual rights.
Judge Bork, who was 60 at the time, was sitting on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often a steppingstone to the Supreme Court, when President Ronald Reagan announced on July 1, 1987, that he was nominating him to the high court to replace Lewis Powell, a moderate justice who was retiring. Within an hour of the announcement, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, set the tone for the bruising contest to come.
''Robert Bork's America,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a speech, ''is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is -- and is often the only -- protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.''
Judge Bork's supporters considered every word of that attack a misrepresentation. But the fear that his confirmation would curtail settled rights, especially of blacks and women, created a national reaction.
A National Outcry
An array of groups focused on civil and women's rights, labor, consumer power and the environment began an extraordinary public campaign against him, arguing that his long and extensive record exposed a range of agendas and made him unfit for the job.
They made their case in full-page advertisements, mass mailings and demonstrations and ceaseless lobbying of their senators. Since there was no question of his integrity or intelligence, the campaign and subsequent hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee, run by Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic senator from Delaware at the time, focused on whether Judge Bork was ''out of the mainstream.''
Two Supreme Court decisions were seen as especially vulnerable to being overturned by a bench with Judge Bork on it: the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which barred states from banning abortion, and the 1978 Bakke case upholding affirmative action. During five days of testimony, much of it televised, Judge Bork declined to comment on how he would rule should those issues come up and argued further that what he had said in his life as a scholar and advocate would have little bearing on his judgments from the bench.
The White House also sought to portray him as a moderate. That, and his own assertion that he would look at the law with a fresh eye, gave off the whiff of hypocrisy, which made it easier for some senators to oppose him.
The American Bar Association's committee on judicial nominees also split, with four of the 15 members calling him ''not qualified,'' because of concerns over his ''compassion, open-mindedness, his sensitivity to the rights of women and minority persons or groups.''
Judge Bork, a bear of a man with a scraggly red beard and untamed frizz on a balding pate who had an outsize love of food and drink, handled himself poorly in front of the committee and failed to give doubters confidence. As Tom Shales, the television critic for The Washington Post, wrote of his testimony: ''He looked, and talked, like a man who would throw the book at you -- maybe like a man who would throw the book at the whole country.''
The most contentious part of the hearings occurred under questioning from Arlen Specter, a centrist Republican from Pennsylvania and a former prosecutor. Mr. Specter, who died in October, quoted Judge Bork as having written that under the Constitution, executive power had to evolve. Why then, Mr. Specter wanted to know, shouldn't other constitutional concepts -- like individual liberty -- have a chance to evolve as well? The senator accused Judge Bork of selecting evolving rights based on his own preferences rather than neutral principles.
It was an accusation that stuck. So did the notion that the nominee was somehow unfeeling as a judge. This latter was amplified when, asked by a sympathetic senator, Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, why he wanted to serve on the Supreme Court, Judge Bork replied that it would be ''an intellectual feast.''
The committee voted, 9 to 5, to reject his nomination and sent it to the full Senate, which also turned him down.
After the defeat the White House picked Douglas Ginsburg, of the same federal appeals court in Washington, as its new nominee. But when it was discovered that he had smoked marijuana at Harvard, his nomination was withdrawn and replaced with that of Anthony M. Kennedy, a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California.
In his hearings, Judge Kennedy, a mainstream, clean-cut conservative from Sacramento, made a point of distinguishing himself from Judge Bork by focusing on compassion and the need to respect Supreme Court precedents. His nomination sailed through the Senate. On the Supreme Court, he became an important centrist swing vote between liberal and conservative blocs and has consistently declined to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Judge Bork inspired a fervent generation of conservative legal thinkers. As America turned more conservative and President George W. Bush chose judges with views similar to his, many of Judge Bork's acolytes and admirers ended up on the federal bench.
After his defeat, Judge Bork retired from the Circuit Court and took up positions at conservative ideological groups and law schools, writing and speaking against what he saw as the moral decline of the country at the hands of an elite, a theme he explored in a best-selling book.
In an interview in The American Spectator in 2002, he repeated his view that a liberal elite had hijacked the nation. ''Churchgoers aren't very powerful, given their numbers,'' he said. ''And the intelligentsia is powerful, far beyond their numbers, because they control the hype of television. They control Hollywood. They control the newspapers. They control the foundations. They control the universities.''
A Change in Philosophy
Robert Heron Bork was born on March 1, 1927, in Pittsburgh to Harry Bork, a purchasing agent with a steel company, and the former Elizabeth Kunkle, an English teacher. He attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and recalled that he spent most of his early years ''reading books and arguing with people.''
After a stint in the Marines guarding supply lines in China at the end of World War II, he went to the University of Chicago. Renowned conservative scholars there like Leo Strauss advocated a return to republican principles of ''virtue'' and hierarchy. Mr. Bork was a New Deal enthusiast, as was his wife, Claire Davidson, a fellow undergraduate whom he married in 1952. But by the early 1950s, while he attended the University of Chicago law school and became impressed with market-oriented conservatism, both had moved permanently to the right.
Mr. Bork discovered economics and became a libertarian opposed to government intervention and regulation. He began to evolve a similar theory of law, seeking what he called ''neutral principles.'' His major scholarly contribution, a 1978 book called ''The Antitrust Paradox,'' encouraged mergers and called for less antitrust regulation for efficiency's sake. Students called a course he taught on the topic at Yale ''protrust.''
Out of law school, Mr. Bork was hired by the prestigious Chicago firm of Kirkland & Ellis, where he spent eight years before taking a job teaching antitrust law at Yale in 1962. The Borks packed up their three children, Robert Jr., Charles and Ellen, and moved to New Haven, where he pursued his conservative ideas in a deeply liberal environment, campaigning for the Republican and archconservative Barry Goldwater's election to the presidency in 1964.
He also wrote a fateful article for The New Republic in 1963 -- one that played a key role in his 1987 defeat -- condemning the public accommodation sections of the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act aimed at integrating restaurants, hotels and other businesses. Mr. Bork said he had no objection to racial integration but feared that government coercion of private behavior threatened freedom.
The New Republic took the rare step of writing a reply, rejecting his reasoning and pointing out that restaurateurs were not legally permitted to reject service to well-behaved whites and that the new law intended simply to extend that principle to blacks. The editors also accused Mr. Bork of taking neutral principles out the window -- an accusation he would hear more than once in his life.
A decade later, during his confirmation hearings for solicitor general, Mr. Bork said that he had changed his mind and that his 1963 article had been a kind of thought experiment. But during the 1987 Supreme Court nomination battle, many cited the article as evidence that he had always been out of step in a way that harmed minorities.
The upheavals of the late 1960s drove Mr. Bork from libertarianism to social conservatism. Freedom -- the cry of student activists -- no longer stood as his supreme value. Tradition, order and hierarchy did. In a 1971 article in The Indiana Law Journal, he argued that the First Amendment's protection of free speech had been wildly extrapolated beyond the intent of the Constitution's framers. In a starkly narrow interpretation, he said free speech existed to perpetuate the process of self-government; therefore, he wrote, only explicitly political speech about governing was protected.
Mr. Bork worked for Nixon's re-election in 1972. He was rewarded with the nomination to solicitor general, a post he held for three and a half years and from which he advanced his beliefs on the constitutionality of the death penalty, the illegality of busing to achieve racial balance in schools and the power of the president over Congress.
Mr. Bork's role in Watergate occurred in 1973, when Nixon wanted to keep a special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, from gaining access to incriminating White House recordings and ordered him fired. The attorney general, Elliot L. Richardson, and his deputy refused and quit. Mr. Bork, as solicitor general, was next in line to carry out the president's orders, and he did, firing Mr. Cox and his entire staff.
When Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, was elected in 1976, Mr. Bork returned to Yale. But it was a hard time for him. He had grown impatient with academic theorizing, and his wife, Claire, had developed cancer, which was spreading. She died in 1980, and he returned to Washington, first in private practice. After the election of President Reagan, he was nominated to the District of Columbia circuit court.
His five years on the federal bench showed a record of stark conservatism; he often denied plaintiffs the right to a court hearing, showed strong deference to the executive branch over Congress and gave wide latitude to business over government regulation.
A View Made Clear
One of his opinions, in Dronenburg v. Zech in 1984, dealt with the Navy's power to fire a veteran for consensual homosexual activity. Judge Bork not only granted the Navy that power, but he also took the opportunity to make clear that a right of privacy did not exist in the Constitution. ''If the revolution in sexual mores that appellant proclaims is in fact ever to arrive,'' he wrote, ''we think it must arrive through the moral choices of the people and their elected representatives, not through the ukase of this court.''
In 1982, at an event in which he was speaking, Judge Bork met Mary Ellen Pohl, a conservative activist and former nun. They married five months later. She and his three children and two grandchildren survive him.
Judge Bork laid out his objections to much of what is handed down in American courtrooms in his best-selling book ''The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law'' in 1989, describing a number of rulings as ''judicial legislation'' by inappropriately activist judges. He further said that he had become the symbol that liberals needed to destroy.
In 1996, he published ''Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline,'' also a best seller. This book took aim at egalitarianism, individualism and other liberal ideas, saying they go against natural law.
''A decline runs across our entire culture,'' he wrote, and ''the rot is spreading.''

HEADLINE: Illinois: Field Museum Cuts Back

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Field Museum in Chicago, a center of global scientific research, has announced plans to cut staff, overhaul operations and limit its research because of a high debt and the recession. The natural history museum may also change operating hours and increase admission prices to special exhibits, museum officials said Tuesday. The museum is known for its research into plants and animals and impressive collections, including Sue, the world's largest and best-preserved Tyrannosaurus rex. Officials said they hoped to cut $5 million in costs and increase the museum's endowment by $100 million. The Field's president and chief executive, Richard Lariviere, said it has more $170 million in outstanding bonds.

HEADLINE: In Kentucky Mining Region, a Power Company Loses Some of Its Appetite for Coal

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Coal took another serious hit Wednesday -- in the heart of coal country.
American Electric Power, or A.E.P., the nation's biggest consumer of coal, announced that it would shut its coal-burning boilers at the Big Sandy electric power plant near Louisa, Ky., a 1,100-megawatt facility that since the early 1960s has been burning coal that was mined locally.
Big Sandy this year became a symbol of the plight of the coal industry nationwide. Strict new environmental regulations are forcing large utilities to spend billions of dollars to retrofit old coal-burning plants or shut them down, replacing them in most cases with equipment that uses cleaner-burning natural gas. 
A.E.P., which is based in Ohio, has repeatedly changed its mind over what to do with Big Sandy, a big employer in eastern Kentucky, both at the 120-employee plant itself and in the Appalachian-area coal mines that feed it 2.5 million tons of coal each year.
In May, the power company withdrew a plan to spent $1 billion to retrofit Big Sandy so that it could continue to operate. But that would have required a 31 percent increase in electricity rates for eastern Kentucky residents.
On Wednesday, A.E.P. announced that it would close both of the coal-burning furnaces at Big Sandy in 2015, but left open the possibility that one of the units would be retrofitted to use natural gas. Area residents, if the Kentucky Public Service Commission approves the plan, would see an 8 percent increase in their electricity rates -- to replace Big Sandy's production with electricity from West Virginia -- much less than the earlier plan.
But the decision still hurts, said State Representative Rocky Adkins, a Democrat who represents the area.
''It's kind of like we have had our heart and soul taken from us,'' said Mr. Adkins, who also is the majority floor leader of the Kentucky House. ''The impact on the economy here is just going to be devastating.''
This has been a bad year for the coal industry.
A total of 55 plants, including Big Sandy, have closed or have announced plans to shut down, according to a count by the Sierra Club. That will leave 395 coal-burning plants in the United States, compared with 522 in 2010, according to the Sierra Club.
Last week, Dynergy of Houston announced that its Danskammer coal-burning power plant near Newburgh, N.Y., which was damaged during Hurricane Sandy, would also close permanently. Last month, Patriot Coal, based in St. Louis, which filed for bankruptcy this year, announced it would be shutting down its Bluegrass Mine Complex near Henderson, Ky., one of dozens of mines that are reducing production or closing operations as electric utilities shift at a record rate from coal to natural gas.
Nationwide, coal production dropped this year by an estimated 7 percent even as exports grew to Asia and Europe, according to the Energy Department.
Politically, this has been a disappointing year for the coal industry as well. Industry executives contributed heavily to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, while also sending large donations to important Congressional races, like Senate contests in Ohio, Virginia and Montana, in which their preferred candidates lost.
''Anyway you count it, this is the worst year ever for coal,'' said Bruce Nilles, one of the managers of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. ''And to see Big Sandy added to the list -- it underscores how the economics of coal have turned so fast. This is eastern Kentucky, a place where the state was willing to do a lot to save it.''
Mr. Adkins said the repercussions in eastern Kentucky will last for decades, adding that local hotels, trucking companies, and even schools, would be adversely affected by the shutdown.
''We will get up, dust ourselves off and we will try our best to move forward,'' Mr. Adkins said.
Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, said that there remained hope that the price of natural gas would rise in the coming year, making coal more competitive. He said surging demand in India and China could help replace declining domestic sales.
''We have the most of the fuel -- coal -- that the rest of world wants the most of,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Revolt Of the Cliff Dwellers

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Attempts to avert the infamous ''fiscal cliff'' are like a super-high-stakes card game. But you have to imagine a game in which one player needs to go into a back room before he makes his bet and get the approval of a herd of rabid ferrets.
That would be Speaker John Boehner. Across from him at the card table sits the president. When Barack Obama won his big Senate race in 2004, his pals in the Illinois Legislature celebrated with one last evening of poker, in which they took the senator-elect for every dollar in his wallet. 
So perhaps it was not surprising that in the negotiations, the president gave up quite a bit. You will remember that Obama had campaigned on keeping the Bush-era tax cuts only for the American middle class: families making $250,000 a year or less. O.K., possibly not all truly middle-class. Still, that was his line in the sand. There were long stretches this fall when tax-hike-for-over-$250,000 seemed to be his only specific plan for the next four years. But, this week, he let Boehner move the line. Pushed it up to $400,000. Plus, Obama gave way on entitlements by agreeing to change the cost-of-living adjustments on Social Security. Then, all eyes turned to the House speaker. And the rabid ferrets.
Pop Quiz: Try to guess what John Boehner did next, based on some of his recent comments about the fiscal-cliff negotiations:
''Ifs and ands and buts are like candy and nuts. If that were the case, every day would be Christmas.''
''Listen, I was born with a glass half full.''
''The president continues to blame anyone and everyone for the drought but himself.''
O.K., the last one was really not about the fiscal-cliff negotiations. But you have to admit it's pretty good.
What Boehner did was to announce that instead of signing off on a deal, he was going to go back to his members and ask them to vote for ''Plan B.''
We had never met Plan B before, but it turns out it's a bill to raise taxes only on the Americans who make $1 million or more a year.
''Unfortunately, today we will have to go to Plan B because we want to make sure we do not go off the cliff,'' said the House majority whip, Kevin McCarthy.
''Plan B'' does not sound like something that would protect you from a cliff. It sounds like a less-than-desirable option for dental coverage.
''I hope the president will get serious soon,'' said Boehner as he explained the complex thinking behind his bill during a 50-second press conference.
If only Boehner had taken the deal, liberal Democrats could now be enjoying a much-anticipated opportunity to complain that President Obama sold them out. He had all the cards, and he gave away the $250,000 one! He dropped the ace of entitlements! But, once again, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives conspired to make Obama look good.
At least the president made a serious offer while Boehner put up ... Plan B. Which does virtually nothing but continue the Bush tax cuts for those making less than $1 million a year. Everything else goes over the cliff. Laid-off workers getting extended unemployment benefits. Doctors treating Medicare patients.
Honestly, it sounded like something that Eric Cantor typed up on his smartphone on the way over from his office.
''I know the Democrats are baffled at what we're doing,'' said Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, during a rather sullen Rules Committee meeting. ''We're trying to find a bill we can pass.''
Sure, blame the ferrets.
At bottom, Plan B is just an attempt to shift the blame if the country falls over the fiscal cliff, destroying whatever faith Americans had in their national government and creating terror on Wall Street.
No matter what happens, let's agree never again to call anything a ''fiscal cliff.''
Imagine what would have happened if Congress and the president had said they were negotiating to ''put the fiscal horse back in the barn'' by Jan. 1. We'd be at the same place right now, but would anybody be talking about a potential stock market collapse? I think not.
And if it weren't for the psychological impact of the cliff thing, would it be so bad if the Bush tax cuts just expired? It would save around $4 trillion over the next 10 years. The deficit would plummet, the fiscal horse would be back in his stall, the gate to the pasture would be locked and there would be several ICBM missiles guarding the budgetary barnyard.
Unfortunately, nobody in Washington seems to think this is a good plan.
If they can't make a deal, on New Year's Eve you can run around yelling: ''The fiscal horse is about to fall over a cliff!'' This, people, is what is known as having it all.

HEADLINE: Obama and Boehner Diverge Sharply on Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Hopes for a broad deficit-reduction agreement faded on Wednesday as President Obama insisted he had offered Republicans ''a fair deal'' while Speaker John A. Boehner moved for a House vote as early as Thursday on a scaled-down plan to limit tax increases to yearly incomes of $1 million and up, despite Senate opposition and Mr. Obama's veto threat.
The impasse was clear as Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner separately spoke to the television cameras instead of each other, after a weekend of private negotiations amid grieving over the shootings in Newtown, Conn., had narrowed their differences enough to raise optimism about a far-reaching deal to stabilize the nation's debt. 
First Mr. Obama and then Mr. Boehner faulted the other side for the impasse, and ultimately the failure, if a year-end deal could not be reached to stop automatic tax increases and the indiscriminate spending cuts in military and domestic programs known as the ''sequester.'' The president, saying he had gone ''at least halfway'' toward Republicans' demands, evoked Hurricane Sandy and the Newtown school massacre to prod lawmakers to compromise for the nation's benefit.
''When you think about what we've gone through over the last couple months -- a devastating hurricane, and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory -- the country deserves us to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good,'' he said during an appearance at the White House to discuss gun control.
''Frankly, up until a couple days ago if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner were in a position to say, 'We've gotten a fair deal,' '' the president said.
About two hours later at the Capitol, Mr. Boehner delivered a surprisingly brief but sharp retort to Mr. Obama, after which he took no questions from reporters. He started by saying that on Thursday, the House would pass the fallback bill that he has called his Plan B, which would extend the Bush-era tax cuts, which would otherwise expire on Dec. 31, for all incomes up to $1 million -- although later his leadership team was scrambling for votes.
''Then the president will have a decision to make,'' he said. ''He can call upon Senate Democrats to pass that bill, or he can be responsible for the largest tax increase in American history.''
The Boehner bill does hold tax benefits for those with a yearly income above $1 million. It would repeal two Clinton-era tax provisions that limit the personal exemptions and deductions that wealthy taxpayers can claim; extend the lower tax rates on inherited estates rather than allow them to revert to the pre-Bush administration level; and set a 20 percent tax rate for the dividends and capital gains of households earning at least $1 million a year.
The speaker's package would raise about $300 billion in additional revenue over 10 years, compared with extending the Bush tax rates for all income, as Republicans long espoused. That is about $500 billion less than Mr. Boehner's original offer for $800 billion. It is about $700 billion less than would be collected under Mr. Obama's proposal to extend the Bush rates only for incomes below a $250,000 threshold for couples, and $200,000 for individuals. In the talks with Mr. Boehner, he moved that line to $400,000.
Mr. Boehner's statement suggested confidence that Republican leaders would have the votes to pass his plan. But lawmakers who were counting votes for the leadership said the tally was short, and House leaders were adding provisions to the speaker's bill to mollify dissidents.
Some Republicans, for example, objected that the plan would do nothing to prevent the automatic military cuts, about $50 billion, from taking effect in January. To satisfy Republican hawks, leaders will hold a separate vote on legislation, nearly identical to a bill passed earlier this year, that would cancel those cuts and instead shift them to domestic programs, a decision likely to amplify Democratic opposition.
Even if the House Republican majority passes the speaker's measure, it probably faces doom in the Democratic-controlled Senate, making Mr. Obama's threatened veto moot. Mr. Boehner's office has countered that Congressional Democratic leaders in 2011 had supported a $1 million threshold for higher tax rates. Democrats said those proposals were largely intended to show that Republicans would not raise taxes even for millionaires.
While Mr. Boehner scrambled to unify his party, Mr. Obama faced unrest as well from liberals who said he had broken a campaign pledge to keep Social Security out of the deficit-reduction talks. Mr. Obama had given tentative support to Republicans' demand that the government adopt a new inflation formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments for federal benefits. The new formula would slightly reduce the growth in Social Security benefits from what it would be under the current inflation index.
Recalling his campaign, Mr. Obama countered, ''What I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases. That's exactly what I have put forward. What I have said is, in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things, some things that some Democrats don't want to see, and probably there are a few Republicans who don't want to see them either.''
The president said he would continue to have discussions with Mr. Boehner and others. But on Wednesday, even the chief staff negotiators for the two leaders were not speaking.
In trying to line up votes, Republican leaders circulated word that the longtime antitax advocate Grover Norquist had blessed Mr. Boehner's plan as compliant with his ''Taxpayer Protection Pledge.'' Because most Republican candidates sign the pledge not to approve any tax increase, Mr. Norquist effectively has long locked in their votes.
But Mr. Norquist seemed to bend his principles to issue the endorsement, perhaps to maintain his relevance in tax debates. Even senior Republicans lately have denounced Mr. Norquist as a deterrent to resolving the nation's fiscal problems, given increasing bipartisan agreement that higher tax revenues are required to control debt growth.
Even so, the Club for Growth, a conservative group, said on Wednesday that it considered even Mr. Boehner's scaled-back plan a tax increase bill and that it might work to defeat Republican lawmakers who voted for it.

 BODY:
DEBT PAID Ally Financial, the former G.M.A.C., said Wednesday that it had repaid the last of the debt it borrowed in response to the financial crisis under a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation program. 
Ally, which became a bank holding company after the 2008 crisis, said it had repaid $4.5 billion in debt that was guaranteed by the F.D.I.C. Ally had repaid an additional $2.9 billion of debt guaranteed under the program on Oct. 30.
DAY-TRADING CASE The Securities and Exchange Commission has revoked the license of a Canadian brokerage firm over failing to prevent overseas day traders that used its system from manipulating stocks in the United States. The firm, the Biremis Corporation, worked with more than 5,000 day traders in 30 countries, including China, Nigeria and Uzbekistan. Biremis, which is affiliated with Swift Trade of Canada, lost its license in the United States, and its two owners were barred from the securities industry. DAVID BARBOZA
IN REMEMBRANCE Morgan Stanley, where three employees lost family members in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, has donated $150,000 to charities honoring the victims. In addition, about 1,400 employees have made pledges, contributing just over $1 million in total. SUSANNE CRAIG
INSURER DEAL The Markel Corporation, a specialty insurer, said it had agreed on Wednesday to acquire a rival, Alterra Capital Holdings, for $3.13 billion.
Markel will offer 0.04315 of a share and $10 in cash for every Alterra share. That is a premium of about 34 percent to Alterra's closing price of $23.15 on Tuesday. After the deal, Markel said it expected to write annual gross premiums of roughly $4.4 billion and to have $6 billion in equity.

HEADLINE: Homebuilding Permits Rise, Exceeding Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Homebuilding permits touched their highest level in nearly four and a half years in November, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
The agency said building permits increased 3.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 899,000 units, the highest level since July 2008. That was well above economists' expectations for a rate of 875,000 units. 
In contrast, construction starts fell 3 percent to a rate of 861,000 units. That came after three consecutive months of solid gains and a three-month moving average that showed a firming trend.
''The trend is definitely up. Housing is going to make a small contribution to economic growth in 2012, and I would expect that homebuilding will continue to improve through 2013,'' said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh.
While last month's decline in groundbreaking prompted some economists to trim already meager growth forecasts for the fourth quarter, homebuilding is expected to add to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005.
In the 12 months through November, housing starts were up 21.6 percent, while permits gained 26.8 percent.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that demand for home loans fell last week as mortgage rates ticked higher. Applications for loans to buy a home rose in each of the previous five weeks.
Though residential construction accounts for only about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, economists estimate that for every single-family home built at least three full-time jobs are created.
Last month, permits to build single-family homes dipped 0.2 percent to a 565,000-unit pace. Permits for multifamily homes increased 10.6 percent to a 334,000-unit rate, reflecting buoyant demand for rental apartments.
''Longer term, we may have seen a shift in psychology, which is putting an extreme pressure on builders to provide multifamily homes. Young families are no longer clamoring to buy,'' said Lindsey M. Piegza, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.

HEADLINE: Increase in Base Subway Fare And 30-Day Pass Is Approved

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted unanimously on Wednesday to raise the base fare on subways and buses by a quarter, to $2.50, and to increase the cost of a 30-day MetroCard by $8, to $112.
At a meeting of the authority's board at its Midtown headquarters, the agency approved a new fare and toll package that would also raise the prices at its railroads, bridges and tunnels.
For subway and bus riders, the cost of a seven-day pass will rise by $1, to $30. And the bonus on pay-per-ride MetroCards will decrease to 5 percent, from 7 percent, but will be available to anyone who places at least $5 on a card. Currently, the bonus applies only to purchases of at least $10. 
The new rates -- the fourth increase in five years -- will take effect in March.
Though a fare increase has long been expected, the authority undertook a unique approach in determining how exactly it would be put in place, unveiling four options in the fall and soliciting feedback from riders on which they preferred. One proposal called for the base fare to remain $2.25, but raised the cost of a 30-day pass to $125. Another kept the base fare at $2.25, increased the cost of a 30-day pass to $119 and eliminated the pay-per-ride bonus. None of the options were adopted precisely.
''The recommended actions, I believe, strike a balance between the competing goals,'' Joseph J. Lhota, the authority's chairman, said before the vote was held Wednesday.
In a letter to board members last week, Mr. Lhota said that a series of public hearings had made clear that riders valued maintaining some level of a pay-per-ride bonus and ''did not want to see another double-digit percentage increase in the 30-day pass.''
In 2010, the authority raised the cost of 30-day cards to $104, from $89, a 17 percent increase.
Mr. Lhota, who announced after the meeting that he would resign from the authority to explore a run for New York City mayor, argued in his letter that the pay-per-ride bonus ''addresses concerns about the affordability of transit for our most economically disadvantaged customers.'' He said the discount kicked in with a single round-trip purchase, under the new $2.50 base fare.
Fares on the Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road will also rise, by an average of 8.19 to 9.31 percent for most tickets. (Prices vary based on a trip's distance and the time of day.)
The authority approved, with one dissenting vote, increases in the tolls on its bridges and tunnels. Several major crossings, including the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, will cost $5.33 for E-ZPass users, up from $4.80. For drivers paying cash on these crossings, tolls will cost $7.50, an increase of $1.
The fare and toll changes are expected to raise $450 million a year for the authority. Many board members lamented on Wednesday that higher fares were required, in the absence of greater transit subsidies, but none opposed the plan's passage. ''In a perfect world,'' one member, Andrew Albert, said, ''we wouldn't be going through these exercises every other year.''

HEADLINE: Pleased by Ridership, City Looks for Bids to Bolster East River Ferry Success

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's experiment in subsidizing ferry service on the East River has been such a smashing success that city officials are preparing to continue it for at least five more years. 
The New York City Economic Development Corporation intends on Thursday to start seeking bids from ferry operators interested in running the service and possibly expanding its operations beyond the seven landings it regularly makes in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.
The city has been subsidizing the service as a pilot project since June 2011, at a cost of about $3 million per year. But ridership has easily exceeded projections, leading city officials to believe that they may be able to reduce the subsidy significantly.
Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the development corporation, said the city had anticipated 1.3 million passengers during the three-year pilot, but the actual ridership had already surpassed 1.6 million. ''As it turns out, our expectations weren't matched; in reality, they were exceeded,'' Mr. Pinsky said.
The ferry service, which charges $4 for a one-way ticket, has been popular with tourists and weekend shoppers. But a vast majority of the riders (85 percent) are city residents, and at least two-thirds use the ferries to commute to work, according to surveys conducted for the city.
Though reducing the subsidy could cause operators to demand higher fares, Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, said she did not want to see that happen. She said she hoped that there would not be a fare increase commensurate with the one now pending for the subway system. A single-ride subway fare will go up about 11 percent, to $2.50 from $2.25.
''I think if the ferry fare goes higher, we lose ridership,'' said Ms. Quinn, who has been one of the biggest champions of the East River service. She said in a phone interview on Wednesday that it was important to consider that effect while trying to build a ''new type of transportation system'' that is both environmentally friendly and affordable.
''New Yorkers are ready for ferry service as an integrated part of their commute, not just as a lark when the weather's nice,'' Ms. Quinn said.
Mr. Pinsky said the request for proposals would seek to determine how long a contract ferry operators would be willing to enter into, how much of a subsidy they would demand and whether they would expand the service. Ms. Quinn often speaks of her goal of establishing ''five-borough ferry service,'' but a new East River contract is unlikely to bring the idea to fruition.
Staten Island, of course, already has its own ferry link to Manhattan. But there is no Manhattan boat service to and from the Bronx, and even Ms. Quinn admits that there is no viable plan for including the borough yet.
Still, she is holding on to the dream: ''I love a five-borough ferry,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Recalling When East Midtown Was Exposition Central

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In the preservation debate over Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's rezoning plan for east Midtown, one of the most conspicuous landmarks is a building that hasn't existed for almost half a century, yet still exerts a strong influence over the neighborhood.
Grand Central Palace, on Lexington Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, was New York's principal exhibition hall for 40 years: home of the International Flower Show, the Greater New York Poultry Exposition, the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, the Sportsmen's and Vacation Show, the National Photographic Show, the International Beauty Shop Owners Convention, the Frozen Foods Exposition, the National Plastics Exposition, the International Textile Exposition, the National Modern Homes Exposition, the American Medical Association Exposition, the city's Golden Anniversary Exposition of 1948 and - in the greatest annual generator of nautical daydreams and logistical nightmares - the National Motor Boat Show. 
(You think it's tough driving in Midtown? Try it in a 54-foot Wheeler cruiser with a flying bridge.)
In 1963, 52 years after Grand Central Palace opened and a decade after the last show was held there, the 13-story building was demolished. A 44-story office tower, 245 Park Avenue, took its place.
But even today, you can clearly follow the shadow of the Palace by walking up Lexington Avenue from 47th Street. Expositions and conventions brought thousands of travelers to town. Accommodations sprouted shoulder to shoulder along "Hotel Alley": the Winthrop (now the Roger Smith), the Lexington, the Shelton (now the Marriott East Side), the Montclair (now the W New York) and the Beverly (now the Benjamin). Across Lexington Avenue, and in a different league, were the Barclay (now the InterContinental Barclay) and the Waldorf-Astoria.
All but one of these hotels have been identified by the Municipal Art Society, the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Historic Districts Council as worthy of consideration for landmark status. (The Waldorf-Astoria is the exception. It already is an official landmark.) Preservationists fear that the increase in permissible building density envisioned in the mayor's rezoning plan would make it economically feasible to demolish structures like these.
Had there been a strong landmarks law in 1963, there surely would have been a fight over Grand Central Palace. A good case could have been made for its architecture, too.
It was designed by Warren & Wetmore and Reed & Stem, who also worked together on Grand Central Terminal itself. The Lexington Avenue facade of the Palace had a portico of four colossal columns. A two-story arcade - illuminated at night - ringed the top of the building. The main exhibition area was ingeniously carved out of the second and third floors to create an interior volume 48 feet high. The main floor could accommodate 94 booths, typically about 320 square feet each. (I've lived in smaller apartments.)
But let's be honest. Grand Central Palace was not about architecture. It was a setting where adults could play out their fantasies under the pretense of doing business; that is, unless you'd been inducted there into the armed forces during World War II or had a dust-up with the Internal Revenue Service, whose New York headquarters were there in the 1950s.
Even the staid New York Times got into the spirit of things. "Grand Central Palace All A-Cackle With 7,200 Poultry Show Entrants," said a headline on Jan. 4, 1951, under a photograph of a young woman with a long-tailed bird on her shoulder: "Florence Awe using 'Lady Amhurst,' a pheasant, as a hat."
The perennial tangle between automotive and nautical traffic before and after the boat show also allowed Times copy editors to let down their hair a bit. "Boats Go Bounding O'er Main Streets," was the headline on Jan. 8, 1953, heralding the arrival of the show.
Assessing the home furnishings show in The Times of Sept. 18, 1952, Betty Pepis wrote: "All the items that could - and, it seemed to this reporter, many things that shouldn't go into a home - will be displayed by more than 400 exhibitors." With a nod to the impending presidential election, Elizabeth Draper designed a study for Dwight D. Eisenhower in bold strokes of red, white and blue. Melanie Kahane's study for Adlai E. Stevenson was of muted gray and beige. You know how that turned out.
One of the greatest annual draws was the flower show, which offered azaleas, camellias, lilies, peonies, petunias, primroses, roses and tulips in early March, when such color and fragrance in Midtown would have been welcome. As a reporter, I imagine it was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Yet I don't envy the writer who had to describe it year in and year out.
"'Spring followed by summer' is the forecast today and all through the week for Grand Central Palace," was how she opened her account on March 5, 1951. Two years later, on March 9, 1953, her lead paragraph began, "'Spring leading into summer' is the forecast for one small part of New York this week." I'm not going to name names. We've all done it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: France Proposes a Plan to Reduce Bank Risk-Taking

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- François Hollande began his campaign for the French presidency in January with the declaration that he and his Socialist party were prepared to break from policies that they said had contributed to the financial crisis, notably promising a separation of investment banking from consumer banks.
''My real adversary has no name, no face, no party; it will never be a candidate, even though it governs,'' he told supporters at Le Bourget, near Paris. ''It is the world of finance.'' 
Of course, 11 months is a long time in politics. The banking overhaul bill rolled out Wednesday by Mr. Hollande's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, was a far cry from the tough talk of January. Les Échos, a French financial daily, summed up the general reaction in a Page One headline: ''Hollande's signature bank law project is on the rails.''
Gone is the strict separation of investment banking from the consumer, or retail, business and its insured deposit base, with banks required simply to ''ring-fence'' trading for their own books in separately capitalized subsidiaries that remain within the organization. And loopholes in proposed bans on high-frequency trading and agricultural commodity speculation have left those measures essentially toothless.
The banking bill fell well short of a proposal put forth by Erkki Liikanen, the governor of the Bank of Finland, that all banks on the European Union quarantine their risky trading activities. It also fell short of the strictest version of the so-called Volcker plan in the United States, which would prohibit lenders from engaging in proprietary trading altogether.
But French bankers and officials including the Bank of France governor, Christian Noyer, had argued forcefully that Mr. Hollande's original plans would have put the country's financial firms at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals. Expectations for the bill had been ratcheted down in recent months.
''This isn't reform for the sake of the banking lobby,'' Mr. Moscovici said after he presented the proposal to the cabinet. ''It preserves the French universal banking model that has stood the test of time.'' The bill represents, he said, a campaign promise Mr. Hollande has kept.
The French Banking Federation said in a statement that the bill would ''create new constraints and additional charges at an inopportune moment, when the banks must make considerable efforts to adapt to the Basel III capital rules.''
But analysts played down the significance of the measures, and shares of the biggest French banks -- BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale -- rose in Paris on Wednesday.
''It's all mirrors and smoke,'' Christophe Nijdam, a banking analyst at AlphaValue in Paris, said. ''In blunt terms, this is not banking reform.''
As evidence, Mr. Nijdam estimated the proposal would require BNP, the largest French lender, to segregate activities that represented just 0.5 percent of its net banking income. In contrast, he said, the Liikanen proposal would require BNP to segregate activities that represented an estimated 13 percent of that income. The difference is important, because if the riskier activities were separated, their financing costs would rise, reducing profitability.
The bill also calls for the creation of a guarantee fund, paid for by a levy on financial institutions, that could be called on to help pay for any banking disaster.
It also gives the government greater reach. The existing Prudential Supervisory Authority would be given the power to wind up any faltering banks. A new agency, the Financial Stability Council, would be charged with anticipating systemic risks to the banking sector, and have the power to order banks to raise capital or take other measures when they encountered difficulties.
Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels, said the new resolution authority might turn out to be the most important element in the bill. ''France has long had a tradition that banks don't fail,'' he said, ''and this represents a significant step away from that.''
The banking bill was adopted by the cabinet but must still obtain parliamentary approval. It must also be brought into conformity with emerging European Union rules.
''I was always skeptical that France could do it alone,'' Mr. Véron said, adding that it was ''not suitable'' for the government to be pushing for integration at the E.U. level through a banking union while pushing for a different policy at the domestic level.
On a day when Mr. Hollande was making headlines on a state visit to Algeria, it also fell to Mr. Moscovici to warn that further pension overhauls might be necessary -- a revelation that carries political risk for the government.
Mr. Moscovici told RTL radio that changes to the retirement system would have to be considered, despite fixes made in 2010 by Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr. Hollande's conservative predecessor. Mr. Sarkozy's changes, including an increase in the retirement age by two years, to 62, were to have kept the system solvent until 2018. But a new study by a government body, the Conseil d'Orientation des Retraites, estimates the retirement plans would have a combined deficit of &#x20ac;18.8 billion, or $23.8 billion, in 2017, up from &#x20ac;15 billion last year.
The study, first reported this week in Le Monde, proposed several means of addressing the gap, including an increase in payroll deductions, a reduction in the average pension, or adding six months to the retirement age.
Mr. Moscovici also sought to play down suggestions of policy differences among members of Mr. Hollande's government, saying it was natural that ministers would express themselves differently even though they agreed on overall direction.
Referring to the recent dispute with ArcelorMittal, in which Mr. Hollande's governmentthreatened to take over one of the company's steel plants, Mr. Moscovici said that temporary nationalization could be ''useful'' when strategic interests were in play, but could not be an end in itself. He spoke after the industry minister, Arnaud Montebourg, told Le Monde that ''temporary nationalization is the solution of the future.''
''Temporary nationalization is a part of the future, not the entire future,'' Mr. Moscovici said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Jordan Talks of Reform, but Old System Holds Sway

BYLINE: By RANA F. SWEIS

 BODY:
AMMAN -- On Nov. 13, Amer Tubeishat joined several thousand demonstrators in central Amman to protest rising prices.
As Mr. Tubeishat, a senior program officer at a nonprofit organization, walked away from the crowds, he was thrown into a police wagon and introduced to a frightening new world, where he had no access to a lawyer for three days, was prevented from using the telephone and was handed over to the State Security Court. Twenty-two days later, Mr. Tubeishat was released on bail and, in a gesture he finds surreal, invited for lunch with King Abdullah.
Jordan's State Security Court is a special body that has jurisdiction over crimes considered harmful to Jordan's internal and external security -- involving drugs, terrorism, weapons, espionage and treason, but also speech-related crimes, including insulting the king.
The court did not drop the various charges against Mr. Tubeishat, including being part of an unlawful assembly and attempting to subvert the regime. He has no idea whether or when the state will resurrect those charges -- the case is ongoing -- and seek to try him in the future. 
Revolutions that began last year in Tunisia and spread across the Middle East also inspired small but persistent protests and labor strikes in Jordan. Opposition groups have called for comprehensive political and economic overhauls, but most of them have stopped short of calling for the ouster of the king.
''For three years Jordanians have been protesting, but they were not being sent to the State Security Court for doing so until recently,'' said Nisreen Zerikat, a human rights advocate and lawyer. ''The cases that are referred to the State Security Court, in my opinion, deal mostly with people who have expressed their opinion.''
She added, ''We had hundreds of protests since the Arab Spring and people were not detained, so you have to conclude that some people are being targeted.''
During the protest in November, against a 54 percent increase in prices for cooking gas, two officers and a civilian were killed, according to the police.
Last week the king ordered the release of most of the demonstrators detained last month who were not involved in the violence.
''The way that the king has handled his opposition has been with a more soft or mild oppressive measures,'' said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at The Washington Institute. ''He has not provided the riot police with bullets. This has helped him avoid the cycle of killings that has engulfed other authoritarian states during the Arab Spring.''
In response to the Arab Spring, the Jordanian government scrapped an article in the Public Assembly Law requiring consent to hold rallies.
''When the government announces in the media that they accept peaceful protests and then use the claim of 'illegal assembly' against them at the State Security Court, this means there is a big gap between what is being said and what is taking place on the ground,'' Ms. Zerikat said.
Mr. Tubeishat, along with scores of other demonstrators, has been placed in legal limbo, facing a bewildering array of laws and procedures that allow the state to keep people in indefinite detention and saddle them with a criminal record that may be difficult to erase.
Both Human Rights Watch and the local National Center for Human Rights released statements last month denouncing the detention of more than 150 protesters, most of whom were charged with ''illegal assembly,'' ''slandering the monarch'' and ''subverting the political regime.''
Brig. Gen. Muhannad Hijazi, attorney general for the State Security Court, said during an interview last week: ''State security courts exist in many countries in the world, including in the United States, and these courts face criticism from human rights organizations and advocates because of their military affiliation.''
''We are working according to the Constitution,'' he added, ''and free speech is legal within the limits of the law.''
The report by the National Center for Human Rights, which received little attention here, includes interviews with detainees who said they were beaten and abused at police stations before being sent to the State Security Court.
Some of those who arrived there said they were denied lawyers and a medical examination, guaranteed by law, according to the report.
But General Hijazi said protesters signed documents that stated the charges against them and their right to an attorney. ''If there is any proof of violations and we receive them, we would investigate and take action,'' he said.
In an effort to respond to public pressures, last year both houses of Parliament and the king approved dozens of constitutional amendments strengthening the rule of law, fostering the role of the judiciary and establishing a constitutional court. They also approved an election law that would increase the number of seats allocated for political parties in the House of Representatives, the lower house of Parliament.
Despite promising widespread constitutional change, Jordan continues to detain demonstrators under laws that are almost 60 years old. The 1954 penal code allows provincial governors to hold suspects indefinitely if they are considered a ''danger to society.''
Nine protesters from the November demonstrations have been held under these provisions. The National Center for Human Rights says that 11,000 people were held last year in administrative detention.
Dissent has been on the rise in Jordan this year, with anger directed at surging prices of basic commodities, along with that of fuel and electricity. Labor unions are becoming an increasingly strong force for calling attention to dismal working conditions and low pay.
A poor country with 14 percent of the population living below the poverty line, which is $2.60 a day, and high unemployment, particularly among the young at nearly 25 percent, Jordan is also facing external shocks, including hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who fled their homes and crossed into the country.
''The violence in Syria is paradoxically stabilizing the kingdom,'' Mr. Schenker said. ''The people in the kingdom are not coming out to protest more because they worry about chaos.''
During his detention, Mr. Tubeishat said he lost 5 kilograms, or 11 pounds. As soon as he was released, he returned to work, but said his time in detention has left him with mixed feelings.
''The most profound realization for me is the extremely tight security grip that still exists in this country,'' he said. ''I am focusing now on building awareness.''
Six days after his release, Mr. Tubeishat and a few other activists were invited to lunch with the king.
''I was standing in front of the State Security Court, but a few days later I was meeting with the king. It was a bit surreal,'' he said. ''We told him what happened to us and he said this needs to end, so I really hope there is action and follow-up.''

HEADLINE: Voestalpine Plans to Invest in North America

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- Voestalpine, the Austrian maker of steel and components, said Wednesday that it would build a new plant in either the United States or Canada, hoping to take advantage of low North American energy prices to compete with rivals.
The plant will use natural gas to turn iron ore into iron sponge or iron briquettes. This intermediate material made through this direct reduction method will then be used as a substitute for iron ore pellets in Voestalpine's European steel plants to bring down their costs, according to Wolfgang Eder, the chairman of the company's management board and chief executive. 
Mr. Eder said by telephone from Vienna that Voestalpine was operating ''in a high-cost region in a high-cost country in Austria'' and was in danger of losing its competitive position to rivals in Turkey, Ukraine and Russia. He said taking advantage of less expensive North American natural gas was one of the few options open to address the situation.
''We have to do it in one of the cheap shale-gas areas around the world,'' he said of building the new plant.
European industrialists have long complained about the high costs of environmental and employment legislation, but high energy prices are now emerging as another drag on European economic activity.
''This is a really serious issue, not just for the steel industry but also for a lot of other industries,'' Mr. Eder said. In Europe, he said, ''the cost of oil and gas and electricity is structurally higher than in all other parts of the world.''
Natural gas prices in the United States are one-third those in Europe, and electric power prices in some parts of the United States are also much lower. Energy prices in Canada are closely linked to those in the United States.
''In my mind, this announcement reinforces the view that the European steel industry faces difficult growth prospects in its traditional market,'' said Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in London. ''In order to grow, European steel makers will need to look outside Europe, and in the case of Voestalpine, look'' to increase the size of their steel processing and engineering business.
He added that Voestalpine's move was similar to a recent decision by another European steel maker, ThyssenKrupp, to focus more on its engineering divisions.
Like other European steel makers, Voestalpine has felt the pinch of the European economic slowdown, though Mr. Largey said the company remained relatively well positioned as a supplier of premium quality components to high-end automakers like Audi and BMW. It also has access to low-cost iron ore pellets from Ukraine, Mr. Largey said.
Mr. Eder said the raw iron produced in North America would be substituted for 10 percent to 15 percent of the pellets used in Voestalpine's blast furnaces.
Over the longer term, he said, Voestalpine will consider building mini-mills, which use electric arc furnaces to make steel either from scrap or iron briquettes. In a research note, Michelle Applebaum of Steel Market Intelligence said availability of the new inputs would greatly improve the economics of mini-mills, in contrast to integrated mills, which make their steel from iron ore.
Voestalpine said that the European financial crisis had ''left its marks'' on the company but that it was ''using this difficult phase to refashion the group.''
For the six months through September the company reported a 22 percent decline in profit, to &#x20ac;270 million, or $356 million, on &#x20ac;5.9 billion in sales.
The company said it planned to increase the size of its special steel, metal engineering and metal forming divisions, which produce more stable revenue streams than basic steel making. Ten years ago, steel making accounted for 55 percent of revenue; it now amounts to 30 percent.
The company also said it planned to triple the amount of its non-European revenue to &#x20ac;9 billion by 2020. It intends to increase activities in China, Southeast Asia, South America and ''niche segments'' in the United States and Canada. More than 70 percent of its revenue currently comes from Europe.

HEADLINE: Ex-Dictator's Daughter Elected President as South Korea Rejects Sharp Change

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- With the election of Park Geun-hye as president on Wednesday, South Korea extended the tenure of its staunchly pro-American governing party and handed power to the daughter of South Korea's longest-ruling dictator, the first woman to win the post in a deeply patriarchal part of Asia.
Voters appeared to prefer stability over her opponent's calls for radical change in how one of the world's strongest economies addresses the new problems of slowing growth and a growing wealth gap, as well as perennial military threats from North Korea.
With all of the votes counted, according to the National Election Commission, the conservative Ms. Park won 51.6 percent of the vote compared with 48 percent for Moon Jae-in, a liberal stalwart. 
''This is a victory for the people's wish to overcome crises and revive the economy,'' Ms. Park, 60, told her cheering supporters, who gathered in freezing weather in downtown Seoul to celebrate a woman whose steeliness in the face of adversity is legend.
According to her memoir, when told her father, Park Chung-Hee, was assassinated in 1979, she responded, ''Is everything all right along the border with North Korea?''
In its starkest terms, this election was about South Korea's continuing confrontation with its authoritarian past, and confusion over whether a conservative or liberal approach would best serve the country as it tries to stop North Korea's excesses and to handle growing frustration over economic inequality without derailing the country's economic miracle. Mr. Moon, a former human rights lawyer who was once imprisoned for opposing the authoritarian rule of Ms. Park's father, campaigned on restoring key liberal policies from the early 2000s, including a warm embrace of North Korea as a way of trying to curb its aggression.
While Ms. Park's run for president was pioneering in one important way, because of her gender, few see her win as likely to significantly change the lot of women anytime soon in a traditional society where, despite some strong inroads in business and government, women's most important job is still considered to be raising children. In an assessment echoed by voters, analysts said the clearest indication that little was changing was that Ms. Park won in good part on the appeal that a man -- her father -- still holds for many in a country still deeply divided over his legacy.
''Her election was less to do with her gender and more to do with the fact that she was her father's daughter,'' said Kim Ji-yoon, research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. Her father's 18-year iron-fisted rule is remembered by many with bitterness; his government jailed and tortured many dissidents -- whom he painted as Communist sympathizers helping North Korea -- and even banned rock music and miniskirts.
But he is consistently voted the most popular former president in polls for his role in birthing the vibrant South Korean economy, a rapid rise from the ruins of the Korean War that has built a thriving middle class, made South Korean companies feared competitors and restored the nation's dignity.
Still, Ms. Park will have to contend with the fallout from that success, and her father's role in it. One of the abiding themes of the campaign was the clamor for more economic equality and a reining in of the chaebol, or family-controlled conglomerates like Samsung, that Mr. Park helped build with government largess. Those companies power the economy, but their unruly expansion in recent years is blamed for aggravating the gap between rich and poor.
In the end, South Koreans appeared to prefer Ms. Park's calls to overhaul the chaebol over time to the more aggressive approach suggested by her rival, Mr. Moon. Indeed, what appeared to separate the two candidates throughout the election was how far they would go in implementing change.
Mr. Moon campaigned on a return to the Sunshine Policy, a combination of investments and aid to the North. Although Ms. Park criticized the ''inflexible'' hard-line policy of the incumbent, President Lee Myung-bak, for failing to tame North Korea, she prefers a cautious rapprochement. She said she would decouple humanitarian aid from politics and try to meet the new North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. But she insisted, like Mr. Lee, that any large-scale investments be conditional on progress in ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
While Ms. Park's stance may pose something of a challenge to the Obama administration's policy on North Korea -- which had been in lock step with Mr. Lee's -- analysts say it will be much easier for the United States to work with her on the issue than with Mr. Moon.
On Wednesday, President Obama congratulated Ms. Park in a statement, while noting ''admiration for all President Lee has done to strengthen relations'' between the United States and South Korea. Mr. Lee could not run again for president because of term limits.
Ms. Park's political career was born in family tragedy. Her mother was killed by a Communist agent in 1974 when Ms. Park was 22 and a student in Paris; she abandoned her studies to return to Seoul and serve as acting first lady. Five years later, her father was assassinated by his disgruntled spy chief.
Ms. Park retired from public view, as the country eventually turned from authoritarianism in the late 1980s, with many vilifying her father as a dictator. She returned to political life only in 1998 with a vow to ''save the country,'' which was struggling with the Asian financial crisis. Voters who remembered her father's charismatic leadership elected her to a seat in Parliament by a landslide margin, and she has held on to that seat ever since, building a reputation as a principled and tough-minded leader.
''Her image among her supporters is a stable leader, calm during crises, strong and dependable,'' said Choi Jin, head of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.
Throughout the campaign, Ms. Park, who never married, said that her gender would be an asset in leading the nation in difficult times. ''I have no family to take care of,'' she said. ''I have no child to inherit my properties. You, the people, are my only family, and to make you happy is the reason I do politics.''
But in a sign of how little her victory might do for other women, analysts like Mr. Choi said she was viewed as something of an anomaly. ''She is a woman, yet not a woman,'' he said.
Women's lives have changed significantly in recent years. Older people remember a time when women in traditional families served the meal to their husbands and sons, and ate afterward. Women are now a big presence at universities and at some companies, and the barriers to women keeping their jobs after marriage are disappearing.
But women still account for only 3 percent of senior government officials, and the rare ''flowers'' in corporate boardrooms are usually daughters of the chairmen.
For South Korea's beleaguered liberals, having a woman lead the country will not automatically change that and is little compensation for what they see as a turn backward, given her policies on the North and on conglomerates. (In fact, analysts considered Mr. Moon and his party more pro-woman.)
To those critics, she is known as ''Princess Geun-hye'' for her privileged upbringing. Early this year, her estranged former spokeswoman complained of having been forced to put the hood of a raincoat over Ms. Park's head.
She also claimed that when Ms. Park was eating a hamburger, she never used her hands, relying instead on a knife and fork.
And they say her apologies for her father's cruelties came reluctantly and halfheartedly, only after she decided to run for the presidency.
''I wonder what the rest of the world will think of Korea; we now have a dictator's child as leader, both in North and South Korea,'' said Kim Min-jin, 31, an office worker in Seoul.

HEADLINE: Sleight of Hand and Illusions of the Theater

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Whether it's seducing the audience into suspending disbelief as seemingly normal folk burst into song, or, more basically, convincing us that what appears before us has some meaningful reality, theater is on some fundamental level a feat of make-believe.
So I reflected while watching ''Nothing to Hide'' at the Geffen Playhouse here in Los Angeles. This brisk hour of ingenious card trickery, performed by a pair of amiable young specialists in old-school sleight of hand, was one of three shows I caught on a trip to the West Coast, each involving make-believe of differing levels of sophistication. Also at the Geffen is Donald Margulies's ''Coney Island Christmas,'' a holiday show that wraps a story of first-generation Jewish immigrants in New York around a children's Christmas pageant: the first taste of the magical illusions of theater for many American kids. 
Most ambitious was the new musical ''Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots,'' a premiere production at the La Jolla Playhouse that supplements the musical theater's traditional arsenal of fantasy-world effects with 21st-century innovations. Directed by the rock-musical specialist Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy,'' last season's ''Jesus Christ Superstar''), this visually bewitching show was inspired by the music of the alternative-rock band Flaming Lips.
Songs from the titular album, along with others from the group's repertory, constitute the nearly sung-through score. The economical book drops us quickly into the story of a young woman, Yoshimi (the lovely Kimiko Glenn), whose boyfriend troubles fade into insignificance when she learns she has advanced aggressive lymphoma, a blood-borne cancer.
''Yoshimi,'' which ended its run on Dec. 16, aims with an impressive forthrightness to push musical theater into the age of digital technology: I kept thinking of it as a musical crossed with a gaming app. The sets, by Robert Brill, are framed in a rectangular proscenium with curved corners that expressly seems to suggest a giant iPad looming over the audience. Much of the action is staged against a stark black backdrop, necessary to disguise the mechanics behind the elaborate puppetry (by the ingenious Basil Twist), mainly involving the flying robots of the title, representing the invidious cancer cells wreaking havoc in Yoshimi's bloodstream.
The musical moves from scene to scene with a fluid swiftness that evoked the satisfying finger-swipe across the glossy surface of a tablet or a smartphone. What's more, the minimal dialogue -- much of it scary-sounding medical jargon delivered by doctors proposing different treatments -- is often typed out in frames that descend from above, suggesting a series of superalarming text messages.
Mr. McAnuff and Wayne Coyne, the band's lead singer, collaborated on the story, which is unquestionably a challenging one for musical theater. (''A New Brain,'' by William Finn, is the only musical I can recall that similarly mines a cancer diagnosis for its dramatic possibilities.) Yoshimi's symbolic battles are staged with nimble panache, with Ms. Glenn (or occasionally a dance double) engaging in martial-arts moves as Yoshimi attempts to stave off the multiplying hordes of villainous pink robots, glow-in-the-dark figures that reminded me of the 1982 Disney sci-fi movie ''Tron.''
Mr. Twist's most staggering contribution is a megarobot that towers over Yoshimi. Her adoring would-be boyfriend, the artsy, porkpie-hat-wearing Ben (Paul Nolan, latterly Jesus on Broadway, and with a reedy timbre redolent of Mr. Coyne's), disappears into this monster at one rather bewildering point in the story, for reasons I couldn't fathom. His rival for Yoshimi's affections is her current paramour, Booker (Nik Walker, with a silk-smooth voice), a stock trader who somewhat abruptly abandons Yoshimi midway through her ordeal. (Nuanced storytelling is not the show's strong suit.)
The many Flaming Lips fans in the audience at the performance I saw clearly were enraptured by the music. The group's hypnotically mellow vibe, redolent of late Beatles and maybe the funkier Grateful Dead, gradually became a little monotonous. Always pleasant and founded on sweet, unaggressive melodies, the songs struck me at times as being too laid-back for the grim story: early on, when Yoshimi suddenly collapses and must be rushed to the hospital, the crooning groove of ''Mr. Ambulance Driver'' seems an incongruous fit for the dramatic moment.
Another incongruity -- a little Jewish girl playing Jesus in her school's Christmas pageant -- is at the heart of Mr. Margulies's ''Coney Island Christmas,'' based on a short story by Grace Paley (''The Loudest Voice'') and set mostly in Depression-era Brooklyn. The New York borough is home territory for Mr. Margulies, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, who grew up there and whose plays include ''Brooklyn Boy,'' about a novelist struggling through a midlife crisis, and ''Time Stands Still,'' set in Williamsburg.
In the comparatively slight ''Coney Island Christmas,'' the young Shirley Abramowitz (a spunky Isabella Acres) is bitten by the stage bug when she plays the pivotal role of the turkey in the school's Thanksgiving production. Elated to be chosen from among her multiethnic peers to portray Jesus in the Christmas show, Shirley is dismayed when her mother (a stiff Annabelle Gurwitch) raises heated objections, seeing the notion as an offensive betrayal of the family's faith and identity. Shirley's father (the sympathetic Arye Gross) shrugs and secretly tells Shirley to go ahead -- but just don't let Mama know.
Even at 90 minutes, ''Coney Island Christmas,'' directed by Bart DeLorenzo and running through Dec. 30, feels attenuated, as well as predictable and sentimental. Much of the fun derives from watching the actors portraying Shirley's schoolmates shuffling awkwardly through their roles in the pageants: casting embarrassed or teasing glances at one another, rambling across the stage awkwardly like newborn foals, delivering their lines with zombified intonation as they stare saucer-eyed into the audience.
The actors do it all with delicious artlessness, but a little of this goes a long way. Watching the kids' inept performances is initially great fun but ultimately irritating, perhaps because the pageants take up what feels like half the show. The sweet, trifling story of Shirley's big moment onstage is also unnecessarily adorned with a contemporary framing device, in which the elderly Shirley narrates the story to her great-granddaughter (Grace Kaufman).
Playing in the Geffen's smaller theater, ''Nothing to Hide'' was a slicker, simpler and more enjoyable evening's entertainment. A popular hit that packs the small theater (by contrast, the larger Geffen space was half empty for ''Coney Island Christmas''), it has been extended through Jan. 20. Created by and starring the gifted card tricksters Derek DelGaudio and Helder Guimaraes, and written by Mr. DelGaudio, the production has an A-list Hollywood name below the title in its director, Neil Patrick Harris.
Although he is best known as a television star and recently as an impish television awards show host, Mr. Harris is also a longtime magic nerd. You probably didn't know that he is president of the Academy of Magical Arts at the Magic Castle, a private club for enthusiasts in the Hollywood Hills. (You probably didn't know such a title existed.)
Dressed in neat gray suits, Mr. DelGaudio and Mr. Guimares perform an hour's worth of card tricks that left me in the proper dumbfounded state: the harder you try to fathom where those cards are coming from, and where they're going, the more these engaging performers' ingenuity leaves you baffled.
Describing the specifics of such feats is a pointless enterprise, like trying to translate into language the experience of riding a roller coaster. So I won't bother, except to note that under Mr. Harris's direction, these two keep ratcheting up the level of difficulty, even as they employ a naturally modest, self-mocking style that's nicely in contrast to the brilliance of their illusions. (The slightly plump Mr. DelGaudio jokingly compares himself to the doughy mascot of the Bob's Big Boyburger chain.)
Their easy rapport with the spectators blew right past my usual allergy to audience participation. And while you might suspect that some of the participants are plants, I can attest that at least one wasn't, and I've still got the five of clubs to prove it.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Deadline For Tax Increases Nears

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Wednesday, as President Obama and Republicans in Congress criticized each other and a deadline to avoid tax increases and government spending cuts drew closer.
General Motors stock surged after the government announced plans to sell its ownership stake in the company. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 98.99 points, or 0.7 percent, at 13,251.97. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,435.81. The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.17, or 0.3 percent, to 3,044.36.
Mr. Obama said that he and the House Speaker, John Boehner, were ''pretty close'' to a deal to avoid the tax increases and spending cuts, a combination known as the fiscal cliff. The two sides have exchanged proposals this week.
But the president also said that Congressional Republicans kept finding ''ways to say no as opposed to finding ways to say yes.'' He said the nation deserved a compromise after the Connecticut school shooting.
Mr. Boehner, speaking to reporters for less than a minute and in a defiant tone, called on Mr. Obama to offer a deficit-cutting plan balanced between spending cuts and tax increases.
He predicted that the House would pass his backup plan, which calls for extending decade-old tax cuts for Americans making less than $1 million a year. The White House has rejected that plan.
The S.& P. 500-stock index had gained more than 2 percent over the previous two days in part because of optimism about a deal taking shape. The optimism seemed to melt on Wednesday and stocks finished near their lows for the day.
G.M. soared $1.69, or 6.6 percent, to $27.18 after the company said it would spend $5.5 billion to buy 200 million shares of its own stock back from the government.
The government pledged to sell the other 300 million G.M. shares it owns on the open market and dispose of its entire ownership stake in 12 to 15 months. The government bought G.M. stock as part of a 2009 bailout.
United States builders broke ground on fewer homes in November after starting work in October at the fastest rate in four years. Hurricane Sandy probably distorted the totals in the Northeast.
The Commerce Department said builders began construction of houses and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 861,000. That was 3 percent less than October's annual rate of 888,000, the fastest since July 2008.
Materials stocks fell 0.5 percent, less than the rest of the market. Industrials fell 0.7 percent. Elsewhere on Wall Street, telecommunications stocks, down 1.2 percent, and health care stocks, down 1.1 percent, fared the worst.
Interest rates were lower. Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 98 12/32 and the yield fell to 1.81 percent from 1.82 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: International Units Help Lift Income at General Mills

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
General Mills said on Wednesday that its newly acquired international businesses helped lift its net income by 22 percent in the second quarter. The company, however, raised its profit outlook only modestly for the year, citing a challenging economic environment. 
The company, whose brands include Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Hamburger Helper, said on Wednesday that the addition of Yoplait Canada and Yoki Alimentos, a Brazilian food company, were among the biggest drivers for a 6 percent increase in sales for the quarter. And although revenue in its organic and natural foods segment in the United States also rose, sales for its flagship cereal unit fell 2 percent and yogurt sales dropped 5 percent.
The company noted that it had a spate of new products and marketing planned for the second half of 2013. In yogurt, the company is planning new flavors for a 100-calorie version of its Yoplait Greek yogurt, a line that was introduced this summer. Executives also said that the decline in the quarter was an improvement from the 10 percent drop in the previous quarter.
For the three months that ended Nov. 25, the company earned $541.6 million, or 82 cents a share. That compares with $444.8 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Not including one-time items, the company said it earned 86 cents a share.
Total revenue rose 6 percent to $4.88 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of 79 cents a share on revenue of $4.88 billion, according to FactSet.
In the back half of the year, the company expects to face a higher tax rate and a 2 to 3 percent rise in costs for ingredients. General Mills now expects to earn $2.65 to $2.67 a share for the year, excluding one-time items. It previously forecast $2.65 a share.
In the United States retail segment, General Mills said sales rose 2 percent primarily as a result of gains in its snack, Small Planet organic and natural foods and meals division. Its international division rose 19 percent, reflecting the addition of Yoki and Yoplait Canada.
Shares of General Mills fell 50 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $41.27.

HEADLINE: Ireland Passes Law to Bolster Housing

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Ireland's Parliament passed a sweeping new law on Wednesday that could let thousands of borrowers reduce the amounts they owe on their mortgages.
The impact of the so-called personal insolvency bill, which overhauls several aspects of Ireland's consumer debt laws, will be closely watched in other countries still grappling with housing busts. 
The bill contains a groundbreaking measure that would let stressed borrowers work with their banks to write down the value of their mortgages. The intent is to make the loans more affordable and avoid a wave of foreclosures.
In America and Europe, officials have generally shied away from policies that would make mortgage write-downs a major part of efforts to clean up their housing messes.
In a news release, Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality, which handled the legislation, said the bill was "a fundamental part of the government's strategy to return this country to stability and economic growth."
The department acknowledged that the part of the bill that could lead to write-downs was unorthodox, saying it introduced "a concept unique in international insolvency law."
The law, however, may not translate that readily to the United States.
There have been very few foreclosures in Ireland. The government owns large stakes in the biggest mortgage banks, and officials instructed the banks to refrain from repossessing large numbers of homes. As a result, uncertainty hangs over struggling households and weighs on the banks. The new bill aims to resolve that limbo.
Banks are expected to work with borrowers to make their mortgages payable. Where deals are possible, the borrower and the bank will be on a much more certain footing. Where there is too much debt, the banks will have more leeway to foreclose.
Nearly 18 percent of Irish mortgages on first homes were in default at the end of September, according to the Central Bank of Ireland. Ireland has nearly $150 billion of mortgage debt on first homes. Defaults are also high on mortgages taken out on investment properties, a big part of Ireland's housing market.
Though the new law was constructed carefully to avoid unintended circumstances, it still carries significant risks.
It could prompt borrowers to default even if they can afford to repay the loan. That could lead to unexpected losses for Ireland's banks, which could undermine their ability to finance a recovery. In a letter in September, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, expressed concern about the potential costs the bill could place on Ireland's banks.
The banks could still decline mortgage write-downs even when they may help borrowers. As the law is written, a majority of creditors have to agree to a write-down. Consumer advocates have criticized this part of the bill, saying it tips the balance of power in favor of the banks.
Alan Shatter, Ireland's minister of justice, responded to those concerns on Wednesday. In the department's news release, he said, "The reality is that it is in the best interests of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Consequences in a Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Timothy L. Firestine, the top government administrator in Montgomery County, Md., is crunching numbers in his battle to preserve the hallowed tax exemption on municipal bonds.
The average annual property tax bill in his affluent suburban Washington county would ultimately rise by at least $100, he estimates, as a consequence of a proposal by the Obama administration to modestly tax the interest that wealthy investors receive from municipal bonds. That's because, he says, if investors see less of a tax break, they will demand higher interest to make up the loss, and higher interest rates will mean higher borrowing costs for governments.
Mr. Firestine is on the front lines of a lobbying campaign by local and state governments, bond dealers, insurers and underwriters that is trying to pre-empt any attempt to limit or even kill the tax exemption. The administration has proposed capping the tax break that America's highest earners now receive from municipal bonds, as part of its campaign to close loopholes and enlist more of the rich in fighting the federal deficit. Analysts expect such a cap to be part of a comprehensive tax overhaul package that Congress will take up next year, under a broad fiscal framework now being negotiated by President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner. 
''This is the most serious threat to tax-exempt bonds since Roosevelt, in the late 1930s, tried to repeal the exemption across the board,'' said John L. Buckley, a professor of taxation at Georgetown University and former chief counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee.
At present, the federal government forgoes about $32 billion a year in taxes by exempting the interest that investors earn from municipal bonds.
A wealthy couple in the highest tax bracket who receive $100,000 a year in municipal bond interest currently pay tax on none of it, effectively lowering their total tax bill by $35,000 under the current rates. But under the administration proposal to limit tax breaks for households whose taxable income is more than $250,000, the same couple would see the savings on their tax bill reduced to $28,000, effectively resulting in a $7,000 tax payment. (People in lower tax brackets would not be affected by the change.)
There are other proposals for taxing muni interest. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, known as the Simpson-Bowles commission, has suggested taxing all municipal bond interest, not just the interest paid to people in the top bracket. Other experts have suggested taking the exemption away from municipal bonds that raise money for business, while still allowing it for bonds that finance public works.
Mr. Firestine, the president-elect of the Government Finance Officers Association, has been following developments, through conference calls arranged by the White House, and calling members of Congress.
Officials of some other government groups, like the New York City Housing Development Corporation, have formed a coalition with Wall Street groups like the Bond Dealers of America to lobby on the issue. But there is the sense of an uphill battle. Last week, Mr. Boehner said he accepted Mr. Obama's proposal to limit various tax deductions and exemptions to the value now received by people in the 28 percent bracket. By implication, that includes municipal bonds.
President Obama's proposal would not ''grandfather'' existing bonds, but would apply to all of the $3.7 trillion worth of municipal bonds now outstanding, most of them held by individual investors, directly or through mutual funds.
High-bracket investors who hold them would have to start paying an effective tax of 7 percent of the interest -- or even more if the highest tax bracket increases from the current 35 percent.
''This would be the first time that a tax law has affected existing debt,'' said Chris Mauro, head of municipal bond strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
Investors are anxious because they bought the bonds, often issued for 20 to 30 years, in the expectation that they would be tax-exempt until maturity.
''The issue of grandfathering is really the big question,'' said Mr. Mauro. ''If it's just new bonds, the municipal market can sort of deal with it. But if the entire market, on a retroactive basis, is affected, you'd have dislocations. Prices would have to adjust on all outstanding bonds to make up for the loss associated with the taxability.''
In other words, the value of the bonds now owned by investors would fall.
The tax exemption is thought to help states and local governments market their bonds, lowering their borrowing costs. But some fiscal analysts say that an undue share of the exemption's value goes not to local governments, but to the wealthiest bond buyers instead.
There are not enough investors in the highest tax bracket to buy all the municipal bonds as they come to market, Mr. Buckley said.
So underwriters price them at a deeper discount to make them attractive to investors in the second-highest bracket, currently 28 percent. That enlarges the pool of buyers and gets all the bonds sold quickly, but for a lower price than people in the 35 percent bracket would probably have been willing to pay.
''That means the people in the 35 percent bracket are getting a big windfall,'' in the form of an underpriced bond, ''while the people in the 28 percent bracket are just getting a good deal,'' Mr. Buckley said.
It is that advantage that the Obama administration now proposes to tax. Some muni experts say the administration's pricing analysis is flawed, and that it overstates any windfall.
At the local level, where tax-exempt municipal bonds are the tool of choice for financing public works, officials are not generally focused on the intricacies of bond pricing. They are busy fighting their own budget deficits and view a potential fiscal gain for the federal government as a likely loss for them.
Mr. Firestine said that Montgomery County currently had about $2.1 billion of general-obligation bonds outstanding, on which it pays interest of $93 million a year.
Capping the tax exemption would cause high-bracket taxpayers to look for higher-yielding investments, he said, and the county would have to offer more interest to lure them back. He says he thinks the county's annual outlays for interest could rise to $135 million, which is why property taxes could rise by $100.
That may not sound like much in a prosperous county with an average property tax bill of $4,250. But Mr. Firestine said any property tax increase was a hard sell these days, when real estate assessments have been declining and the county has had to lay off employees.
''The burden,'' he said, ''will be transferred to the property tax.''

HEADLINE: Struggling to Go On After a Son's Death

BYLINE: By ELISA MALA

 BODY:
To enter the apartment of Kendrick Moore and Carol Bowman-Moore in the Alphabet City neighborhood in Lower Manhattan is to be greeted by a ghost. Not far from the doorway is a table adorned with dozens of photos that preserve Shytik Bowman, killed last year, as he will always be remembered: a charismatic young man a few weeks shy of 18 with more than a passing resemblance to the singer Chris Brown.
When Shytik was 15, he was placed on probation after getting into a fight with a boy over a motor scooter. When Shytik brought a gun to his high school a year later, he was given a 10-month sentence in a juvenile detention center. Shytik entered Lasting Investments in Neighborhood Connections, a juvenile justice re-entry and life coaching program run by the Children's Aid Society. 
''Ever since he got into the program, there was a big change in him,'' said Mr. Moore, 45, his stepfather. ''But it was a change for the good.''As part of the program, Shytik helped paint a mural at the UBS bank building on Avenue of the Americas. He was in training to be a lifeguard. And he had reconnected with his biological father, who had been absent for part of his childhood.
But while visiting an aunt and cousins on Staten Island in August 2011, he ducked out to go to the store. His aunt, Crystal Lacroix, remembers what sounded like firecrackers going off in the distance.
Instead, they were the gunshots that killed Shytik; he had been robbed of a bracelet. ''It destroyed the whole family for the rest of our lives,'' Ms. Lacroix said. A suspect was arrested and is expected to be tried early next year.
When Shytik died, the family was already experiencing money problems. Mr. Moore had lost his job as a manager in finance at Thomson Reuters and Mrs. Bowman-Moore, now 35, had left her position as a home health aide, and they had fallen behind on rent.
For months, Mr. Moore searched for a new job. He said his bachelor's degree from Medgar Evers College seemed to make little difference during the hunt. ''Someone else has a better degree,'' he said. But the family persevered, caring for their other children, daughters Monday, 11; Aleyah, 7; Anayah, 4; and Atayah, 20 months.
The family began receiving a small amount in unemployment benefits, but the bills continued to mount. The family had to pay $800 of the more than $6,000 cost of the funeral.
They obtained basic health insurance through Medicaid and stretched the monthly allotment of food stamps, about $600, to feed their family. But the family faced possible eviction after the rent fell more than $3,000 in arrears.
The Moores eventually received help with rent from the Legal Aid Society, but still had other expenses to cover. During the past year and a half, the Children's Aid Society, one of the agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provided small grants from the fund totaling $1,450 to buy food and clothing.
Being alleviated of the constant financial pressure, even for a few months, gave them the time to bond with relatives. ''People congregated, and they came over,'' Mr. Moore said, which proved enormously helpful in allowing the family to grieve.
The tough times may be easing a bit. Mr. Moore has found work, as a telephone consultant at a health insurance company. Mrs. Bowman-Moore plans to stay home with the children for another year before returning to her work.
Their loss is never far away, though. A memorial near the family's doorway provides Mrs. Bowman-Moore some solace. ''Every morning,'' she said, ''I wake up and I look at my son's picture and say, 'Mommy loves you. Mommy misses you.' ''
HOW TO HELP: The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has begun a special campaign to raise money in support of Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in the New York metropolitan area. This campaign will run with the Neediest Cases Fund annual campaign.

HEADLINE: The N.R.A. Protection Racket

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. PAINTER. 
Richard W. Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota, was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007.

 BODY:
Edina, Minn.
FOR years, protection rackets dominated dangerous urban neighborhoods. Shop owners and residents lived in relative security only by paying off or paying homage to organized criminals or corrupt cops. Anyone who dared to stand up to these ''protectors'' would not be around for long.
The Republican Party -- once a proud bastion of civic and business leaders who battled Southern racism, Northern corruption and the evils of big government -- has for the past several decades been itself the victim of political protection rackets. These rackets are orchestrated by fringe groups with extremist views on social issues, which Republican politicians are forced to support even if they are unpopular with intelligent, economically successful and especially female voters. Their influence was already clear by the time I joined the Bush White House staff in 2005, and it has only increased in the years since. 
The most blatant protection racket is orchestrated by the National Rifle Association, which is ruthless against candidates who are tempted to stray from its view that all gun regulations are pure evil. Debra Maggart, a Republican leader in the Tennessee House of Representatives, was one of its most recent victims. The N.R.A. spent around $100,000 to defeat her in the primary, because she would not support a bill that would have allowed people to keep guns locked in their cars on private property without the property owner's consent.
The message to Republicans is clear: ''We will help you get elected and protect your seat from Democrats. We will spend millions on ads that make your opponent look worse than the average holdup man robbing a liquor store. In return, we expect you to oppose any laws that regulate guns. These include laws requiring handgun registration, meaningful background checks on purchasers, limiting the right to carry concealed weapons, limiting access to semiautomatic weapons or anything else that would diminish the firepower available to anybody who wants it. And if you don't comply, we will load our weapons and direct everything in our arsenal at you in the next Republican primary.''
For decades, Republican politicians have gone along with this racket, some willingly and others because they know that resisting would be pointless. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the N.R.A. spent almost $19 million in the last federal election cycle. This money is not just spent to beat Democrats but also to beat Republicans who don't toe the line.
But the last election showed the costs to Republicans of succumbing to the N.R.A. and to other groups with extremist views on issues like homosexuality and stem cell research. The fringe groups, drenched with money and the ''free speech'' that comes with it, have stood firm, and become even more radical, as the population as a whole -- including many traditional Republican voters -- has moved in the opposite direction.
Gun violence in particular frightens voters in middle- and upper-income suburbs across the country, places like my hometown, Edina, Minn. These areas, once Republican strongholds, still have many voters who are sympathetic to the economic platform of the Republican Party but are increasingly worried about their own safety in a country with millions of unregistered and unregulated guns. Some suburban voters may keep a hunting rifle locked away in a safe place, but few want people bringing semiautomatic weapons into their neighborhoods. They also believe that insane people should not have access to guns.
A few clicks on the N.R.A. Web site lead you to the type of weapons the group wants to protect from regulation. Many are not needed for hunting pheasants or deer. They are used for hunting people. They have firepower unimaginable to the founding fathers who drafted the Second Amendment, firepower that could wipe out an entire kindergarten classroom in a few minutes, as we saw so tragically last week.
This is not the vision of sportsmanship that soccer moms and dads want or will vote for, and they will turn against Republicans because of it. Who worries about the inheritance tax when gun violence may kill off one's heirs in the second grade?
Republican politicians must free themselves from the N.R.A. protection racket and others like it. For starters, the party establishment should refuse to endorse anyone who runs in a primary with N.R.A. money against a sitting Republican. If the establishment refuses to support Republicans using other Republicans for target practice, the N.R.A. will take its shooting game somewhere else.
Reasonable gun control legislation will then be able to pass Congress and the state legislatures. Next, Republicans should embrace legislation like the proposed American Anti-Corruption Act, which would rid both parties of their dependence on big money from groups like the N.R.A. The Republican Party will once again be proud to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. And voters will go back to feeling that their children are safe, their democracy works, and they will once again consider voting Republican.

HEADLINE: A Liberal Arts Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Florida is the latest state to propose offering incentives for college students toward ''high demand'' majors, including STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and health care fields (''To Steer Students Toward Jobs, Florida May Cut Tuition for Select Majors,'' news article, Dec. 10). 
This makes sense, particularly for businesses struggling to find employees with the skills to succeed in today's high-tech economy. But American competitiveness also depends on students' acquiring a wide range of general knowledge that provides critical thinking and communication skills that will enable graduates to take up new jobs -- jobs that we can't imagine today.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average person held 11 different jobs between ages 18 and 46. Employer surveys, moreover, show that graduates lack basic competencies that a liberal arts education provides.
Gov. Rick Scott is correct: Florida's higher education needs reform. However, the push for vocation-specific majors should not absolve education leaders from the obligation of ensuring a rigorous liberal arts foundation.

HEADLINE: Alex Moulton Dies at 92; Created Small-Wheeled Bike

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Alex Moulton, a British automotive engineer who created a small-wheeled bicycle that fired a trend in the 1960s and became the forerunner of the collapsible, portable bikes of today, died on Dec. 9 in Bath, England. He was 92.
His death was confirmed by his grandnephew Shaun Moulton, the chief executive of the Moulton Bicycle Company, which Alex Moulton founded and which still makes by hand bicycles based on his original design in Bradford-on-Avon, where Mr. Moulton lived. 
Mr. Moulton, who had made a number of innovations in automobile suspension systems, began toying with a small-wheel design for an adult bicycle in the late 1950s. His interest was partly spurred by gasoline rationing in Britain during the Suez crisis, which began when Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, an act that threatened to halt oil shipments to Western Europe from the Persian Gulf.
But the design was also fostered by his own engineer's determination to make things better: ''The Moulton bicycle was born out of my resolve to challenge and improve upon the classic bicycle,'' he said.
His idea was to create a more efficient, all-purpose vehicle, suitable for errands and commuting at least as much as for recreation. He wanted it to have substantial carrying capacity, to be maneuverable in traffic, to roll smoothly and to be pedaled easily.
He came up with a bike with wheels 16 inches in diameter, high-pressure tires for minimum rolling resistance, front and rear rubber suspension systems for smooth riding on potholed or cobblestoned roads, and a step-through frame (that is, without the top tube of the traditional diamond-shaped frame) for easy dismounting (and more suitable for women wearing skirts). The small wheels left plenty of room for carrying briefcases, shopping bags or overnight luggage.
A few of the early bikes could easily be taken apart for convenient stowing, though they were not really foldable. ''Alex's bicycles are an alternative to a conventional, diamond-framed performance road bike, so no compromise by adding a hinge,'' Shaun Moulton wrote in an e-mail. Still, the small-wheel collapsible bikes of today owe a debt to the original Moulton.
Mr. Moulton completed the prototype in 1959 and offered to license it to the Raleigh bicycle company. When it turned him down, he began making them himself, introducing the bicycle at a London bicycle fair in 1962 and founding the Moulton Bicycle Company in Bradford-on-Avon in 1964.
The bicycles immediately took hold in 1960s Britain, where, because of their quirkiness and convenience, they became ''seen as a fashionable minibike,'' as the company says on its Web site, ''to go with miniskirts and mini cars.''
They were less popular in the United States, where the Huffman Manufacturing Company in Dayton, Ohio, began making them in 1965.
Life magazine referred to Mr. Moulton's invention as ''the first basic advance in bicycle design in 70 years,'' and the Raleigh company, after creating a competing design of its own and then scrapping it, eventually approached Mr. Moulton to acquire the rights it had failed to secure years earlier. Raleigh manufactured the Moulton bicycle from 1967 to 1974.
Alexander Eric Moulton was born on April 9, 1920, in Stratford-on-Avon. His great-grandfather founded a rubber company. His father, John Coney Moulton, was a zoologist and British army officer who spent years in Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, where he was curator of the Sarawak Museum and became chief secretary to the white rajah, Charles Brooke, Sarawak's head of state. John Moulton died when his son Alex was 5 or 6, leaving him to be raised by his mother, Beryl, and her family.
Alex Moulton graduated in engineering from Cambridge. During World War II he worked at the Bristol Aeroplane Company as the assistant to the company's chief engineer, a leading designer of aircraft engines. After the war he joined the family rubber business, Spencer Moulton and Company, and established a research department specializing in automobile suspension systems.
Mr. Moulton made his innovations in suspension systems using rubber cones instead of the coil or leaf springs that had been standard. Working with Sir Alec Issigonis, developer of the British Motor Company's popular economy car, the Mini, Mr. Moulton created a space-efficient system known as the Hydrolastic suspension.
It was incorporated in a number of cars made by B.M.C. and its successors, including the Mini, the Austin 1800 and the MG 1100. A next-generation suspension system, known as Hydragas and also a product of Mr. Moulton's work, was used on many other cars, including the Austin Allegro, a small family car; and a sports car, the MG F.
Spencer Moulton and Company was sold in the late 1950s, and Mr. Moulton founded his own design firm, Moulton Developments Limited. He never married and leaves no immediate survivors.
''Having spent most of my life involved in automotive engineering, I find it interesting to reflect that the automobile, with all its convenience of use and fascination to the engineer, was an inevitable evolution from the horse-drawn chariot; whereas the bicycle, with its human propulsion and single track, is an extraordinary and unlikely device to have been created!'' Mr. Moulton wrote in the mid-1990s, in a pamphlet titled ''The Moulton Bicycle: The World's Most Efficient Form of Transport.''
''The contrast in the activity of motoring and cycling could not be more profound,'' he continued. ''The driver, who sits in a low, enclosed, air-conditioned environment or 'cage,' is only sensually and nervously involved and is isolated from the surroundings; whereas the cyclist, with a high sightline and in the open air, is physically involved, and proceeds in that miraculous way entirely by his or her own effort of health-giving exercise, with nervous relaxation and spiritual uplift even!''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Benefit Raises $50 Million

BYLINE: By JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR.

 BODY:
The 12-12-12 benefit concert at Madison Square Garden last week has raised about $50 million for people affected by Hurricane Sandy, the producers announced on Tuesday night. They said that they expected more money to flow in over the coming weeks from the sales of albums, merchandise and more donations, and that the first $50 million in aid would be distributed immediately.
With a lineup featuring stars like Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney, the event raised more than was collected during the Concert for New York, a similar show staged by the same producers after the Sept. 11 attacks. (That show brought in $35 million -- adjusted for inflation, the equivalent of about $45 million today.) 
But the benefit's tally fell short of other recent telethon-style fund-raisers, like the Hope for Haiti concert that was broadcast on MTV in January 2010, which raised about $61 million. It also did not exceed the $55 million gathered in 1985 (about $118 million in 2012 dollars) for famine victims at the Live Aid concerts, according to BBC news. Those concerts drew tens of thousands of fans to stadiums in London and Philadelphia.
David Saltzman, the executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, said the money would be distributed to about 140 groups that are providing aid to people whose homes and businesses were destroyed when Hurricane Sandy swept through the region in late October. Among other things, those groups have been providing hot meals to people in devastated areas, legal and psychological counseling to storm victims, cash grants to college students unable to pay their bills and home furnishings to people whose houses were destroyed.
"Our hope is that Robin Hood will continue to put boots on the ground in the hardest hit communities, to get people what they need now," Mr. Saltzman said.
The concert was marred by reports that thousands of tickets were resold for a profit on StubHub, the ticket resale site. StubHub donated its fees from these sales -- about $1 million -- to the Robin Hood Relief Fund, but it appears most of the profits from those secondary sales went into the pockets of professional ticket brokers and individuals, rather than to the charity, said Glenn Lehrman, a StubHub spokesman.
Since Stubhub charges a 25 percent fee, the total cost of the tickets sold on the resale site is estimated to be about $4 million. The tickets were listed for many times their face value, prompting some calls in Albany for a ban on reselling tickets to charitable events.
The large number of tickets that were resold for profit also drew fire from the concert's producers -- James Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company; John Sykes, the president of Clear Channel Entertainment Enterprises; and the filmmaker Harvey Weinstein.
Mr. Saltzman said about $30 million of the total had come from the initial sale of 13,500 tickets and donations from corporate sponsors, chief among them J.P. Morgan Chase & Company, which also underwrote the production costs.
The rest of the proceeds -- some $20 million -- flowed in from other sources: donations given over the telephone, online donations to Robin Hood and the sale of merchandise.
The charity is also receiving money from the sale of an album of the concert, which has been distributed by Columbia Records. That recording was listed at No. 3 on the iTunes album chart on Tuesday afternoon.
Funds are also being raised through an auction of memorabilia from the show, mostly instruments and clothing signed by the celebrities who took part. A Fender bass autographed by Mr. McCartney, Mr. Springsteen, Roger Daltrey and several other rock figures was being auctioned for more than $40,000. The drumsticks used by Dave Grohl during his appearance are being sold for more than $6,000.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Battlefront In the Front Yard

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
JASON HELVENSTON was at work on his second crop, spreading compost to fertilize the carrots, bok choy, kale and dozens of other vegetables he grows organically on his property in Orlando, Fla., when the trouble began.
Mr. Helvenston spent last Super Bowl Sunday planting the garden outside his 1940s cottage, in a neighborhood of modest houses close to downtown. Orlando's growing season is nearly year-round, and Mr. Helvenston, a self-employed sustainability consultant for the building trade, said he saw the garden as ''a budget thing'' -- a money-saving supplement to the chicken coop he and his wife, Jennifer, installed a few months later behind their house.
Since his backyard doesn't get much sun, Mr. Helvenston ripped out the lawn in his front yard and put the 25-by-25-foot, micro-irrigated plot there. The unorthodox landscaping went largely unnoticed for months, perhaps because he lives on a dead-end street next to Interstate 4.
Then, in September, Pedro Padin, who lives in Puerto Rico but owns the rental property next door, visited with his wife and cast a displeasing eye on his neighbor's front yard. ''All the houses are pretty much kept neat,'' Mr. Padin said, ''but his house looks like a farm.'' 
Mr. Padin contacted the city, which cited the Helvenstons for violating section 60.207 of Orlando's Land Development Code (failure to maintain ground cover on property) and set a deadline of Nov. 7 to comply.
Instead, Mr. Helvenston stood outside his polling site during the last election circulating a petition to change the current code, and then appeared on a local TV news station, telling the reporter and any city officials who happened to be watching, ''You'll take my house before you take my vegetable garden.''
Gardeners aren't generally known for their civil disobedience, yet in the last couple of years several have run afoul of local officials for tending vegetables in their front yards. In Ferguson, Mo., a stay-at-home father was ordered to dig up his 55 varieties of edible plants. In Tulsa, Okla., a gardener who didn't want to remove her veggies and medicinal herbs saw them largely cleared by the city. In Oak Park, Mich., a mother of six named Julie Bass faced up to 93 days in jail for refusing to take out the raised beds in front of her home and plant what the city deemed ''suitable'' ground cover.
These and other cases have drawn national attention, as well as outrage from gardeners, some of whom have begun referring to the isolated skirmishes as a broader ''war on gardens.''
Roger Doiron, the founder and director of Kitchen Gardeners International, a group promoting food gardens, has marshaled support for Ms. Bass and others. ''If you define a war as a struggle between opposing forces, this does fit the bill,'' he said. The opposing forces, in Mr. Doiron's view, are progressive-minded gardeners and backward-thinking municipalities. Gardeners, he said, ''need to push back. This isn't about a single garden; this is about the right to garden.''
Though rooted in something as innocuous as vegetables, these disputes touch on divisive issues like homeowner rights, property values, sustainability, food integrity and the aesthetics of the traditional American lawn. Ecologists and libertarians alike have gotten into the debate, the latter asserting that the codification of gardens is just one more way the government tells people how to live.
Jeff Rowes, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm based in Arlington, Va., that is advising Mr. Helvenston, is adamant. ''It's the micromanagement of land that invades your liberty in a thousand small ways,'' he said.
Invoking the nation's agrarian past, Mr. Rowes noted, ''Washington, Jefferson and Madison were all farmers.''
For Mr. Padin, the issue is less about the inalienable right to grow snap peas at home than it is about the prerogative to not stand idly by while your property value plummets. Mr. Helvenston's garden is ''messy,'' Mr. Padin said, and will attract rats and lower the worth of his rental home. Mr. Padin also questioned Mr. Helvenston's commitment to maintaining the mulch-covered plot.
Mr. Helvenston, who is 40 and wears his hair in the same receding-ponytail style as the martial arts actor Steven Seagal, said that his green thumb isn't a whim but a financial necessity. Anyone who is going to remove his family's garden, he told a reporter by phone, ''might as well kick down our door, steal food from our table and take off.''
Ms. Helvenston took the phone from her husband. ''We want to be sustainable,'' she said.
Mr. Helvenston, who has begun referring to his yard as a ''patriot garden,'' an overt reference to the Victory Gardens planted during World War II, got back on the line, expressing disbelief at the response by Mr. Padin and the city of Orlando: ''Who doesn't like a garden? It's like punching a baby.''
THE neatly manicured lawn was imported from England, and has been like a civic religion in the United States since the early 20th century. The desire to make your neighbor's yard conform apparently goes back even farther. In her book ''The Lawn: A History of an American Obsession,'' Virginia Scott Jenkins quotes the horticulture writer Peter Henderson, who in 1875 disparaged homeowners who let their grass grow wild and vowed that ''the majority will soon shame them into decency.'' If Mr. Henderson were alive today, he might be pleased to discover that Americans spend an estimated $30 billion annually on lawn care and divert rivers so those in arid places like Phoenix can spend their Saturdays behind a mower, too.
But in recent years, water shortages and growing interest in sustainability have given rise to an alternate view of the lawn. Food Not Lawns, an environmental group, advocates abolishing ornamental grasses in favor of edible gardens, while the National Wildlife Federation sponsors a program for homeowners interested in creating wildlife habitats in their yards. The transformation can start with something as minimal as adding flowers that attract migratory butterflies or be as ambitious as cultivating a wild landscape of Dr. Dolittle proportions, said David Mizejewski, a spokesman for the National Wildlife Federation.
''There's a movement of turning conventional suburban yards into more productive spaces,'' Mr. Mizejewski said. His organization has certified about 131,000 wildlife habitats since 2000, he said, almost seven times the number registered during the program's previous 27 years.
As Amy Stewart of the blog Garden Rant put it, ''People are going native.''
If that's true, someone should inform local municipalities, many of which have spent the last 50 years drafting increasingly restrictive codes governing their residents' landscaping choices. Orlando's code, for instance, specifies that planted shrubs ''shall be a minimum of 24 inches in height'' and ''spaced not more than 36 inches apart,'' while berms ''shall not exceed a slope of 3:1.'' The code goes on to list no less than 295 approved and prohibited species.
Opponents like Mr. Rowes argue that such strict rules are fine when instituted by homeowners associations, where residents ''go in with their eyes wide open,'' but codification of a homeowner's landscaping by local governments can be ''oppressive.''
Jon Ippel, sustainability director for the city of Orlando, said the list of approved and prohibited plantings is intended to create permanent landscaping that survives Florida climate and keeps out invasive species. As for the enforced homogeneity, Mr. Ippel said, the code was written in 1991 and reflects an era when ''the aesthetic was more of a formalized thing. Organic, natural planting was out of vogue.'' The garden sharing program run by the city of Santa Monica, Calif., where residents are permitted -- even encouraged -- to plant front-yard gardens, turns out to be the exception, not the rule.
City officials frequently cite public health and safety as the main reasons for zoning codes, but the underlying driver is often real estate. John Shaw, the city manager in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, said of zoning codes, ''At the end of the day, they're there to protect homeowners and to protect their property value.''
Last summer, after Karl Tricamo, the stay-at-home father in Ferguson, was informed that his front-yard garden was in violation, he challenged the city and won a ruling from the Board of Adjustment that allowed him to keep his veggies.
Mr. Shaw cited the city's ''Live Well Ferguson'' program as an example of its progressive attitude toward healthy practices like gardening. It is the residents, he added, who are often in favor of restrictive landscaping codes. ''Some of the largest volume of calls we get are complaints about property conditions,'' he said.
In many communities where gardeners face fines, including Orlando and Ferguson, code enforcement officials didn't initially go after the person planting vegetables in the front yard. It wasn't until one or more neighbors complained that the city responded by following the law as currently set forth. Much like the chicken coops that popped up in suburban backyards a few years ago, front-yard gardens weren't an issue until they suddenly became one.
Faced with residents who are adapting to what they perceive as new economic and environmental realities, in ways that don't always fit the current laws or aesthetic norms, many communities have been caught off guard. Mr. Shaw said flatly, ''We weren't ready for this.''
Mr. Doiron, the gardening activist, believes change will come slowly to the traditional lawn, and with resistance from local officials. ''We're going to pull them kicking and screaming into the 21st century if we have to,'' he said.
IF there's a Norma Rae in the war on gardens, a public face the movement has coalesced around, it's Julie Bass, the 43-year-old Michigan mother who faced jail time for tending a front-yard garden. But as Ms. Bass tells it, she was an accidental scofflaw.
When the roots of a tree planted by the city of Oak Park cracked her sewer line two summers ago, Ms. Bass had to dig up her front lawn. She hadn't been opposed to grass, or very eco-conscious for that matter, but replanting ''a green carpet of nothing,'' she said, seemed like a waste of money. Instead, she and her husband hired a carpenter to build and install five large raised garden beds that covered the yard in front of their small brick house in the inner suburb of Detroit.
First, however, she checked with officials in Oak Park, and discovered the code was vague in regard to front-yard gardens. She went ahead anyway. Soon she received warnings and then a letter from the city, citing her under the blight ordinance for failing to have ''grass, shrubbery or other suitable live plant material'' in her front yard.
Ms. Bass decided to keep her garden and consulted a lawyer, who told her she faced up to 93 days in prison if found guilty, a startling possibility she noted on her new blog, oakparkhatesveggies. ''That's when everything went viral,'' she said.
Eugene Lumberg, the prosecuting attorney for the city in the case, said the chances of Ms. Bass's going to jail were ''nil to none.'' Still, he said, under the city's laws, violating the zoning ordinance was a criminal misdemeanor, not to mention an unattractive addition to the streetscape. ''We're a city of neat, manicured lawns,'' Mr. Lumberg said, expressing disapproval over the expected tangle of tomato vines and adding that ''nothing destroys a neighborhood faster'' than shabby-looking homes.
Ms. Bass said she came to see herself as a champion for gardeners' rights, especially after her case attracted media attention and support worldwide. ''I felt like if I don't stand up to this petty tyranny,'' she said, ''it gives the city carte blanche to walk all over anyone.''
But the city saw an important principle at stake, too: maintaining the delicate balance of comity between neighbors. Individual property rights aren't absolute, Mr. Lumberg argued. ''What if I decide to leave my garbage out for a week before pickup day?'' he said. ''People say, 'This is America. It's my garbage and my property.' Where does it stop?''
Mr. Rowes, the lawyer advising Mr. Helvenston, agrees with that argument, up to a point. ''The government gets to draw lines'' for the public good, he said, acknowledging that concerns over property values are legitimate and citing as an example of objectionable behavior a homeowner's burning noxious substances. But with respect to a front-yard garden, he said, ''we don't need to make an aesthetic judgment.''
The city of Oak Park was flooded with angry calls and e-mails. But, as Mr. Lumberg pointed out, the great majority of Ms. Bass's supporters weren't her neighbors. ''If you don't live next door to it,'' he said, ''your thinking is different.''
In a Clintonian echo, Ms. Bass's case hinged on parsing how one defines ''suitable'' plant material. In interviews with the media, a city official argued that suitable meant commonly seen in the community, so a front-yard vegetable garden didn't qualify. Ms. Bass insisted that her cucumbers, melons and jalapeños were the definition of suitable.
Perhaps owing to the Bass family's indicating they were moving to Seattle, or to the negative media attention, the city dismissed the case. The Basses now have chickens at their new home, but no front-yard garden, since their lawn is concrete.
Instead, Ms. Bass acts as a kind of elder sage in the garden war. She recently e-mailed Mr. Helvenston, offering advice and encouragement. ''I told him, 'It's going to be difficult, but you're fighting a good fight. Hang in there and stay strong.' ''
ORLANDO is an unlikely place for a battle over a garden. As the name of the college football stadium reminds visitors, the city's roots are in citrus growing. In 2007, Mayor Buddy Dyer started GreenWorks Orlando, an ambitious plan spanning decades to turn Orlando into one of the country's greenest cities. Publicly fighting one of its residents over organic vegetables probably didn't come up in the drafting meetings.
From Mr. Rowes's view, the Orlando case points to a distinction between what he calls a ''corporatized green,'' like installing reflective windows in city buildings, and a ''grass roots kind of green,'' as practiced by the Helvenstons and others. ''People just want to be able to grow their own food,'' he said. ''It's a rejection of everyone having the same kind of house with the same kind of lawn.''
Mr. Ippel, the sustainability director, said Orlando is all for sustainability at the grass roots level. ''We're not opposed to gardens,'' he said. ''We allow chickens in the community. In our view, the story got blown out of proportion.''
Mr. Ippel added that the city had undergone a yearlong process to revise its current landscape code to better promote sustainability and flexibility. As part of the process, he said, the city would incorporate codified standards for front-yard gardens. ''Hopefully, he's amenable to making those changes,'' Mr. Ippel said of Mr. Helvenston.
One of the ideas floating around is to require homeowners who plant a front-yard garden to shield it from the street with a fence. Mr. Padin, the owner of the neighboring house, said he would be ''100 percent agreeable'' to that solution.
But Mr. Helvenston finds the compromise objectionable. ''A fence is expensive,'' he said, digging in. ''Now you just ruined my return on investment.''
While they wait for the city's updated policy, the Helvenstons continue to tend their vegetable patch (they just harvested edamame) and to drum up support for the garden in their front yard and those elsewhere. ''We didn't want this to happen,'' Mr. Helvenston said, in a warning shot to other communities, ''but it's a blessing. It's gotten more people planting gardens.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It Will Sell the Rest of Its Stake in G.M.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
11:13 p.m. | Updated
For months, General Motors executives have been pressing Washington to sell its stake in the company, desperate to rid itself of the yoke of being called Government Motors.
Nearly four years after what became a $49.5 billion bailout, the Treasury Department announced on Wednesday that it would sell 200 million shares back to the company for $5.5 billion, then sell an additional 300 million shares by early 2014.
Currently, the exit would produce a loss of more than $12 billion for taxpayers - one of the few major bailouts that did not produce a return. Yet, after the sale of its remaining stake in the American International Group last week, the government can now claim that it has largely unwound the huge, politically contentious corporate rescues it undertook amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
"This can't happen soon enough," said Henry T. C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. "You don't want an industrial corporation being subject, in effect, to government limits." 
The Treasury's presence in G.M. disturbed investors and prompted some consumers to avoid its products in an increasingly competitive United States auto market. Independence, however, will leave the company with no excuse as it battles domestic and foreign rivals, many of whom did not turn to the government for a lifeline.
When G.M. was given its first loans by the Bush administration, the company was still the industry leader, with a 22 percent share of the market in the United States. After bankruptcy and its re-emergence as a public company, that dominance has eroded.
As of the end of November, G.M.'s market share had slipped below 18 percent this year, and it was struggling with hefty inventories of some major models like the Silverado pickup and the Malibu midsize sedan.
And while General Motors has benefited from shedding debt and four brands in bankruptcy, it has considerable work ahead to rebuild a product lineup that withered during its financial crisis. For one, its hometown rival, Ford Motor, earns more money in North America despite selling fewer vehicles.
"There's no doubt that General Motors is in a better position now than it was four or five years ago," said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com. "The key is to watch and see if the company falls back into old habits."
G.M. executives say that the company has changed its ways.
"As today's news travels around the world, the question will be asked, 'Did G.M. truly learn the lessons of the bankruptcy?' " Daniel F. Akerson, the chief executive, wrote in an internal memo. "Our results show that we are changing the company so we never go down that path again."
The sale is expected to bolster morale inside the company.
"It's probably more significant on the employee front than on the automotive side," said Mike Wall, director of analysis at the research firm IHS Automotive. "After what they have gone through the past four years, this is an emotional event and a rallying point for the future."
Executives were eager to shed the government's 32 percent ownership stake, but the election in November delayed any talk of a share buyback. But soon after President Obama's victory, G.M.'s chief financial officer, Daniel Ammann, called Timothy G. Massad, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial stability, to begin negotiations, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
An offer to buy back a substantial number of G.M. shares at the market price - no premium for the Treasury - was rejected. Several weeks of start-and-stop negotiation followed, during which the company demanded a firm timetable for the government's exit.
By about 5 p.m. Tuesday, G.M.'s board had voted to offer $27.50 for the Treasury stake, an approximately 8 percent premium to the stock price at that day's close. By about 7:30 p.m., the sides signed off on the deal.
Despite the relief of reaching an accord, G.M. executives planned no celebration or new marketing campaign, feeling that might look unseemly or even arrogant.
Wednesday's deal all but guarantees a loss for taxpayers. The remaining shares need to be sold at close to $70 each to break even. But a Treasury official argued that the company's stock hadn't surpassed $27.50 since the government was legally cleared to sell additional shares after G.M.'s initial public offering.
The Obama administration has long argued that the rescue was always about saving the American auto industry, not making money. On Wednesday, Treasury claimed to have saved more than one million jobs through the bailout.
The administration is hoping to offset the losses from the G.M. rescue with the profits from its A.I.G. investments and the bank recapitalization program, which together have reaped about $46 billion for taxpayers.
The Treasury Department has also long favored a quick exit from its investments rather than turning a profit. It has already divested its stake in Chrysler, selling it last year to Fiat, the Italian carmaker that was a crucial ally during Chrysler's bankruptcy.
"The government should not be in the business of owning stakes in private companies for an indefinite period of time," Mr. Massad, of the Treasury Department, said in a statement. "Moving to exit our investment in G.M. within the next 12 to 15 months is consistent with our dual goals of winding down TARP as soon as practicable and protecting taxpayer interests."
But the government still owns large portions of other firms, including 74 percent of Ally Financial, G.M.'s former lending arm.
Being a ward of the state has cost G.M. more than its reputation. The company has been subject to a number of restrictions that it claims have hampered its ability to attract fresh talent. Some of those limits, including the use of corporate aircraft, will be lifted after the stock buyback.
But the biggest, a cap on the compensation of top executives, will remain in place until the government sells off its entire stake.
The news was welcomed by some of G.M.'s biggest investors. Among them is Greenlight Capital, a prominent hedge fund that has called the company an "ugly duckling" underappreciated by the market.
"We applaud G.M. management for unlocking shareholder value by releasing excess capital and beginning a resolution of the government stake overhang," David Einhorn, the head of Greenlight, said in a statement.
G.M. has improved in several respects. Its annual profit has risen over the last two years, and as of the end of the year will have about $38 billion in cash and credit lines to draw upon.
But much hard work remains. Ford has had a head start on G.M. in globalizing its products and spreading out development costs. And during its bankruptcy, G.M. had to delay some new models, costing it valuable time in reacting to market trends
Given the challenges that lie ahead for G.M., the company cannot appear to be celebrating or placing too much emphasis on the government's ultimate exit.
"They have to keep their head down and keep plugging away and executing their strategy," Mr. Wall of IHS Automotive said. "It is the beginning of the end of government ownership, but way too soon to celebrate anything."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes in Congress; Out in Front at Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
FAIRFAX CITY, Va. -- With Washington gripped by the usual gridlock and partisanship, Steve Stombres, the chief of staff to Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, slipped into a back room for a closed-door meeting one evening last week.
He emerged 30 minutes later -- along with his colleagues on the Fairfax City Council -- having secured unanimous agreement on appointments to the city's environmental sustainability committee, the Planning Commission and the Economic Development Authority.
In Washington, Mr. Stombres is one of the most powerful Republican aides on Capitol Hill and a central, if largely unseen, player in the fiscal showdown between his party and President Obama. But here where he lives, 22 miles away, he is ''Mr. Councilman,'' the city's well-known, nonpartisan champion of recycling, parks and government efficiency.
''The city is a very small, unique little community,'' Mr. Stombres, 42, said in an interview after his final Council meeting of the year. ''You know these people. They pick up the phone and call you.'' 
For five years, Mr. Stombres has been one of very few people in Washington to juggle life as a senior Capitol Hill staff member and a local elected official. (An aide to Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland is also a state delegate.) Intense and direct, especially during tough negotiations, he is nonetheless embraced by Democrats as a straight shooter who is eager to reach a deal.
''Steve is a pragmatic guy -- he works very hard to defend the interests of his boss,'' said Rob Nabors, Mr. Obama's top Congressional liaison, who has known Mr. Stombres since they attended Lee High School in Virginia together.
A couple of weeks ago, Mr. Nabors and Mr. Stombres encountered each other at a White House holiday reception after a particularly tense week between the leaders of their parties. They chatted briefly, promising to keep the lines of communication open, Mr. Nabors recalled.
''At the end of the day, he's also looking for the opportunity to find compromise when possible,'' Mr. Nabors said.
In his day job, senior Congressional Republicans said, Mr. Stombres has been part of the Republican brain trust for most of the legislative fights in recent years, serving at Mr. Cantor's side as the lawmaker rose to be second in command behind Speaker John A. Boehner. Mr. Stombres is part of a small group of Republican aides who plot out the party's tactics on taxes, spending, foreign affairs, social issues and jobs.
''Strategically, there are a handful of people involved in the kind of big issues, and big questions, and he's a part of almost every one of them,'' said Tim Berry, the chief of staff for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican whip.
Mr. Berry said Mr. Stombres, a former Army reservist, brought ''a military-level intensity to solve problems,'' but added that he had never known Mr. Stombres to say no ''just because it feels good.''
Capitol Hill Democrats who have been on the other side of that intensity also speak with warmth about their rival. Catlin O'Neill, the chief of staff for Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, recently was co-host with Mr. Stombres of a fund-raiser for the homeless in Washington.
''He's a tough adversary,'' Ms. O'Neill said. ''But he's extraordinarily affable. A good guy. Someone you can reason with. He plays it straight.''
That same assessment is echoed by Mr. Stombres's colleagues on the Fairfax City Council, where the Democratic mayor calls him a bridge-builder who embraces a nonpartisan, community-based approach.
''There's no overt politicking,'' said Scott Silverthorne, the mayor, musing that Mr. Stombres probably ''gets his fill of it on Capitol Hill.''
The disdain for the harsh politics of Washington is palpable in Fairfax, a city known in Northern Virginia for its efficient garbage collection and snow removal. In some ways, the Council chambers could not be more different from the grander ones Mr. Stombres frequents on the other side of the Potomac River.
The night of the recent Council meeting, Mr. Stombres battled Washington's infamous rush-hour traffic, arriving at City Hall about 30 minutes late, but still in time to vote on the Eleven Oaks rezoning, which changed the amount of space allowed between 12 proposed homes from 20 feet to as little as 15 feet. (He voted ''Aye.'')
Among the other agenda items: approving $56,675.59 for flood control in a city neighborhood; the presentation of certificates to graduates of the citizen fire academy; and a public hearing on proposed budget guidelines, complete with a finger-wagging lecture from the city's regular budget-watcher.
In the audience: three Boy Scouts, nine firefighters, a handful of land-use lawyers, a couple of Council regulars and a mother with a crying baby.
''We all of us take the nonpartisan thing very seriously,'' said Dan Drummond, a Democrat on the Council who calls Mr. Stombres a friend. ''If Congress were to run like the Fairfax City Council, the country would be a far better place.''
But not everything is different. In Fairfax, as in Washington, the sagging economy has put pressure on leaders to balance spending and revenue. A huge spike in the city's school costs last year forced Mr. Stombres and his colleagues to find $6 million in the city's $120 million general fund budget.
Democrats on the Council argued for an increase in the city's main tax, on homes. Mr. Stombres vigorously opposed raising taxes, arguing that the city's many elderly residents could hardly afford to pay more.
Mr. Stombres lost that battle, 5 to 1, and the city's tax rate rose.
''I know people that it's going to hurt,'' he said of tax increases in Fairfax, which has a population of 22,000. ''The city of Fairfax, just like a family, has got to learn how to tighten its belt.''
On Capitol Hill, few of Mr. Stombres's colleagues know much about his other political life. Most were surprised to find out that he was the prime mover behind his hometown's aggressive recycling program. Or that he and Mr. Drummond had been working hard to turn land near the city's water treatment plant into a regional park.
But as Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama moved closer toward a deadlock over taxes and spending this week, many in Washington said Mr. Stombres could be a factor in preventing calamity.
Mr. Stombres said his friendship with Mr. Nabors was part of what made him optimistic that the two sides in the tax fight would eventually bridge the deep philosophical gulf separating them.
''I have a long connection with Rob,'' Mr. Stombres said. ''You develop trust when you come from the same community. He's always been straight with me. It's what gives me some degree of confidence that we can work to resolve some of these difficult issues.''

HEADLINE: Obama Vows Fast Action Pressing for Gun Control

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama declared on Wednesday that he would make gun control a ''central issue'' as he opens his second term, promising to submit broad new firearm proposals to Congress no later than January and to employ the full power of his office to overcome deep-seated political resistance.
Leading House Republicans responded to the president's pledge in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre by restating their firm opposition to new limits on guns or ammunition, setting up the possibility of a bitter legislative battle and a philosophical clash over the Second Amendment soon after Mr. Obama's inauguration.
Having avoided a politically difficult debate over guns for four years, Mr. Obama vowed to restart a national conversation about their role in American society, the need for better access to mental health services and the impact of exceedingly violent images in the nation's culture. 
He warned that the conversation -- which has produced little serious change after previous mass shootings -- will be a short one, followed by specific legislative proposals that he intends to campaign for, starting with his State of the Union address next month.
''This time, the words need to lead to action,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I will use all the powers of this office to help advance efforts aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.''
At an appearance in the White House briefing room, the president said that he had directed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to lead an interagency effort to develop what the White House said would be a multifaceted approach to preventing mass shootings like the one in Newtown, Conn., last week and the many other gun deaths that occur each year.
As evidence of the brutal cost of gun violence, Mr. Obama said that since Friday's school shooting in Connecticut, guns had led to the deaths of police officers in Memphis and Topeka, Kan.; a woman in Las Vegas; three people in an Alabama hospital; and a 4-year-old in a drive-by shooting in Missouri. They are, he said, victims of ''violence that we cannot accept as routine.''
Accompanied by Mr. Biden, the president signaled his support for new limits on high-capacity clips and assault weapons, as well as a desire to close regulatory loopholes affecting gun shows. He promised to confront the broad pro-gun sentiment in Congress that has for years blocked gun control measures.
That opposition shows little signs of fading away. While the death of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday appears to have persuaded some Democratic lawmakers to support new gun control measures, there has been little indication that Republicans who control the House -- and are in a standoff with Mr. Obama over taxes -- are willing to accept such restrictions.
House Democrats urged Speaker John A. Boehner on Wednesday to bring a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines to a vote by Saturday -- a step he is highly unlikely to take.
Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, an influential conservative leader, said in a statement that ''it is clear that criminals will always find ways to acquire weapons and use them to commit acts of violence.''
''Passing more restrictions on law-abiding citizens will not deter this type of crime,'' he said.
Mr. Jordan and other House Republicans declined to be interviewed, saying through aides that it was time to mourn, not to debate policy.
''There will be plenty of time to have this conversation,'' said Brittany Lesser, a spokeswoman for Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, ''but it is not amidst the funerals of these brave young children and adults.''
This week, Mr. King told an Iowa radio station, KSCJ, that ''political opportunists didn't wait 24 hours before they decided they were going to go after some kind of a gun ban.'' He also expressed doubt about gun control measures, saying, ''We all had our cap pistols when I was growing up, and that didn't seem to cause mass murders in the street.''
Representative Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina, said in an interview that he thought the talk of gun control was ''probably a rush to judgment'' that missed the real issue.
''I think it's more of a mental health problem than a gun problem right now,'' he said. ''Traditionally states that enact rigid, inflexible gun laws do not show a corresponding diminishment in crime.''
While Mr. Coble said he would want to study any proposal made by the president, he said fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, which would consider any gun recommendations, probably agree with his views.
One senior Republican, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, signaled an openness to review Mr. Obama's proposals.
''As the president said, no set of laws will prevent every future horrific act of violence or eliminate evil from our society, but we can do better,'' Mr. Sensenbrenner said in an e-mailed response to questions.
Mr. Sensenbrenner noted that he had co-sponsored the Brady gun control bill in the 1990s. ''Our country must also grapple with difficult questions about the identification and care of individuals with mental illnesses,'' he said.
On Wednesday the president said that Mr. Biden's group would propose new laws and actions in January, and that those would be ''proposals that I then intend to push without delay.'' Mr. Obama said Mr. Biden's effort was ''not some Washington commission'' that would take six months and produce a report that was shelved.
''I urge the new Congress to hold votes on these new measures next year, in a timely manner,'' Mr. Obama said.
White House aides said Mr. Biden would meet with law enforcement officials from across the country on Thursday, along with cabinet officials from the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Education and Health and Human Services.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York praised Mr. Obama's announcement and said he offered his ''full support'' to Mr. Biden in a phone conversation on Wednesday. But Mr. Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of tougher gun control, also urged the president to take executive actions in the meantime, including making a recess appointment of a new director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Republicans have blocked an appointment to the post for years.
''The country needs his leadership if we are going to reduce the daily bloodshed from gun violence that we have seen for too long,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of Mr. Obama.
Gun control advocates have urged the White House and lawmakers to move rapidly to enact new gun control measures before the killings in Connecticut fade from the public's consciousness. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has said she intends to introduce a new ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines on the first day of the next Congress in January.
During his first term, Mr. Obama largely avoided the issue of gun control, even as high-powered firearms were used in several mass shootings. Asked bluntly about his lack of past action on the issue, the president appeared irritated, citing the economic crisis, the collapse of the auto industry and two wars as matters that demanded attention.
''I don't think I've been on vacation,'' he said curtly.
He then conceded, ''All of us have to do some reflection on how we prioritize what we do here in Washington.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Abe's Second Chance

 BODY:
The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and its leader, Shinzo Abe, are basking in Sunday's election victory over the incumbent Democratic Party. A few short years ago, many were counting out Mr. Abe and his party as relics of an exhausted postwar political order. Now both are back, handed a huge parliamentary majority and a new chance to shape the future of a country with the world's third-largest economy behind the United States and China. 
To jolt Japan out of decades of anemic growth, Mr. Abe favors more ambitious fiscal and monetary stimulus. We couldn't agree more. But his career-long fondness for right-wing nationalist statements and gestures is serious cause for concern.
As a candidate this fall, Mr. Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japan's war dead, major war criminals included. He shamelessly denies the wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women by Japanese military forces and seeks to tone down past apologies. He says he will reinterpret Japan's antiwar constitution to permit a more assertive foreign policy. And he favors revising Japan's already euphemistic school textbooks to further disguise Japan's militaristic excesses and promote more patriotic pride.
Mr. Abe's attempts to rewrite Japan's wartime history understandably disturb neighboring nations, like China and South Korea, that bore the brunt of Japanese aggression. Deliberate manipulation of these resentments by cynical Chinese leaders does not make them less real. Nor does it help that Mr. Abe's grandfather and political inspiration, the former prime minister, Nobusuke Kishi, served as a top official during the harsh Japanese occupation of the northern Chinese region of Manchuria in the 1930s and as a cabinet minister during World War II.
During Mr. Abe's first term, in 2006-7, he showed that he could moderate his stridency in the interests of easing tensions with China. We hope he will do so again. Japan voted for economic revival, not nationalist fantasies. As a nation that lives by trade, Japan needs harmonious relations with its main Asian trading partners, China most of all.
Mr. Abe's excesses could prove challenging for the United States. As the guarantor of Japan's military security, Washington must stand by Tokyo in the face of actual territorial threats, like China's menacing behavior toward the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. But the United States also has an even bigger interest in easing regional tensions, including those caused by Japan's willful amnesia.

HEADLINE: Images of Emancipation

BYLINE: MAURICE BERGER


HIGHLIGHT: A new book argues that photography was not incidental but central to the war against slavery, racism and segregation in the1850s through the 1930s. 

 BODY:
The portrait for the carte-de-visite of Sojourner Truth, the African-American abolitionist and women's rights advocate, was taken in Battle Creek, Mich., in the 1860s (Slide 5). She wears an elegant silk dress and shawl. With one hand resting on her hip, the other on the arm of the chair, her pose is majestic and determined. She stares resolutely into the camera.
But it is the object in her lap that remains one of the image's most revelatory details: an open daguerreotype of her grandson James Caldwell, a soldier during the Civil War. 
The daguerreotype's pride of place speaks not only to Truth's love for her grandchild but also to her passionate engagement with photography. As Deborah Willis and Barbara Krauthamer write in their groundbreaking new book, "Envisioning Emancipation: Black Americans and the End of Slavery" (Temple University Press), Truth was probably the first black woman to actively distribute photographs of herself.
Those pictures were meant to affirm her status as a sophisticated and respectable "free woman and as a woman in control of her image." The public's fascination with carte-de-visites, small and collectible card-mounted photographs, allowed her to advance her abolitionist cause to a huge audience and earn a living through their sale. "I Sell the Shadow to Support the Substance," proclaimed the famous slogan for these pictures.
Truth was not alone in her understanding of the power of photography. A host of other African-Americans, both eminent and ordinary, employed the medium as an instrument of political engagement and inspiration. "Envisioning Emancipation" argues that photography was not incidental but central to the war against slavery, racism and segregation in the antebellum period of the 1850s through the New Deal era of the 1930s.
The book explores how blacks "positioned themselves and were posed by others" in order to advance, question or alter prevailing ideas about race. It examines the ways the national debate about slavery was played out in photographs, for example, from the standpoint of abolitionists, who published them as proof of the brutality and immorality of slavery, and its supporters, who engaged photographs as visual evidence of its "natural order and orderliness."
Pseudoscientists, like Louis Agassiz, the Swiss-born and Harvard-trained zoologist, adapted the medium to further notions of black aberrance and inferiority. Agassiz employed invasive daguerreotypes of naked slaves - the "pornography of forced labor," as they have been aptly described - to verify his theory of polygenesis, the separate human origins of Africans and Europeans, and emphasize the relative lowliness of the former.
Abolitionists used photographs to convince Northern whites - for whom the prospect of emancipation elicited responses ranging from skepticism to violence - of the unjustness of slavery. They stirred public sentiment by offering visual evidence of slavery's abuses as well as of the wholesomeness of an emerging class of freed blacks. Juxtaposing pictures of hapless children, posed barefoot and dressed in ragged clothes, with images of the same children wearing neatly pressed and undamaged garments, for example, abolitionists were able to convey the idea that a formerly enslaved people, now rendered as attractive and healthy, were worthy of liberation.
As Ms. Willis and Ms. Krauthamer note, freedom for African-Americans was not instantly achieved with the implementation of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863; it evolved fitfully, over many decades. During that time, it was photographs created largely by and for African-Americans that helped an oppressed people to imagine their own freedom. Prominent black leaders, including Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, routinely turned to the medium, much as Sojourner Truth did, to further their abolitionist campaigns.
Soon, increasingly inexpensive imaging technology, coupled with a growing national network of black-owned photo studios, permitted African-Americans of all economic classes, even "the servant girl," as Douglass observed, to construct their own versions of themselves. This affirmative imagery served to countermand destructive and pervasive stereotypes, steeling African-Americans against the ruthless forces of intolerance while simultaneously convincing white people of their shared humanity.
In the end, "Envisioning Emancipation" recounts a dynamic history of black self-possession and self-determination, one that challenges the abiding myth of the crusade against slavery and segregation: that of passive black victims who obtained freedom mostly through the benevolence and generosity of their white saviors.
That myth does not die easily. It haunts popular culture, no more so than in Steven Spielberg's just-released film about the 16th president's epic battle against slavery, "Lincoln." Despite the nuanced portrayal of its protagonist, "Lincoln" is almost devoid of images of active black resistance and protest, ignoring a wealth of research "demonstrating that slaves were crucial agents in their emancipation," as the historian Kate Masur wrote last month in this newspaper.
"For my community, the message has been clear," the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates recently observed, "the Civil War is a story for white people - acted out by white people, and on white people's terms - in which blacks feature strictly as stock characters and props." "Envisioning Emancipation" brilliantly rewrites this story, insisting that we acknowledge the names and faces of people who have been invisible for too long.

HEADLINE: Last-Ditch Attempt to Derail Volcker Rule

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: A cynical effort by the biggest banks to derail limitations on risk taking misrepresents American obligations abroad, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
In a desperate attempt to prevent implementation of the Volcker Rule, representatives of megabanks are resorting to some last-minute scare tactics. Specifically, they assert that the Volcker Rule, which is designed to reduce the risks that such banks can take, violates the international trade obligations of the United States and would offend other member nations of the Group of 20. This is false and should be brushed aside by the relevant authorities. 
The Volcker Rule was adopted as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation in 2010. The legislative intent was, at the suggestion of Paul A. Volcker (the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors), to limit the kinds of risk-taking that very large banks could undertake. In particular, the banks are supposed to be severely limited in terms of the proprietary bets that they can make, to lower the probability they can ruin themselves and inflict great damage on the rest of society. (For a primer and great insights, see this commentary by Alexis Goldstein, a leader of Occupy the S.E.C.)
The Volcker Rule is almost finished winding its way through the regulatory process, and a version should be implemented soon. But in a last-ditch attempt to block it, the United States Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the United States Trade Representative asserting:
The Volcker Rule is discriminatory, as foreign sovereign debt is subject to the regulation, while Unted States Treasury debt instruments are exempt. This creates a discord in G20 and invites foreign governments to retaliate at a time when we need those same regulators in foreign countries to support initiatives to liberalize trade in financial services. Further, U.S.T.R. should conduct a very close examination to ensure the Volcker Rule does not violate any of our trade obligations.
This statement is correct with regard to the point that there are exemptions in the current version of the Volcker Rule for banks' holdings of United States government debt, i.e., there are fewer restrictions on their holdings of Treasury obligations than on their holdings of foreign government debt.
But the idea that this violates the spirit or letter of our international obligations is flatly wrong. Perhaps that is why the letter doesn't point to any particular provisions of any specific trade agreements.
As a matter of basic principle, there is no violation, because there is no provision in any trade agreement that says United States banking regulators can't protect our financial system by engaging in prudent regulation. To the contrary, nations have always been allowed to restrict what their banks can regard as safe assets, and thus effectively to limit their holdings of foreign assets.
Think of it this way. Would we want United States banking regulators to be prohibited from distinguishing between United States debt and that of Greece, Ireland, Spain or Italy?
In practice, this distinction among countries already occurs. For example, the Basel II equity capital requirements allow every country to treat the debt of other governments with some caution (although, without doubt, more caution is needed than was actually used in the past, or even than is encouraged under the new Basel III agreement).
Some Canadian officials, for example, have said that Canadian government debt should receive equal treatment with United States government debt. This is a dangerous proposal. Canada has ridden the recent commodity price boom and, to many observers, its real estate looks pricey. Do Canadian banks have enough loss-absorbing capital to weather whatever storms lie ahead - if China slows down or energy prices fall for some other reason? They had trouble in the 1990s, when commodity prices fell sharply. Why should American regulators allow our banks to take on a huge amount of Canadian risk?
Markets love a country until five seconds before they hate it. Surely we should have learned that by now, including from the European crisis.
We should continue to regard euro-zone debt with great suspicion. The euro-zone sovereign debt crisis may be over, and Greece's bond rating was upgraded sharply by Standard & Poor's this week. On the other hand, S.&P. and other ratings agencies have been wrong - and to a spectacular degree - in the not-too-distant past, including being overly optimistic about European sovereign debt and residential mortgages in the United States.
The Volcker Rule, and its international counterparts, like "ring fencing," are forms of re-regulation, to be sure. Based on harsh recent experiences, countries are backing away from letting their banks and other people's banks run unfettered around the world, taking on whatever risks they like and getting themselves into complicated legal and financial difficulties.
We need to reduce excessive and irresponsible risk taking throughout our financial system. The Volcker Rule is a significant step in the right direction. It is time for the regulators to finish the job.

HEADLINE: Modi Inches Closer to India's Capital

BYLINE: GARDINER HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Narendra Modi's win in the Gujarat elections could lead to a prime minister nomination in 2014. 

 BODY:
NEW DELHI - Gujarat's polarizing state leader, Narendra Modi, inched closer Thursday to becoming the leading political challenger to India's dominant Gandhi family.
Mr. Modi was convincingly re-elected as chief minister of the western state of Gujarat under the banner of the nation's leading opposition party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. That would improve Mr. Modi's chances of being selected as his party's candidate for prime minister in national elections in 2014.
As of 5:30 p.m. in India, 116 seats were declared for the B.J.P. in Gujarat, with several seats still outstanding, a clear victory for the party. 
Mr. Modi campaigned on claims that he has presided over rapid economic growth while staying free of the taint of corruption that has affected many other state and national leaders. Questions about his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed have made him one of the most divisive figures in Indian politics.
Mr. Modi is accused of not doing enough to stop the riots and, possibly, of encouraging them. But he was re-elected by a wide margin just five years after the violence, and won again Thursday. Muslims have long been marginalized in Gujarat and represent just 9 percent of the electorate.
Memories of the riots may be more of a hindrance in national elections, where religious minorities represent nearly 20 percent of the population. Mr. Modi's actions during the riots and disparagement of Muslims since then have been questioned by more moderate Hindus; indeed, some leading members of the B.J.P. have resisted Modi's rising prominence in part for fear that he will cost the party votes among religious minorities.
Nitish Kumar, the powerful chief minister of Bihar, has promised to withdraw his support for the B.J.P. if it selects Mr. Modi as its prime ministerial candidate for 2014. That would reduce the party's chances of gaining a majority in the national Parliament, but whether Mr. Kumar would follow through on his threat is uncertain.
Mr. Modi's role in the 2002 riots has long been a concern for governments in the West. The United States, for instance, refuses to provide Mr. Modi with a visa.
But as he continues to consolidate his power, more Western countries may rethink their refusal to talk with him in an official context. In October, Britain ended a 10-year diplomatic boycott of Mr. Modi when its high commissioner met with him for 50 minutes.
India's religious, caste and regional differences have increasingly splintered the country's politics into a complex array of regional players and leaders. The Bharatiya Janata Party has long advocated Hindu supremacy in hopes of achieving this dominance, with some of its leaders demonizing Muslims in hopes of uniting Hindus. But the party has been resisted by regional parties that advocate for certain castes and cultures, as well as by the Congress party, which still clings to Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a secular state in which religion plays a minimal role in public life.
Leaders of the B.J.P. said that Mr. Modi had solidified his place as one of India's most important leaders, although top party leaders refused to speculate on whether he would be the party's candidate for prime minister in 2014. "This shows the people's confidence and trust in the B.J.P. and Narendra Modi's leadership," said Dhansukh Bhanderi, a top party official.
P. Chidambaram, India's finance minister and a leader of the Congress party, said in a televised interview that he thought Congress had won a victory Thursday because Mr. Modi had not managed to expand his political dominance in Gujarat. "Congress is the winner," Mr. Chidambaram said.
Outside a B.J.P. office in Gujarat, party members held signs before TV cameras that read, "CM 2012, Narendra Modi, PM 2014," suggesting that they saw Mr. Modi's victory in Gujarat as a prelude to a national victory in 2014.
Also on Thursday, it was announced that Congress had defeated the B.J.P. in state assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, a hilly state in the Himalayas. The victory was an important balm to Congress, which has been buffeted in recent years by corruption allegations and the rise of regional parties.
The election in Himachal was between two veteran political leaders who have traded control over the state between them for decades. Virbhadra Singh, 78, of Congress is now expected to become the state's chief minister, a post he has already held five times. Prem Kumar Dhumal, 68, will resign after having served two non-consecutive terms as chief minister.
 Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Haresh Pandya from Rajkot, Gujarat.

HEADLINE: Chinese Companies Head For the Exit

BYLINE: NEIL GOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: The $3.7 billion bid to privatize Nasdaq-listed and Shanghai-based Focus Media, a leveraged buyout backed by private equity and management, is the biggest deal in a rising wave of Chinese companies seeking to delist from American exchanges. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG--Fed up with slumping share prices, prickly regulators and aggressive short sellers, an increasing number of Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges are heading for the exits. 
The most recent case is also the biggest yet. On Wednesday, the directors of Focus Media Holdings, a display advertising company based in Shanghai, whose shares had come under attack by short-sellers, said they had accepted a sweetened $3.7 billion privatization bid from a buyout group that included the American private equity giant Carlyle Group, several Chinese private equity firms and the company's chairman. 
The deal would delist the company from Nasdaq. It includes $1.5 billion in debt financing from a consortium of Wall Street banks and mainly state-owned Chinese lenders and would rank as China's biggest-ever leveraged buyout. Pending shareholders' approval, the company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of next year. 
Including the Focus Media deal, which was first announced in August, Chinese companies began a record $5.8 billion worth of privatization bids in the first nine months of the year, according to the data provider Dealogic. That was a 42 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, and proposed Chinese delistings accounted for a record 16 percent of such transactions globally during the period, up from 6 percent a year earlier. 
''A lot of Chinese entrepreneurs want out of the U.S. markets. Share prices are depressed, and there are a lot of these deals in the pipeline,'' said David Brown, greater China private equity practice leader at the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Valuations of companies from China that are listed in the United States have come under pressure in recent years after a wave of allegations of fraud and other accounting scandals. The Securities and Exchange Commission has deregistered the securities of nearly 50 China-based companies and has filed about 40 related fraud cases.
At the same time, a cross-border regulatory dispute over auditing procedures for Chinese companies listed in the United States escalated this month, when the S.E.C. charged the Chinese affiliates of the world's four biggest accounting companies with violating securities law for failing to turn over documents related to their auditing work on businesses in China. 
The standoff between United States and Chinese regulators over the auditing issue has raised concerns among multinational corporations that operate in both countries.
''Failure to reach an agreement will create regulatory dead zones that harm investors and businesses,'' the United States Chamber of Commercesaid last week in a letter to securities regulators in Beijing and Washington. ''The threat of retaliatory actions by regulators, on both sides of the Pacific, may create a regulatory protectionism that will harm both economies.''

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Gun Violence

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
President Obama plans to make gun control a higher priority in his second term in the wake of the Connecticut school massacre. Michael D. Shear reports that Mr. Obama has named Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to lead an interagency effort to develop the White House's approach to curbing gun violence, and he plans to start sending proposals to Congress in January. Mr. Obama will also address the topic in his State of the Union speech next month. 
Negotiations to avoid the automatic tax increases and broad spending cuts set to kick in next year appear closer to a deadlock than a deal after Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio reached an impasse on Wednesday. Jackie Calmes and Jonathan Weisman write that with time running out, the House is set to vote today on Mr. Boehner's "Plan B," despite Senate opposition and a veto threat from Mr. Obama.
A central player in the fiscal negotiations leads a double life as a top Congressional aide and a local councilman, Michael D. Shear writes. The aide, Steve Stombres, the chief of staff to Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican majority leader, has a reputation on the Fairfax City Council and on Capitol Hill that could bode well for the fiscal talks -- he is know as an intense negotiator who is eager to reach a deal.
A scathing report on the security conditions that left a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, vulnerable to attack hasled to the ouster of four State Department officials. Michael R. Gordon and Eric Schmitt write that the report said officials' lack of leadership and a culture of "husbanding resources" contributed to insecurities at the compound, where Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed on Sept. 11. Two deputy secretaries of state are expected to testify today on Capitol Hill about the attacks.
 Around the Web: 
Medicare officials began the formal steps to carry out a 27 percent cut in doctors' payments, as the possibility of a temporary patch to prevent the cut remains ensnared in fiscal negotiations, according to The Hill.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic data expected today include third-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by leading indicators for November, existing home sales for last month, and weekly mortgage rates.
William F. Burns, the deputy secretary of state, and Thomas R. Nides, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, testify about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, at two hearings: an 8 a.m. session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a 1 p.m. session of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
At 10, public viewing begins in the Capitol Rotunda for Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, who died on Monday.
In the afternoon, the House is expected to vote on Speaker John A. Boehner's "Plan B," a measure to raise tax rates only on incomes over $1 million, and another measure to replace automatic spending cuts set to kick in next year.

HEADLINE: On Not Seeing the Forest for the Equations

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No, macro isn't converging. 

 BODY:
So, Noah Smith weighs in on the state of macro and argues that there really isn't that much disagreement in the field, because both saltwater and freshwater macro use the same set of techniques. (For newbies: saltwater is the kind of macro practiced at MIT, some of Harvard, Princeton, etc., macro that still finds Keynesian ideas useful and argues that monetary and fiscal policy can be effective; freshwater is Chicago, Minnesota, etc. insisting that business cycles are optimal responses to real shocks). 
I think Smith is missing the point here. Alchemists and chemists used similar equipment: retorts, beakers, and so on. That didn't make them the same endeavor. New Keynesians and real business cycle theorists both do lots of intertemporal maximization -- that is, they use similar equations to represent consumer and producer behavior. Again, this doesn't make them the same endeavor.
The real test came when the financial crisis struck, and pretty much to a man freshwater economists not only argued against fiscal stimulus -- which is a defensible position -- but insisted that there was no possible way to justify stimulus, that such ideas had been refuted and that "nobody" believed in them anymore. The only way to understand these claims is to realize that the freshwater types simply didn't accept the legitimacy of what the New Keynesians were doing -- in fact, didn't even bother to read any of it, because anyone who actually worked with that kind of model would know that fiscal policy can indeed have an effect in that framework. 
I'm not saying that the NK approach is necessarily right; but it's a serious intellectual effort, undertaken by people who thought they were part of an open professional dialogue. Oh, and there's a lot of evidence for the price stickiness that is central to NK models; again, maybe it doesn't mean what the theorists think, but surely that evidence ought to be part of any discussion.
So yes, the equations in one of Mike Woodford's papers look a lot like the equations coming out of Chicago or Minneapolis. And a few years ago it was possible to delude oneself into believing that this represented a true convergence of thought. But recent events have proved that it just wasn't true.

HEADLINE: The Deal for N.Y.S.E.

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is in talks to be acquired by the IntercontinentalExchange, an upstart commodities and derivatives trading platform. | UBS made history on Wednesday when its Japanese unit agreed to plead guilty to fraud. | Shares of Herbalife began plummeting on Wednesday after reports that the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman was short-selling the company. | Some of John A. Paulson's investors appear to be reconsidering whether they should keep their money with the hedge fund manager. 

 BODY:
N.Y.S.E IN MERGER TALKS | The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is in talks to be acquired by the IntercontinentalExchange, an upstart commodities and derivatives trading platform, in an $8 billion deal, people briefed on the matter tell DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced. IntercontinentalExchange, known as ICE, is expected to offer about $33 a share, with two-thirds of that in stock, according to one of these people. That would be a 37 percent premium to NYSE Euronext's closing price on Wednesday. 
"While the New York Stock Exchange, with its opening bell and floor traders, has been the public image of a stock market for two centuries, it is NYSE Euronext's businesses in the over-the-counter trading of derivatives - including the Liffe market in London - that appear to be the main attraction in the merger talks," Mr. de la Merced writes. A deal would follow a failed attempt by ICE and the Nasdaq OMX Group more than a year ago to buy NYSE Euronext - an effort that fell apart after being challenged by regulators. "The newest merger might pose fewer problems because ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives." A merger, Mr. de la Merced says, would underscore "how the global market for derivatives has eclipsed that for stocks."
HOW UBS WAS DENIED LENIENCY | UBS made history on Wednesday when its Japanese unit agreed to plead guilty to fraud over interest-rate manipulation. "It was the first guilty plea from a major financial institution since Drexel Burnham Lambert admitted to six counts of fraud in 1989," DealBook's Ben Protess reports.
The Swiss bank fought to avoid its punishment, which also involves $1.5 billion in fines from an international group of regulators. Mr. Protess reports: "A week ago, in a bid for leniency over interest-rate manipulation, the bank's chairman traveled to Washington to plead his case to the Justice Department, according to people briefed on the matter. Knowing the long odds, the chairman, Axel Weber, asked the criminal division for a lighter punishment. But the government did not budge. With support from Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the agency's criminal division decided the bank's actions were simply too egregious, people briefed on the matter said."
The Justice Department also leveled criminal charges at two former UBS traders. Tom Hayes and Roger Darin were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and Mr. Hayes also faces an additional count of wire fraud and another related to price fixing.
Just six months ago, it seemed UBS's penalty would be similar to the $450 million settlement struck with Barclays over attempts to manipulate Libor. "Then the tone shifted this fall. After examining thousands of e-mails and hours of taped phone calls, the agency's criminal division concluded that the conduct at the Japanese subsidiary warranted a criminal charge." Prosecutors wanted to send a warning. Other institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, remain in regulators' sights.
ACKMAN'S NEW TARGET | Shares of Herbalife began plummeting on Wednesday after reports that the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman was short-selling the company. According to CNBC, Mr. Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management, has said he considers the business to be a pyramid scheme. Herbalife's chief executive called that accusation "bogus." But investors fled the stock, which fell 12 percent. Mr. Ackman is scheduled to announce his new thesis Thursday morning as the market opens, at an event in Manhattan sponsored by the Sohn Conference Foundation. He is also scheduled for a media tour, with appearances on CNBC at 12 p.m. and Bloomberg TV at 12:30 p.m. If Mr. Ackman is indeed taking aim at Herbalife, he would be the second prominent hedge fund manager this year to raise questions about the company. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who has not announced any short position in Herbalife, prompted a selloff when he asked questions on a conference call in May.
ON THE AGENDA | The maker of the BlackBerry, Research in Motion, reports earnings after the market closes. Discover Financial Services reports results before the opening bell. The final measure of third-quarter gross domestic product is out at 8:30 a.m. Data on existing home sales in November are out at 10 a.m. Robert Kindler, Morgan Stanley's head of global mergers and acquisitions, is on CNBC at 10:30 a.m. Robert Benmosche of A.I.G. is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m. John Donahoe, chief executive of eBay, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m.
FRESH SETBACK FOR PAULSON | Some of John A. Paulson's investors appear to be reconsidering whether they should keep their money with the hedge fund manager, who has suffered a string of disappointing quarters. The latest doubts came from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which recommended that its financial advisers withdraw client money from Mr. Paulson's Advantage and Advantage Plus funds, according to Reuters, which cites an unidentified person familiar with the matter. "The move, which is expected to shave some $100 million in assets off the $5.7 billion Advantage and Advantage Plus funds, may be more humiliating than truly harmful for Paulson's $20 billion firm," Reuters reports, adding that investors with Morgan Stanley "have already asked to pull out about $36 million of the $100 million that is expected to be redeemed." In August, Citigroup's private bank was said to be withdrawing $410 million from Mr. Paulson's funds.

HEADLINE: UBS Settlement Minimizes Impact of Guilty Plea

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: To settle a rate-rigging case, the Japanese securities subsidiary of UBS pleaded guilty to a charge of felony wire fraud as part of a settlement that was structured to keep the potential fallout from the plea to a minimum. 

 BODY:
The Swiss banking giant UBS paid a fairly stiff price to settle the rate-rigging case. In addition to approximately $1.5 billion in penalties and disgorgement, the bank's Japanese securities subsidiary pleaded guilty to a charge of felony wire fraud. 
As DealBook reported, the guilty plea by the UBS subsidiary is the first time an arm of major financial institution has been convicted of a crime since Drexel Burnham was more than 20 years ago. Although that distinguishes this case from most others, the Justice Department and UBS also structured the settlement to keep the potential fallout from the plea to a minimum. 
A guilty plea in a corporate criminal investigation is uncommon, with most cases concluded by a deferred or nonprosecution agreement. Just last week, HSBC received a deferred prosecution agreement related to money laundering. Barclays struck a deferred prosecution agreement to settle its rate manipulation case. 
 This is not the first time UBS has been caught up in an investigation of criminal violations. In February 2009, the bank entered into a deferred prosecution agreement over its role in aiding tax evasion by Americans using secret accounts that resulted in $780 million in fines and penalties. 
In the rate-manipulation settlement, the parent company received a separate nonprosecution agreement, which will be in effect for two years, after which the criminal investigation will be closed without any charges being filed. Under this type of arrangement, the bank does not suffer the embarrassment of having charges made public while prosecutors hold them in abeyance. 
UBS was required to accept a statement of facts outlining its misconduct, which will be useful to private plaintiffs. More important, the nonprosecution agreement does not affect the bank's ability to continue to do business in the United States in the same way a criminal conviction could because the parent company will be able to keep its charter.
The Japanese subsidiary, where much of the manipulation involving the yen-denominated London interbank offered rate, or Libor, occurred, does not have any operations in the United States and so is not subject to direct regulation in this country. Its criminal conviction will not have a direct effect on UBS's operations here.
The impact in Japan on the UBS subsidiary also is likely to be minimal. The Financial Services Agency, which oversees Japanese banks and securities firms, issued an administrative order in December 2011 sanctioning UBS Securities Japan for manipulation of the yen-denominated Libor. The action included a 1-week suspension from derivatives transactions and an agreement to improve its compliance measures. The Japanese authorities might revisit the case, but it appears they have already disposed of the matter.
One concern that has been expressed about pursuing criminal charges in the United States against global companies in heavily regulated industries like banking is the potentially devastating impact a conviction could have on their operations. If a large bank were suddenly put out of business, the financial system might be substantially harmed because it has become so interdependent, not to mention the loss of jobs and threat to investments.
This is the fear of the "Arthur Andersen" effect, named after the accounting firm that went out of business in 2002 when it was convicted of obstruction of justice related to auditing work for Enron. Since its demise, federal prosecutors have relied primarily on deferred and nonprosecution agreements to resolve corporate criminal investigations. Even when the Justice Department obtains a guilty plea as part of the resolution of a corporate criminal investigation, it has structured the case to minimize the collateral consequences to the company from a conviction.
For example, in the health care area, the government has allowed nonoperating subsidiaries - basically corporate shells - to be the defendant pleading guilty while the parent company is involved only in a civil settlement or, as with UBS, enters into a deferred or nonprosecution agreement. 
In 2009, Pfizer agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement for illegal promotion of its products in which its Pharmacia & Upjohn subsidiary, which had ceased operations years earlier, pleaded guilty. Earlier this year, GlaxoSmithKline, which is incorporated in Britain, paid $3 billion as part of a settlement for unlawful promotion of its drugs while a Delaware limited liability company it owned pleaded guilty.
One reason health care companies need to avoid a criminal conviction is that certain violations result in an automatic five-year exclusion from participating in Medicare and Medicaid. That would have a devastating effect on a drug company. So the settlements have a nonoperating subsidiary bear the consequences of the conviction while the parent stays in business.
Using the Japanese subsidiary as the vehicle for the guilty plea spares UBS from having its operations in other countries hampered. In addition to the Justice Department, one of the parties to the settlement is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which imposed $700 million of the $1.5 billion in penalties. As such, UBS is likely to have resolved its dealings with the federal government.
The bank is not immune from further enforcement activity in the United States, however. As Standard Charteredlearned recently when it had to settle a claim filed by the New York State Department of Financial Services by paying $340 million, state regulators may want their own payments for violation of banking laws.
UBS has branches in New York and Connecticut with billions of dollars in assets, so it would not be a surprise if authorities in those states raise questions over its manipulation of Libor and perhaps seek their own pound of flesh from the bank.
The Justice Department has upped the ante for other banks involved in the Libor investigation by including criminal charges rather than just employing a deferred or nonprosecution agreement. Although UBS did everything it could to avoid pleading guilty, in the end the Justice Department held firm.
It will be interesting to see if a guilty plea has become the price of a settlement with federal prosecutors. If so, that may not bode well for other banks involved in the investigation.

HEADLINE: Questions Remain About New Plan on 'Too Big to Fail'

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England recently put out a new paper on how they might work together to aid a major financial institution who gets into trouble. 

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England recently put out a new paper on how they might work together to aid a major financial institution that gets into trouble.
Lots of good feelings all around about international cooperation, but having spent the week giving the document a close read, I'm struck by how much remains unknown or simply speculative.
The basic problem is that Dodd-Frank's orderly liquidation authority as originally presented was -- and still is -- probably unworkable. I have written about how the fractured nature of financial institution regulation and insolvency in the United States means that in or out of the authority, failure of a big, integrated "universal bank" (or as close as we get to those in the United States) would be something of a calamity. 
The F.D.I.C. has sensibly moved on, and now plans to stabilize the holding company, providing it will provide enough financing and liquidity to keep the rest of the operation afloat.
It's generally a good plan, but let's just stipulate now that whatever political party does not hold the White House will call this a bailout. So be it. I leave it to the F.D.I.C. to deal with the politics
More important, for the agency's new plan to work on a global scale, you need to make several assumptions. First, all the relevant countries have to basically agree to abstain from action, and trust that the F.D,I.C. will be able to stabilize the enterprise. Getting London on boardis huge in this regard, because of the crucial role that Britain plays in most major American financial institutions.
There remains lost of assumptions in the paper about parties involved having "strong incentives" to behave rationally once the F.D.I.C. is standing behind the institution. One might question whether assuming that people will be rational in the kind of financial crisis we are talking about here makes a lot of sense.
But you also have to assume that the problem is not caused by a foreign subsidiary that itself has become insolvent. Rather, much of the new plan seems to turn on insolvency at the holding company level, which can be easily solved by the effects of inflicting pain on bondholders and injecting cash.
This model does not fit nicely with a foreign operating subsidiary that develops a gigantic, A.I.G.-like, cash-sucking hole. In Paragraph 37 of the new report, the regulators suggest that such a situation would require a separate, forcible equity for debt swap at the subsidiary level.
Not easy to do with the liquidation authority applying only to domestic parts of the financial institution, and doing that does seem to lead to the breakup of the institution. Creditors at the subsidiary level might not be the same creditors as at the parent level, and before you know it, one group owns the head and another the body.
The paper also talks at cross-purposes at times. On the one hand, it's quite clear that the F.D.I.C. would want to get rid of its control of the financial institution as soon as possible. Thus, the paper talks a lot about a quick turnover of new equity to old creditors.
On the other hand, it also says that as part of the resolution process, the agency might well require a significant operational restructuring of the financial institution, even to the extent of requiring a breakup of the institution. How is that going to happen if the F.D.I.C. is also giving up control right away? 
The paper provides an answer: The F.D.I.C. will mandate changes that the new owners (creditors of the financial institution) will have to put into place.
Right. So, that still leaves the question of how the agency will know which changes to mandate in the short time it has control over the institution. It may also leave the creditors wondering precisely what it is that the F.D.I.C. is handing them in this process.

HEADLINE: Nearly 30,000 Jobs Lost Because of Hurricane Sandy

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The impact of the storm on small businesses and larger companies whose offices could not reopen for weeks afterward left New York City and the state with fewer jobs in November than in October. 

 BODY:
Hurricane Sandy wiped out nearly 30,000 jobs in and around New York City last month, the New York State Labor Department said on Thursday.
 The impact of the storm on small businesses and larger companies whose offices could not reopen for weeks afterward left New York City and the state with fewer jobs in November than in October. But the Labor Department also reported that the unemployment rates, which are calculated from a separate survey of employers, fell significantly last month. 
 New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 8.8 percent from 9.2 percent in October and the statewide unemployment rate declined to 8.3 percent from 8.7 percent. Both are still higher than the national unemployment rate, which was 7.7 percent in November.
 In New York City, restaurants and food-service operations in Lower Manhattan were hit particularly hard, said James Brown, principal economist for the labor department. He said the leisure and hospitality sector lost about 8,500 jobs in November, a month when those businesses would normally be adding workers.
 "Restaurant closings and layoffs were widespread in impacted neighborhoods and the relocation of workers from damaged downtown office buildings is hurting holiday catering and corporate cafeterias," Mr. Brown said.
 He said that construction also suffered as many worksites were shut down. The shuttering of office buildings caused some companies to let go temporary workers, he added.
 Still, over the past year, New York City has added about 67,100 private-sector jobs. That gain represents a growth rate of 2 percent, slightly higher than the national job gain of 1.8 percent in the past year, he said.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Downsizes Holiday Parties

BYLINE: MICHAEL KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Banks that once took over entire floors of nightclubs and reserved Midtown steakhouses are downsizing their holiday parties, exchanging Grey Goose vodka for Stolichnaya. 

 BODY:
In the year of Hurricane Sandy, looming fiscal austerity and global scrutiny of banks, Wall Street is just not in a celebratory mood.
Banks that once took over entire floors of Manhattan nightclubs and reserved Midtown steakhouses are continuing to follow restrictions on the office holiday party, many of which have been in place since the 2008 financial crisis.
Witness the scene at the 40/40 Club in New York's Flatiron district on a recent December evening. There was no lavish, companywide affair; instead, a group of 40 Morgan Stanley employees gathered in a private room off to the side of the club. 
 The generous platters of sliders and lobster crab cakes were present. But instead of Grey Goose vodka, there was Smirnoff and Stolichnaya.
"It's probably not going to be caviar and ice sculptures, but it's still going to be something," said Dale Winston, chief executive of the executive search firm Battalia Winston.
Intimate group gatherings, paid for out of pocket by department heads and managing directors, are the new norm. With tighter budgets and dwindling salaries, investment bankers in the bulge bracket can hardly count on dinner, let alone top-shelf liquor.
Smaller holiday gatherings mean more face time with superiors and less opportunity to let loose. A Morgan Stanley financial adviser in Los Angeles described the new, austere conditions as "stiff and boring."
"I went and made sure my managing director saw me, and then I just left," he said. "They've taken what used to be a party and have reduced it to an event where people just meet up and chat."
While the parties are a subject of much conversation, few if any lower-ranking employees are willing to discuss them on the record. Under stern orders not to talk to reporters about anything - including seating arrangements at company get-togethers - workers insisted on anonymity to describe the holiday merrymaking.
Neither Morgan Stanley nor Credit Suisse held company-sponsored holiday parties this year. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and the investment banking division of Bank of America decided against them as well, but departments can do as they please as long as the costs come from their own accounts. Representatives of Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Barclays declined to comment.
The restaurants and other sites the banks once frequented say they are feeling the pinch as "budget conscious" has become a motto of party planners.chains that Wall Street might once have considered déclassé are being welcomed by the staff in accounting.
For example, Brother Jimmy's, a barbecue restaurant with a number of Manhattan locations, catered many more in-house celebrations this year for corporate clients, including major banks, said a spokeswoman, Jenna Fritsche.
The reluctance of Wall Street firms to return to sponsored parties runs contrary to a general resurgence of corporate holiday celebrations. In its annual study, Battalia Winston found that 91 percent of the 105 companies surveyed planned to hold a party this year, up from 74 percent in 2011.
"The banks are still image-conscious," Ms. Winston said. "It's hard to have a party when you're laying people off."
Restaurants and clubs have responded accordingly, convinced that the belt-tightening is here to stay.
"People aren't just going to say, 'I have $10,000, throw me a party,' " said Lauren Menache, a publicist for Berk Communications in New York, which represents high-end group dining spots like Junoon and those owned by the restaurateur Richard Sandoval. "They really want to try and understand where their money is going."
This year, sites like the 40/40 Club, once the beneficiaries of opulent affairs, have shifted their focus to enticing smaller groups with specific food and drink packages.
"Companies are dividing up and having smaller events," said Amber King, director of sales at the 40/40 Club, who has booked parties for three Credit Suisse groups this holiday season, charging around $60 to $150 per person. "That's how they are maintaining costs. Instead of a 500-person gala, firms are holding more intimate, 10- to 80-person events."
Still, the lavish party hasn't completely become a Wall Street myth. Companies in the private equity and hedge fund sectors - which tend to face less public and shareholder scrutiny than investment banks - are free to spend whatever millions their annualized returns will bear.
The downsized gatherings present new challenges to Wall Streeters, particularly younger employees at investment banks. Some have realized that because of budgetary pressures, financial modeling skills won't necessarily guarantee them continued employment or a big year-end bonus. With this in mind, small holiday parties can be an opportunity to impress their bosses with their social panache.
"Even though groups are more aware of their cost structures, the holiday party is still a big deal," a Credit Suisse analyst said, adding that the senior members of his group came around the day of the party and made sure everyone put work aside to attend.
"It's huge in my eyes to have a group outing," another analyst said. "The associates you get to know because you work with them until midnight all the time, but the senior guys leave at 6 and you don't get to chat with them much, so I'm looking forward to it."

HEADLINE: E-Reader Market Shrinks Faster Than Many Predicted

BYLINE: BRIAN X. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Nearly three years after the first iPad, the tablet has come a long way. Now there are plenty of smaller, cheaper tablets that are pretty powerful. So why buy an e-book reader? That appears to be what a lot of people are thinking this year. 

 BODY:
 Nearly three years after the first iPad was introduced, the tablet has come a long way. Now there are plenty of smaller, cheaper tablets that are pretty powerful. So why buy a more primitive e-book reader? 
That appears to be what a lot of people are thinking this year. The research firm the International Data Corporation found a surge in shipments this year of what it called "smart connected devices," including tablets, smartphones and PCs. That market grew 27.1 percent from last year, to 303.6 million shipments, according to IDC.
Meanwhile, e-book readers are losing momentum. This year, worldwide shipments of e-book readers will fall to 14.9 million units from 23.2 million units last year - a 36 percent drop, according to estimates by IHS iSuppli. The research firm eMarketer noted these trends in a report published on Thursday.
Forrester Research is seeing a similar trend. In the United States, manufacturers sold nine million e-book readers this year, down from 15.5 million last year, according to Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. Next year, the number of e-book readers sold will be 7.5 million units, and in 2014 that number will drop to 5.3 million and keep falling from there, Forrester predicts.
Does it make much sense anymore to buy e-book readers? They are still far cheaper than tablets - the cheapest Kindle costs $70, while the cheapest Kindle Fire tablet costs $160. But many people are choosing to pay extra to get the features of a tablet, Ms. Rotman Epps said. In a survey conducted by Forrester, 12 percent of respondents said they had bought a tablet instead of an e-book reader, and 39 percent of tablet owners said they wouldn't buy an e-book reader in the future.
"It's looking like e-readers were a device for a particular moment in time that, more rapidly than we or anyone else thought, has been replaced by a new technology," Ms. Rotman Epps said in an interview.
That doesn't mean Amazon and Barnes & Noble, which have been big sellers of e-book readers, need to worry. Those companies have been offering touch-screen tablets for a while now. The companies that will be most vulnerable to this trend are those that primarily make e-book readers, like Kobo, Ms. Rotman Epps said.

HEADLINE: Empathy as a Path to Climate (and Energy) Progress

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Can the kind of empathy driving a new push on gun control carry over to climate change? 

 BODY:
 Dec. 21, 8:33 a.m. | Updated below | 
David Roberts at Grist yesterday posted a deeply moving essay about using empathy as a means to take on tough issues. He built the piece around President Obama's heartfelt reaction and response to the Connecticut elementary school massacre and, followed by Joe Romm, noted the lack of any such response from the president or society on the greenhouse buildup despite the risk posed by human-driven climate change. (Current and past greenhouse-gas emissions will affect the climate for generations, actually millenniums, to come).
Roberts' piece should be read in full. There's a wonderful section, for example, on the reality that humans' "circle of concern" is rapidly expanding through global connectedness -- echoing my explorations of what I call "Knowosphere" as well as a prediction of Darwin in 1871.
But Roberts' main interest is in harnessing empathy -- for yet-unborn generations as well as today's vulnerable people -- as a path to progress on greenhouse gases. This is where I think his argument, as laid out, weakens. Here's the most relevant portion of the post: 
We know that the decisions we are making today are on track to create irreversible and inexorable changes in the global climate that our children and their children will inherit. We know that those changes threaten to slow or reverse our hard-fought gains in peace and health, leaving our descendants a world in violent, unceasing transition, with rising seas, greater droughts, more intense storms, shifting zones of fertility and disease, and waves of climate refugees. We discovered this not through shock or confrontation but through the slow accumulation and careful interpretation of evidence. It is still, to most people, almost entirely an intellectual phenomenon, something they know but do not feel. Relative to the gut-wrenching images out of Newtown, the evidence of the climate threat to children is, by and large, abstract and ethereal. Even those who "know" the extent of climate change find it difficult to feel authentic moral outrage about it.
Yet for every ton of carbon we emit, we are firing a bullet into the air. We may not live to see it, but those bullets will rain down on the children of the future, and they will suffer for it. Obama said of the nation's young:
 We know we're always doing right when we're taking care of them, when we're teaching them well, when we're showing acts of kindness. We don't go wrong when we do that. 
He also said, of our efforts to protect them: "Surely we can do better."
Yes. Surely we can do better in protecting today's children from random acts of violence. But surely we can also do better in protecting tomorrow's children from suffering that, however distant and theoretical it may seem to us now, will yield just as many broken lives and broken hearts.
It's great to see this line of thinking, and feeling, explored afresh. I've been criticized in the past for seeing work that builds the human capacity for connectedness and empathy as more valuable than demanding targets for the concentration of carbon dioxide.
The problem with the argument for greenhouse-gas action based on morality and empathy is that it clashes with other moral imperatives.
The two billion people on the planet who lack a light bulb or scrabble for firewood for cooking or heat (sometimes getting into knife fights in the process) need affordable, convenient energy sources now -- whether from a solar panel or biogas, or from a conventional power plant or propane tank.
People in fast-growing countries like China and India would almost certainly expect a concerned person in a wealthy nation to recognize the primacy in such places of real-time energy needs over long-term climate concerns. Their leaders absolutely do, and that's why, even though they will be the dominant source of warming gases in coming decades, the climate treaty talks have remained stuck in "you first" mode.
The issue of inter-generational empathy on climate risk butts up against even tougher barriers, the ones that make this a truly "super wicked" problem. One is our habit of "hyperbolic discounting" of long-term, murky threats, but that's just the start. Much more is summarized by Richard Lazarus in a paper (cited here several times) subtitled "Restraining the Present to Liberate the Future."
Read that paper and the vital early paper that underpins it, by Kelly Levin and others, then circle back to the top of this post and consider the response to the Newtown shootings and the realities of global warming.
In the end, I see efforts to boost the global capacity for connectedness and empathy -- to concretize the once-fuzzy notion of the "global village" -- as vital if the goal is a relatively smooth ride for humanity in this century and beyond (along with the capacity for innovation and resilience). Spend 45 minutes with one of my "Knowosphere" talks to get the details.
But it's vital to recognize that a full assessment of moral gaps, and responsibilities, includes far more than figuring out ways to constrain greenhouse gases.
When I do that, the importance of curbing carbon dioxide emissions falls well behind* the immediacy of energy gaps (and work to limit vulnerability of poor places to today's norms for climate and coastal hazards).
I'm sure others considering this question would feel (I use that word with precision; emotions dominate calculations in this arena) differently.
And that, to a significant extent, is the point of this piece.
 1:19 p.m. | Addendum | I encourage you also to consider the latest essay on the climate challenge by Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University: "Truths We Must Tell Ourselves to Manage Climate Change" (Vanderbilt Law Review, Vol. 65, Number 6, pp. 1455-1478).
 Dec. 21, 8:23 a.m. | Amplification | * The line marked by an asterisk, on reflection, is not consistent with my well-established line of thinking. I should have written: 
When I do that, aggressive curbs on carbon dioxide emissions fall well behind the immediacy of filling the world's energy gaps (and work to limit vulnerability of poor places to today's norms for climate and coastal hazards).

HEADLINE: Why Renters Use More Electricity

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Data indicate that a landlord is less likely to invest in Energy Star appliances than a homeowner is, because usually the landlord is not paying the electric bill. 

 BODY:
Why do people buy inefficient refrigerators and clothes washers when spending a little more for an efficient one would save them money over time through lower electricity or water bills? There are a variety of reasons, but one that is persistently cited is that people are not necessarily buying these appliances for themselves. Often the buyer is a landlord, and the user is a tenant who does not make the choice but faces the consequences because he receives the energy bill.
 Now research by Lucas W. Davis and David I. Levine, economists at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley, have attached numbers to that hypothesis, calculating how much more likely an owner-occupied dwelling is to have an Energy Star appliance than a rental unit is. 
The disparities are considerable. For example, in owner-occupied units, 45 percent of the washing machines are Energy Star-rated, but in rental units, only 17 percent are, the two researchers said, citing federal statistics. Even accounting for factors like household income, demographics, energy prices and weather, there are still big differences, they found. 
 Yet window air-conditioners owned by renters are very often Energy Star-rated models, they found. And when the electricity bill is paid by the landlord, that makes the landlord very pragmatic about the choice of appliance or light bulb.
 
The total impact of this behavior on energy consumption is not as large as might be imagined - only about one half of 1 percent of the amount of electricity used in residences nationally, according to a paper by Mr. Lucas. The reason is that even in owner-occupied units, the penetration of Energy Star-rated units is not anywhere near saturation, and those models still use a lot of electricity. The Energy Star appliances, including dishwashers and window air-conditioners, reduce energy consumption by 10 to 30 percent.
 The Energy Star program has assorted problems; some of the models it does not rate are more efficient than the models it does rate, and manufacturers have been known to try to game the system. But over all, the program does generally guide consumers toward efficiency. 
 The results would seem to argue that the most effective Energy Department action on appliances would be to ban the least efficient models rather than award the carrot of the Energy Star seal of approval. 
Landlords whose tenants pay their own electric bills could solve the problem by picking better appliances and thus seeking to gain a competitive advantage in the rental marketplace, but they would probably have trouble convincing a prospective tenant of the benefit, according to earlier research by Mr. Davis.
The researchers' proposed solution was a new parallel to the yellow Energy Guide sticker familiar to consumers who visit appliance stores, which shows the anticipated consumption of a particular refrigerator, dishwasher or other appliance, compared with the full range of models available. 
The two professors suggest a sticker for the whole apartment. And the idea may not require federal action: cities or states could devise such rating systems, they said. 
Among the consequences of the landlord/tenant problem, Mr. Davis wrote, is that raising electricity prices in an effort to cut consumption and thus to drive down carbon emissions will not work very well if one party picks the appliances and another pays the bill.

HEADLINE: Exchange Sale Reflects New Realities of Trading

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: IntercontinentalExchange's $8.2 billion takeover of the New York Stock Exchange illustrates starkly how trading in commodities and derivatives has become much more lucrative than trading in the shares of companies. 

 BODY:
On a warm day in Boca Raton, Fla., the host of a reception for an annual financial conference was not a big bank or a powerful exchange as in years past, but a young firm based in Atlanta.
Guests who gathered at the oceanfront resort were surprised. They were greeted with bottled ice water that carried the company's logo, and as they left, were invited to grab iPod Shuffles.
That event, some four years ago, was the Wall Street equivalent of a coming-out party for the firm, IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, an electronic operator of markets for derivatives and commodities. Now, the markets upstart is announcing itself to a much larger world with an $8.2 billion deal to buy the symbolic cradle of American capitalism, the New York Stock Exchange.
 The takeover illustrates starkly how trading in commodities and derivatives has become much more lucrative than trading in the shares of companies. Warren E. Buffett warned in 2003 that the "derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle," and that the genie, even after a global financial crisis, was not going back. Currently, derivatives - financial bets tied to underlying assets like oil prices or interest rates, among other things - are a $600 trillion market. Even the parent of the N.Y.S.E. attracted its suitor largely because of its ownership of Liffe, a major derivatives exchange in London. 
For many, the Beaux-Arts New York Stock Exchange, and images of traders looking despondent or exuberant on its floor, represent what making money is all about. Yet Wall Street itself has found it more profitable to bet on fluctuations in natural gas or corn or on interest rates. The financial industry often does so electronically and through platforms in cities as scattered as London, Chicago and Atlanta. The biggest bonuses each year are typically for traders who reaped rich gains on these often complex financial products.
That change, decades in the making, has left the New York exchange, with roots going back 220 years, in an increasing difficult position as trading volumes slump and profit margins stay razor thin. While its acquirer has pledged to keep a dual headquarters in the exchange building in Lower Manhattan, as well as in Atlanta, the center of power in finance long ago migrated elsewhere.
The success of the newly combined companies hinges on the derivatives business. ICE is hoping that a greater share of derivatives trading will go through its clearinghouse operations, which act as backstops in case one party defaults. It is being aided by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, which is forcing Wall Street banks to push their derivatives trades into clearinghouses and regulated exchanges.
"For the past decade, our solutions made our markets increasingly electronic and increasingly clear," Jeffrey C. Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said this month. "Today, financial reform is imposing that vision on many markets through a rule-making process."
While Dodd-Frank compliance is still in its early days, and the volume of derivatives trading remains depressed amid broader economic uncertainty, the law is ultimately expected to cement ICE's business model into the regulatory code.
"Despite the complaints, there's no question that at the end of the day, Dodd-Frank will be a financial boon to exchanges," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives.
Still, such a development will not do much for the traditional business of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Sprecher said on Thursday that he was committed to keeping the floor of the exchange open. But according to people briefed on his plans, he intends to use the stock trading operation and its steady cash-generating abilities to finance future deals and expansion efforts.
Nowhere have the changing fortunes of ICE and the parent of the New York exchange, NYSE Euronext, been more apparent than in their value on the stock market. In April 2011, when ICE first tried to acquire NYSE Euronext in league with Nasdaq OMX, it was worth about $1.5 billion less than the New York company. Just over a year later, ICE was worth nearly $4 billion more than NYSE Euronext, even with less than a third of its revenue.
ICE was founded in 2000 by Mr. Sprecher, who began his career developing power plants. In the 1990s, he saw that many power companies and financial firms wanted to hedge their investments in energy with financial contracts, but the market for these contracts was disorganized and opaque.
Mr. Sprecher bought an obscure exchange for buying and selling electricity in Atlanta and turned it into ICE with financing from BP and Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Banks were drawn to the idea of a standardized place to buy and sell derivatives tied to the value of oil and other commodities. But they also hoped to create a competitor to the virtual monopoly position being built up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in futures trading.
"You talk to people in Chicago, they basically think that ICE is just a front for the banks," said Craig Pirrong, an expert in futures trading and director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the University of Houston.
As the company grew through a quick series of acquisitions, Mr. Sprecher won a reputation for being the "enfant terrible" of the energy industry, with a "sharp eye for identifying opportunities and seizing on them in a very aggressive way," Dr. Pirrong said.
Early on, ICE sought to move all trading onto computers, allowing firms to buy and sell contracts 24 hours a day. Soon after buying the International Petroleum Exchange in London, ICE shut down its trading floor.
"They were a technology company from Day 1," said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.
ICE also decided to fashion its own clearinghouse, rather than tap an outsize firm. It expanded through acquisitions, planting the seeds for growth in 2008, when it took over the Clearing Corporation, home to a popular derivative known as a credit-default swap.
The Dodd-Frank overhaul may provide additional benefits for ICE. Under the law, exchanges must turn over public and private information to outside data warehouses, which will, in turn, share the information with regulators. Sensing an opportunity, ICE created its own warehouse, named ICE Trade Vault.
ICE and its Chicago rival, CME Group, have also moved in recent months to convert swaps trades, which are facing more scrutiny under Dodd-Frank, into old-fashioned futures contracts. Futures trading is lucrative territory for the exchanges in part because they can shut out competitors.
"The reality is that there are incentives to convert swaps into futures, where there's less competition," said Richard M. McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, an independent trading platform that is expanding into the swaps business. "There's no requirement for CME and ICE to open their futures clearinghouses to other exchanges."
Despite its growing prominence, ICE has a small footprint in Washington. With only two full-time lobbyists, the company relies on Mr. Sprecher to communicate with regulators.
"Jeff is the company," one official said, though others said he had loosened his grip over the last year or so.
He is well received, officials say, in part because he has embraced some reforms. Unlike executives of other exchanges and financial firms, Mr. Sprecher did not resist an effort in 2009 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to close certain loopholes.
Officials recall him saying, "Tell me what the rules are, and I'll make money with them."

HIGHLIGHT: South Korea elects its first female president, attempts to modernize the French economy, and Roger Federer loves South America. 

 BODY:
 NEWS With the election of Park Geun-hye as president on Wednesday, South Korea extended the tenure of its staunchly pro-American governing party and handed power to the daughter of South Korea's longest-ruling dictator, the first woman to win the post in a deeply patriarchal part of Asia. Choe Sang-Hun reports from Seoul. 
Security officials in China have been rounding up members of the Church of Almighty God, a renegade Christian group whose adherents predict that the world will end on Saturday. Andrew Jacobs reports from Beijing.
The Russian Parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted in support of a bill that would prohibit the adoption of Russian children by American citizens, though it was unclear if President Vladimir V. Putin would allow the ban to go forward. David M. Herszenhorn reports from Moscow.
While the European crisis has made the French aware of the need to modernize the economy, there are mixed signals on whether the government of Francois Hollande is willing to heed the advice. Liz Alderman reports from Paris.
Make some room in the boys' club: It is now mandatory to have female board members in every company and government agency in the United Arab Emirates, according to a new instruction from the U.A.E. government. Sara Hamdan reports from Dubai.
Prosecutors in Stuttgart said on Wednesday that they had charged two former Porsche executives with market manipulation in the carmaker's failed bid to take over Volkswagen several years ago. Melissa Eddy and Nicholas Kulish report from Berlin.
Health warnings should cover 75 percent of cigarette packs but governments should also have leeway to require plain packaging, the European Commission said Wednesday. James Kanter reports from Brussels.
 ARTS Arab cinema is growing up. As the film festival season in the Gulf region drew to an end last Sunday in Dubai, filmmakers from the Arab world and industry-watchers hailed a new wave of indigenous films aimed at an audience accustomed to a mostly foreign blend of Hollywood and Bollywood movies with a dollop of Turkish soaps. Vinita Bharadwaj reports from Dubai.
 SPORTS Roger Federer just completed a lucrative tour of South America-his first as a professional-and is more than glad he did. Christopher Clarey reports from Buenos Aires.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events.
Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Foiled: Tinsel Painting in America' (through Jan. 13) Might tinsel painting, a decorative and resourceful form of picture making that was all the rage during the second half of the 19th century, be due for a comeback? Possibly, to judge from this cluttered but charming show, which seems tailor-made for the Etsy set. It includes some 150 works made by placing crinkly metallic foil under a protective surface of reverse-painted glass, most of them by unidentified artists. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collagelike paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'' ': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 17) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Jan. 6) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the now two-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of a Peasant (Patience Escalier)' (through Jan. 20) ''You'll shortly make the acquaintance of Mr. Patience Escalier -- a sort of man with a hoe, an old Camargue oxherd,'' Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, from the Provençal city of Arles in 1888. His bracingly vivid portrait the same year of this local character, with his grizzled beard and steely blue eyes offset by a ruddy complexion and bright yellow hat, normally resides at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. But for the next few months it can be seen at the Frick as part of an exchange program between the two museums. Installed on a temporary wall in the Oval Room, it shocks the neighboring Whistler portraits with its feral gaze and forthright celebration of hard labor. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Gabriel Orozco: Asterisms' (through Jan. 13) For one-half of this two-part exhibition, Mr. Orozco and his team collected about 1,200 pieces of flotsam and jetsam that washed up on the beach of a nature preserve in Mexico. All are displayed by type in a color-coordinated rectangle on the floor along with framed grids of photographs of each item. A playing field on Pier 40 in Manhattan was similarly combed for detritus. The two presentations resemble exhibitions in a natural history museum. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help being overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (through Jan. 6) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. The exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein-air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (through Jan. 27) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Ken Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (through Jan. 6) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Fantasy and Invention: Rosso Fiorentino and Sixteenth-Century Florentine Drawing' (through Feb. 3) With just under 30 works, including an unfinished Rosso painting on loan from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, a Rosso drawing from the Metropolitan Museum and a smattering of drawings and letters by other Italian masters in the Morgan's collection, this small exhibition is a fine little introduction to the eccentricities of Florentine Mannerism and to one of the style's quirkiest practitioners, who was lauded by Vasari as ''bold and well grounded in draftsmanship, graceful in manner, sublime in the highest flights of the imagination.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2012' (through Feb. 4) In her pellucid photographs, Anne Collier contemplates old record album covers and an Edward Weston photograph in an old MoMA date book. In montages by Michele Abeles we see the bodies of naked men through spaces between grids and stripes cut from other printed materials. Shirana Shahbazi's abstractions picture alluring colors and light of photography itself. Zoe Crosher recycles amateur snapshots by a woman who worked as an escort in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The two members of a team known as Birdhead use nondigital cameras and black-and-white film to shoot scenes in their hometown, Shanghai. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all.

&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke.

&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

&#x2605; National Academy Museum: 'John Cage: the Sight of Silence' (Jan. 13) This solo show of John Cage's lambent late watercolors, produced in the decade or so before his death in 1992, is a superb, late addition to the 2012 Cage centenary year. It's a sort of companion to the Philadelphia Museum of Art's ''Dancing Around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp,'' which focuses on a transformative moment in American modernism when a heroic view of art ended, and another view, cool, wry and brainy, began. (The Philadelphia show runs through Jan. 21.) 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos' (through Jan. 20) This elegant, mind-expanding exhibition sidesteps the standard retrospective format and a linear, canonical version of art history. Ms. Trockel emphasizes her recent work in numerous mediums -- most impressively ceramics, photography and drawing, sharing the spotlight with outsider artists, botanical illustrations and zoological models and even natural specimens. The result is completely entrancing, a celebration of nature and also of human nature -- its curiosity, ingenuity and yearning for expression -- encapsulated by the artist's magnanimous vision. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (through March 10) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a dynamite group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. In the latest edition, ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax, covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- is familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s.

&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Feb. 9) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Smith)
Bob Dylan: 'Revisionist Art' (through Jan. 12) Bob Dylan may be a genius but he's no polymath. His music is great. His attempts at visual art have gone from bad to worse. From paintings based on photographs, he has turned to full-on appropriation with silk-screened works that rejigger the words and pictures on the covers of magazines like Time, Life, Playboy and Rolling Stone. Alternately obscure or obvious, these attempts at social satire suggest that the line between naïveté and cynicism is sometimes very thin. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Ann Hamilton: 'the event of a thread' (through Jan. 6) Art as thought-provoking playground, this elaborate installation-performance piece centers on 42 large swings to be enjoyed by viewers, and the enormous silk curtain hanging among them, from the rafters, that their swinging agitates. A kind of weaving together of language and sound, movement and stillness, form and behavior, public and private, it is the artist's most interactive work yet and a big improvement over her fastidious previous efforts, which often resembled esoteric window displays. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Smith)
Galleries: 57th Street
&#x2605; 'Egon Schiele's Women' (through next Friday) New York's most thorough look at Egon Schiele since a 2005 exhibition at the Neue Galerie finds the artist working through a long and impressively varied list of female models, including his mother; a rebellious sister who sometimes posed nude for him; anonymous pregnant women in a maternity hospital; a pair of young prostitutes known as the ''black-haired girls''; his redheaded lover Wally Neuzil; and his strait-laced bourgeois wife, Edith. In an accompanying book, the gallery owner, Jane Kallir, argues persuasively that Schiele, in contrast to contemporaries like Gustav Klimt, ''did not judge his women; he merely observed.'' Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734, gseart.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Steve Wheeler: 'The Oracle Visiting the 21st Century' (through Dec. 29) This irrepressible group show examines the influence of the Indian Space painter Steve Wheeler (1912-92) on both his own generation and succeeding ones. It includes work by fellow Indian Spacers like Robert Barrell (1912-95), and also finds striking visual analogies in recent efforts by Tom Burckhardt, Elizabeth Murray and Margrit Lewczuk, and especially Luke Gray and Baker Oversteet. But the unquestionable star is the visiting oracle himself, represented in nine works that provide a new sense of artistic breadth.

Agnes Denes: 'Sculptures of the Mind: 1968 to Now' (through Jan. 19) By the end of the 1960s, art's final frontier was mind itself, and Agnes Denes has been one of its brainiest and far-ranging explorers. This much abridged retrospective includes a miniature tableau of skeletons in philosophical conversation, diagrams of a system of symbolic logic that Ms. Denes thought up, and photographs of outdoor works like the wheat field she planted on a parcel of landfill near the World Trade Center in 1982. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450, tonkonow.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Carroll Dunham' (through Jan. 19) All nine of Mr. Dunhams big, comical and exhilarating paintings represent landscapes resembling a South Pacific paradise, with chunky, fat-leafed trees and colorful, spongy flowers. Six feature the figure of a naked woman of heroic proportions with chalk-white skin and untamed black hair drawn in thick black lines, bathing, swimming and cavorting in this Edenic setting. She might be the artist's own inner wild woman. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Keltie Ferris' (through Jan. 12) Keltie Ferris's big, scintillating paintings feel fresh, direct and very much of this moment. That's partly because they seem to picture a kind of visual experience that did not exist before the advent of digital forms of visualization. Made with lively immediacy on canvases up to nearly nine feet in their longest dimensions, they give the impression of computer-screen imagery breaking up into pixels and blurs. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Johnson)
John A. Parks: 'Paint and Memory' (through Jan. 19) The strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on the artist's childhood memories and painted with his fingers. The loosely Pointillist, somewhat Vuillardian hazes of color, light and form that result demarcate trees, gardens, brick buildings, puffy clouds and, above all, scrambling children, whose feral energy and natural subversiveness are vividly conveyed. The distinction between illustration and painting is rendered moot by the teeming quality of both surface and subject. 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel, 532 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (917) 701-3338, 532gallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Charles Ray' (through Jan. 12) This striking show features the sculptor's latest forays into post-Conceptual realism, namely two male nudes -- one standing and one crouching -- and a clothed, homeless woman sleeping on a bench. Oddly luminous, finely detailed, 10 percent larger than life and carved by computer-driven machines in solid stainless steel, they form a beautifully spare arrangement and a cat's cradle of ricocheting ideas that both update and disrupt longstanding sculptural motifs, techniques and traditions. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)
'Arpita Singh' (through Jan. 5) Arpita Singh, who was born in West Bengal in 1937 and has long lived in New Delhi, makes an infrequent New York appearance with this small, fine show of recent watercolors. Ms. Singh began her career as an abstract artist, then switched to painting folkloric scenes of daily life in Bengal before settling on the enigmatic, quasi-narrative mode that has become her signature. And that's what we see here: art that isn't precisely topical or allegorical or autobiographical, but partly all of these.

&#x2605; William Baziotes: 'A Centennial Exhibition: Surrealist Drawings of the 1930s' (through Dec. 29) More low than high, these raucous sometimes ribald figurative images in watercolor and gouache reveal quite a different side of the well-respected second-tier Abstract Expressionist painter best known for the tasteful restraint, diaphanous colors and blurry organic shapes of his mature style. These heady cocktails of Miró, Picasso, Surrealist automatism and sometimes ancient myth also hint at misbehaviors to come, from underground comics to William N. Copley and Peter Saul.

'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Out of Town
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith)
Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: 'Jeremy Deller: Joy in People' (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984. University of Pennsylvania, 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
National Gallery of Art: 'Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' (through Jan. 13) The first major survey of this Pop artist's career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein's large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Dancing Around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp' (through Jan. 21) The Philadelphia show, an ensemble performance composed of entirely stars, with an elusive sun, Marcel Duchamp, at the center, focuses on a transformative moment in American modernism when a heroic view of art ended, and another view, cool, wry and brainy, began. In Manhattan, the most radical of all those stars, John Cage, gets a solo show of his lambent late watercolors in honor of his 2012 centenary year. (That Manhattan show, ''John Cage: The Sight of Silence'' at the National Academy Museum, runs through Jan. 13.) Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Walters Art Museum: 'Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe' (through Jan. 21) This history-rattling exhibition is a visual gift, with marvelous things by artists familiar and revered -- Durer, Rubens, Veronese -- along with images most of us never knew existed. Together, they map a history of art, politics and race that few museums have addressed in full-dress style. Like the best scholarship, the Walters show, organized by Joaneath Spicer, the museum's curator of Renaissance and Baroque art, is as much about questions as answers. It takes a prized piece of art history, one polished to a glow by generations of attention, and turns it in an unexpected direction, so it catches the searching, scouring rays of new investigative light. (From Feb. 16 to June 9 it will be at the Princeton University Art Museum in Princeton, N.J.) 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore, (410) 547-9000, thewalters.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
'Anti-Establishment' (closes on Friday) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultraviolet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Kutlug Ataman: 'Mesopotamian Dramaturgies' (closes on Saturday) In his first show with the gallery Sperone Westwater, the filmmaker Kutlug Ataman ruminates on the cultural and geopolitical forces transforming his home country, Turkey. ''Mayhem,'' the most recent piece (from 2011), involves seven projections of rushing and cascading water that refer obliquely to the Arab Spring. The longer ''Journey to the Moon,'' a split-screen historical fiction, follows Anatolian villagers who make a Sputnik-inspired attempt at space travel in a vehicle fashioned from a minaret and helium balloons. It has elements of ''Waiting for Guffman,'' the Icarus myth and Georges Méliès's ''Voyage Dans la Lune,'' and it should not be missed. Sperone Westwater, 257 Bowery, between Houston and Stanton Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com. (Rosenberg)
Gina Beavers: 'Palate' (closes on Saturday) This promising young artist adds another twist to her skeptical approach to painting by downloading images of plated food and rendering them into low, fairly garish reliefs. The appetizing is rendered unappetizing, and painterliness turns aggressive. The resulting bulked-up Photo Realism lacks the rawness of her previous work but makes one look forward to a more complete integration of her talents. Clifton Benevento, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-6325, cliftonbenevento.com. (Smith)
Alice Channer: 'Cold Blood' (closes on Sunday) In Alice Channer's promising United States solo debut the body is elusive and amphibious; just when you think you've pinned it down, it changes form or acquires a new habitat. It helps that Ms. Channer embraces a wide range of materials, bringing to mind post-Minimalist sculptors like Lynda Benglis as well as digital-age painter-printmakers like Wade Guyton. In ''Primordial Fluids,'' for instance, two long swaths of silk-spandex fabric hang from the ceiling, each bearing a stretched-out image of a white shampoo bottle and strands of brown hair. Lisa Cooley, 107 Norfolk Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 680-0564, lisa-cooley.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Paul DeMuro: 'Revelations' (closes on Saturday) Paul DeMuro's New York solo debut sparks with all kinds of painterly electricity, combining 1980s Neo-Expressionism, for instance, with up-to-the-minute techno-shamanism. Almost all the paintings are built around blue, green and purple diamond shapes and Xs that look a bit like quartz crystals, with their subtle gradations of color and ridged brush strokes. But most of the action takes place along the edges, where silhouettes of hands and flowers (along with various abstract flourishes) creep into the central areas of the canvas and disrupt their talismanic formalism. Zürcher Studio, 33 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 777-0790, galeriezurcher.com. (Rosenberg)
Olafur Eliasson: 'Volcanoes and Shelters' (closes on Saturday) For his seventh exhibition at this gallery, Olafur Eliasson, the Icelandic-Danish artist known for perception-altering environments, mostly pays a refreshingly back-to-basics homage to Iceland's natural wonders. Photographs of its many volcanoes and hot springs and the isolated huts and cottages built for the enjoyment of them culminate in a gorgeous Richard Long-like floor piece made of chunks of obsidian, or volcanic glass. The strobe-lighted miniature fountains sequestered in a darkened gallery seem superfluous. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Tom Fairs: 'Drawings June-July 2004' (closes on Sunday) The almost demonic energy of the small, concentrated plein-air drawings by the British artist Tom Fairs (1925-2007) shines forth in this exhibition of a dozen examples from 2004. Fairs's prolix vocabulary of graphite marks conveys trees, bushes, pathways and the occasional brick wall with a nearly photographic rightness. The uncanny coalescences of surface texture and observed life are supremely satisfying to look at. Kerry Schuss, 34 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-9918, kerryschuss.com. (Smith)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (closes on Friday) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s.

HEADLINE: Proposal Would Force Bank Loan Write-Downs

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
An accounting rule that would often force banks to take loan write-downs well before loans actually go bad was preliminarily proposed on Thursday by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets American accounting rules.
The proposal appears likely to lead to greater write-downs -- and thus earlier losses -- than one being considered by international rule makers.
''The global financial crisis highlighted the need for improvements in the accounting for credit losses on loans and other debt instruments held as investments,'' said Leslie F. Seidman, the chairwoman of the board. The proposed model from FASB (pronounced FASS-bee) ''would require more timely recognition of expected credit losses and more transparent information about the reasons for any changes in those estimates.'' 
The new rules, which are unlikely to actually take effect for several years, were initiated by complaints that banks were unable to write down the value of loans as soon as they should have as the financial crisis was growing. Under the exposure draft issued by the board, banks would frequently evaluate the expected cash flows from groups of loans and securities they owned, and take write-downs to the extent they expect the cash flow to be lower than called for in the loan documents.
As a practical matter, it seems likely that any bank making a loan would almost immediately have to write down the value of the loan, even though nothing indicated that particular loan was likely to go bad, simply because experience would indicate that some percentage of similar loans do wind up defaulting.
The value would then be adjusted each quarter, based on changes in conditions. An improving economy might make defaults seem less likely and cause banks to write up the value of loans on their books, thus raising reported profits.
But the initial write-down could mean that banks with limited capital would be constrained from making as many loans as they otherwise would make.
The International Accounting Standards Board plans to propose its rule early next year, enabling people to compare them when they file comments. The principal difference is that the rule that board plans to propose would limit the initial write-down to the losses expected during the first year the loan was outstanding, rather than over its entire life.
The two boards had reached agreement on the set of principles contained in the I.A.S.B. proposal, but the American board backed away from them in a joint meeting in July, leaving Hans Hoogervorst, the chairman of the international board, sputtering with frustration.
The Americans switched course at least partly because bank regulators feared that under the agreement banks might be too slow to write down the value of loans that could go bad, making the banks appear to be better capitalized than they really were.
The international regulators privately argued that the pricing of loans reflected the degree of loss expected, therefore there was no need for an initial write-down. They agreed to the limited first-year write-down in what they saw as a compromise with the Americans, only to have the Americans walk away from it.
Under either rule, the change in accounting will be significant. Current rules refer to ''incurred losses,'' in which loans are written down as it becomes clear that a particular loan is likely to default.
Those rules stemmed from what were seen as abuses in a previous era, as banks used loan loss reserves to smooth reported profits. Now banks will have more flexibility.
The American board said it expected the rule to cover bonds as well as loans, but some details remained vague and were likely to be fleshed out after the two boards considered public comments.
The comment period for the American proposal will end April 30.

HEADLINE: ConAgra Raises Forecast as Earnings Exceed Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ConAgra Foods, the maker of Chef Boyardee pasta and Hunt's ketchup, raised its full-year earnings forecast after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results in the wake of acquisitions and strong sales in its consumer foods business. 
ConAgra said last month that it would buy Ralcorp Holdings for $5 billion, to become the top American producer of private-label foods that stores brand as their own.
It said its full-year earnings forecast did not include any benefit from the purchase of Ralcorp. Consumer food brands ConAgra sells include Act II, Hebrew National, Marie Callender's and Orville Redenbacher.
ConAgra has been increasing its presence in the private-label foods business, which often outpaces brand name food as consumer spending is squeezed by the lingering economic downturn.
This year ConAgra bought Odom's Tennessee Pride, which makes breakfast sandwiches and sausage, and Kangaroo, which makes pita chips. It struck a deal in July to buy Unilever North America's frozen meal business for $265 million.
ConAgra now predicts earnings of at least $2.06 a share for the 12 months ending May 13. It had forecast earnings of $2.03 to $2.06 a share for the period. Analysts on average were expecting $2.07 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
The company, which is based in Omaha, predicted marketing investments would improve consumer food sales this year.
ConAgra's profit rose to $211.6 million, or 51 cents a share, in the quarter ended Nov. 25, the company's second fiscal quarter, from $180.2 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 57 cents a share from continuing operations, topping Wall Street expectations by 2 cents.
''The results reflect the number of deals they have done over the past year,'' said Erin Lash, a Morningstar analyst.
Sales rose 9 percent to $3.74 billion. Consumer foods sales rose 11 percent to contribute 64 percent to total revenue. Analysts on average had expected sales of $3.69 billion. Sales in the commercial foods business rose 5 percent, helped by strong sales at its Lamb Weston potato business outside the United States.
ConAgra's shares closed at $30.16 on Thursday, up 0.7 percent, or 20 cents.

HEADLINE: 3rd-Quarter Growth Is Revised Up to 3.1%, With Help From Exports

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the third quarter as exports increased, consumers spent more and state and local governments added to growth for the first time in three years. 
The Commerce Department's third and final estimate Thursday of growth for July through September was increased from its previous estimate of a 2.7 percent annual growth rate.
Growth in the third quarter was more than twice the 1.3 percent growth in the second quarter. But disruptions from Hurricane Sandy and uncertainty weighing on consumers and businesses from the budget negotiations in Washington are likely to restrain growth in the fourth quarter, according to analysts' forecasts. Many analysts predict an annual growth rate of just 1.5 percent for this quarter.
Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, said the revision of third-quarter growth did not change his view that the economy is slowing in the current quarter to an annual growth rate below 2 percent. Mr. Kavcic said a temporary increase in military spending and business stockpiling in the third quarter probably is being reversed this quarter.
And many economists are not expecting much improvement in the first quarter of 2013. The latest forecast by 48 economists for the National Association for Business Economics is for an annual growth rate of just 1.8 percent in January through March. Such growth is considered too weak to significantly reduce the unemployment rate, which was 7.7 percent in November.
But if Congress and the White House reach agreement to avoid tax increases and spending cuts, growth could accelerate next year, many economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said.
The Fed said last week it would keep an important interest rate at a record low as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent. It forecast that unemployment would stay that high until late 2015.
The government's final estimate of a 3.1 percent growth rate for third-quarter gross domestic product is a sharp improvement over its initial estimate of 2 percent -- a figure that it later increased to 2.7 percent based on a buildup in business stockpiles.
The further increase this month reflected stronger consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity. The government said consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter. Its previous estimate was 1.4 percent.
The Commerce Department also raised its estimate of spending by state and local governments to show a gain of 0.3 percent -- the first quarterly increase in three years. State and local governments had been cutting payrolls and other spending in the aftermath of the recession. Total government spending grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the third quarter, reflecting a surge in military spending.
The economy was also helped by trade in the third quarter. Exports grew at a faster pace than previously estimated.
The National Association for Business Economics forecasting panel has said it expects G.D.P. to grow 2.1 percent in 2013, little changed from the expected 2.2 percent expansion this year.

HEADLINE: American Empire

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Like one of those optical illusions that can be viewed as two completely different things, Patrea Patrick's ''American Empire'' will give you whiplash. At first glance this eye-rollingly melodramatic documentary seems to be a left-wing attack on unbounded corporate power. Just squint a little, however, and you'll see a right-wing conspiracy rant whose attacks on the Federal Reserve would make Ron Paul thrill. 
Positing that multinational corporations have created a ''cartel economy'' bent on world domination -- and that our major financial and governmental institutions are using military force to further that goal -- the film juggles multiple issues with more scare mongering than substance. Though a section on agribusiness and control of the world's food and water supplies is clearly laid out and undeniably troubling, the bulk of the material is confusing at best and laughable at worst.
But whether sensible or nonsensical, the film's claims arrive wrapped in a thick coating of dread, thanks to Ms. Patrick's spooky-low narration, which makes signing a document sound as sinister as casting a spell.
Just because she's paranoid, however, doesn't mean her fears that the ultrarich are destroying the planet are unfounded. Persuading others, though, will take more than a mishmash of reggae music, burning bank notes and repeated, blurry shots of the Constitution. It will also require a more thorough sampling of respected thinkers like Tariq Ali and rather less of lightning rods like G. Edward Griffin (whose signature work about the Federal Reserve, ''The Creature From Jekyll Island,'' has been debunked). If ever a movie cried out for footnotes, it's this one.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Patrea Patrick 1 hour 36 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: National Rifle (Selling) Association

 BODY:
The National Rifle Association is scheduled to hold a news conference on Friday where it says it plans to provide details about its promise of ''meaningful contributions'' to prevent another a massacre like the one in Newtown, Conn.
We would like to believe that the N.R.A., the most influential opponent of sensible gun-control policies, will do as it says, but we have little faith that it will offer any substantial reforms. The association presents itself as a grass-roots organization, but it has become increasingly clear in recent years that it represents gun makers. Its chief aim has been to help their businesses by increasing the spread of firearms throughout American society. 
In recent years, the N.R.A. has aggressively lobbied federal and state governments to dilute or eliminate numerous regulations on gun ownership. And the clearest beneficiary has been the gun industry -- sales of firearms and ammunition have grown 5.7 percent a year since 2007, to nearly $12 billion this year, according to IBISWorld, a market research firm. Despite the recession, arms sales have been growing so fast that domestic manufacturers haven't been able to keep up. Imports of arms have grown 3.6 percent a year in the last five years.
The industry has, in turn, been a big supporter of the N.R.A. It has contributed between $14.7 million and $38.9 million to an N.R.A.-corporate-giving campaign since 2005, according to a report published last year by the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit group that advocates greater gun control. The estimate is based on a study of the N.R.A.'s ''Ring of Freedom'' program and very likely understates the industry's total financial support for the association, which does not publicly disclose a comprehensive list of its donors and how much they have given.
Officials from the N.R.A. have repeatedly said their main goal is to protect the Second Amendment rights of rank-and-file members who like to hunt or want guns for protection. But that claim is at odds with surveys that show a majority of N.R.A. members and a majority of American gun owners often support restrictions on gun sales and ownership that the N.R.A. has bitterly fought.
For instance, a 2009 poll commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that 69 percent of N.R.A. members would support requiring all sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks of prospective buyers, which they do not have to do now and which the N.R.A. has steadfastly argued against. If lawful gun owners are willing to subject themselves to background checks, why is the association resisting? Its position appears only to serve the interest of gun makers and dealers who want to increase sales even if it means having dangerous weapons fall into the hands of criminals and violent individuals.
Businesses and special-interest groups often cloak their profit motives in the garb of constitutional rights -- think Big Tobacco and its opposition to restrictions on smoking in public places and bold warnings on cigarette packages. The Supreme Court has made clear that the right to bear arms is not absolute and is subject to regulations and controls. Yet the N.R.A. clings to its groundless arguments that tough regulations violate the Second Amendment. Many of those arguments serve no purpose other than to increase the sales of guns and bullets.
This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/gunchallenge.

HEADLINE: Coming of Age at a Sour Time

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Have you been naughty or nice?
Whether you are a child writing to Santa or someone a little older taking stock of 2012 and preparing resolutions for 2013, this is the time of year a lot of us reflect on our personal performance.
One yardstick is moral or religious: Was I good? But another way we judge ourselves -- and another reason the very act of self-measurement feels virtuous, like cleaning your house or exercising -- is on our professional accomplishments. Did I work hard? Did I work smart? Did I get a raise? Did I land a good job? 
This culture of self-improvement is made manifest in the forest of self-help books, which defy the secular decline of the publishing industry, and in their more highbrow older brothers, literary best sellers like ''The Power of Habit'' or ''How Children Succeed,'' which deploy more serious science and more stylish turns of phrase to teach us how to win, or how to raise children who will.
The baby boomers were enthusiastic consumers and producers of this individualistic approach to life. They were right to be. In North America and in Europe, they came of age at a time of robust economic growth. The social and economic trends that went along with that prosperity tended both to erode many traditional institutions -- the patriarchal family, the church, the geographical community -- and to create more personal freedom.
The result was an era of unprecedented individual choice and unprecedented individual opportunity. You really could build it yourself, and today's silver-haired generation did. Their children have not rebelled against those values -- they have doubled down on them. Even in many European and Asian societies that had retained traditional family structures and community ties, in long defiance of the economic currents pushing against them, young people today are leading lives driven and shaped by personal choice.
That's why our new era of slow economic growth will be a personal shock, as well as a political one. Today's young people have been reared on optimism and the power of individual choice. But they are coming of age at a sour time, when big, impersonal, structural forces will usually trump the efforts of even the grittiest and most ingenious and hardest working of individuals.
In an influential study, Lisa B. Kahn, an economist at the Yale School of Management, in Connecticut, found that coming of age during a poor economy had a serious financial impact on the rising generation. Initially, their incomes fell between 6 percent and 7 percent for each percentage point increase in unemployment. Crucially, this penalty persisted over time: 15 years later, their incomes were still knocked back 2.5 percent.
''Taken as a whole, the results suggest that the labor market consequences of graduating from college in a bad economy are large, negative and persistent,'' Dr. Kahn writes. ''This is suggestive that workers who graduate in bad economies are unable to fully shift into better jobs after the economy picks up.''
These economic headwinds are a personal tragedy -- millions of them. They are also a million personal disenchantments and maybe the beginning of a tectonic cultural shift. Recent political contests in the United States and Europe have taught us to connect our beliefs about personal agency with partisan politics: The right thinks individuals are the masters of their own destiny; the left wants government to extend a helping hand.
Of course, that broad caricature overlooks the ways in which conservatives have often privileged community needs -- those of family, faith and country -- over personal ones, while liberals have argued that personal happiness trumps everything else. Moreover, a preference for personal explanations over collective ones -- the self-help book, rather than the political movement -- can be a generational matter, rather than a political one.
Consider the finding by Paola Giuliano, of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Antonio Spilimbergo, of the International Monetary Fund, in a 2009 paper, that ''recessions have a long-lasting effect on individuals' beliefs.'' Dr. Giuliano and Dr. Spilimbergo found that ''individuals growing up during recessions tend to believe that success in life depends more on luck than on effort.'' They also ''support more government redistribution, but are less confident in public institutions.''
This research suggests we could be at the dawn of a profound cultural shift. Shamus Khan, a sociologist at Columbia University, in New York, told me that a widely shared conviction that individual effort determines individual reward -- that we are the beneficiaries of hard work and talent, rather than luck and circumstance -- is one of the central underpinnings of our current social and political order. The plutocrats think they built it themselves; ordinary Joes think if they get the right retraining and read the right self-help books, they can become winners, too.
The individualistic ethos is tremendously appealing -- especially for those of us who have been raised in it. But for today's rising generation, which is coming of age at a time of fierce economic challenges, it is unlikely to square with their personal experience. When unemployment is high and economic growth is sluggish, whether you are naughty or nice doesn't matter so much. What counts is how generous Santa's presents are and whether he exists at all.

1912 Opium Suppression Hampered
PEKING -- The agitation in connection with the opium question is rapidly reaching a crisis, owing to the persistent demands made by the British Legation for an indemnity for breaches of the opium agreements and the re-issue of the instructions prohibiting the suppression of the retail trade in the provinces in which the cultivation has not been suppressed. The Chinese maintain that the suppression of the business of retail dealers is a necessary measure in the anti-opium campaign, which has been hampered by the existing agreements. There is no doubt that if China boldly repudiated the agreements on this ground she would receive the moral support of the British public and the civilized world generally.

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court today [Dec. 20] turned thumbs down on the use of evidence obtained by Federal agents through wire-tapping in a seven-to-two opinion which reversed an earlier finding by a district court of appeals. The majority opinion was read by Associate Justice Owen D. Roberts, Associate Justice George Sutherland and James C. McReynolds dissented. During the prohibition era, Federal agents obtained convictions against alcohol smugglers on four counts on evidence obtained by tapping telephone wires. Appeals were entered and the district court of appeals upheld the legality of the government's evidence. The high court said today, however, that the 1934 Federal Communications Act outlawed the use of such testimony in Federal courts.
1962 Joblessness Adds to U.K. Woes
LONDON -- Britain suffered its second economic jolt in as many days today [Dec. 20] when the Labor Ministry announced that the number of unemployed increased by 21,500 last month to 566,000. That is the highest number of jobless in Britain since January-February, 1959. The total is expected to exceed 600,000 by the end of the year. The higher jobless figure came one day after the Treasury reported that Britain's industrial production index had dropped three points in October. That meant output levels were back to those of last March and April. They were only slightly higher than the marks recorded for the same period in 1961. The production index drop confirmed complaints recently by industrialists here that output was falling.

HEADLINE: Resounding Victory in Indian Vote Nudges Polarizing Figure Closer to a Larger Race

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS; Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Haresh Pandya from Rajkot, India.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The polarizing leader of the western state of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, inched closer on Thursday to becoming the leading political challenger to India's dominant Gandhi family by winning a resounding re-election as chief minister.
''My biggest dream is to serve my masses, my people,'' Mr. Modi said in a speech before a cheering throng that eventually began to shout ''Delhi, Delhi, Delhi,'' and then amended that to ''P.M., P.M., P.M.,'' signaling a hope that he wins the post of prime minister in national elections scheduled for 2014. 
Mr. Modi had campaigned in the Gujarati language, but he gave his widely televised victory speech in Hindi -- a clear sign that his intended audience extended well beyond his 60 million constituents. His message in the speech, as it has been throughout his campaign, was that he has brought wealth to Gujarat, which lies on the coast of the Arabian Sea, by encouraging economic development. His party won 115 seats in the state legislature. Although a decline of two seats, it is nonetheless a comfortable majority in a house of 182 seats.
Mr. Modi is a prominent politician in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which for years tried to win elections by uniting the country's Hindu majority -- in part by demonizing its Muslim minority. Indeed, shortly after Mr. Modi came to power a decade ago, riots convulsed Gujarat and cost the lives of about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Mr. Modi has been accused of not doing enough to stop the riots and of possibly of encouraging them, making him one of the most divisive figures in Indian politics.
He has since sought to broaden his national appeal by softening his overt Hindu nationalism and instead claiming the mantle of good governance and economic growth. In a country where new corruption scandals seem to emerge every month and economic growth has slowed, that message may have broad resonance.
But whether minorities and moderate Hindus in the rest of India will forgive or forget the government failures during the 2002 riots is very much of an open question.
Indeed, some leading members of the Bharatiya Janata Party have resisted Mr. Modi's rising prominence because they fear that he will cost the party votes among religious minorities.
Nitish Kumar, the powerful chief minister of Bihar in the northeast, has promised to withdraw his support for the Bharatiya Janata Party if it selects Mr. Modi as its prime ministerial candidate for 2014. That would reduce the party's chances of gaining a majority in the national Parliament, but whether Mr. Kumar would follow through on his threat is uncertain.
Mr. Modi's role in the 2002 riots has long been a concern for governments in the West. The United States refuses to provide Mr. Modi with a visa.
But as he grows into a national political figure, more Western countries may rethink their refusal to talk with him in an official capacity. In October, Britain ended a 10-year diplomatic boycott of Mr. Modi when its high commissioner met with him for 50 minutes.
India's religious, caste and regional differences have increasingly splintered the country's politics. Since Hindus represent 80 percent of the electorate, they could dominate national politics if they managed to overcome the caste differences that divide them. But caste has long been the dominant nexus of Indian politics. The Bharatiya Janata Party has led the national government for only one period, from 1998 to 2004.
Leaders of the party said that Mr. Modi had solidified his place as one of India's most important politicians, although top party officials refused to speculate on whether he would be its candidate for prime minister in 2014.
''This shows the people's confidence and trust in the B.J.P. and Narendra Modi's leadership,'' said Dhansukh Bhanderi, a top party official.
Mr. Modi's opponents played down the importance of his victory. Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister and a leader of the governing Indian National Congress Party, said in a televised interview that he thought it had done well on Thursday because Mr. Modi had not managed to expand his political dominance in Gujarat.
In a related political development, it was announced Thursday that the Congress Party had defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party in state assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, a hilly state in the Himalayas. The victory was an important balm to the Congress Party, which has been buffeted in recent years by corruption allegations and the rise of regional parties.
The election in Himachal Pradesh was between two political leaders who have traded control over the state between them for decades. Virbhadra Singh, 78, of the Congress Party, is now expected to become the state's chief minister, a post he has already held four times. Prem Kumar Dhumal, 68, will resign after having served two nonconsecutive terms as chief minister.

HEADLINE: South Korean President-Elect Calls for Reconciliation After Tight Race

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's president-elect, Park Geun-hye, called for national reconciliation on Thursday, a day after she was elected as the country's first female leader in a close contest that reflected generational divides and growing unease over North Korea's military threat.
Ms. Park, 60, the daughter of South Korea's longest-ruling dictator, won 51.6 percent of the votes cast on Wednesday to choose a successor to President Lee Myung-bak, who was barred by law from seeking a second term.
''I will reflect various opinions of the people, whether they have supported or opposed me,'' Ms. Park said in a speech Thursday. She pledged ''impartiality,'' ''national harmony'' and ''reconciliation,'' saying she would bring people into her government ''regardless of their regional background, gender and generation.'' 
She also promised ''the sharing of fruits of economic growth,'' mindful of doubts that her conservative party, the governing Saenuri Party, would address the widening income gap that was one of the biggest issues in the campaign.
Ms. Park on Wednesday became the first presidential candidate to win a majority of the vote since South Korea adopted a democratic constitution in 1987. But the campaign hardly put the country's divisions to rest. It rekindled a dispute over the legacy of Ms. Park's father, Park Chung-hee, who remains a polarizing figure 33 years after his iron-fisted rule ended with his assassination in 1979.
It also highlighted a generational divide over issues like North Korea and the powerful, family-controlled business conglomerates known as chaebol. Exit polls indicated that Ms. Park won twice as many votes among people 50 and older than did her main rival, Moon Jae-in, but only half as many among voters in their 20s and 30s.
She defeated Mr. Moon in most provinces and big cities. But Seoul and the southwestern provinces of North and South Jeolla, traditionally a progressive stronghold, chose the liberal Mr. Moon, who championed bold economic investment in North Korea as a means of inducing denuclearization and more aggressive measures to tame the conglomerates, which have been widely blamed for growing economic inequality. Mr. Moon won 48 percent of the vote nationwide.
Ms. Park met Thursday with the ambassadors from the United States, China, Japan and Russia, the four other countries involved with the two Koreas in talks over the North's nuclear weapons programs.
Worries over the North's weapons programs flared again last week with the launching of a long-range rocket that many saw as a test of its missile capabilities. Such missiles could eventually be used to deliver a nuclear weapon.
Ms. Park on Thursday referred to the launching as ''a symbolic demonstration of how serious a challenge we face in national security.''
She has, however, promised to be more open to the North than Mr. Lee, who took a hard-line approach that many South Koreans felt proved to be counterproductive.
''North Korea will wait a few months to see if Park Geun-hye will appease it with money,'' said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul. ''If she does not -- and it looks unlikely that she will, given her statements so far and the hard-liners surrounding her -- then North Korea will launch provocations.''
With Ms. Park's election, South Korea extended the tenure of its staunchly pro-American governing party and handed power to the first woman to win the post in a deeply patriarchal part of Asia. Voters appeared to prefer stability over Mr. Moon's calls for radical change.
''This is a victory for the people's wish to overcome crises and revive the economy,'' Ms. Park told her cheering supporters after the results came in, a crowd that had gathered in freezing weather in downtown Seoul to celebrate a woman whose steeliness in the face of adversity is legend. According to her memoir, when told of her father's assassination in 1979, she responded, ''Is everything all right along the border with North Korea?''
In its starkest terms, this election was about South Korea's continuing confrontation with its authoritarian past, and confusion over whether a conservative or liberal approach would best serve the country as it tries to stop North Korea's excesses and to handle growing frustration over economic inequality without derailing the country's economic miracle. Mr. Moon, a former human rights lawyer who was once imprisoned for opposing the authoritarian rule of Ms. Park's father, campaigned on restoring liberal policies from the early 2000s, including a warm embrace of North Korea as a way of trying to curb its aggression.
While Ms. Park's run for president was pioneering in one important way, because of her gender, few see her victory as likely to significantly change the lot of women anytime soon in a traditional society where, despite some strong inroads in business and government, women's most important job is still considered to be raising children. In an assessment echoed by voters, analysts said the clearest indication that little was changing was that Ms. Park won in good part on the appeal that a man -- her father -- still holds for many in a country still deeply divided over his legacy.
''Her election was less to do with her gender and more to do with the fact that she was her father's daughter,'' said Kim Ji-yoon, research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. Her father's rule is remembered by many with bitterness; his government jailed and tortured many dissidents -- whom he painted as Communist sympathizers helping North Korea -- and even banned rock music and miniskirts.
But he is consistently voted the most popular former president in polls for his role in birthing the vibrant South Korean economy, a rapid rise from the ruins of the Korean War that has built a thriving middle class, made South Korean companies feared competitors and restored the nation's dignity.
Still, Ms. Park will have to contend with the fallout from that success, and her father's role in it. One of the abiding themes of the campaign was the clamor for more economic equality and a reining in of the conglomerates like Samsung that Mr. Park helped build with government largess. Those companies power the economy, but their unruly expansion in recent years is blamed for aggravating the gap between rich and poor.
In the end, South Koreans appeared to prefer Ms. Park's calls to overhaul the chaebol over time to the more aggressive approach suggested by her rival, Mr. Moon. Indeed, what appeared to separate the two candidates throughout the election was how far they would go in implementing change.
Mr. Moon campaigned on a return to the Sunshine Policy, a combination of investments and aid to the North. Although Ms. Park criticized the incumbent Mr. Lee's ''inflexible'' policy, she prefers a cautious rapprochement. She said she would decouple humanitarian aid from politics and try to meet the new North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. But she insisted, like Mr. Lee, that any large-scale investments be conditional on progress in ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
While Ms. Park's stance may pose something of a challenge to the Obama administration's policy on North Korea -- which had been in lock step with Mr. Lee's -- analysts say it will be much easier for the United States to work with her on the issue than with Mr. Moon.
On Wednesday, President Obama congratulated Ms. Park in a statement, while noting ''admiration for all President Lee has done to strengthen relations'' between the United States and South Korea.
Ms. Park's political career was born in family tragedy. Her mother was killed by a Communist agent in 1974 when Ms. Park was 22 and a student in Paris; she abandoned her studies to return to Seoul and serve as acting first lady. Five years later, her father was killed by his disgruntled spy chief.
Ms. Park retired from public view, as the country eventually turned from authoritarianism in the late 1980s, with many vilifying her father as a dictator. She returned to political life only in 1998 with a vow to ''save the country,'' which was struggling with the Asian financial crisis. Voters who remembered her father's charismatic leadership elected her to a seat in Parliament by a landslide margin, and she has held on to that seat ever since, building a reputation as a principled and tough-minded leader.
''Her image among her supporters is a stable leader, calm during crises, strong and dependable,'' said Choi Jin, head of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.
Throughout the campaign, Ms. Park, who never married, said that her gender would be an asset in leading the nation in difficult times. ''I have no family to take care of,'' she said. ''I have no child to inherit my properties. You, the people, are my only family, and to make you happy is the reason I do politics.''

HEADLINE: Faltering Budget Talks Hit Markets

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Asian shares and United States stock index futures fell sharply in early trading on Friday after a Republican proposal to fend off a fiscal crunch failed to get enough support, deepening uncertainty over prospects for negotiations to avert automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to start in January.
''Markets dislike signs of further delay in talks, with the risk that a deal may not be reached by the end-of-the-year deadline,'' said Yuji Saito, director of foreign exchange at Credit Agricole in Tokyo. ''It clearly hit risk sentiment.'' 
Assets that carried a risk of devaluation were sold off, from stock shares to oil to currencies like the Australian dollar and the euro, which fell while the Japanese yen rose slightly.
Futures on the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index fell 1.5 percent on worries over the breakdown.
Earlier on Thursday, global shares rose as lawmakers in Washington continued in their budget negotiations, but gold prices tumbled to their lowest level since August on a burst of year-end selling.
Wall Street rebounded from early losses, after the House speaker, John Boehner, said he would keep working on a solution to the budget negotiations. Republicans in the House pushed ahead with their own plan to avoid a series of tax increases and spending cuts expected next month, complicating negotiations with the White House. President Obama has vowed to veto the plan, which would raise taxes only on the wealthiest Americans.
''Speaker Boehner went on the air and basically told us he doesn't like what the president's doing or not doing, and the markets rallied on that, which was kind of weird,'' said Stephen Guilfoyle, a trader at Meridian Equity Partners in New York.
When that plan fell apart, well after the close of market trading, stock index futures, and Asian shares went into a swoon.
Investors have hoped for an agreement soon, but progress has been slow.
The lack of progress in Washington kept most markets in a virtual holding pattern. Currencies held to tight ranges in thin preholiday trade, and the euro seesawed against the dollar. In commodities markets, crude oil futures edged higher while Brent futures slid in choppy trade.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 59.75 points, or 0.45 percent, at 13,311.72 on Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 7.88 points, or 0.55 percent, at 1,443.69. The Nasdaq composite index was up 6.02 points, or 0.20 percent, at 3,050.39.
NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, had the biggest gains on Thursday, surging 34.1 percent to $32.25, after the IntercontinentalExchange said it would buy the company for $8.2 billion. Intercontinental rose 1.4 percent to $130.10.
The MSCI world equity index, which has risen steadily over the last five weeks on optimism that a budget deal would clear the way for stronger growth in 2013, was up 0.2 percent to near 343 points on Thursday. It remains near levels last seen in July 2011.
In Europe, shares stuttered as indexes approached levels considered overbought. The FTSEurofirst 300 closed virtually unchanged at 1,142.80 points.
In currency markets, investors struggled to gauge developments on the American budget talks against a backdrop of generally positive economic data in the United States.
The euro recouped earlier losses to gain 0.1 percent at $1.3226. On Wednesday, the euro hit an eight-and-a-half-month high of $1.3308.
In the oil market, crude in the United States settled 0.17 percent higher at $90.13 a barrel, after trading $89.26 to $90.54 a barrel in a thin market.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 98 14/32, and the yield fell to 1.80 percent from 1.81 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: With Farm Bill Stalled, Consumers May Face Soaring Milk Prices

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Forget the fiscal crisis and the automatic budget cuts. Come Jan. 1, there is a threat that milk prices could rise to $6 to $8 a gallon if Congress does not pass a new farm bill that amends farm policy dating back to the Truman presidency.
Lost in the political standoff between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans over the budget is a virtually forgotten impasse over a farm bill that covers billions of dollars in agriculture programs. Without last-minute Congressional action, the government would have to follow an antiquated 1949 farm law that would force Washington to buy milk at wildly inflated prices, creating higher prices in the dairy case. Milk now costs an average of $3.65 a gallon. 
Higher prices would be based on what dairy farm production costs were in 1949, when milk production was almost all done by hand. Because of adjustments for inflation and other technical formulas, the government would be forced by law to buy milk at roughly twice the current market prices to maintain a stable milk market.
But the market would be anything but stable. Farmers, at first, would experience a financial windfall as they rushed to sell dairy products to the government at higher prices than those they would get on the commercial market. Then the prices customers pay at the supermarket would surge as shortages developed and fewer gallons of milk were available for consumers and for manufacturers of products like cheese and butter.
For dairy farmers like Dean Norton in upstate New York, who are struggling with high feed costs caused by this summer's drought, a jump in prices would be welcomed.
''But it would be short-term euphoria followed by a long hangover that would be difficult for us to recover from,'' said Mr. Norton, who is president of the New York Farm Bureau. ''I don't think customers and food processors are going to pay double what they are paying now for dairy products.''
The Senate passed a farm bill in July. A House version of the bill made it out of committee, but House leaders have yet to bring its version to the floor.
Under the current program, the government sets a minimum price to cover dairy farmers' production costs. If the market price drops below that, the government buys dairy products from farmers to buoy prices and increase demand. Since milk prices have remained above that minimum price in recent years, dairy farmers usually do better by selling their products commercially rather than to the government.
But if 1949 rules go into effect, the government would be required to buy dairy products at around $40 per hundredweight -- roughly twice the current market price -- to drive up the price of milk to cover dairy producers' cost.
''It would be bad for consumer demand in the long run,'' said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents more than 32,000 dairy farmers.
Mr. Galen and others in the dairy industry said reverting to 1949 policies could probably force the makers of butter, cheese, yogurt and other dairy products to look for cheaper alternatives, like imported milk from countries like New Zealand.
Most dairy companies declined to discuss plans to buy dairy supplies from abroad if they are forced to pay higher prices for milk.
But Land O' Lakes, a dairy company based in Arden Hills, Minn., said the 1949 law could be potentially disruptive for dairy industry operations.
''Congress needs to pass a comprehensive farm bill that helps farmers continue to feed the world, keeps food prices affordable and provides farmers some financial stability in the very unpredictable profession of farming,'' said Rebecca Lentz, a company spokeswoman.
In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said the department was exploring all its options to deal with the possibility of the 1949 law going into effect.
''We will do whatever we are legally obligated to do,'' said Mr. Vilsack, who declined to say what specific steps the department would take to prepare for what dairy lobbyists and industry officials are calling the ''milk cliff.''
Among the options: the agriculture secretary could drag his heels on the milk purchases until Congress passes a new farm bill or an extension of the 2008 one that expired in September, said Vincent Smith, a professor of agriculture at Montana State University in Bozeman.
''This is a totally antiquated law that has nothing to do with farming conditions today,'' Professor Smith said. ''It was put as a poison pill to get Congress to pass a farm bill by scaring lawmakers with the prospect of higher support prices for milk and other agriculture products. Letting it go into effect for even a few months would be particularly disastrous for consumers and food processors. ''

HEADLINE: Nike Beats Expectations, Helped by Robust Demand

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Nike reported second-quarter results on Thursday that topped analysts' forecasts, citing strong demand in North America.
Orders for Nike-branded shoes and clothing scheduled for delivery from December 2012 through April 2013, known as futures orders, were up 14 percent in North America, Nike's most mature market. Its volume of orders also indicated steady worldwide demand for its products. 
''In North America, we created great momentum. This is somewhat counterintuitive to some, given this market size and assumed maturity. But I see tremendous growth potential in North America,'' Mark Parker, Nike's chief executive, said in a call with analysts.
Worldwide orders for Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., were up 6 percent, the same as last quarter.
''The biggest driver of this stock is usually futures orders. Last quarter, futures orders were lower than expected. This quarter they came in line, and North America was stronger than expected,'' said Brian Yarbrough, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones.
For the second quarter ended Nov. 30, the company earned $384 million, or $1.14 a share, from continuing operations. Analysts, on average, were expecting the company to earn $1 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Revenue rose 7 percent to $6 billion.
Nike had been caught with excess inventory in important markets like China and was finding it difficult to tackle intense competition, while distributors and retailers remained wary in an uncertain economy.
''The China problem won't go away in 12 to 18 months, but it is no worse than it was expected,'' said Rahul Sharma, founder and managing director of Neev Capital, a consulting company in London. ''But look at North America. It is on fire. And this is such a big business.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Downsizes Holiday Parties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KAPLAN

 BODY:
In the year of Hurricane Sandy, looming fiscal austerity and global scrutiny of banks, Wall Street is just not in a celebratory mood.
Banks that once took over entire floors of Manhattan nightclubs and reserved Midtown steakhouses are continuing to follow restrictions on the office holiday party, many of which have been in place since the 2008 financial crisis.
Witness the scene at the 40/40 Club in New York's Flatiron district on a recent December evening. There was no lavish, companywide affair; instead, a group of 40 Morgan Stanley employees gathered in a private room off to the side of the club. 
The generous platters of sliders and lobster crab cakes were present. But instead of Grey Goose vodka, there was Smirnoff and Stolichnaya.
"It's probably not going to be caviar and ice sculptures, but it's still going to be something," said Dale Winston, chief executive of the executive search firm Battalia Winston.
Intimate group gatherings, paid for out of pocket by department heads and managing directors, are the new norm. With tighter budgets and dwindling salaries, investment bankers in the bulge bracket can hardly count on dinner, let alone top-shelf liquor.
Smaller holiday gatherings mean more face time with superiors and less opportunity to let loose. A Morgan Stanley financial adviser in Los Angeles described the new, austere conditions as "stiff and boring."
"I went and made sure my managing director saw me, and then I just left," he said. "They've taken what used to be a party and have reduced it to an event where people just meet up and chat."
While the parties are a subject of much conversation, few if any lower-ranking employees are willing to discuss them on the record. Under stern orders not to talk to reporters about anything - including seating arrangements at company get-togethers - workers insisted on anonymity to describe the holiday merrymaking.
Neither Morgan Stanley nor Credit Suisse held company-sponsored holiday parties this year. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and the investment banking division of Bank of America decided against them as well, but departments can do as they please as long as the costs come from their own accounts. Representatives of Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Barclays declined to comment.
The restaurants and other sites the banks once frequented say they are feeling the pinch as "budget conscious" has become a motto of party planners.chains that Wall Street might once have considered déclassé are being welcomed by the staff in accounting.
For example, Brother Jimmy's, a barbecue restaurant with a number of Manhattan locations, catered many more in-house celebrations this year for corporate clients, including major banks, said a spokeswoman, Jenna Fritsche.
The reluctance of Wall Street firms to return to sponsored parties runs contrary to a general resurgence of corporate holiday celebrations. In its annual study, Battalia Winston found that 91 percent of the 105 companies surveyed planned to hold a party this year, up from 74 percent in 2011.
"The banks are still image-conscious," Ms. Winston said. "It's hard to have a party when you're laying people off."
Restaurants and clubs have responded accordingly, convinced that the belt-tightening is here to stay.
"People aren't just going to say, 'I have $10,000, throw me a party,' " said Lauren Menache, a publicist for Berk Communications in New York, which represents high-end group dining spots like Junoon and those owned by the restaurateur Richard Sandoval. "They really want to try and understand where their money is going."
This year, sites like the 40/40 Club, once the beneficiaries of opulent affairs, have shifted their focus to enticing smaller groups with specific food and drink packages.
"Companies are dividing up and having smaller events," said Amber King, director of sales at the 40/40 Club, who has booked parties for three Credit Suisse groups this holiday season, charging around $60 to $150 per person. "That's how they are maintaining costs. Instead of a 500-person gala, firms are holding more intimate, 10- to 80-person events."
Still, the lavish party hasn't completely become a Wall Street myth. Companies in the private equity and hedge fund sectors - which tend to face less public and shareholder scrutiny than investment banks - are free to spend whatever millions their annualized returns will bear.
The downsized gatherings present new challenges to Wall Streeters, particularly younger employees at investment banks. Some have realized that because of budgetary pressures, financial modeling skills won't necessarily guarantee them continued employment or a big year-end bonus. With this in mind, small holiday parties can be an opportunity to impress their bosses with their social panache.
"Even though groups are more aware of their cost structures, the holiday party is still a big deal," a Credit Suisse analyst said, adding that the senior members of his group came around the day of the party and made sure everyone put work aside to attend.
"It's huge in my eyes to have a group outing," another analyst said. "The associates you get to know because you work with them until midnight all the time, but the senior guys leave at 6 and you don't get to chat with them much, so I'm looking forward to it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: When Reality and Perception Part Ways

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
In their efforts to resolve the pending fiscal crisis, Republican and Democratic negotiators are struggling to thread a very fine needle: finding budget cuts big enough to help stabilize the country's long-term debt but palatable enough to sell to both sides and the public at large. 
Part of the challenge is that the biggest, fastest-growing expenses tend to be the ones Americans object most to cutting. Last year, a Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health poll asked respondents whether they would support major, minor or no reductions to a number of programs.
Over all, Americans were most willing to cut foreign aid, spending for the war in Afghanistan and salaries and benefits for federal workers. But Congress could eliminate spending on foreign aid and Afghanistan entirely and still be left with large deficits.
As of the 2011 fiscal year, the government was spending about $22 billion a year on foreign aid and $120 billion on the conflict in Afghanistan. But for the past four years, it has run deficits of more than $1 trillion a year. As for federal salaries, they have been frozen for the past two years. And if all federal civilian workers took a 10 percent pay cut, that would amount to roughly $19 billion a year in savings.
Americans were far less willing to cut Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare. But those programs pose far and away the biggest challenge to the long-term fiscal health of the country, as Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and a number of other economic experts have long warned. Rising health care spending is often singled out as the one most pressing factor.
Moreover, Congress has already wrung billions in savings from discretionary spending programs. According to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, the Budget Control Act passed last year contained about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, about two-fifths from defense and three-fifths from other discretionary spending. That will shrink nondefense discretionary spending - meaning public education, agriculture, infrastructure, aid to the poor and numerous other programs - as a share of economic output to its lowest level since 1962 at least.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Hit Parade Of Small Labels And Upstarts

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH, CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM, ZACHARY WOOLFE, ANTHONY TOMMASINI and VIVIEN SCHWEITZER

 BODY:
Fiscal cliffs are nothing new in the classical record industry. As became increasingly apparent when the classical music critics of The New York Times set about the annual ritual of choosing records of the year, the larger economy could perhaps learn a thing or two from certain classical cliff dwellers who have managed to tailor supply to demand while maintaining a zest for innovation and continuing to lead and expand taste.
For more than a decade, the so-called major labels, such as they still exist, have been paying a heavy price for long years of excess and shortsighted management. Some have maintained a core quality, often surrounded by layers of crossover pandering and superstar indulgence.
But as our honor roll suggests, these days most of the action lies elsewhere: with the latter-day stalwart Harmonia Mundi and upstart labels like Avie and Cedille; with big American orchestras recording for small international labels (the New York Philharmonic for Dacapo, the Minnesota Orchestra for Bis); with performing institutions issuing their own recordings (the Berlin Philharmonic; the Boston Symphony, Mariinsky and Philharmonia Baroque Orchestras; John Eliot Gardiner's Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists). 
To add to the industry's uncertainties, we keep hearing that the CD is doomed, however much -- as the list clearly shows -- it continues to dominate our listening habits.
Be all of that as it may, our critics had little difficulty compiling a small treasury of excellent recordings. We allowed each critic to choose up to five CDs, DVDs or downloads and made a conscious attempt to spread the wealth, sorting out duplications. (I, for one, could happily have doubled up on two of the Bach recordings listed, Mr. Gardiner's motets and Andras Schiff's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' but was just as content to trawl more broadly.)
Happy listening.
BACH: MOTETS Monteverdi Choir, English Baroque Soloists, conducted by John Eliot Gardiner (Soli Deo Gloria SDC 716; CD). Few choirs sing Bach with such loving attention to the text and such exquisitely floating textures. None are more persuasive in revealing the sensuality, delight and even playfulness Bach brought to these motets, which are among the most personal expressions of his faith. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
BACH: 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Vocal soloists; Berlin Radio Chorus, Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Simon Rattle (Berliner Philharmoniker BPH120011; DVD). A tenor kneeling at the feet of the violist da gamba; a solo violinist locking eyes with a bass-baritone, as they pass melodic material back and forth; two choirs, face to face, in dialogue: the DVD of Peter Sellars's 2011 ''ritualization'' of the ''St. Matthew Passion'' by the Berlin Philharmonic captures great musicians at their most vulnerable, bringing raw emotion and social relevance to this canonic work. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
BACH: 'THE WELL-TEMPERED CLAVIER,' BOOKS 1 AND 2 Andras Schiff, pianist (ECM New Series 2270-73; four CDs). If only as a record of Mr. Schiff's current approach to this inexhaustible work -- its lyricism achieved without the use of the sustaining pedal -- this recording would be invaluable. But it also stands on its own, both energetic and restrained. The approach is precise and, in its way, traditional, but each phrase feels natural and fresh. ZACHARY WOOLFE
BRAHMS: SERENADES Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, conducted by Nicholas McGegan (Philharmonia Baroque Productions PBP-05; CD). These are the first period-instrument accounts of the two serenades that I've encountered, though that is the least of their charms. More to the point, they rank among the finest recorded performances of these underrated works, perhaps second only to Istvan Kertesz's classic versions with the London Symphony Orchestra, on Decca. JAMES R. OESTREICH
BRITTEN: VOCAL WORKS Nicholas Phan, tenor; Myra Huang, pianist; other artists (Avie AV2258; CD). The young tenor Nicholas Phan again proves himself an affecting interpreter of Britten's music. His new recording, ''Still Falls the Rain,'' offers seldom-heard Britten works, including ''The Heart of the Matter'' (revised by Peter Pears), for tenor, horn, piano and narrator (the actor Alan Cumming). ANTHONY TOMMASINI
CHOPIN: PIANO WORKS, VOLUME 2 Louis Lortie, pianist (Chandos 10714; CD). There is not exactly a shortage of Chopin discs by exemplary pianists. But Louis Lortie offers a worthy addition with his elegant interpretations of the four ballades, the Opus 57 Berceuse, the Opus 60 Barcarolle and six nocturnes. His passionate readings are notable for both their poetic introspection and their tempestuous virtuosity. VIVIEN SCHWEITZER
DVORAK: SYMPHONY NO. 8 Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, conducted by James Levine (BSO Classics download; bso.org/Merchandise/Detail/43876). If there is a recording of anything that ends more excitingly, I don't know it. And these are not cheap thrills but an eloquent culmination earned throughout by the brilliant response of the young professionals at the Boston Symphony Orchestra's training camp in 2008 to Mr. Levine's big-league demands. JAMES R. OESTREICH
MOZART: 'DON GIOVANNI' Vocal soloists; Mahler Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin (Deutsche Grammophon 477 9878; three CDs). The impressive cast for this ''Don Giovanni'' includes Ildebrando D'Arcangelo in the title role, with Luca Pisaroni (Leporello), Joyce DiDonato (Donna Elvira), Diana Damrau (Donna Anna) and other fine artists, brought together in a wondrously fresh performance conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
MOZART: 'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' Vocal soloists; Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, conducted by René Jacobs (Harmonia Mundi HMC 902126.28; three CDs). Mr. Jacobs's careening, crisp recordings of Mozart's operas are idiosyncratic joys, and his ''Finta Giardiniera'' brings out both the farce and the melancholy in a long-overlooked work. The Freiburg Baroque Orchestra plays with wit and snap, and the cast is as vigorous as the conducting. ZACHARY WOOLFE
NIELSEN: SYMPHONIES NOS. 2, 3 New York Philharmonic, conducted by Alan Gilbert (Dacapo 6.220623; CD). Alan Gilbert is in the midst of an exciting project with the New York Philharmonic to perform and record Carl Nielsen's complete symphonies and concertos. The first release in the series is terrific, with pulsing and insightful accounts of the Second Symphony (''The Four Temperaments'') and the Third (''Sinfonia Espansiva''). ANTHONY TOMMASINI
NONO: 'LA LONTANANZA NOSTALGICA UTOPICA FUTURA' Miranda Cuckson, violinist; Christopher Burns, electronics (Urlicht AudioVisual UAD-5992-SE; two CDs). Played with assured mystery by the accomplished Ms. Cuckson, Luigi Nono's 1988-89 work swerves from ethereal to violent and back again. The violinist interacts with previously taped material, including both her own playing and studio sounds, and wanders during a live performance, a spatial element captured in the surround-sound version on one of the discs in this set. At times Ms. Cuckson even sings, hauntingly -- a part of the score seemingly ignored by previous interpreters. ZACHARY WOOLFE
PUCCINI: 'LA BOHÈME' Vocal soloists; Norwegian National Opera Orchestra, conducted by Eivind Gullberg Jensen (Electric Picture EPC01; DVD). The intellectually charged but dazzlingly theatrical director Stefan Herheim deconstructed the traditional sets of the Norwegian National Opera's previous production of ''La Bohème,'' creating a mixture of old and new with a sober twist: Mimi dies of cancer at the start, and the opera is reconfigured as Rodolfo's surreal, moving refusal to admit it. ZACHARY WOOLFE
SHOSTAKOVICH: SYMPHONY NO. 7 Mariinsky Orchestra, conducted by Valery Gergiev (Mariinsky MAR0533; CD). I named Mr. Gergiev's Philips recording of the epic ''Leningrad'' Symphony with the two orchestras he led then, the Rotterdam Philharmonic and the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Orchestra, a best of 2003. His conception of the work seems only to have deepened since, and the St. Petersburg orchestra's sound, neither diluted nor amplified, lies closer to the heart of the music. JAMES R. OESTREICH
SIBELIUS: SYMPHONIES NOS. 2, 5 Minnesota Orchestra, conducted by Osmo Vanska (Bis SACD-1986; CD). This is a poignant document: a longtime also-ran ensemble makes a persuasive bid to be ranked among the world's greatest, absolutely luxuriating in its music director's great specialty, only to have its current season seriously foreshortened, if not entirely wiped out, by labor-management strife. JAMES R. OESTREICH
VIVALDI: 'L'ORACOLO IN MESSENIA' Europa Galante, conducted by Fabio Biondi (Virgin Classics 50999 6025472 6; two CDs). Fabio Biondi conducts the excellent period-instrument orchestra Europa Galante in a fiery, vivacious performance of a pasticcio opera that was popular in its day, then forgotten. It is presented here in a reconstruction by Mr. Biondi with an excellent cast, including Magnus Staveland, Vivica Genaux, Ann Hallenberg, Romina Basso and Xavier Sabata. VIVIEN SCHWEITZER
VIVALDI: 'TEUZZONE' Vocal soloists; Le Concert des Nations, conducted by Jordi Savall (Naïve OP 30513; three CDs). Joined by his gleaming, vibrant instrumental ensemble and a cast endowed with the brilliant agility that Vivaldian style requires, Mr. Savall serves both the glitter and the emotion of a work unheard for centuries. The drama, set at the ancient Chinese court, is surprisingly nuanced, and the energy is endless. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'BACH AND BEYOND,' PART 1 Jennifer Koh, violinist (Cedille Records CDR 90000 134). The violinist Jennifer Koh is known as both a masterly Bach interpreter and a champion of contemporary repertory. As part of her ''Bach and Beyond'' series, she pairs alluring performances of Bach's Partitas Nos. 2 and 3 with Ysaÿe's Sonata No. 2 and works by Kaija Saariaho and Missy Mazzoli. VIVIEN SCHWEITZER
'BAROQUE CONVERSATIONS' David Greilsammer; pianist (Sony Classical 88697929692; CD). The elegant Israeli pianist David Greilsammer excels at juxtaposing old and new music to find common ground between pieces written centuries apart. On this exciting recording, contemporary scores by Morton Feldman, Helmut Lachenmann, Matan Porat and Nimrod Sahar are surrounded by Couperin, Rameau, Handel and other Baroque composers. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
'DARKNESSE VISIBLE' Inon Barnatan, pianist (Avie AV2256; CD). Each piece on this recording by the brilliant and thoughtful pianist Inon Barnatan was inspired by a literary work: Ravel's ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' and ''La Valse''; Debussy's ''Suite Bergamasque''; Ronald Stevenson's fantasy on music from Britten's ''Peter Grimes''; and, the title work, Thomas Adès's ''Darknesse Visible.'' Each receives a superb performance. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
'FERNE GELIEBTE' Christian Gerhaher, baritone; Gerold Huber, pianist (Sony Classical 8869935432; CD). The German baritone Christian Gerhaher, who took master classes with the great Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, would make his mentor proud with this recording of lieder by Beethoven, Schoenberg, Haydn and Berg. Mr. Gerhaher's mellifluous voice is aptly complemented by the supple touch and deeply expressive playing of Gerold Huber, his superb pianist. VIVIEN SCHWEITZER
'MEANWHILE' Eighth Blackbird (Cedille 90000 133; CD). The adventurous ensemble Eighth Blackbird has entranced listeners in recent years with its theatrical interpretations of new music. Its performances on disc are equally electric, with dynamic interpretations of works including Philippe Hurel's kaleidoscopic ''... à mesure,'' Stephen Hartke's quirky ''Meanwhile: Incidental Music to Imaginary Puppet Plays'' and Philip Glass's ''Music in Similar Motion.'' VIVIEN SCHWEITZER
'TERPSICHORE: MUSE OF THE DANCE' Capriccio Stravagante Renaissance Orchestra, directed by Skip Sempé (Paradizo PA0011; CD). Michael Praetorius, that liveliest and most entertaining of Renaissance masters, supplies most of the music, and Doron Sherwin, the incomparable cornetto virtuoso best known for his work with the ensemble L'Arpeggiata, provides much of the improvisational charge.

HEADLINE: Putin Evasive on Banning Adoptions by Americans

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Ellen Barry and Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- He seemed to wince a bit as he sauntered on stage -- a twinge no doubt from a lingering back injury -- but as he took his seat before scores of cameras in a hall packed with more than 1,000 journalists on Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin was clearly in his element: under the bright lights, jaunty and confident, arriving to theme music befitting an action hero.
But this virtuoso performance was nearly upstaged by an issue that emerged only in the last few days: a proposed ban on adoptions of Russian children by American citizens, as part of a measure retaliating against the United States for a new law that will punish Russian citizens accused of violating human rights. Mr. Putin was pressed repeatedly for his view -- eight times in all -- and each time he skirted the question. 
When it first came up, he gave an exaggerated shrug, palms turned upward, as if to say, ''Bring it on.'' By the last one, he was snapping back, short of patience, visibly annoyed.
Over and over, Mr. Putin said he needed time to read the text of the legislation before making a decision. But the text of the ban is just two simple sentences, and it was clear that Mr. Putin was buying time to contemplate what would be the most potent, anti-American action yet in his new term. This year, there have already been several setbacks in bilateral relations, including his ousting of the United States Agency for International Development.
''The talk here is not about the ban on adoption to all foreigners. The talk is about Americans who want to adopt children,'' he said, adding, ''I am simply not ready to answer you now.''
In other respects, this was the cocksure Mr. Putin of 10 years ago. As his mostly adoring audience settled in, Mr. Putin, who has seemed subdued at times since beginning a third term as president in May, appeared eager to joust. And he did -- for four and a half hours -- on virtually any subject: crop subsidies for sugar beet farmers and housing for miners, political relations with Georgia, economic ties with China, fishing restrictions in the Volga River delta.
After months of aggressive steps to squash political dissent and curtail what he views as undue political influence by outsiders, he seemed to relish every chance to take jabs at the United States, especially over its policies in the Middle East and on human rights.
He fielded dozens of questions, on topics like a continuing national debate over adopting daylight saving time, taxes, pensions and Russia's position on the war in Syria. After each reply, journalists clamored for a chance to ask a question, waving signs and flags, scarves, even a red balloon to get noticed.
At one point, discussing the French actor Gérard Depardieu's decision to renounce his French citizenship, Mr. Putin warmly invited him to live in Russia. ''If Gérard really wants to have a residency permit for Russia or a Russian passport,'' Mr. Putin said, ''we can consider this issue resolved.''
Throughout the day, Mr. Putin basked in the fawning adulation of journalists visiting the capital from virtually every provincial corner of Russia. Near the end of the news conference, he paused to write a personal note extending birthday wishes to a reporter's daughter.
But in a series of unusually sharp challenges, he was repeatedly forced back to the issue of the proposed adoption ban and pressed to say if he would support it.
Mr. Putin repeatedly criticized the new American law -- the Magnitsky Act -- as a provocation, and said Russia had no choice but to retaliate. ''This is very bad and it poisons our relations,'' he said.
Mr. Putin said the United States was failing to live up to an agreement ratified earlier this year, by not allowing Russian officials to get involved in abuse cases involving adopted Russian children, even as observers. And he lashed out at one reporter who challenged him.
''This is unacceptable,'' he said. ''Do you find it normal? Do you like it? Are you a sadomasochist?'' At other times, Mr. Putin acknowledged that most adoptive parents from America are ''kind and decent people.''
At several points, he said legal experts would have to review the proposed ban to see if it could be enacted given the agreement with the United States on adoptions. He also repeatedly rejected assertions that the ban would most hurt Russian orphans because he said it would apply only to the United States.
According to the Russian government, there were 956 Russian children adopted by families from the United States in 2011 -- the most of any country. Italy was next with 798 followed by Spain with 685.
Mr. Putin did not cite those statistics, but he began his news conference rattling off an array of others to illustrate Russia's recent successes. Economic output is growing stronger than in the United States or Europe, he said. Unemployment is lower. Average salaries are up. Reserve funds are flush. The birthrate is climbing.
One reporter asked him about the jailed former billionaire, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, whose imprisonment has been condemned as politically motivated. A court on Thursday reduced Mr. Khodorkovsky's sentence so he may be released two years early, in 2014. Mr. Putin said the issue should not be politicized. Then, archly, he noted that at some point Mr. Khodorkovsky would be free. ''May God give him health,'' he said.

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and NICK CUMMING-BRUCE; David M. Herszenhorn reported from Moscow, and Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva. An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Damascus, Syria, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday strongly defended Russia's implacable opposition to military intervention in Syria and sharply chastised the United States for its role in toppling Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, describing that outcome as a mistake that created chaos and ultimately led to the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi.
However, speaking at his annual end-of-year news conference, he made clear that Russia, Syria's longtime ally, was now mainly concerned about averting ''never-ending civil war,'' not preserving the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. 
''We are not concerned with the fate of Assad's regime,'' he said. ''Of course, changes are being demanded, but it's something else that concerns -- what will happen next?''
In recent days, the Kremlin has sounded increasingly pessimistic about Mr. Assad's government, and Russian officials have acknowledged developing contingency plans to evacuate thousands of Russia citizens, mostly women wed to Syrians who had studied at Russian universities.
The West has been looking for signs that Russia might cease using its veto power as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to defend the sovereignty of the Assad government and to block the more aggressive intervention sought by the United States and many other countries. Mr. Putin's comments against intervention left open the uncertain possibility that Russia might persuade Mr. Assad to step down.
Mr. Putin expressed worry that the Assad government and the Syrian opposition could merely switch places, with the rebels in power but with the fighting unabated. In answer to a question, he rejected an assertion that Russia was making a mistake, potentially isolating itself and at risk of losing influence in the Middle East, by opposing intervention. Mr. Putin pointed to Libya as his evidence that intervention by the NATO alliance of Western nations had caused more harm than good.
''No matter how they explained their position, the state is falling apart,'' he said. ''Interethnic, interclan and intertribal conflicts continue. Moreover, it went as far as the murder of the United States ambassador.'' He added, ''I was asked here about mistakes: Isn't it a mistake? And you want us to constantly repeat these mistakes in other countries?''
Russia has been a major Syria arms supplier and trade partner with the Assad government and maintains a small naval refueling installation in the Syrian port of Tartus. But Mr. Putin on Thursday sought to portray the relationship as transactional. ''Some special economic relations?'' Mr. Putin asked rhetorically. ''No.''
His remarks about Syria came as United Nations human rights investigators said in a new report that the Syria crisis had evolved from a battle to oust Mr. Assad into more of a sectarian conflict, pitting entire communities against one another and pulling in fighters from the Middle East and North Africa.
As the conflict approaches the end of its second year, it ''has become overtly sectarian in nature,'' said the report by a panel of the Human Rights Council.
The panel, led by Paulo Pinheiro, a human rights investigator from Brazil, said attacks and reprisals had led communities to arm themselves and to be armed by different parties to the conflict. ''Entire communities are at risk of being forced out of the country or killed inside the country,'' the panel wrote.
''Feeling threatened and under attack, ethnic and religious minority groups have increasingly aligned themselves with parties to the conflict, deepening sectarian divides,'' the panel said.
The sharpest split is between the ruling minority Alawite sect, a Shiite Muslim offshoot from which Mr. Assad's most senior political and military associates are drawn, and the country's Sunni Muslim majority, mostly aligned with the opposition, the panel noted. But it said the conflict had drawn in other minorities, including Armenians, Christians, Druse, Palestinians, Kurds and Turkmens.
Most foreign fighters joining the conflict are Sunni Muslims from Middle Eastern and North African countries, many of them linked to extremist groups, the panel said, and often operating independently of the opposition Free Syrian Army but coordinating attacks with its forces.
Lebanon's Shiite group Hezbollah confirmed that its members were fighting for the Assad government, the panel said, and it was investigating reports that Iraqi Shiites had also entered Syria. Iran has also confirmed that members of its Revolutionary Guards Corps are providing the Assad government with ''intellectual and advisory support.''
Making their fourth submission to the Human Rights Council, the panel of four investigators said that government forces and supporting militias had attacked Sunni civilians and that opposition forces had attacked Alawite and other pro-government communities. It said that Kurdish groups had clashed with government and antigovernment forces, that Turkmen militias were fighting with antigovernment forces, and that Palestinians, increasingly split in their views of the Assad government, were being armed by both pro- and antigovernment forces.
On Thursday, at the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp south of Damascus, hundreds of residents who had fled fighting between factions returned during a lull, after what Palestinian activists said was a negotiated truce. A Palestinian activist with a pro-rebel faction said that the negotiations had taken place in the Palestinian Embassy in Damascus, and that armed gunmen had agreed to pull out of the camp.
''We have an urgent humanitarian crisis,'' said the activist, who used the name Abu Khalid. ''We should solve it, and then talk about the past mistakes of some factions. The camps should be secure and stable areas for all unarmed Palestinians and Syrians.''
On Thursday, dozens of cars brought back families heeding Palestinian activists' invitation, via the Internet, to return. Many stores were open, and there was no sign of armed men on the streets. By nightfall, activist groups were reporting that the camp was being shelled again.

Previews and Openings
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' (in previews; opens on Jan. 17) Break out the bourbon. While Blanche DuBois is the most frequent Broadway habitué among Tennessee Williams's gallery of damaged, desperate women, Maggie the Cat now moves into second place to tie with Amanda and Laura Wingfield. Since Barbara Bel Geddes first prowled the Pollitt family's Mississippi Delta plantation home in 1955, this sultry drama of Southern decadence, greed and mendacity has returned in five major productions -- this one being its third in a decade. Following in the heels of Elizabeth Ashley, Kathleen Turner, Ashley Judd and Anika Noni Rose -- not to mention Elizabeth Taylor on-screen -- the latest actress to don Margaret's figure-hugging slip and indomitable determination is Scarlett Johansson, who won a Tony Award in 2010 for her Broadway debut in ''A View From the Bridge.'' Appearing alongside her in this Rob Ashford production is Benjamin Walker (''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'') as Maggie's boozing, depressed husband, Brick, with Ciaran Hinds as Big Daddy and Debra Monk as Big Mama. Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney) 
'Flipside: The Patti Page Story' (opens on Friday) In case ''Forever Dusty'' hasn't whetted your appetite for jukebox musicals devoted to mid-20th-century female icons, along comes this entry with more than two dozen songs by the country-pop crossover queen known as the ''Singing Rage.'' Interviews with Ms. Page make up the play's text, which is surrounded by the likes of ''Tennessee Waltz'' and ''(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window?'' 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Eric Grode)
'Midwinter Night: Sacred and Profane Rituals' (opens on Thursday) If Ebenezer Scrooge and ''A Civil War Christmas'' are too modern for you when it comes to seasonal entertainment, feast your eyes and ears on this rare glimpse at pre-Christian songs and rituals from the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe. A coterie of musicians (including a self-described ''Balkan-klezmer-Gypsy-punk-super-party band'' called the Lemon Bucket Orkestra) performs a mixture of ancient incantations, raucous ''Goat Songs'' and even, for something a little more cutting-edge, a Baroque Nativity folk opera. La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Rooney)
'The Other Place' (in previews; opens on Jan. 10) Sharr White's twisty drama earned Laurie Metcalf an Obie Award in 2011; now it and she are making a somewhat delayed transfer to Broadway, with two new actors (including Daniel Stern) joining them. Ms. Metcalf plays a renowned neurologist whose research may be hitting too close to home -- and that's about all that's safe to divulge about the plot. Joe Mantello directs, as he did in 2011. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Grode)
'Picnic' (in previews; opens on Jan. 13) Despite being a Pulitzer Prize winner (in 1954) and possibly William Inge's best-known play, ''Picnic'' has only been revived one other time on Broadway, when the Roundabout presented Kyle Chandler and Ashley Judd as the young lovers in 1994. Almost 20 years later, the Roundabout once again revisits it; this time the ubiquitous director Sam Gold (''Seminar,'' ''Circle Mirror Transformation'') has surrounded his young leads, Maggie Grace and Sebastian Stan, with a canny blend of theater mainstays (Reed Birney, Elizabeth Marvel) and Hollywood royalty (Ellen Burstyn). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'Water by the Spoonful' (in previews; opens on Jan. 8) It's not often that plays win the Pulitzer Prize before their New York debut, so Quiara Alegría Hudes's 2012 winner is eagerly anticipated. The second play in her Elliot Trilogy, following her 2007 work, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue,'' follows the life of a young Puerto Rican veteran of the Iraq war and the two overlapping worlds -- one online, one real -- that keep him physically and psychologically afloat. Two ''Elliot'' veterans -- the actor Armando Riesco and the director Davis McCallum -- are on board for this one, too. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' An amiable, blessedly ungarish holiday musical for family audiences, faithfully adapted from the popular 1983 movie drawing on the writings of Jean Shepherd (2:20). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com, achristmasstorythemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Dead Accounts' As a prodigal son returned to Cincinnati from New York City, Norbert Leo Butz conjures fireworks out of very thin air in Theresa Rebeck's new comedy, directed by Jack O'Brien and featuring Katie Holmes. The play throws out many weighty subjects, but they all blur into a jet stream of semi-snappy dialogue before changing course and evaporating (2:00). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Elf' This stage musical based on the Will Ferrell movie returns to Broadway with Wayne Knight as the celebrity Santa, though he isn't around much. The production, like all the holiday-themed shows clogging New York theaters, has some funny moments, a couple of decent musical numbers and a lot of generic-feeling songs and synthetic sentiment. Jordan Gelber in the role of Buddy, the human raised as an elf who comes to New York to find his real father, never really finds a comfort zone for the sometimes awkward, sometimes perceptive character (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan's deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it's as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Golden Boy' Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets's 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It's a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets's still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'Bare' Having shepherded a sanitized overhaul of that delirious orgy of pig's blood on prom night, ''Carrie,'' this year, the director Stafford Arima has now turned to this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a coed Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during the school drama club's production of -- you guessed it -- ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'A Civil War Christmas' Paula Vogel's play is a beautifully stitched tapestry of American lives set during the chilly winter of 1964. Characters include Abraham Lincoln (a dignified Bob Stillman) and his troubled wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (an affecting Alice Ripley) but also Mary Todd's dressmaker, a slave who purchased her freedom named Elizabeth Keckley (the fine Karen Kandel) along with soldiers on both sides of the conflict. It's a rare holiday entertainment that won't nauseate the adults, and should edify the children without boring them (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls. Performed with vivifying passion by a talented young cast of six (1:30). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Golden Age' Terrence McNally's comedy-drama, set backstage on the first night of the opera composer Vincenzo Bellini's last opera (''I Puritani''), is sadly hackneyed and contrived. Lee Pace plays the composer, and Bebe Neuwirth the famed singer Maria Malibran (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Isherwood)
'Golden Land' The upbeat six-person acting ensemble in this National Yiddish Theater-Folksbiene production seems game for the two-hour rendition of the entire New York Jewish immigrant experience, from the 1880s to the 1940s. In montages and medleys, partly in Yiddish and partly in English, the audience is transported to Ellis Island, the Lower East Side, the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, union protests, the Holocaust and more. The characters are more or less generic immigrant archetypes, but the actors do a great job of hiding how exhausted they must be from the constant march of history and costume changes (2:00). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, nationalyiddishtheatre.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'The Great God Pan' The new play from the terrific young playwright Amy Herzog (''4000 Miles'') is an oblique but moving drama about a young man (the excellent Jeremy Strong) agonized by the discovery that he may (or, if he can trust his hazy memory, may not) have been sexually abused as a child. Under Carolyn Cantor's direction, an altogether terrific cast, including Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman, draws out all the quiet heartbreak in Ms. Herzog's keenly observed writing (1:25). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'It's a Wonderful Life: The 1946 Live Radio Play' Irish Repertory Theater's adaptation of Frank Capra's perennial holiday movie offers six actors (and one effects specialist) handling 25 roles, in a 70-minute condensation of the original, which was more than two hours. The film's fans may pine for the deleted passages, but the production's invention, humor and charm helps to soothe the loss (1:10). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Webster)
'Let's Kill Grandma This Christmas' After worming her way into grandma's will, a slutty blonde conspires with her sister's husband to off the family matriarch. The end product is the theatrical equivalent of a mediocre holiday movie, replete with the usual Hollywood clichés: a potty-mouthed grandma; lots of bickering beneath the Christmas tree; a triumphant, drunken meltdown from the mousy pushover; a high-fiving, unemployed meathead; a nasally henpecked nerd; and even an O. J. Simpson joke, which is almost a parody of lazy writing (2:10). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, letskillgrandmatheplay.com. (Rampell)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Old Man and the Old Moon' The marvelous and folksy PigPen Theater Company tells this tall tale using live songs, puppets and shadow screens (2:10). Gym at Judson, 243 Thompson Street, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, pigpentheatre.com. (Ken Jaworowski)
&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board. A highlight of the year in theater (2:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Restoration Comedy' Amy Freed's mash-up of two late-17th-century frolics juggles bawdy humor and elastic morality as it examines questions of love, marriage and licentiousness. While the adventures of an inveterate womanizer and the efforts of his prim wife to tame him via masked seduction are diverting, the play is not really the thing here. Ed Sylvanus Iskander's raucous production, featuring the Flea's caffeinated and fabulously costumed young acting ensemble, the Bats, is more about the Baroque-glam rock happening. In addition to libidinous displays of pole dancing and other savory skills set to Scissor Sisters tunes during the play proper, the lengthy evening also includes a preshow musicale with cocktails, an extended variety entr'acte with dumplings being served and a girl group covering En Vogue and Mariah Carey, and a post-show dance party (3:25). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'What Rhymes With America' Melissa James Gibson's touching, mournful play examines the disappointed lives of a quartet of interlocked characters. A wonderful cast under Daniel Aukin's direction brings out all the piquant, off-kilter charm of Ms. Gibson's writing (1:20).

'Working: the Musical' Based on Studs Terkel's landmark oral history of the American worker, this 1977 revue incorporates contributions from a handful of composers, including Mr. Schwartz, Mary Rodgers, Micki Grant and James Taylor. This revised presentation, directed by Gordon Greenberg for Prospect Theater Company, also has new material by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The result is wildly uneven, but strikes a chord in intimate, contemplative moments that celebrate how even the most seemingly marginal professions are an intrinsic part of the fabric of American life. Anyone with an interest in late-20th century musical theater will want to investigate (1:40). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended.

'From the Ground Up' Daring Australians fly through the air in Circus Oz's fast and furious show, which owes something to vaudeville as well as the circus. Recommended for ages 5 and up, this is the holiday offering at the New Victory Theater, and it's a good one: a little naughty, a little nice, a little death-defying (1:40). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, 10th floor, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org. (Saltz)
'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' After last year's update, this annual extravaganza returns with a paucity of new material. But the Rockettes are forever splendid: regal in their precision, radiant in their costumes, exuberant in their high kicks. Yes, there's a cheesy narrative thread, but also a new and fascinating look at Rockettes fashions through the decades. (It's the troupe's 85th year.)

HEADLINE: Exchange Sale Reflects New Realities of Trading

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
On a warm day in Boca Raton, Fla., the host of a reception for an annual financial conference was not a big bank or a powerful exchange as in years past, but a young firm based in Atlanta.
Guests who gathered at the oceanfront resort were surprised. They were greeted with bottled ice water that carried the company's logo, and as they left, were invited to grab iPod Shuffles.
That event, some four years ago, was the Wall Street equivalent of a coming-out party for the firm, IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, an electronic operator of markets for derivatives and commodities. Now, the markets upstart is announcing itself to a much larger world with an $8.2 billion deal to buy the symbolic cradle of American capitalism, the New York Stock Exchange.
The takeover illustrates starkly how trading in commodities and derivatives has become much more lucrative than trading in the shares of companies. Warren E. Buffett warned in 2003 that the "derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle," and that the genie, even after a global financial crisis, was not going back. Currently, derivatives - financial bets tied to underlying assets like oil prices or interest rates, among other things - are a $600 trillion market. Even the parent of the N.Y.S.E. attracted its suitor largely because of its ownership of Liffe, a major derivatives exchange in London. 
For many, the Beaux-Arts New York Stock Exchange, and images of traders looking despondent or exuberant on its floor, represent what making money is all about. Yet Wall Street itself has found it more profitable to bet on fluctuations in natural gas or corn or on interest rates. The financial industry often does so electronically and through platforms in cities as scattered as London, Chicago and Atlanta. The biggest bonuses each year are typically for traders who reaped rich gains on these often complex financial products.
That change, decades in the making, has left the New York exchange, with roots going back 220 years, in an increasing difficult position as trading volumes slump and profit margins stay razor thin. While its acquirer has pledged to keep a dual headquarters in the exchange building in Lower Manhattan, as well as in Atlanta, the center of power in finance long ago migrated elsewhere.
The success of the newly combined companies hinges on the derivatives business. ICE is hoping that a greater share of derivatives trading will go through its clearinghouse operations, which act as backstops in case one party defaults. It is being aided by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, which is forcing Wall Street banks to push their derivatives trades into clearinghouses and regulated exchanges.
"For the past decade, our solutions made our markets increasingly electronic and increasingly clear," Jeffrey C. Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said this month. "Today, financial reform is imposing that vision on many markets through a rule-making process."
While Dodd-Frank compliance is still in its early days, and the volume of derivatives trading remains depressed amid broader economic uncertainty, the law is ultimately expected to cement ICE's business model into the regulatory code.
"Despite the complaints, there's no question that at the end of the day, Dodd-Frank will be a financial boon to exchanges," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives.
Still, such a development will not do much for the traditional business of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Sprecher said on Thursday that he was committed to keeping the floor of the exchange open. But according to people briefed on his plans, he intends to use the stock trading operation and its steady cash-generating abilities to finance future deals and expansion efforts.
Nowhere have the changing fortunes of ICE and the parent of the New York exchange, NYSE Euronext, been more apparent than in their value on the stock market. In April 2011, when ICE first tried to acquire NYSE Euronext in league with Nasdaq OMX, it was worth about $1.5 billion less than the New York company. Just over a year later, ICE was worth nearly $4 billion more than NYSE Euronext, even with less than a third of its revenue.
ICE was founded in 2000 by Mr. Sprecher, who began his career developing power plants. In the 1990s, he saw that many power companies and financial firms wanted to hedge their investments in energy with financial contracts, but the market for these contracts was disorganized and opaque.
Mr. Sprecher bought an obscure exchange for buying and selling electricity in Atlanta and turned it into ICE with financing from BP and Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Banks were drawn to the idea of a standardized place to buy and sell derivatives tied to the value of oil and other commodities. But they also hoped to create a competitor to the virtual monopoly position being built up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in futures trading.
"You talk to people in Chicago, they basically think that ICE is just a front for the banks," said Craig Pirrong, an expert in futures trading and director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the University of Houston.
As the company grew through a quick series of acquisitions, Mr. Sprecher won a reputation for being the "enfant terrible" of the energy industry, with a "sharp eye for identifying opportunities and seizing on them in a very aggressive way," Dr. Pirrong said.
Early on, ICE sought to move all trading onto computers, allowing firms to buy and sell contracts 24 hours a day. Soon after buying the International Petroleum Exchange in London, ICE shut down its trading floor.
"They were a technology company from Day 1," said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.
ICE also decided to fashion its own clearinghouse, rather than tap an outsize firm. It expanded through acquisitions, planting the seeds for growth in 2008, when it took over the Clearing Corporation, home to a popular derivative known as a credit-default swap.
The Dodd-Frank overhaul may provide additional benefits for ICE. Under the law, exchanges must turn over public and private information to outside data warehouses, which will, in turn, share the information with regulators. Sensing an opportunity, ICE created its own warehouse, named ICE Trade Vault.
ICE and its Chicago rival, CME Group, have also moved in recent months to convert swaps trades, which are facing more scrutiny under Dodd-Frank, into old-fashioned futures contracts. Futures trading is lucrative territory for the exchanges in part because they can shut out competitors.
"The reality is that there are incentives to convert swaps into futures, where there's less competition," said Richard M. McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, an independent trading platform that is expanding into the swaps business. "There's no requirement for CME and ICE to open their futures clearinghouses to other exchanges."
Despite its growing prominence, ICE has a small footprint in Washington. With only two full-time lobbyists, the company relies on Mr. Sprecher to communicate with regulators.
"Jeff is the company," one official said, though others said he had loosened his grip over the last year or so.
He is well received, officials say, in part because he has embraced some reforms. Unlike executives of other exchanges and financial firms, Mr. Sprecher did not resist an effort in 2009 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to close certain loopholes.
Officials recall him saying, "Tell me what the rules are, and I'll make money with them."
Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Session Could Prove Awkward for Perry

BYLINE: By JAY ROOT. 
jroot@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry was at the height of his power in 2011 when the most Republican Texas Legislature in modern times enacted deep spending cuts and handed him one victory after another.
But after a botched run for the presidency and growing disenchantment among Tea Party activists, Mr. Perry is facing some potentially awkward policy discussions when the Legislature convenes in January, as well as deeper scrutiny of an administration that has endured for 12 years.
For starters, fellow Republicans want to ban a provision Mr. Perry has used to ''double dip'' -- taking both his salary and his state pension -- a benefit that has increased his earnings by more than $90,000 a year. Representative Jason Isaac, Republican of Dripping Springs, has filed a bill to end the perk, reserved for long-serving elected officials. It would not apply retroactively to the governor. 
Meanwhile, Tea Party conservatives are upset about all the money going to ''corporate welfare,'' including tax subsidies and incentive payments that Mr. Perry champions as vital to luring companies to Texas. The governor says the state economy is stronger as a result, but not all Republicans agree.
Representative James White, Republican of Hillister, who represents a conservative swath of southeast Texas, said he does not understand why big corporations get tax dollars when his district needs more money for roads and schools.
''We are against any type of program that unfairly picks winners and losers,'' he said. ''I'm not against the governor, I'm just telling you what I'm for.''
The Legislature is also poised to look more closely at the grant-awarding practices at the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, overseen in part by Perry appointees. Investigations of the agency have again cast allegations of ''crony capitalism'' -- a tag opponents of Mr. Perry have long hung on him -- into the political spotlight.
''He's in a different position -- diminished, perhaps, but not done,'' said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin and a Texas Tribune pollster. ''He may well have worn out his welcome with the conservative end of the base in Texas.'' (The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
Incoming Senator Larry Taylor, Republican of Friendswood, said the governor still had plenty of strengths, including his veto power and his experience in office. ''I'm sure the perception is after his presidential run he's dropped a notch,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''He certainly has the opportunity to bring it back up with a good session.''
Catherine Frazier, Mr. Perry's spokeswoman, said the governor would ''thoughtfully consider'' any reforms that come his way.
Mr. Perry rode the Tea Party wave during his 2010 re-election campaign, and in the 2011 session he successfully championed new abortion restrictions, curbs on lawsuits and a voter ID bill. He continues to court the Tea Party, possibly with an eye toward a 2014 re-election bid or another stab at the presidency in 2016.
This week, addressing the Northeast Tarrant County Tea Party near Fort Worth, Mr. Perry bashed Washington and cited his support for allowing teachers to carry firearms in the wake of the Connecticut elementary school mass shootings.
One of the group's leaders, Konni Burton, said many Tea Party activists had soured on the longest-serving governor in Texas history. ''Most Tea Partiers would like to see Perry move on and elect another governor,'' she said. ''We don't really like lifelong legislators.''
A Tea Party umbrella group that advises the Legislature supports a proposal to limit statewide officeholders to two consecutive four-year terms. Twelve years ago Friday, Mr. Perry was sworn in as governor.
Senator Kevin P. Eltife, Republican of Tyler, is proposing the term limit measure, which would require voter approval. He says it has nothing to do with any statewide incumbents, all of whom are Republicans. The bill exempts people in office now.
''I've tried to keep personalities out of this,'' Mr. Eltife said. ''I don't want to make the current statewide officeholders a target of this legislation.''
Mr. Taylor, the incoming senator, dismissed the notion that Mr. Perry is down and out.
''I think he's still in a very good position,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Boehner Cancels Tax Vote In Face Of G.O.P. Revolt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner's effort to pass fallback legislation to avert a fiscal crisis in less than two weeks collapsed Thursday night in an embarrassing defeat after conservative Republicans refused to support legislation that would allow taxes to rise on the most affluent households in the country.
House Republican leaders abruptly canceled a vote on the bill after they failed to rally enough votes for passage in an emergency meeting about 8 p.m. Within minutes, dejected Republicans filed out of the basement meeting room and declared there would be no votes to avert the ''fiscal cliff'' until after Christmas. With his ''Plan B'' all but dead, the speaker was left with the choice to find a new Republican way forward or to try to get a broad deficit reduction deal with President Obama that could win passage with Republican and Democratic votes.
What he could not do was blame Democrats for failing to take up legislation he could not even get through his own membership in the House. 
''The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement that said responsibility for a solution now fell to the White House and Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader. ''Now it is up to the president to work with Senator Reid on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff.''
The stunning turn of events in the House left the status of negotiations to head off a combination of automatic tax increases and significant federal spending cuts in disarray with little time before the start of the new year.
At the White House, the press secretary, Jay Carney, said the defeat should press Mr. Boehner back into talks with Mr. Obama.
''The president will work with Congress to get this done, and we are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly that protects the middle class and our economy,'' he said.
The refusal of a band of House Republicans to allow income tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million came after Mr. Obama scored a decisive re-election victory campaigning for higher taxes on incomes over $250,000. Since the November election, the president's approval ratings have risen, and opinion polls have shown a strong majority not only favoring his tax position, but saying they will blame Republicans for a failure to reach a deficit deal.
With a series of votes on Thursday, the speaker, who faces election for his post in the new Congress next month, had hoped to assemble a Republican path away from the cliff. With a show of Republican unity, he also sought to strengthen his own hand in negotiations with Mr. Obama. The House did narrowly pass legislation to cancel automatic, across-the-board military cuts set to begin next month, and shift them to domestic programs.
But the main component of ''Plan B,'' a bill to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts for everyone with incomes under $1 million, could not win enough Republican support to overcome united Democratic opposition. Democrats questioned Mr. Boehner's ability to deliver any agreement.
''I think this demonstrates that Speaker Boehner has a real challenge,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat. ''He hasn't been able to cut any deal, make any agreement that's balanced. Even if it's his own compromise.''
Representative Rick Larsen of Washington accused Republicans of shirking their responsibility by leaving the capital. ''The Republicans just picked up their toys and went home,'' he said.
Futures contracts on indexes of United States stock listings and shares in Asia fell sharply after Mr. Boehner conceded that his bill lacked the votes to pass.
The point of the Boehner effort was to secure passage of a Republican plan, then demand that the president and the Senate to take up that measure and pass it, putting off the major fights until early next year when Republicans would conceivably have more leverage because of the need to increase the federal debt limit. It would also allow Republicans to claim it was Democrats who had caused taxes to rise after the first of the year had no agreement been reached.
That strategy lay in tatters after the Republican implosion.''Some people don't know how to take yea for an answer,'' said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a Republican who supported the measure and was open about his disappointment with his colleagues.
Opponents said they were not about to bend their uncompromising principles on taxes just because Mr. Boehner asked.
''The speaker should be meeting with us to get our views on things rather than just presenting his,'' said Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who recently lost a committee post for routinely crossing the leadership.
Just days before more than a half trillion dollars in tax increases and spending cuts kick in, a chasm now separates Congressional Republicans from the president, even though the latest deficit offers from the White House and speaker are numerically very close. With his own plan defeated, Mr. Boehner faces a grave decision. A deal with Mr. Obama would almost certainly lose a huge swath of his Republican conference, but it could pass with Democratic support. Does he make such a deal and risk a Republican revolt, or do leaders allow the nation to head into an economic situation that some say could cause a recession?
''It has been deeply troubling that Speaker Boehner has spent day after day on the road to nowhere; making it clear Republicans are having trouble governing and only putting us closer to the fiscal cliff,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. ''The speaker needs to now exercise leadership and go back to the negotiating table with the president to find a path forward that is balanced, equitable, and promotes economic growth.''
Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, was enlisted to press his former House colleagues to vote yes, but even with the failure of that effort, he said there was a way forward.
''Maybe I'm the last optimist standing in this town, but I still think whether it passes or not, there's still an opportunity for a broader agreement,'' he said.
The speaker's troubles on Thursday seemed to worsen with each hour. The vote to cancel the military cuts, supposed to be the easiest of the night, passed narrowly, 215-209. Even a routine procedural vote to take up the speaker's tax bill passed by a surprisingly tight tally, 219-197, with 13 Republicans bolting from their leadership to vote ''no.'' Recalcitrant conservatives were balking on allowing taxes to rise on incomes over $1 million a year.
''I want something that treats everybody fairly. I think everybody needs to be protected, and I don't think the bill does that,'' said Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, who opposes Plan B.
The struggle to muster the votes for Plan B played out against a surreal tableau in the Capitol. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, who died Monday, was lying in state in the Rotunda. Mr. Boehner spoke briefly with Senator Reid as they watched the somber memorial service for Mr. Inouye in the morning. Then the two men blasted each other hours later. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican whip, could be seen bending arms on the House floor.
Stymied, Republican leaders called a recess around 7 p.m. Members streamed in and out of the whip's office, munched on Chick-fil-A sandwiches (regular and spicy) and professed uncertainty over what comes next.
Democrats -- and some Republicans -- hoped the demise of the Boehner backup plan will usher in a last and final round of negotiations between the speaker and President Obama over a broad deficit reduction deal that raises more than $1 trillion in taxes over 10 years while locking in another $1 trillion in savings from entitlements like Medicare and other federal programs.
''The math changes'' with a bipartisan deal, said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, a retiring Republican moderate from Ohio, who predicted Mr. Boehner could win at least half of House Republicans. ''If there's a negotiated settlement with the president, the speaker will put it on the floor and we'll see where the chips fall.''

HEADLINE: Tensions Between Japan and South Korea Complicate Picture for U.S.

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Su Hyun Lee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The sighs of relief in Washington have almost been audible. As the United States forges ahead with efforts to counter China's influence in Asia, Japan and South Korea this week both elected conservative, pro-American leaders, raising hopes that the United States and its two closest Asian allies can work together on the vexing security issues roiling this economically vibrant region.
All those issues, that is, except one: Tokyo and Seoul's emotionally charged relations with each other. On Friday, Japan's next prime minister, Shinzo Abe, announced he would send a special envoy to Seoul to mend ties. However, analysts remain skeptical that tensions will end with right-wing governments in power.
The strains between its two closest partners in the region have already proved a headache for the United States, which has been pressing the two export powerhouses to take a bigger role in regional security to ease its own budgetary pressures. But the neighbors remain hamstrung by history, and even a relatively small deal on intelligence sharing unraveled this summer amid a dispute over how to view Japan's harsh colonization of the Korean Peninsula before World War II. 
''The U.S. might think it's great to have two conservative governments, but these are two allies that can't even sign a minor agreement,'' said Daniel C. Sneider, a researcher on East Asian diplomacy at Stanford University.
The question, then, is whether the United States can effectively deal with China's rise if the allies, who host about 75,000 American troops and sailors, find it so hard to work with each other.
Even with those worries, the elections were seen as a victory for Washington as it struggles to contain a nuclear-armed North Korea and counter China's military buildup.
In both elections, the winners defeated opponents who raised at least some alarms in Washington. In Japan, a blowout victory by the Liberal Democrats on Sunday ensured the prime ministership will go to Mr. Abe, a nationalist who has vowed to restore close military cooperation with the United States that frayed under a left-leaning government during a dispute over an American base. One of the losers was a party led by Shintaro Ishihara, known for railing against his nation's servility to Washington and for provoking a territorial spat with China that the United States fears being dragged into.
In South Korea, Park Geun-hye won on Wednesday with promises to keep the close bonds that the incumbent, Lee Myung-bak, cultivated with the Obama administration, a relationship that analysts in both countries say is the best ever by leaders of the two nations. Ms. Park defeated a liberal candidate who wanted an immediate restart of extensive aid to North Korea that some feared would undermine United States-led sanctions against the North's nuclear program.
The Obama administration quickly embraced both victors. After a phone call with Mr. Obama, Mr. Abe announced that he would go to Washington in January for the first visit abroad as prime minister, and Ms. Park's aides said her first presidential visit abroad would also most probably be to the United States.
The new leadership is a particular relief for the United States after a decade in which both countries have sometimes bridled at Washington's hold on them, with public sentiment seeming to veer at times between viewing the large American military as a welcome protection and an affront to national dignity.
The United States has benefited from China's increasingly sharp-elbowed approach to its neighbors, especially Japan, with whom it is in a dispute over islands in the East China Sea. ''In both Japan and South Korea, the perception of China has changed to being a threat, and that has made the U.S. seem much more favorable as a source of security,'' said Narushige Michishita, a security affairs expert at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.
While South Korea has less direct tension with China, Korean experts said Chinese support of Pyongyang, even after the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship for which the South blamed the North and a deadly rocket attack that year on a South Korean island, has fueled a pro-American mood that may have played a role in Ms. Park's election.
Mr. Abe has promised to reinterpret his nation's antiwar Constitution to allow Japan's military, seen as Asia's most technologically advanced, to aid American forces in combat. The United States has welcomed Mr. Abe's calls to expand security ties with other democracies in the region, like Australia and India, as a way to offset China's growing presence. But analysts say Japan will need to reverse a decline in military spending before Washington is convinced that Tokyo is doing enough to keep China's aspirations in check.
The United States is also asking South Korea to use its superior economic and technological power to help it shoulder more of its own defense against a possible attack from the heavily armed North. Washington wants a reliable ally in 2015, when it plans to transfer command of its own and South Korean troops on the peninsula to Seoul during a crisis. While Ms. Park has said she will reach out to China, she says improved ties with Beijing are not a zero-sum game with Washington, with whom South Korea will remain a closer ally.
''With Park and Abe, conservatives in both Seoul and Tokyo, Washington seems to have a coalition of the willing,'' Mr. Michishita said. ''But it might have more difficulty than it imagines in finding any benefits.''
There had been hopes that tensions might ease after Mr. Lee leaves office, but one side effect of installing two conservative governments might be to ensure that neither side is willing to give in on issues closely bound to national identity and pride, like the continuing fracas over Korean women forced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II.
''South Korean-Japan ties are already in trouble, and there is probably only more trouble ahead with Abe and Park,'' said Hwang Ji-hwan, a professor of international relations at the University of Seoul.
The last time he was prime minister, in 2006-7, Mr. Abe drew criticism in Seoul and in the United States Congress for denying the position of the South Korean government and most historians that the women were coerced, saying they instead were common prostitutes.
Ms. Park, a lawmaker at the time, went to Washington to attend Congressional hearings that criticized Mr. Abe's denials. During the presidential campaign, she shed her usual quiet reserve when she appeared to lecture a reporter for a conservative Japanese newspaper who asked about the worsening of Japanese-Korean relations. ''There is something that I really want to tell you,'' she said. The sex slave issue ''cannot be justified in any way whatsoever.'' ''I hope the wise leaders of Japan will deeply ponder this point.''
Officials for all three nations say some efforts to soothe relations are already under way. Japanese and American officials said that in November, the United States assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, Kurt Campbell, privately urged Mr. Abe to shelve calls to revise a 1993 official apology to the women by Japan's government.
Friday's decision to send an envoy to Seoul appears to signal that Mr. Abe got the message that improving ties is necessary. ''Both sides have learned there is a line that you don't want to cross,'' said Lee Chung-min, an adviser on international affairs to Ms. Park.

HEADLINE: A Tough Woman in a Tough Job

BYLINE: By GI-WOOK SHIN and DAVID STRAUB

 BODY:
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA -- Exactly a week after North Korea's new leader Kim Jong-un oversaw his regime's first successful test of a long-range rocket, South Korean voters on Wednesday elected the conservative Park Geun-hye as their next president.
Park is a more forthright supporter of the alliance with the United States than her progressive challenger. The critical questions for Americans are whether South Korea's new president will be both a strong leader and a good partner in dealing with the increasing North Korean threat. 
Americans have enjoyed unprecedentedly close cooperation with the conservative administration of the outgoing South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, because they shared a strong consensus on North Korea. That could change under the new leadership in Seoul without considerable attention and effort on the part of the Obama administration.
Like Lee, Park stresses the primacy of the United States as South Korea's security partner and has linked most concessions to North Korea to Pyongyang's willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But Park says she will make greater efforts with North Korea to boost mutual confidence through reciprocal steps she calls ''trustpolitik.'' Also unlike Lee, she has declared she will provide large-scale food aid to North Korea without conditions.
In any case, Park will be under popular pressure to give engagement with North Korea a serious try. Many Koreans are also uncomfortable with the unvarnished support Lee gave to the U.S. alliance, feeling that it soured relations with China, now by far Korea's biggest trading partner.
Although the Obama administration signaled before the election that it would try hard to work out a North Korea policy with whoever won, Park will still find it difficult to forge a policy that meets both popular demands and American interests, especially as Pyongyang increasingly tests Washington's limits.
As the daughter of the late president Park Chung-hee, Park comes with some weighty baggage. She rose to prominence because her father oversaw the Korean economic ''miracle'' of the 1960s and 1970s, but he is also remembered for his authoritarian rule. Moreover, Park will become the first female president in a male-dominated country.
But like other daughters of charismatic Asian leaders, such as Indira Gandhi and Megawati Sukarnoputri, Park is formidable in her own right. She has rescued her party twice from the brink of collapse, earning her a reputation as the ''queen of elections.''
Park, 60, learned politics and diplomacy early when she assumed the first-lady role on the assassination of her mother by a North Korean agent. She endured two decades of political exile after her father's death in 1979, entering politics only when the Asian financial crisis of 1997 awakened popular nostalgia for the Park era. By then, Park Geun-hye was no longer simply a ''princess'' -- she built her own base of organizational and voter support among conservatives and moderates.
In this election, Park showed her political skills by realizing a ''grand coalition of conservatives'' -- a first since South Korea democratized in 1987. It came at a heavy cost: Progressive opponents have reacted by increasing their own solidarity, further deepening the country's political polarization. Younger Koreans and residents of the southwestern Cholla region voted overwhelmingly for her opponent.
Park won in a tight race in a country more politically polarized than the United States. South Koreans are split between conservatives who blame North Korea entirely for its own plight, and progressives who lay substantial blame on South Korean conservatives and the United States for not addressing what they believe are North Korea's legitimate security concerns.
While for Washington North Korea is a policy concern, for South Koreans it is also a heated political issue and, fundamentally, a matter of unresolved national identity. The North Korean satellite launch will not alter the divisions within South Korea.
The North Korean regime, which harshly denounced Park during the campaign, will likely try to challenge her soon. That will put to the test Park's campaign promises to both improve relations with North Korea and induce it to denuclearize.
Given the escalation of the North Korean threat, it is even more important that Washington reach out quickly to the new administration in Seoul. President Obama needs to establish personal ties with Park, whose private nature may make it harder to duplicate the kind of convivial bond he enjoyed with President Lee. An early but well-prepared summit should be high on the agenda of both governments.

HEADLINE: A Pleasure to Read (And Even Reread)

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE PASSAGE OF POWER: THE YEARS OF LYNDON JOHNSON by Robert A. Caro (Alfred A. Knopf). In the latest installment of his magisterial, multivolume biography, Mr. Caro uses his wondrous narrative gifts to tell the dramatic story of how Johnson was catapulted to the White House in the wake of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and how he used his potent political skills to push his predecessor's civil rights legislation through Congress and lay the groundwork for his own revolutionary war on poverty.
A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING by Dave Eggers (McSweeney's Books). Using a new, pared down voice in this sad-funny-moving novel, Mr. Eggers recounts the tale of a penny-ante Job named Alan Clay, who's betting everything on a quixotic scheme to sell the king of Saudi Arabia a lucrative new technology contract. Alan's dreamlike story unfolds to become an emotionally stirring allegory about the frustrations of middle-class Americans coping with unemployment and diminished dreams in a newly globalized world. 
THE YELLOW BIRDS by Kevin Powers (Little, Brown & Company). The author of this beautifully observed first novel joined the Army when he was 17 and served as a machine-gunner in Iraq in 2004 and 2005. In chronicling the friendship of two young soldiers struggling to stay alive on the battlefield there he has written a deeply affecting book that conveys the horrors of combat with harrowing poetry. At once a freshly imagined bildungsroman and a metaphysical parable about the loss of innocence and the uses of memory, it's a novel that will stand with Tim O'Brien's enduring Vietnam book, ''The Things They Carried,'' as a classic of contemporary war fiction.
TELEGRAPH AVENUE by Michael Chabon (Harper). Taking its title from the famous thoroughfare that bridges Berkeley and Oakland, Calif., this fresh, tactile novel introduces us to Archy Stallings and Nat Jaffe, the proprietors of a struggling vinyl-record store that's threatened by the prospect of a new megastore opening down the street. The stories of Nat and Archy and their families become a choral tale that addresses many of Mr. Chabon's perennial themes -- concerning fathers and sons, husbands and wives, and the consolations of art -- while underscoring his ability to write magically about just about anything.
THE IDEA FACTORY: BELL LABS AND THE GREAT AGE OF AMERICAN INNOVATION by Jon Gertner (Penguin Press). From the 1920s through the '80s Bell Labs -- the research and development wing of AT&T -- was the most innovative scientific organization in the world, pioneering the development of the transistor, the laser and digital communications. In this riveting new book Mr. Gertner not only gives us keenly observed portraits of the individual scientists behind such transformative products but also examines the reasons Bell Labs became such an incubator of talent -- and the place, for several decades, where the future was invented.
THE TWELVE TRIBES OF HATTIE by Ayana Mathis (Alfred A. Knopf). This extraordinarily powerful debut novel chronicles the many sorrows visited upon one Hattie Shepherd, a woman who left the Jim Crow South in the 1920s to start a new life in Philadelphia, and who at 16 lost her twin babies to pneumonia. That loss hardens Hattie's heart, and she raises nine more children with stoic determination and not a whole lot of warmth -- an emotional legacy that will shape the remainder of their lives. Writing with authority and psychological precision, Ms. Mathis endows Hattie's life with an epic dimension -- much as Toni Morrison has done with so many of her characters -- while at the same time making her daily life thoroughly palpable and real.
THE REVOLUTION WAS TELEVISED: THE COPS, CROOKS, SLINGERS AND SLAYERS WHO CHANGED TV DRAMA FOREVER by Alan Sepinwall. In this engaging new book the television critic for hitfix.com provides a smart, observant look at 12 ''great millennial dramas'' -- including ''The Sopranos,'' ''The Wire,'' ''24,'' ''Friday Night Lights,'' ''Mad Men'' and ''Breaking Bad'' -- that transformed the TV landscape and moved the small screen out from under the shadow of the movies. Mixing critical analysis and interviews with the creators of these shows, the book is a spirited and thoughtful cultural history that possesses all the immediacy and detailed observation of Mr. Sepinwall's popular blog, What's Alan Watching?
EVERY LOVE STORY IS A GHOST STORY: A LIFE OF DAVID FOSTER WALLACE by D. T. Max (Viking). This revealing biography of Wallace -- who committed suicide in 2008 at 46 -- traces the connections between his life and art, mapping the sources of his philosophical vision, while chronicling the heartbreaking struggle he waged throughout his adult life with severe depression. It gives the reader a sympathetic portrait of the artist as a young man: conflicted, self-conscious and, like many of his characters, yearning for connection yet stymied by the whirring of his brain and the discontinuities of an America reeling from information overload.
HELLO GOODBYE HELLO: A CIRCLE OF 101 REMARKABLE MEETINGS by Craig Brown (Simon & Schuster). In this captivating volume a longtime columnist for the satirical British magazine Private Eye weaves together dozens of real-life encounters into a glittering daisy chain that reads like an entertaining illustration of the theory of Six Degrees of Separation. Frank Lloyd Wright meets Marilyn Monroe who meets Nikita Khrushchev. Tolstoy meets Tchaikovsky who meets Rachmaninoff who meets Harpo Marx who meets George Bernard Shaw. Mr. Brown's sketches of these incongruous meetings -- drawing upon diaries, biographies, interviews and other source material -- possess the historical resonance of reportage, the surreal fizz of fiction.
HALLUCINATIONS by Oliver Sacks (Alfred A. Knopf). This physician's latest book is a fascinating natural history of hallucinations. There are visual hallucinations (like seeing Kermit the ''Sesame Street'' frog several times a day), auditory hallucinations (hearing music or voices), and hallucinations produced by illness, fevers, sleep deprivation, drugs, grief, trauma and exhaustion. Dr. Sacks's compassion for his patients and philosophical outlook transform what might have been clinical case studies into humanely written short stories that illuminate the complexities of the human brain and the mysteries of the human mind.

HEADLINE: In Japan, A Test Of Inflation Targets

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
''Under a paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher spending and, hence, positive inflation.''
-- Ben Bernanke, 2002
Now we may find out if Mr. Bernanke was right. Japan appears to be ready to do whatever it takes to end its long run of falling prices. The Bank of Japan took limited action on Thursday, and more is expected in the new year.
Mr. Bernanke, then a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and now its chairman, gave the speech quoted above at a time when the American economy was stumbling along in a slow recovery and prices, at least as measured by the Consumer Price Index, were declining.
He was arguing that the Fed would not be out of ammunition if it cut nominal interest rates to zero and the economy failed to respond. He has since proved he was right about that. In the speech, he made a passing reference to a phrase used by Milton Friedman, about using a ''helicopter drop'' of money to fight inflation, which eventually earned him the nickname ''Helicopter Ben'' from conservatives scandalized by his aggressive action after the financial crisis began. 
For two decades, Japan has provided stark evidence that chronic deflation is possible in a modern economy. Prices have fallen steadily despite extraordinarily low interest rates. The economy has stagnated.
This week the Liberal Democratic Party, which had ruled Japan for nearly its entire postwar history until it was swept from power three years ago, won a landslide victory. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister from 2006 to 2007, will get another chance.
Mr. Abe devoted a decent part of his campaign to criticism of the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank. He wants the bank to pursue inflation, and to effectively print money until it gets it. At one point during the campaign he spoke of a 3 percent inflation target, although he seems to have cut that back to 2 percent.
Either goal, if realized, would be a major change for the country. The inflation index used in calculations of gross domestic product is now 18 percent lower than it was at the end of 1994.
On Thursday, the central bank took a relatively small step in the direction favored by Mr. Abe. It decided to step up its asset purchases and seemed to leave open the possibility that it would adopt the inflation target at a later meeting. Mr. Abe praised the move.
To a significant extent, deflationary expectations are now baked into the Japanese economy. Tiny government bond yields have persisted for many years. Even though the nominal yields are small, the real (after inflation) yields have been respectable because there has been deflation, not inflation. And the competition has not been that great. The stock market has fluctuated, but it remains far below where it was when the Japanese bubble began to deflate in the early 1990s. Real estate losses from that bubble -- do you remember when the gardens of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were supposed to be worth more than the entire state of California? -- still have an impact on investor psychology.
Western economists, Mr. Bernanke among them, have long called for Japan to target inflation. Lately, some Chinese economists have been offering similar lectures. But until now, little has happened. The central bank has announced a goal of positive inflation of up to 1 percent, but it is not widely believed, and it has certainly not happened.
As it is, the limited quantitative easing efforts of the Japanese central bank have been viewed as temporary, and as not really changing anything. Whether the new promises of something more significant will be credible remains to be seen.
''At this point, moving to a 2 percent target would not be such a giant step,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has suggested inflation targeting in the United States as well as in Japan. ''They have to pursue it vigorously until we have inflation expectations firmly higher. No one knows how much they would have to do to accomplish that.''
The Bank of Japan has in the past been hesitant to really try to establish that credibility, for at least two reasons. One is that there is fear that the Japanese government bond market would be disrupted. Another is that it could do severe damage to the central bank's own balance sheet. It owns a lot of Japanese government bonds whose market value would fall. Conceivably, that could cause the bank to seek a recapitalization from the government, something that would be embarrassing, to say the least.
To establish the credibility, the central bank would have to show a readiness to create credit at a rapid rate. It would probably also need to take steps to hold down the value of the yen, a move that would no doubt cause concern in the United States.
It is, however, very doable, as Switzerland has shown. When the euro zone debt crisis was at its worst, Switzerland became a safe haven for European investors worried that the euro might blow up. That drove up the value of the Swiss franc versus the euro and damaged Switzerland's ability to compete. The Swiss government responded by announcing that the euro would not be allowed to fall below 1.2 Swiss francs. If necessary, the government would simply sell francs to meet any demand.
That has been necessary, and the Swiss have accumulated a huge portfolio of foreign currency. So, too, could the Japanese if they chose to announce that the dollar would henceforth be worth at least 100 yen, a level not seen since 2009.
Doing so would instantly restore at least some competitiveness to Japanese industry, which has experienced something that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago: Japan has a trade deficit.
Bringing inflation to Japan could make the country's debt load -- now higher than that of any other major country -- appear more manageable. One unfortunate result of deflation coupled with perennial recession is that a country's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio rises even if no more money is borrowed. Measured in yen, the Japanese economy was larger when Mr. Abe left office in 2007 -- two years before his party lost power -- than it is now.
A stronger recovery in the United States, not to mention avoiding a new Europe-wide downturn, would make it easier for Japan to begin to grow again. But even if that did happen, it would not solve all of Japan's problems. The country has an aging, shrinking population. It needs more workers, but the Japanese attitude toward immigration makes Arizona look liberal by comparison.
Japan's economy has been adrift for so long that much of the world takes for granted that it cannot, or at least will not, ever be reformed. Such cynicism has a basis, but it is possible that circumstances have changed. Japanese who seemed content with the way things were now clearly want something different, even if they are not sure what, or how to get it.
Three years ago, the Democratic Party of Japan won a landslide election, only to prove stumbling and incoherent when it tried to govern. Now the voters have turned back to the Liberal Democrats. Whether Mr. Abe will be more competent, and whether he will be able to effectively lead a party that still has competing factions, is far from clear.
Still, investors are taking heart. Japanese stocks leapt on the news of the election results, while the yen weakened. For now, at least, there is reason to hope that something important was changed by this election.

Madoff's brother and former chief compliance officer is headed to prison for his role in aiding the Ponzi scheme. | The F.B.I. arrested a former bank executive in Los Angeles in connection with the the accounting scandal at Olympus. | It looks like we'll be heading into Christmas without a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. 

 BODY:
CHANGING FACE OF FINANCE | The $8.2 billion deal for the New York Stock Exchange showed how the power base in finance has shifted. Once seen as the cradle of American capitalism, the stock exchange has suffered from declining trading volumes and razor-thin margins. Meanwhile, its acquirer, the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, has bolstered its position as "trading in commodities and derivatives has become much more lucrative than trading in the shares of companies," DealBook's Ben Protess and Nathaniel Popper write.
The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul may be a plus for the combined company. The law, which forces Wall Street banks to push derivatives trades into clearinghouses and regulated exchanges, "is ultimately expected to cement ICE's business model into the regulatory code," Mr. Protess and Mr. Popper write. Jeffrey C. Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said: "Financial reform is imposing that vision on many markets through a rule-making process." 
Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of the stock exchange's parent NYSE Euronext, acknowledged that the deal was "not a merger of equals." When Mr. Niederauer was approached by Mr. Sprecher of ICE, reaching a deal took only three months, Michael J. de la Merced reports. "The two companies found themselves in alignment on several issues. Mr. Sprecher indicated that he was willing to maintain two headquarters, ICE's home in Atlanta and the Big Board's center in New York City."
But even that arrangement shows how the N.Y.S.E.'s clout has declined over the years. What was once "the temple of commerce" is now "not much more than a television studio," The New York Times columnist Floyd Norris writes. "The transformation of the New York Stock Exchange from its position at the apex of the world financial system to an asset to be bought and sold like any other - and one that is not deemed to be worth as much as it would be if it traded more modern derivative securities rather than old-fashioned stocks - has been going on for decades, but has accelerated in recent years."
PETER MADOFF SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS | Bernard L. Madoff's brother and former chief compliance officer is headed to prison for his role in aiding the Ponzi scheme. Peter B. Madoff, the second figure in the scandal to be sentenced, received 10 years on Thursday. Peter Lattman and Diana B. Henriques write in DealBook: "Mr. Madoff, in a slate blue suit and striped blue tie, entered the crowded courtroom accompanied only by his lawyers, although many members of his family and friends had written letters of support for him. The 63 character references stood in stark contrast to his brother's sentencing, when the judge in that case noted that he had not received a single supportive letter." For his part, Peter Madoff said he was "deeply ashamed" of his conduct and had "tried to atone by pleading guilty."
F.B.I. DIGS INTO OLYMPUS SCANDAL | The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a former bank executive in Los Angeles in connection with the the accounting scandal at Olympus, Peter Eavis reports in The New York Times. "Prosecutors in New York said that the executive, Chan Ming Fon, received more than $10 million from Olympus for assisting in its accounting fraud." Mr. Chan, who authorities said was a citizen of Taiwan living in Singapore, was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, with a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison. In February, Japanese authorities arrested seven people in connected with the scandal, including the company's former chairman.
ON THE AGENDA | Please note that the morning newsletter is off for the holidays, to resume on Jan. 2. Walgreen, which recently bought a stake in Alliance Boots, reports earnings today before the market opens. Personal income and spending data for November are out at 8:30 a.m., and the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December is released at 9:55 a.m. Thorsten Heins, the chief executive of Research in Motion, is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m. Austan Goolsbee, the former adviser to President Obama and current University of Chicago economist, is on CNBC at 8 a.m.
DOWN TO THE WIRE IN FISCAL TALKS | It looks like we'll be heading into Christmas without a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. The New York Times reports: "Speaker John A. Boehner's effort to pass fallback legislation to avert a fiscal crisis in less than two weeks collapsed Thursday night in an embarrassing defeat after conservative Republicans refused to support legislation that would allow taxes to rise on the most affluent households in the country." The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said the defeat should push Mr. Boehner back into talks with the president. "We are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly," Mr. Carney said.
WALL STREET'S LOW-KEY HOLIDAY SEASON | Wall Street firms have little to celebrate this holiday season. And with new restrictions on parties since the financial crisis, holiday gatherings have been decidedly understated. Michael Kaplan writes in DealBook: "Witness the scene at the 40/40 Club in New York's Flatiron district on a recent December evening. There was no lavish, companywide affair; instead, a group of 40 Morgan Stanley employees gathered in a private room off to the side of the club. The generous platters of sliders and lobster crab cakes were present. But instead of Grey Goose vodka, there was Smirnoff and Stolichnaya."

HEADLINE: British Commission Says Bank Reforms Don't Go Far Enough

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: A recommendation for periodic reviews of whether banks are adhering to the rules - referred to as electrifying the ring-fence protections. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Regulators in Britain should have the power to completely split up banks, a government-commissioned report concluded Friday, adding that changes being currently proposed do not go far enough to prevent a future crisis.
Plans to tighten banking regulation, which are expected to go before Parliament early next year, "fall well short of what is required," the report said.
After the rate-rigging scandal that erupted this summer, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, asked a parliamentary commission to take a closer look at the planned banking regulation overhaul. While Mr. Osborne had previously backed the plan, the commission found the proposals lacking. 
"Banks need to be discouraged from gaming the rules," the report said. "All history tells us they will do this unless incentivized not to."
Now, Mr. Osborne has to decide whether to follow the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking and further strengthen the rules or bow to pressure from the banking sector, which argued that any strict rules would harm its competitiveness. Under the current proposals, banks would have to protect, or ring-fence, their retail banking operations from possible losses at their investment banking units.
But the commission said on Friday that the rate-manipulation investigation, which has ensnared more than a dozen big banks around the globe, highlighted the need for even stricter rules. "The latest revelations of collusion, corruption and market-rigging," the commission wrote in the report, are "the clearest illustration yet that a great deal more needs to be done to restore standards in banking."
The commission recommended "electrification" of such a ring-fence, meaning there needed to be periodic reviews that the partition remained in place and realistic threats to keep banks from trying to bend the rules.
"Over time, the ring-fence will be tested and challenged by the banks," the commission said in the report. "Politicians too, could succumb to lobbying from banks and others, adding to pressure to put holes in the ring-fence."
Authorities in the United States and Europe are putting the finishing touches on a new set of banking regulations intended to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis that started in 2007.
In the United States, the Volcker Rule, a part of the Dodd-Frank act that would prohibit banks from making risky bets with their money, is nearing approval by regulators. In France, the finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, introduced a banking bill similar to one planned by Mr. Osborne.
But in some cases, the details remain murky. While latest recommendations by the British lawmakers might not fundamentally change the requirements for banks, they do add to the regulatory uncertainty for banks, which the industry contends makes it difficult to shape strategy.
"It's suffocating," Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said. "There is constant speculation and change, and the number of resources banks have to make available is becoming more than a distraction."
Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, an industry lobby group, warned that such uncertainty could threaten London's position as a global financial center. "While it is clearly important to retain a degree of flexibility around the scope of the ring-fence, it is equally critical that any new system creates regulatory certainty for banks and their investors," he said.

HEADLINE: Apollo Unit to Buy Aviva's U.S. Unit for $1.8 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A unit of Apollo Global Management agreed on Friday to buy the American operations of Aviva, the British insurer, for about $1.55 billion in cash. 

 BODY:
A unit of Apollo Global Management agreed on Friday to buy the American operations of Aviva, the British insurer, for about $1.8 billion in cash. 
The deal is meant to improve Aviva's financial strength as the insurer rebuilds a balance sheet ravaged by the European debt crisis. The firm has embarked on a series of asset sales meant to raise cash. 
Friday's deal will generate about $1.55 billion in proceeds for the insurer, after it pays off some debt.
 "The sale of Aviva USA is an important step forward in the delivery of our strategic plan," John McFarlane, Aviva's chairman, said in a statement. "It considerably strengthens Aviva's financial position, increases group liquidity and improves our economic capital surplus whilst also reducing its volatility."
The Aviva unit's acquirer is Athene Holding, a four-year-old Bermuda-based insurance holding company that has grown through a series of acquisitions. The deal for the Aviva unit is its biggest to date, according to data from Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
Athene plans to fold the acquisition into its existing American business, which will become one of the biggest providers of fixed-index annuities in the United States.
"With this acquisition, Athene is a leader in the fixed-annuity space," James R. Belardi, Athene's chief executive, said in a statement. "The purchase of Aviva's U.S. annuity business will add significant scale to our retail sales and reinsurance operations and provides Athene with best in class operational capabilities."
The insurer will also weigh a potential sale of the Aviva unit's life insurance operations.
Athene had already received about $621 million in additional capital to help bolster its financial health in advance of the transaction. On Friday, Apollo agreed to provide up to $100 million in additional support.
Athene was advised by Deutsche Bank, Lazard and the law firm Sidley Austin.
Aviva was advised by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: In House of Representatives, an Arithmetic Problem

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: With the failure of his tax plan, the difficulty for Speaker John A. Boehner is in finding any winning coalition of votes in the House. 

 BODY:
Markets were down sharply on Friday after Speaker John A. Boehner's tax plan failed to reach a vote in the House on Thursday evening. No Democrats were prepared to support the bill, and Mr. Boehner told reporters that his plan also lacked sufficient votes among Republicans.
A variety of smart political observers have suggested that the markets are misreading the situation. Instead, they say, the failure of Mr. Boehner's bill makes a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff more likely because it has now become clear that any deal will need to rely upon the support of at least some Democrats, which could ease passage through the Democratic-controlled Senate. 
Perhaps this is correct. Mr. Boehner has said that the White House and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, will now have to take the lead in negotiations. The chance that a fiscal deal will be secured on terms that Democrats find favorable may have increased.
But the chance that there will not be a deal at all may also have increased, or at least not one before protracted negotiations that could harm the economy. The difficulty is in finding any winning coalition of votes in the House of Representatives.
In the diagram below, I've charted the major coalitions in the incoming 113th Congress, which will convene on Jan. 3. The new House of Representatives will have 233 Republicans and 200 Democrats. Two seats remain vacant, which means that 217 of 433 votes will be required to pass a bill.
Of the 233 Republicans, 51 will be members of the Tea Party Caucus, give or take a few depending on which first-term members of Congress join the coalition. The other 182 are what I will call Establishment Republicans.
As Keith T. Poole of the Voteview blog points out, the Tea Party Caucus wasn't solely responsible for Mr. Boehner's failure to pass his bill. A significant number of Tea Party Caucus members were thought to support his plan, while some of the opposition came from representatives who do not formally associate themselves with the Tea Party. 
Nonetheless, it seems clear that Mr. Boehner lacks the confidence of roughly three dozen Republican members of the House, and possibly more. Erick Erickson, of the blog RedState, identified 34 Republicans who he said opposed Mr. Boehner's bill and another 12 whom he identified as being on the fence.
Say that Mr. Boehner cannot count on the support of 34 of his Republicans when it comes to passing major fiscal policy legislation. That means he would need to identify 18 Democrats who would vote along with the Republicans who remained with him.
Here's the problem: it might be hard to round up those 18 Democrats. 
The reason is that most of the Democrats who remain in the House are quite liberal.
In fact, the once-powerful Blue Dog Caucus, a coalition of moderate Democrats, will have only 14 members in the new Congress. The centrist Democrats who once filled its ranks fared very poorly in the 2010 midterm elections, while others retired or were harmed by redistricting or by primary battles. Although Republicans have moved more to the right than Democrats have moved to the left in recent years, according to measures like those developed by Mr. Poole, the attrition in the Democratic Party has nevertheless contributed to moving the two parties even further apart.
What that means is that if Mr. Boehner has a significant number of Republican defections, as he did on Thursday night, he will need to win the support of at least some liberal Democrats. And a bill that wins the support of some liberal Democrats will be an even harder sell to Mr. Boehner's Republicans. For each vote that he picks up from the left, he could risk losing another from his right flank.
Perhaps cooler heads will prevail in these negotiations. But a majority of the incoming House - 237 of 433 members - will be either Tea Party Republicans or liberal Democrats, leaving only 196 members who are either Establishment Republicans or Blue Dog Democrats and who might form a functional center-right coalition.
Moreover, the House is likely to engage in repeated battles over fiscal policy during the next two years: not just the over the fiscal cliff, but also over the debt ceiling, annual budgeting plans and whatever stabilization measures might be proposed in the event of another economic downturn.
If Mr. Boehner is having as much trouble whipping votes as he did on Thursday night, reducing the pool from which he might be able to draw together a compromise, this arithmetic problem could turn out to be intractable at some point.

HEADLINE: Candy Cane Scrooge

BYLINE: JOE BRESCIA


HIGHLIGHT: Everyone, from the bank to the dry cleaner, wants to give my children candy. When did this start, and how do I make it stop? 

 BODY:
I'm considering getting the windows on my family S.U.V. tinted.
Not to stave off the heat from the sun, cut down glare or make it difficult for thieves to eyeball CDs. I want to tint the windows for the benefit of our children's health - it will be part of our family's new candy lollipop defense system. With apologies to P. T. Barnum, I have found that there's a sucker given out just about every minute to my children.
 As much as I want to believe it is part of the giving spirit of the season or some post-Hurricane Sandy kindness in my area of Monmouth County, N.J., I would prefer a "have a nice holiday" or even some apple cider. Maybe organic. And while it intensifies around the holidays, and the variety increases (hello, sticky wrappers on broken candy canes), I've found the lollipop gifting to be a year-round ritual. Or curse. 
When I pull up to the drive-in bank, I can see the jovial and polite tellers peek into the windows of my van. Then they gleefully reach for their red bucket of lollipops, grab a handful and load up the pneumatic tube with the assortment of colored circles on white stems. My 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son joyfully watch the tube's return flight as if the clear cylinder were a portable aquarium delivering SpongeBob into their laps. As the kids reach for the goodies, I'm left fishing my receipts out of a Halloween flashback. While I appreciate the bank employees' generosity and my children's joy, I see the plastic vessel as delivering cavities, ruined appetites and childhood obesity.
Socrates comes to the mind of this former philosophy major. That old, doting, health-freak soccer dad said, "Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel." I might be mangling his metaphor, but surely the ethicist meant that banking was the kindling of savings, not the filling of my children. Like Socrates, I want my children to be educated - about avoiding sugar and empty calories. 
But it's not just my bank that is offering the kids their fill. When I pull up to the storefront of the dry cleaner, the cheery woman behind the counter sights the two bobbing heads in the back seats and reaches for her bowl full of Tootsie Pops. When I drove to the barber shop the other day to make an appointment, the receptionist was waving two large red ones. My wife swung by the nail salon with the kids, and the box below the counter came out, full with colors as glossy as the nail polish bottles on display. I'm suffering from lollipop overload anxiety disorder.
I took the children for their dental appointment, and when they were through, the dentist said they were so well behaved they could choose something from the bins along the wall. I froze. No. Never. Couldn't be. Thankfully, the bins were filled with tops, yo-yos and parachute men.
Is Willy Wonka running the merchants' bureau in our town? Is it all a plot by our dentists to drum up business during a recession? I feel as if I'm racing around in a reality show version of Candy Land and I always lose.
Just like any parent, I'm grateful that our local merchants like my children and think they're cute. However, I would like the kids to keep their toothy smiles - minus yellow incisors or, even worse, gaps. Do I demand that the tellers stop the decay delivery system that seems to bring them as much joy as my kids get from the sugar high, and risk losing free checking or the quick service? What about halting the dry cleaner's fun with her Tootsie trot? Would those hard-to-get-out stains never come out, and would I get an extra dose of perc in my shirts?
Until I can figure out how to stop the pop culture in my neighborhood, I've persuaded my children to give all (I hope) of the lollipops to me and I'll give them 25 cents per pop. Does anyone need a hamper-size box of suckers? I'll be stopping by the post office - I have to teach my children how to deposit their lollipop loot in the bank by mail.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Issues Standards On Air Pollution for Boilers

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday issued long-delayed new air pollution standards for industrial boilers, incinerators and cement kilns. The rules provide significant concessions to industry and allow several additional years for full compliance in an effort to minimize job and economic impacts, officials said.
The new standards for the first time set numerical limits on emissions of mercury, acid gas and small-particle pollution for a small subset of the nation's 1.5 million industrial boilers. The agency, which has come under withering criticism from Congressional Republicans for what they contend is regulatory overreach, emphasized that the standards were drafted after extensive consultation with industry groups and local officials. 
The agency said that the rules would affect fewer than 1 percent of industrial boilers, and that the others either would not be covered by the regulations or can meet the standards by performing routine maintenance.
The agency said that the rules would prevent as many as 8,100 premature deaths and 52,000 asthma attacks a year by limiting emissions of lung-scarring particles and toxic pollutants. The agency is giving boiler operators at least three years to meet the standards.
The boilers are generally small-scale power and heat plants found at refineries, chemical plants, manufacturing facilities, hospitals, universities and paper mills.
Despite the weakening of the rule and the additional time for compliance, industry complained that the regulation would cripple the economy.
The National Association of Manufacturers estimated that compliance with the rules would cost industry as much as $14 billion and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. The environmental agency estimates the compliance costs at about $2 billion, however.
''The onslaught of regulations from the E.P.A. means manufacturers will continue to see rising energy prices and skyrocketing compliance costs, which translate into few opportunities for growth and even few jobs,'' the association said in a statement on Friday. ''Any confidence manufacturers had that the E.P.A.'s next four years will be different is quickly eroding.''
The new boiler rules are the subject of continuing litigation by industry and environmental groups. Those challenges are expected to continue.
The agency also issued a new rule governing emissions from the country's roughly 100 cement plants. The rule, issued under a court-ordered deadline, had been in litigation for more than a decade and faced fierce opposition from House Republicans last year. The agency said the regulation would cut emissions of mercury by 93 percent, hydrochloric acid by 96 percent and particulate matter by 91 percent.
But environmental advocates said that the 10-year delay in imposing the rule and the additional two or three years granted industry to comply with it would have devastating health and environmental impacts.
''The two-year delay has real health effects,'' said James Pew, a lawyer with Earthjustice, which filed suit in 2011 on behalf of communities near cement plants. ''Using the E.P.A.'s estimates, these new rules would save 960-2,500 lives a year. Every year of delay is one more year communities suffer.''
The Portland Cement Association, which represents the industry, said it welcomed the new environmental rule -- a rare expression of approval for regulatory action by a Democratic administration.
''E.P.A.'s revised rule strikes the right balance in establishing compliance limits that, while still extremely challenging, are now realistic and achievable,'' the association said in a statement. ''P.C.A. and E.P.A. agreed that the revised standards and reset compliance period are essential to preserving jobs at domestic cement facilities, providing direct support for an American manufacturing industry that is critical to our nation's infrastructure.''

HEADLINE: Wish You A Gun-Free Christmas

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Well, the Mayans were sort of right.
The world didn't implode when their calendar stopped on Dec. 21. But the National Rifle Association did call for putting guns in every American school in a press conference that had a sort of civilization-hits-a-dead-end feel to it.
And we learned that negotiations on averting a major economic crisis had come to a screeching halt because Speaker John Boehner lost the support of the far-right contingent of his already-pretty-damned-conservative caucus. We have seen the future, and everything involves negotiating with loony people. 
Wayne LaPierre, the C.E.O. of the N.R.A., has major sway in Congress when it comes to gun issues. So the press conference, in which he read a rambling, unyielding statement in a quavering voice, while refusing to take any questions, could not have inspired confidence that the national trauma over the shooting at a Connecticut elementary school was going to be resolved anytime soon.
LaPierre immediately identified the problem that led to a deranged young man mowing down children with a semiautomatic rifle: Gun-free school zones. (''They tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem.'') Then he demanded a police officer in every American school. Or maybe a program to recruit armed volunteers.
At around the same time he was speaking, a gunman in Pennsylvania killed three people after shooting up a rural church. We will await the next grand plan for arming ministers.
The idea that having lots of guns around is the best protection against gun violence is a fairy tale that the N.R.A. tells itself when it goes to sleep at night. But an armed security officer at Columbine High School was no help. And history also shows that armed civilians generally freeze up during mass shootings -- for good reason, since usually the only way a crazed gunman gets stopped is when he runs out of ammunition. So what we continue to have is an excellent argument for banning weapons that spray lots of bullets.
However unhinged LaPierre might have seemed to the casual observer, he sent a clear message to members of Congress who fear the wrath of the N.R.A.: No compromise on banning assault weapons or any gun control issue. That made it hard to imagine any reform getting past the great, gaping maw that is the House of Representatives.
We witnessed the magic of the House Republican majority when the Tea Party forces blocked Boehner's plan to continue the Bush tax cuts for incomes under $1 million a year. This was around the time the speaker recited the prayer, much beloved by 12-step programs, about seeking the serenity to accept things you cannot change.
Boehner's bill was mainly a political ploy, so in a way, its defeat was meaningless. Except that it would be comforting not to believe that one of the critical players in Washington was always at the mercy of the loopy-extremist wing in his caucus.
Like, um, Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas. On Friday, Huelskamp represented the House resistance forces on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' in an appearance with great Mayan overtones. First, he gradually acknowledged that he was never going to vote for anything that raised taxes on anybody, even if it was understood by the entire world to be a negotiating tactic to win massive spending cuts, and avert massive tax increases on 99.8 percent of the population.
Then the discussion turned to the Connecticut shootings, and Huelskamp quickly announced that the nation did not have a gun problem. ''It's a people problem. It's a culture problem,'' he insisted. Anybody who disagreed -- like President Obama -- was, he said, using a tragedy ''to push a political agenda.''
In conclusion, the congressman announced that he had an 11-year-old son, ''and I have a choice whether he's allowed to play those video games. What I would suggest to moms and dads across this country is look at what your children are doing. ... And I'm not saying to pass a single law about that, because I think that would be politicizing the issue.''
Which we really hate. Politicizing.
There are so many ways we'd rather be celebrating the holidays. We would like to be gathering around the tree with loved ones, discussing current events in the form of that story about the theft of 6 million pounds of syrup from the strategic maple syrup reserve in Quebec.
But we are where we are. President Obama bid a Merry Christmas to the nation after announcing that he would try to re-avert the feared ''fiscal cliff'' with a bill that resolves virtually nothing but avoiding tax increases for the middle class. ''At the very least, let's agree right now on what we already agree on,'' he said. This is what currently passes for a wildly optimistic statement.
Meanwhile, a congressman from Wisconsin, angry about the failure to pass a farm bill, warned that the nation was about to fall over ''the Dairy Cliff.''
At least there's still eggnog. God bless us every one.

HEADLINE: Obama Pressing To Bar Tax Rise For Nearly All

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, conceding that a ''grand bargain'' for deficit reduction with Speaker John A. Boehner is unlikely, called Friday for Congress to approve a stripped-down measure by year's end to prevent a tax increase for all but the richest taxpayers and to extend aid for two million unemployed Americans.
''That's an achievable goal; that can get done in 10 days,'' Mr. Obama said to reporters during a hastily scheduled evening appearance in the White House briefing room. ''Call me a hopeless optimist,'' he added, ''but I actually think we can get this done.''
The president, who took no questions, read his statement just after a brief phone conversation with Mr. Boehner and a separate meeting at the White House with Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and Senate majority leader. It was Mr. Boehner's stinging defeat Thursday night -- when rebellious antitax House Republicans blocked a vote on his tax plan, after he had suspended negotiations with Mr. Obama -- that forced the president to reach for a fallback strategy with Senate help. 
By Friday, both the House and the Senate had closed for the Christmas break, and soon after his statement Mr. Obama left with his family for their annual holiday trip to Hawaii, his native state. His return date is dependent on events, aides said.
But as he and Democrats in Congress envision the coming days, the Senate would reconvene on Thursday to pass a compromise bill with commitments of cooperation from both Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, to keep the process moving.
Facing the Dec. 31 deadline for the expiration of all Bush-era tax cuts, Mr. McConnell would need to promise not to filibuster and Mr. Boehner would have to agree to a House vote on the Senate-passed bill.
Presumably, the sort of fallback measure that Mr. Obama seeks could pass in the House only with strong support from Democrats, since conservative Republicans, by their revolt against Mr. Boehner this week, have signaled that they would not approve even legislation that raises tax rates for fewer than 1 percent of Americans.
While many in both parties believe that Mr. Boehner will permit the vote on a compromise under the intense pressure, with public opinion on the newly re-elected president's side, doing so could threaten his already weakened speakership among conservatives.
Without such action, taxes would increase on Jan. 1 for every taxpayer. National polls have shown that most Americans would blame Republicans.
Mr. Obama, backed by Congressional Democrats, is proposing as he has for four years that the Bush tax rates be extended permanently for all income below $250,000 a year. In negotiations with Mr. Boehner he had tentatively agreed to raise that threshold to $400,000, and Congressional Democrats on Friday said they would go as high as $500,000 if it would seal a deal with Republicans.
But the Republicans' rejection of Mr. Boehner's bill on Thursday indicated that such a concession by Democrats would not sway the antitax absolutists among them. The speaker's so-called Plan B would have extended the Bush tax cuts for income up to $1 million, meaning a tax increase for only an estimated 0.3 percent of households, yet that was too much for many of his members.
While the strategy that Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid are now pursuing requires the acquiescence of both Republican leaders, Mr. McConnell has given no public indication whether he would give it. Asked at the Capitol before Mr. Obama's statement whether he would agree not to filibuster the stripped-down bill, he stepped onto an elevator and said ''Merry Christmas.''
Mr. Boehner has not said when or whether he would call the House back in session, but a spokesman said late Friday that the speaker would return to Washington from his Ohio home after the holiday ''ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress.''
''It is time for the Democratic-run Senate to act, and that is what the speaker told the president tonight,'' said Mr. Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck.
As Democrats on Capitol Hill described the possible fallback plan, it would be similar to legislation already passed by the Senate to extend the Bush-era tax rates for income below $250,000, increase to 20 percent from 15 percent the tax rate for capital gains and dividend income, and extend some other tax breaks.
But the new bill, they said, would also delay the so-called sequester in January -- across-the-board spending cuts in military and domestic programs that Mr. Obama and Congress scheduled in mid-2011 as an incentive for the two sides to approve an alternative, more deliberate deficit-reduction compromise. And it would extend federal unemployment benefits for the estimated two million Americans who have been out of a job for long enough to exhaust their initial state aid.
A spokesman for Mr. Reid said in a statement: ''As a fallback plan to protect the middle class, Republicans should support passing a bill that extends tax cuts for families up to $250,000, extends unemployment insurance, and delays the so-called sequester while we negotiate additional policies next year. But the bottom line is that moving forward on any solution will require cooperation from Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell.''
While Mr. Obama said the bill also should provide ''the groundwork'' for Congress to achieve additional deficit reduction next year through overhauls of the tax code and spending for fast-growing entitlement programs, chiefly Medicare, Congressional Democrats said the likely measure by itself would do nothing to put such efforts in motion.
The upshot is that, for a second year, Mr. Obama has been unable to reach agreement with Mr. Boehner on a debt-reduction framework that would stabilize the nation's debt, which is growing unsustainably as the population ages and medical costs rise.
Nor, Democrats said, would the measure extend the nation's borrowing limit, which the Treasury will hit early in 2013. Mr. Obama had hoped for a deal that would include a debt-limit increase, to avert the short of showdown that damaged the economy -- and both parties' public approval ratings -- last year.
By his resort to the stripped-down legislative option, Mr. Obama demonstrated that his and his party's priority is to prevent the Bush tax cuts from expiring for most Americans. But he might be forfeiting some leverage in the coming fiscal battles early next year over extending the debt limit.
Many Republicans are threatening to withhold support for increasing that limit, as they did in 2011, without Mr. Obama's agreement to deep reductions in spending for Medicare and Social Security. By both sides' reckoning, Mr. Obama would have a strong hand in the debt limit debate if it remained tied to the tax issue, given Republicans' zeal to avoid tax increases.
Mr. Obama, in his statement, pressed for conciliation.
''With their votes, the American people have determined that governing is a shared responsibility between both parties,'' Mr. Obama said. ''In this Congress, laws can only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. And that means nobody gets 100 percent of what they want.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Spurs Forecasts for Faster Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fresh signs of a strengthening economy emerged on Friday in reports that consumers spent and earned more in November and that companies for a second month increased their orders for some manufactured goods. 
In light of the latest figures, some analysts said the economy could end up growing faster in this quarter and next year than they had thought.
''I see momentum building,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. ''If Washington makes the moves it needs to make, then the economy should pick up speed next year,'' he said, a reference to the bumpy negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans to avert tax increases and spending cuts that are to take effect on Jan. 1.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending, which fuels about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.4 percent in November compared with October. Spending dipped 0.1 percent in October. But that decline was linked in part to disruptions from Hurricane Sandy.
Incomes rose 0.6 percent in November, the biggest gain in 11 months. That reflected a rebound in wages and salaries, which were depressed in October. Damage from Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast prevented some people from working at the end of October and reduced wages at an annual rate of $18 billion.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that a category of durable-goods orders that tracks business investment had risen 2.7 percent. That gain came after an upwardly revised 3.2 percent increase in October, the biggest in 10 months.
The back-to-back increases came after a period of weakness in so-called core capital goods that had raised concerns about business investment, a driving force in the economy.
The economy grew in the July-to-September quarter at a solid 3.1 percent annual rate. But some analysts said they thought growth would slow significantly in the October-to-December period. They predicted that consumers and businesses would cut back on spending because of worries about tax increases and spending cuts.
But after Friday's reports, Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays Capital, said Barclays was raising its estimate of growth in the current quarter to a 2.4 percent annual rate from a previous estimate of 2.2 percent.
Mr. Naroff said fourth-quarter growth could reach a 2.6 percent annual rate. He said he expected growth to reach 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2013 and 3.6 percent in the second quarter.
He said those estimates were based on his confidence that Washington policy makers would avert the sharp tax increases and spending cuts, which could set off a recession if they remained in place for much of 2013.
''I remain hopeful that saner heads will prevail in Washington,'' Mr. Naroff said.
Economists said the budget impasse and the uncertainty it had created about tax rates were hurting consumer confidence. The University of Michigan said on Friday that its index of consumer sentiment for December fell to 72.9, its lowest point since July. It was a sharp drop from the November reading of 82.7, a five-year high.

HEADLINE: In Paris, Longing for Damascus

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

 BODY:
PARIS -- Maha Assabalani can't get Damascus out of her mind.
A Yemeni citizen of Iranian origin and living in Paris, Ms. Assabalani, 27, spent just two years in the Syrian capital before she had to flee on a snowy day last February, crossing the border to Lebanon, with little idea of where to go next.
Yet Damascus has marked her forever. The day before she left, she watched in horror as Syrian security forces rounded up 15 friends and colleagues at the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression. Five are still in Syrian prisons, held without charge. 
''The thing that kills me is that I feel guilty all the time, because I left them behind,'' she said, sitting in a cafe on a wet December night. ''I am now on the outside. I am in Paris, and they are in the hell.''
How Ms. Assabalani came to be in the central Damascus offices of an independent media-monitoring organization, run by Syrian journalists and bloggers, is a story of the changes that keep swirling through the Middle East.
Her grandfather fled Iran after the Islamic Revolution and went to Yemen, where her father became a diplomat. That meant she grew up in different countries, before going to college in Jordan. In 2008, she spent a year in the United States on a Fulbright grant to the University of William and Mary, in Virginia.
She had been working as a consultant with the World Bank, when she decided to join her family in Damascus where her father was -- and still is -- posted. To keep busy, she enrolled in French classes.
The year was 2010, the eve of the Arab uprisings. What struck Ms. Assabalani then about Damascus, besides the sweet smell of jasmine, was the silence. ''Nobody had opinions,'' she said, using her fingers to zip her mouth closed, ''not even in joking.''
When she met a young woman in her French class who was ready to express her views openly, Ms. Assabalani was stunned. ''It was weird because she was so different from others,'' she said.
That friend introduced Ms. Assabalani to the Syrian Media Center. The group, founded in 2004 by Mazen Darwish, a journalist and lawyer, defended journalists and monitored media coverage, with a credo of strict neutrality.
It was a risky business, as Ms. Assabalani was warned from the start; the office had already been raided twice. But she held to the belief that her Yemeni diplomatic passport would protect not only her, but her colleagues as well.
Now, looking back, she sees her decision to join the group as a turning point.
''Seriously, it was the call of freedom,'' she said. ''No one has the right to kill, to torture, just because they want to destroy the free word.''
At noon on Feb. 16, a year after she started working at the center, a half-dozen Syrian security police officers stormed the center's offices, waving their guns. It was a Thursday, and the 14 staff members, and two visitors, had gathered to celebrate a young colleague's birthday later that afternoon. ''The security forces were faster than our surprise,'' said Ms. Assabalani.
When the police started collecting documents and cellphones, Ms. Assabalani, at her boss's urging, flashed her Yemeni passport. When everyone else was hustled out of the building into a waiting van, she was left behind.
After 10 minutes, the police came back to question her and make her sign a statement. ''They gave me a lecture on morals,'' she said. ''They said this not a good thing for a girl to be involved in, that it was a plot by the West against Syria.''
She was released and went first to a friend's house, before returning home at midnight to face her father. ''He wasn't happy,'' she said. Not only had she lied to him about her job, but she had crossed a forbidden line. ''He never wanted any of us to be in politics, and he considers activism to be politics,'' she said.
The next day, she left Syria, borrowing money from friends. Her father refused to help. To this day, he will not speak to her. ''There was no way I could stay,'' she said. ''It was clear they would take away the diplomatic immunity.''
She got a ride to a border town, where she spent an anxious 24 hours, blocked by the snow. After hitchhiking to Beirut, she eventually made her way to Paris, where the media center was established.
Today, she works with various human rights organizations, in particular with the Violations Documentation Center, which verifies reports and videos coming out of Syria. She is also pursuing, on scholarship, a master's degree at the American University of Paris.
Mostly, she lobbies ceaselessly on behalf of the five friends who are still in prison, some of whom she believes have been tortured. Among them are Mr. Darwish and the young man whose birthday celebration turned into a nightmare.
Others were released but remain under surveillance. A few made their way to other countries. Ms. Assabalani stays in touch as best she can. Even now, in Paris, she longs for Damascus, to be with those friends who stayed to defend the ''free word'' and their own dignity.
''Theirs are the stories that shifted everything for me,'' said Ms. Assabalani, nestling her chin into a thick wool scarf. ''Then there is the smell of jasmine. I would love to go back.''

HEADLINE: Debt Ceiling Rises Again As Threat For the U.S.

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The three major ratings agencies shrugged off this week's breakdown in talks aimed at ending the fiscal impasse in Washington by Jan. 1, saying their outlook for America's sovereign debt was already negative and would not immediately change.
But officials of the agencies said they were looking toward another looming fiscal deadline -- a date sometime in February or early March when the United States government risks running out of cash if Congress cannot find a way to raise its statutory debt ceiling. That date appears to pose more of a threat to the nation's credit rating than Jan. 1, when a package of onerous tax increases and spending cuts will begin if America goes over what is commonly called the fiscal cliff.
Stock investors appeared on Friday to be more concerned about the economic consequences of raising tax rates than about a downgrade of the nation's credit.
Stock prices fell around the world after Republican leaders announced Thursday night that they could not summon up enough votes for their own proposal to cut spending and raise taxes for the nation's most affluent households. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.94 percent Friday, or 13.54 points, to 1,430.15. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.96 percent, or 29.38 points, to 3,021.01, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.91 percent, or 120.88 points, to 13,190.84.
Stocks had largely risen over the last two weeks as President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner inched forward with small concessions.
Next week, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is expected to alert Congress that the government has officially run out of borrowing capacity, currently limited to about $16.4 trillion under law. But Mr. Geithner has a package of extraordinary measures he can take to buy some time, so that lawmakers will not have to raise the nation's debt limit even as they struggle to agree on how to shrink the budget deficit over the long term. The measures include suspending the issuance of special, nontrading Treasury bills that are used to finance federal employees' retirement plans.
Fitch Ratings said in a report Wednesday that it was watching both processes and that the time frame was not open-ended.
''If the negotiations on the fiscal cliff and raising the debt ceiling extend into 2013, and appear likely to be prolonged with adverse implications for the economy and fiscal stability, the U.S. sovereign rating could be subject to review, potentially leading to a negative rating,'' the agency wrote in its latest six-month report on sovereign debt.
It was a similar chain of events in 2011 that led Standard & Poor's to downgrade the Treasury's debt by one notch, an unprecedented move that set off wild swings in the stock market and led to downgrades at other highly rated institutions, like insurance companies, that had significant exposure to Treasury securities. Fitch and Moody's have both maintained their AAA rating for Treasury debt, which has long been considered risk-free.
A credit downgrade normally makes it more expensive for an institution to borrow, but that did not happen after Standard & Poor's action.
Global investors have kept on flocking to Treasuries, and the federal government's borrowing rate has fallen to 1.77 percent, from above 2.5 percent.
The last time Mr. Geithner told Congress the government had exhausted its borrowing capacity and was resorting to the extraordinary measures was mid-May 2011. The measures gave Congress about two-and-a-half months to authorize a borrowing increase. But lawmakers nearly missed the deadline, and some said they thought a default was preferable to more borrowing.
''We came within 10 hours or so of a major cash-flow problem, which is inconsistent, our analysts felt, with a Triple-A credit,'' John Piecuch, a spokesman for Standard & Poor's, said Friday.
Even after the downgrade, Standard & Poor's said its outlook was still negative, meaning that it saw a 1-in-3 chance of another downgrade within two years. It reaffirmed the negative outlook last June, resetting the two-year clock.
This time, fiscal analysts think Congress may have even less time to act on the debt ceiling. The Treasury has not said how long it will take to burn through the additional money, but the Bipartisan Policy Center, a research group, has projected that it will run out sometime in February. The Congressional Budget Office has said the special funding could last until mid-February or early March.
The ratings agencies have made clear that they will be watching to see whether Congress can raise the debt limit more smoothly this time.
''Last-minute agreements to raise the debt ceiling undermine confidence in the sovereign's willingness to pay, and thus its AAA status,'' Fitch said in its report.
''While Fitch believes the threat of default to be incredible, it would review the U.S. sovereign rating in the unlikely event of a repeat of the August 2011 debt-ceiling crisis.''
When a ratings agency puts a credit under review, it means it has begun an active, deliberate evaluation that could lead to a rating change in a matter of weeks or months. S.& P. had put Treasury debt under review mid-2011, several weeks before its downgrade that August.
Moody's said in a report this year that it would probably put the federal government's credit rating ''under review'' sometime after Mr. Geithner announces the exhaustion of the Treasury's borrowing capacity, and ''several weeks before the exhaustion of the Treasury's resources.''
Moody's had put the federal debt under review in July 2011 as well, but completed that review without changing the rating. It has reiterated since then that its outlook remains negative, and that it is watching this time for ''a relatively orderly process for the increase in the statutory debt limit.''
Mr. Piecuch of S.& P. said the agency saw this week's failure to agree on a plan to shrink the deficit in a different light from the failure last year to raise the debt ceiling until it was almost too late.
''In late July and August 2011, what seemed in the realm of possibility was that you could run up against that ceiling, and there would be a missed payment'' on the public debt, he said. ''In our system it's very clear -- a missed payment does constitute a default. When we're thinking about the fiscal cliff, and whether or not there's a deal by the end of this year, that's not the same thing.''
The dominant fear among investors on Friday was that politicians are running out of time to come up with an agreement and have no clear path to a solution.
''There's such disarray about coming to a compromise even within the Republican Party,'' said Douglas Cote, the chief investment strategist for ING Investment Management. ''The market just says, 'They are not coming up with any feasible plan.' ''
In the bond market, interest rates fell. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 8/32, to 98 22/32, while its yield dropped to 1.77 percent, from 1.80 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Putin Puts More Distance Between Russia and Assad

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS; Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Brussels, and Hania Mourtada and Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday added to recent signals that Moscow is slowly distancing itself from the regime of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, its longstanding but now severely weakened ally.
Asserting that Russia's main goal is to avoid chaos, Mr. Putin restated Russia's position that Syria's civil war could be resolved only through talks between the parties involved. But he insisted that ''we aren't a defender of the current Syrian leadership'' and said Moscow wants ''a democratic regime in Syria based on the expression of the people's will.'' 
He made the remarks at a joint news conference in Brussels with European Union leaders at the end of mostly fruitless talks centered on quarrels over energy and trade at the headquarters of the 27-nation bloc.
European nations are themselves divided over what to do about Syria but have increasingly tilted toward providing at least diplomatic support for the opponents of Mr. Assad.
Russia has been the Syrian government's main backer since an uprising against Mr. Assad began in 2011 and, along with China, has used its veto in the United Nations Security Council to block resolutions that would have imposed penalties on Syria.
But a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said recently that Mr. Assad's government could lose its struggle for survival and that Moscow was making contingency plans to evacuate citizens from the country.
At the same time, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said in an interview with Russia Today, a government news organization, that Moscow was still rejecting appeals from other countries to help persuade the Syrian leader to flee.
Mr. Putin described Russia's policy, which has put it at odds with Washington and also Arab countries that support Mr. Assad's opponents, as intended to avoid mayhem. ''We will do what we can so that there will be order in Syria,'' he said. ''Whatever changes are occurring in Syria, we would not like to see the same chaos there which we are seeing in other countries in the region.''
Mr. Putin's talks in Brussels focused mainly on energy, an issue of far more immediate importance to his own hold on power in Russia, where earnings from natural gas exports to Europe are a central pillar of an economic and political system built around state control of natural resources.
Mr. Putin pressed the European Union to exempt the natural gas behemoth Gazprom from rules aimed at promoting greater competition in the energy market. But he won no favors for the company, Russia's biggest.
Russia is Europe's main external energy supplier, and disputes over natural gas have dominated discussions between Moscow and the bloc for years. Friday's talks yielded no significant progress, said a European Union official briefed on them. While the visit to Brussels produced no breakthroughs, it did avoid the angry polemics of some previous meetings.
''We've had worse summits,'' the official said.
In Syria, meanwhile, activists reported fierce fighting in Hama Province, where rebel forces have spent days attacking checkpoints and other government positions. Opposition commanders described the moves as part of a broad offensive aimed at controlling a strategic link between the north, where the rebels control broad areas of territory, and the government strongholds in the center.
Abu Hadi, an activist in the village of Kafarzita,, north of Hama city, said the village and others had come under heavy government shelling on Friday. ''The situation is very bad,'' he said. ''People are panicking in the streets.''
Mr. Putin, who started his third term as president in May after taking a four-year break to serve as prime minister, dropped the combative language that has characterized previous appearances in Brussels. At the end of the news conference, he threw his arm over the shoulder of the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso. The two men had earlier sparred over European Union energy regulations that Mr. Putin described as ''discriminatory'' but that Mr. Barroso defended as applying to all countries, not just Russia.
The bloc has demanded that Gazprom open its export pipelines that run through member countries to other gas producers.
Mr. Putin complained that European energy regulation violated an earlier agreement on Russia-European Union economic relations, a claim the Europeans rejected. ''It creates confusion and undermines confidence in our mutual work,'' he said ahead of talks with Mr. Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, which represents the governments of the member states.

HEADLINE: Bank Reforms Fall Short, British Commission Says

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON - Regulators in Britain should have the power to completely split up banks, a government-commissioned report concluded Friday, adding that changes being currently proposed do not go far enough to prevent a future crisis.
Plans to tighten banking regulation, which are expected to go before Parliament early next year, "fall well short of what is required," the report said.
After the rate-rigging scandal that erupted this summer, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, asked a parliamentary commission to take a closer look at the planned banking regulation overhaul. While Mr. Osborne had previously backed the plan, the commission found the proposals lacking. 
"Banks need to be discouraged from gaming the rules," the report said. "All history tells us they will do this unless incentivized not to."
Now, Mr. Osborne has to decide whether to follow the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking and further strengthen the rules or bow to pressure from the banking sector, which argued that any strict rules would harm its competitiveness. Under the current proposals, banks would have to protect, or ring-fence, their retail banking operations from possible losses at their investment banking units.
But the commission said on Friday that the rate-manipulation investigation, which has ensnared more than a dozen big banks around the globe, highlighted the need for even stricter rules. "The latest revelations of collusion, corruption and market-rigging," the commission wrote in the report, are "the clearest illustration yet that a great deal more needs to be done to restore standards in banking."
The commission recommended "electrification" of such a ring-fence, meaning there needed to be periodic reviews that the partition remained in place and realistic threats to keep banks from trying to bend the rules.
"Over time, the ring-fence will be tested and challenged by the banks," the commission said in the report. "Politicians too, could succumb to lobbying from banks and others, adding to pressure to put holes in the ring-fence."
Authorities in the United States and Europe are putting the finishing touches on a new set of banking regulations intended to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis that started in 2007.
In the United States, the Volcker Rule, a part of the Dodd-Frank act that would prohibit banks from making risky bets with their money, is nearing approval by regulators. In France, the finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, introduced a banking bill similar to one planned by Mr. Osborne.
But in some cases, the details remain murky. While latest recommendations by the British lawmakers might not fundamentally change the requirements for banks, they do add to the regulatory uncertainty for banks, which the industry contends makes it difficult to shape strategy.
"It's suffocating," Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said. "There is constant speculation and change, and the number of resources banks have to make available is becoming more than a distraction."
Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, an industry lobby group, warned that such uncertainty could threaten London's position as a global financial center. "While it is clearly important to retain a degree of flexibility around the scope of the ring-fence, it is equally critical that any new system creates regulatory certainty for banks and their investors," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 3 Reminders Of Gridlock

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If Friday's memorial service for one of this country's long-serving senators was a somber recollection of a bipartisan era that once was, the rest of the day was a frenetic reminder of the political gridlock that now grips the capital.
At the National Cathedral, the nation's political leaders eulogized Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, who died this week at 88 after more than 50 years in Congress. President Obama said he learned from Mr. Inouye ''how our democracy is supposed to work.'' 
Across town, democracy was, at best, showing its gritty side as it ground along angrily, noisily and slowly: A weary Speaker John A. Boehner admitted failure in his efforts to avert a fiscal crisis with a bill to increase taxes on millionaires but asserted that his job was not at risk; a top National Rifle Association official bluntly challenged Congress to embrace guns at schools, not control them; and Mr. Obama bowed to the reality that Republicans had blocked his first choice to be the next secretary of state.
Though it has been 45 days since voters emphatically reaffirmed their faith in Mr. Obama, the time since then has shown the president's power to be severely constrained by a Republican opposition that is bitter about its losses, unmoved by Mr. Obama's victory and unwilling to compromise on social policy, economics or foreign affairs.
''The stars are all aligning the wrong way in terms of working together,'' said Peter Wehner, a former top White House aide to President George W. Bush. ''Right now, the political system is not up to the moment and the challenges that we face.''
House Republicans argue that voters handed their members a mandate as well, granting the party control of the House for another two years and with it the right to stick to their own views, even when they clash strongly with the president's.
And many Republicans remember well when the tables were turned. After Mr. Bush's re-election in 2004, Democrats eagerly thwarted his push for privatization of Social Security, hobbling Mr. Bush's domestic agenda in the first year of his second term.
New polls suggest that Mr. Obama's popularity has surged to its highest point since he announced the killing of Osama bin Laden. In the latest CBS News survey, the president's job approval rating was at 57 percent.
But taken together, events suggest that even that improvement in the polls has done little to deliver the president the kind of clear authority to enact his policies that voters seemed to say they wanted during the election.
Even some of the president's closest advisers said they were surprised by the ferocity of the Republican opposition.
''It's kind of a stunning thing to watch the way this has unfolded, at least to date,'' said David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama's longtime advisers. ''The question is, how do you break free from these strident voices?''
Friday's wrangling crystalized the challenges that Mr. Obama faces as he prepares to begin a second term next month.
In Mr. Boehner, the president has a potential deal-making partner who is unable to rally House Republicans behind his own plans, much less any agreement he might cut with Mr. Obama. In a news conference on Friday morning, Mr. Boehner essentially admitted he was running out of ideas to avert big tax increases and spending cuts early next year.
''How we get there,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters, ''God only knows.''
Just minutes later, officials with the National Rifle Association made clear what House Republicans had been whispering all week: The president's call for gun control in the wake of the Connecticut shooting is likely to run into tremendous opposition.
Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the firearm group, made clear the N.R.A. would not support the president's call for gun control, recommending instead a ''school shield'' program of armed security guards at the nation's schools as well as a national database that could track the mentally ill.
At the same time, Mr. Obama officially named Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts as his choice to lead the State Department -- a decision the president was forced to make after Republicans effectively blocked his preferred choice, Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations.
Ms. Rice, a longtime confidante of Mr. Obama's, was never formally nominated, but it was no secret inside the White House that the president would have liked her to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton early next year. But even on the heels of his electoral victory, Mr. Obama was unable to overcome Republican opposition -- led by Senator John McCain, the man he defeated for the presidency in 2008 -- to her nomination.
There are still 10 days left in which Mr. Obama might reach some sort of arrangement with Congress on averting a fiscal crisis that some predict could plunge the nation back into recession.
In an evening news briefing, Mr. Obama proposed a scaled-back deal that might avert fiscal crisis while putting off the major philosophical arguments for another day. He said he hoped lawmakers could cool off, "drink some eggnog, have some Christmas cookies and sing some Christmas carols" before coming back to Washington.
"Now is not the time for more self-inflicted wounds," Mr. Obama pleaded as he left town for a Hawaii holiday vacation. "Certainly not those coming from Washington."
In another 31 days, Mr. Obama will deliver his second Inaugural Address, providing him the opportunity to make his case to the American public on the direction he wants to take them in a second term. A few weeks after that, he will give his State of the Union address, which he has already promised to use in part as a call for new gun control laws.
Tom Daschle, a former Democratic majority leader in the Senate, said he feared Washington would remain paralyzed on taxes and other issues until the country truly faces a crisis.
''I worry that it's going to take that kind of a condition to bring people to the reality that they can't mess around here anymore,'' Mr. Daschle said.
On Friday, Mr. Obama was more hopeful.
''This is something within our capacity to solve,'' he insisted, even as he left Washington without even the outlines of a deal in place.

HEADLINE: Support for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood Erodes in an Islamist Bastion

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
AL TALBEYA, Egypt -- Mohamed Salamah used to vote with the Muslim Brotherhood. But in Saturday's referendum on the Islamist-backed constitution, Mr. Salamah says he is voting against it, mainly because he no longer trusts the movement.
''They aren't even doing anything very Islamic,'' said Mr. Salamah, a 24-year-old waiter in a cafe in Al Talbeya, a working-class neighborhood in Giza across the Nile from Cairo that was an Islamist stronghold in previous votes. ''They are just doing things that aren't very competent.''
Throughout the neighborhood, both loyal supporters and critics of the Brotherhood described a deep erosion in the group's street-level support. That was evident, they said, even before the low turnout and narrow margin in last weekend's first round of voting on what residents here call ''the Brotherhood constitution.''
The results so far appear to have surprised leaders of the Brotherhood and their opposition. And even if the draft constitution is approved, as expected, on Saturday in the second half of the vote, the new questions about the charter's popularity and the Brotherhood's mandate could prolong Egypt's political turbulence and, as a result, defer badly needed economic reforms as well. 
Residents here and around Cairo say the damage to the Brotherhood's popularity is unrelated to its religious ideology. It reflects a consistent trio of complaints: confusing economic policies of the Brotherhood-led government, a near-monopoly on power and civilian supporters' use of force against opponents in a street battle two weeks ago. Even so, many say the Brotherhood remains the most potent political force, in part because of the incoherence of the opposition, which has often focused on accusing the Brotherhood of imposing religious rule.
But for now economists say the battle for power is jeopardizing progress on the bread-and-butter issues that are paramount across the ideological spectrum. ''What the economy needs are decisions that are politically courageous and credible, and no government can do that now,'' said Ragui Assaad, an economist at the University of Minnesota with an office in Cairo.
A critical loan of more than $4 billion from the International Monetary Fund, expected to be signed this month, has been delayed until the political situation settles. The Egyptian pound is slipping against the dollar. And the most obvious step to improve the growth and fairness of the economy requires a government with credibility and political skill. Attempts at overhauling Egypt's vast subsidies to energy prices have in the past set off riots.
''What we have now is a government that lacks legitimacy but also economic competence,'' Mr. Assaad said. ''I don't see anything better coming out of this government.''
Brotherhood leaders have acknowledged the emergence of hostility against them. Mobs attacked more than three dozen Brotherhood offices, including its headquarters, in the prelude to the first round of voting on the constitution. ''I am telling everyone, do not hate the Muslim Brotherhood so much that you forget Egypt's best interest,'' said Mohamed Badie, the group's spiritual leader. ''You can be angry at us and hate us as much as you want; we cannot control affection. But I say to you, be rational. Protect Egypt. Its unity cannot survive what is happening.''
For many in Al Talbeya, the defining moment of the prelude to the referendum was the night of Dec. 5, when the Brotherhood called its supporters to defend President Mohamed Morsi against protesters outside his office. Ten died in the fight. And although the Brotherhood has claimed all those killed were its members, seemingly everyone in Al Talbeya still blamed the group for the violence.
''People don't like the Muslim Brotherhood as much as they used to, because they saw how they tried to control everything and how they beat people up,'' said Emad Mohamed Yosri, 37, a tailor who still counts himself a supporter of the group.
Omar Ateh, 30, a shopkeeper and Islamist, said he was trying to defend the Brotherhood. ''We are trying to make people understand, they are not from another planet,'' he said, ''they just like politics more than we do.''
But Ahmed Ragab, 14, interjected, ''If they are such good people, why are they beating people up in the streets?''
Many here accused Mr. Morsi, of the Brotherhood's political party, of focusing too exclusively on his Islamist base. Others pointed to Mr. Morsi's decree -- which he later repealed -- elevating his decisions above the judiciary until the passage of a constitution.
''No, no, no, that does not work for us,'' said Mohamed Omar, 37, a street cafe owner. ''Morsi tried to take everything for himself.''
Others pointed to policy missteps. Mr. Morsi campaigned on an elaborate ''renaissance project'' to turn around Egypt's bureaucracy, but no plans have materialized.
Al Talbeya residents complained about the Morsi government's plan to impose a 10 p.m. closing hour on the restaurants and shops of this all-night metropolis to save electricity, a plan that was abandoned at the last minute. Others noted that during the heat of the constitutional battle this month, the Morsi government unveiled tax increases on liquor, cigarettes and other goods to reduce a deficit. That, too, was suspended, through a 2 a.m. statement on Facebook.
A few criticized Mr. Morsi as both an authoritarian bully and a pushover. ''He shouldn't have made the order, and then he shouldn't have retracted it,'' Mr. Omar said. ''It made him look weak.''
After the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood's party and ultraconservative Salafis received more than 70 percent of the vote in the first parliamentary elections. Mr. Morsi's victory in the presidential runoff was closer, with about 52 percent of the vote. But his opponent, Ahmed Shafik, was a well-known former prime minister with the networks of the former governing party at his back.
The up-or-down vote on a new constitution, however, should have been an easy win for the Brotherhood, many analysts said. The charter would end two years of transitional chaos, and the organized opposition was negligible. But on the first day of voting, turnout was less than 33 percent, and only about 56.5 percent voted yes, according to the Brotherhood's own tabulations.
Some say they will vote yes this Saturday even though they have lost confidence in the Brotherhood, in the hope of establishing a more stable political process. ''Every time there is a problem now we have a fistfight, because we are still learning the culture of dialogue,'' said Sayed Abu Gabal, 45, a German teacher who previously voted for Islamists. ''We can't choose a new president every day.''
But after this, he said, ''I am not going to vote for the Muslim Brotherhood or the Salafis ever again.''

HEADLINE: East Asia's Defining Moment

BYLINE: By BRAHMA CHELLANEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The overlapping power transitions in East Asia's three main economies promise to mark a defining moment in the region's tense geopolitics. After the ascension in China of Xi Jinping, regarded by the People's Liberation Army as its own man, Japan's swing to the right in its parliamentary election seems set to fuel nationalist passion on both sides of the Sino-Japanese rivalry at a time when their brewing territorial spat in the East China Sea has created new risks to regional peace and stability.
South Korea's presidential election swept another conservative to power, but one who supports conditional rapprochement with North Korea -- a line at variance with the policies of departing President Lee Myung-bak and President Obama to keep Pyongyang punitively isolated. Park Geun-hye, the first woman to be elected president in a country that ranks poorly in gender equality, says she intends to tread the middle path between unconditional engagement and uncompromising chastisement. 
Park Geun-hye, the 60-year-old daughter of the military general who served as South Korea's dictator for 18 years until 1979, will assume the presidency in February -- a month before Xi, the new leader of the ruling Communist Party, becomes China's president -- while Shinzo Abe, a vocal nationalist, will return as Japan's prime minister a day after Christmas.
Abe, as prime minister in 2006 and 2007, proposed a concert of democracies in the Asia-Pacific -- an idea that spawned the Quadrilateral Initiative of Australia, India, Japan and the United States. Although China's strong response prevented the ''quad'' from developing into a formal institution, the four countries have been building strategic collaboration on a bilateral and -- in the case of India, Japan and America -- even trilateral basis.
East Asia's political transitions threaten to exacerbate regional challenges, which include the need to institute a stable balance of power and dispense with historical baggage that weighs on interstate relationships. Booming trade has failed to moderate territorial and historical disputes, highlighting that economic interdependence by itself cannot deliver regional stability unless rival states undertake genuine efforts to mend their political relations.
The timing of the political transitions is particularly problematic for the Obama administration, which has been urging China and Japan to peacefully resolve their disputes, while keeping the Stalinist regime in North Korea under stringent sanctions and seeking to promote strategic cooperation between its two allies, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea's decade-long ''sunshine policy'' of engagement with North Korea was reversed by the neoconservative Lee after he took office in 2008, triggering a series of tit-for-tat actions that brought the South-North relationship to a low by 2010.
Despite Pyongyang's successful rocket launch last week in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, Lee's successor and colleague in the Saenuri Party, Park, has promised to allow humanitarian aid to the North and to try to meet its young leader Kim Jong-un, who is less than half her age. Kim came to power a year ago following the death of his father. Park's more moderate approach could undercut Obama's sanctions-centered policy just when Pyongyang has signaled open defiance of U.S. and U.N. pressure.
Washington's diplomatic efforts notwithstanding, the new strains in South Korea's relationship with Japan, owing to the revival of historical issues, may also not be easy to mend. Earlier this year, Lee, at the last minute, canceled the scheduled signing of a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, besides scrapping a bilateral plan to finalize a military-related Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement. Weeks later, Lee provocatively visited the contested islets known as the Dokdo Islands in South Korea (which controls them) and the Takeshima Islands in Japan.
Park may seek to similarly pander to nationalist sentiment at home by taking a tough stance against Japan, especially to play down her father's collaboration with the Japanese military while Korea was under Japanese colonial rule.
China, meanwhile, has launched a new campaign of attrition against Japan over the Senkaku Islands. By sending patrol ships frequently to the waters around the islands -- and by violating the airspace over them -- Beijing has sought to challenge Japan's decades-old control, despite the risk that an incident could spiral out of control.
This assertiveness followed often-violent anti-Japanese protests in China in September. An informal Chinese boycott of Japanese goods has led to a sharp fall in Japan's exports to China, raising the risk of another Japanese recession. China remains Japan's largest overseas market. A nationalist backlash in Japan is in turn fanning nationalism in China, where the Communist Party has made ultranationalism the legitimating credo of its monopoly on power. Consequently, China and Japan find themselves in a vicious circle that is difficult to escape.
The risks to peace in East Asia posed by increasing nationalism and militarism are highlighted by the rise of a new Chinese dynasty of ''princelings'' -- the sons of revolutionary heroes who have widespread contacts in the military. In fact, what distinguishes Xi, a former military reservist, from China's other civilian leaders is his strong relationship with the military, whose rising clout has underpinned China's increasingly muscular foreign policy.
Against this background, the central challenge for East Asia's three largest economies is to resolve the historical issues that are preventing them from charting a more stable and prosperous future. As a Russian proverb warns, ''Forget the past and lose an eye; dwell on the past and lose both eyes.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Acts With Europe To Strengthen Iran Penalties

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The United States and Europe announced strengthened sanctions against Iran on Friday, increasing the number of blacklisted companies and individuals linked to the Iranian nuclear program, in coordinated actions that underscored the failure to resolve one of the most intractable international disputes.
Under the expanded sanctions, the Treasury Department in Washington blacklisted four companies and one person, and the European Union blacklisted 18 companies and one person. The Treasury said one of the four companies was also involved in supplying weapons to the military of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, Iran's Middle East ally, who has been fighting an insurgency for nearly two years. 
The steps were announced against a backdrop of uncertainty about the possible resumption of talks between Iran and the group of six big powers, which have been stalled for half a year, over Iran's uranium enrichment activities. Despite statements from both sides this month that they were ready to re-engage, a date and place have yet to be announced. Russian news services reported Thursday that the renewed talks might be scheduled in January.
The Treasury said the additions to the sanctioned category -- Iran's SAD Import-Export Company, Chemical Industries and Development of Materials Group, Doostan International Company, Marine Industries Organization and its director, Mustafa Esbati -- would now be subject to the freezing of assets and a ban on doing business with Americans. In addition, under a two-year-old law of sanctions on Iran, any foreign financial institution that does business with them risks expulsion from the American market.
In a statement, the Treasury under secretary responsible for sanctions, David S. Cohen, said SAD had also supplied material to Syrian military manufacturers of propellants for rockets, missiles and mortars. He accused the company of acting in ''support of the Assad regime's violence.''
The European Union did not immediately identify by name the additions to its Iran sanctions blacklist, saying they would be published later. But in a statement, the European Union said all the new entries had been ''involved in nuclear activities or providing support to the Iranian government.''
The actions by the Americans and the Europeans capped a year in which Iran has been subjected to the most onerous Western economic penalties yet because of the nuclear dispute. The measures have severely constricted its ability to conduct international financial transactions or to sell oil, Iran's most important export.
Iran has insisted that its operations to enrich uranium are for purely peaceful purposes. The group of six powers, comprising the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany, the so-called P5-plus-1, has insisted that Iran must abide by numerous Security Council resolutions demanding that it halt the enrichment and satisfactorily answer questions about what the West and Israel suspect is work toward the ability to make nuclear weapons.
At the last negotiating session, in Moscow in June, there had been some signs of compromise. Iran hinted then it was willing to halt enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, considered a short technical step from bomb-grade, if sanctions were lifted and the P5-plus-1 group formally recognized Iran's right to enrich its own nuclear fuel.
The P5-plus-1 group countered by demanding that Iran export its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium and disband the underground facility where it is produced, in exchange for an outside supply of processed nuclear fuel that cannot be used for weapons, a limited easing of sanctions and vows of more relief if Iran cooperates. Iran rejected the offer.
Israeli leaders, who consider Iran to be their country's most dangerous enemy, have said they believe Iran will have enough enriched uranium to produce a bomb by next summer. They have periodically warned of making a pre-emptive military strike on suspected nuclear targets in Iran to prevent such a possibility.

HEADLINE: Kerry, in Role of a Lifetime, Is Pick to Lead the State Dept.

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With a patrician bearing, nearly three decades of service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a highly decorated combat career in the Vietnam War, even a father who was a diplomat, John Kerry is the very picture of a secretary of state.
''In a sense, John's entire life has prepared him for this role,'' President Obama said on Friday at the White House, as he nominated Mr. Kerry to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first step in filling out a national security team for his second term.
Mr. Obama praised Mr. Kerry, 69, a Massachusetts Democrat, for having been immersed in ''every major foreign-policy debate for nearly 30 years.''
But though Mr. Kerry would bring even deeper experience to the job than Mrs. Clinton did, his appointment is likely to further centralize policy decisions in the White House, where for the past four years the president and a small circle of advisers have kept a tight grip on issues like Iran's nuclear program, China, Pakistan, and the winding down of the war in Afghanistan. 
''There's every reason to believe that we're going to have a very White House-centric foreign policy,'' said David J. Rothkopf, the chief executive of the Foreign Policy Group. ''Kerry is going to have to show his loyalty and willingness to work within the Obama system.''
In contrast to Mrs. Clinton, whom Mr. Obama named to his cabinet after they competed against each other in the 2008 presidential primaries, Mr. Kerry has been a loyal supporter of the Obama administration, guiding an arms-reduction treaty with Russia to ratification in the Senate and playing diplomatic troubleshooter for the White House in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan.
He has also figured at critical moments in Mr. Obama's career. At the 2004 Democratic National Convention that nominated him for president, Mr. Kerry gave the keynote speaking slot to Mr. Obama, then a little-known Illinois state senator, catapulting him to national prominence. In early 2008, Mr. Kerry endorsed him over Mrs. Clinton, and this fall he played the role of Mitt Romney in mock debates -- sessions that by some accounts put the president's teeth on edge.
''Nothing brings two people closer together than weeks of debate prep,'' said Mr. Obama on Friday, looking at a grinning Mr. Kerry. ''John, I'm looking forward to working with you instead of debating you.''
However lavish Mr. Obama's praise, his instinctive choice for secretary of state was Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, who withdrew her name from consideration after Republicans threatened to block her nomination because of statements she made after the lethal attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya.
Mr. Obama, his aides said, likes Ms. Rice's blunt style and is in sync with her view of foreign policy, which places a premium on aggressively defending human rights.
As a result, Ms. Rice, who is staying in her post, remains a candidate for a major foreign-policy post in the second term, according to administration officials. Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, is expected to stay on for a year or so, but Ms. Rice could be named to his job.
If she were to move into the White House, analysts said, that would pose a test for Mr. Kerry, given her access to Mr. Obama and their shared views on many foreign policy issues.
''The easiest model to see developing is one in which Kerry is on the road a lot, interfacing with foreign leaders, but the decision-making is done at the White House,'' said Elliott Abrams, who held foreign-policy posts in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.
Mr. Obama expressed confidence that Mr. Kerry would be confirmed by his Senate colleagues, a prediction that seemed safe, given that at a recent news conference, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, one of Ms. Rice's fiercest critics, jokingly referred to Mr. Kerry as ''Mr. Secretary.''
Mrs. Clinton has not announced her resignation, but she has made it clear she would not stay beyond a single term. Because she is recovering from a concussion, she did not appear at the midday announcement. Mr. Obama said that he spoke to her on Friday morning, and reported that she was ''in good spirits.''
In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Kerry was a leader of the ''highest caliber,'' who had advocated on behalf of diplomacy and development in Congress.
Mr. Kerry is working with her to adopt the recommendations of a recent report that harshly criticized the State Department for lapses in security in Benghazi, she said. The Benghazi attack, analysts said, underscored the management challenge for a longtime senator like Mr. Kerry in taking over a sprawling worldwide bureaucracy. Former aides to Mr. Kerry point out that he did oversee a huge, if temporary, campaign operation in 2004, which, though criticized for tactical missteps, was not viewed as poorly managed.
Although Mr. Kerry is not a global celebrity like Mrs. Clinton, his background as a presidential nominee and his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee have made him well known abroad, accustomed to meeting monarchs and presidents.
In October 2009, he was viewed as instrumental in persuading President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to accept the need for a runoff election. Mr. Kerry spent 20 hours over five days with Mr. Karzai, telling him over dinner and in long walks in the garden of the presidential palace in Kabul of his own frustrations at the ballot box in 2004.
''I told him, 'Sometimes there are tough things,' '' Mr. Kerry said in an interview at the time.
Before Syria exploded in violence, Mr. Kerry met several times with its president, Bashar al-Assad, hoping to draw him into a more constructive role in the Middle East. His failed effort at engagement may elicit some tough questions from Mr. McCain and other Senate hawks.
As a senator, Mr. Kerry compiled a strong record on climate change, and environmental groups issued enthusiastic responses to his nomination. But Mr. Obama, pressed at a recent news conference, said climate change would take a back seat to the economy, at least for now.
For Mr. Kerry, exerting influence internally is likely to be the greatest challenge of the job he has long coveted. Friends and former aides predicted he would carve out a role, just as Mrs. Clinton did.
''John was someone who from an early age dreamed of being president,'' said Jim Gomes, a former chief of staff to Mr. Kerry. ''As someone who grew up in a Foreign Service family, who testified before Senate Foreign Relations after coming home from Vietnam and who wanted to serve on Foreign Relations, this is a pretty terrific Plan B.''

HEADLINE: Even in Disarray, G.O.P. Has Power to Constrain Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It's been 45 days since voters reaffirmed their faith in President Obama and heartily endorsed his policy agenda for the next four years.
But if anything has been learned since then, it's that the president's power in Washington remains severely constrained by a Republican opposition establishment that is bitter about its losses, unmoved by Mr. Obama's victory and unwilling to compromise on social policy, economics or foreign affairs. House Republicans, in particular, argue that they won elections as well and they see their ability to retain control of the House as granting them the right to stick to their own views even when they clash strongly with the president's.
Friday's pre-Christmas wrangling in the nation's Capitol crystalized the challenges that Mr. Obama faces as he prepares to begin a second term next month. 
In House Speaker John A. Boehner, the president has a deal-making partner who is unable to rally House Republicans behind his own plans, much less any deal he might cut with Mr. Obama. In a news conference Friday morning, Mr. Boehner essentially admitted he was running out of ideas to avert big tax increases and spending cuts early next year.
''How we get there,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters, ''God only knows.''
Across town just minutes later, officials with the National Rifle Association made clear what House Republicans had been whispering all week: the president's call for gun control in the wake of the Connecticut shooting will run into tremendous opposition.
Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the firearm group, made clear the N.R.A. would not support the president's call for gun control, recommending instead a ''school shield'' program of armed security guards at the nation's schools as well as a national database that could track the mentally ill.
''The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,'' Mr. LaPierre said at a news conference that was interrupted by protests and allowed no questions from reporters.
At the same time, the White House said on Friday that it would officially name Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts as Mr. Obama's choice to lead the State Department -- a decision Mr. Obama was forced to make after Republicans effectively blocked his preferred choice, Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations.
Ms. Rice, a longtime confidante of Mr. Obama's, was never formally nominated, but it was no secret inside the White House that the president would have liked her to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton early next year. But even on the heels of his electoral victory, Mr. Obama was unable to overcome Republican opposition -- led by Senator John McCain -- to her nomination.
Polls suggest that Mr. Obama's popularity has surged to its highest point since announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden. In the latest CBS News poll, the president's job approval rating was at 57 percent.
But taken together, the events of the last five weeks suggest that even that improvement in the polls has done little to deliver the president the kind of clear authority to enact his policies that voters seemed to say they wanted during the election.
Even some of the president's closest advisers said they were surprised by the ferocity of the Republican opposition.
''It's kind of a stunning thing to watch the way this has unfolded, at least to date,'' said David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama's longtime advisers. ''The question is, how do you break free from these strident voices?''
Mr. Axelrod said that the election appeared to have had no effect on the president's most committed adversaries in the Republican House, many of whom remain committed to blocking his every move.
''You have got members of Congress who are simply unwilling to compromise and unwilling to yield to either the will of the American people or the demands of the moment,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
That may yet change.
There are still 10 days left in which Mr. Obama might reach some sort of arrangement with Congress on averting a fiscal crisis that some predict could plunge the nation back into recession. The White House says it remains hopeful.
In another 31 days, Mr. Obama will deliver his second inaugural address, providing him the opportunity to make his case to the American public on the direction he wants to take them in a second term.
A few weeks after that, he will give his State of the Union address, which he has already promised to use as a call for new gun control laws.
Those opportunities could provide the president with fresh political momentum in the new year.
He will need it. Whatever happens during the remainder of December, Mr. Obama will face economic challenges starting in January, including the likelihood of an extended debate with Republicans over how to overhaul the nation's tax code.
The president's team will need to shepherd Mr. Kerry through the Senate, past what appears to be minimal Republican opposition. But his nominees for other posts -- including, perhaps, Chuck Hagel, the former senator from Nebraska, to be secretary of defense -- may face tougher questions.
The gun control fight he has promised to wage will also compete for time and energy with a battle over comprehensive immigration reform, which he has also said he wants to begin early next year.
In a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Obama expressed hope about finding ways to compromise with his adversaries but also lamented the opposition that he faces in Republicans.
''They keep on finding ways to say no, as opposed to finding ways to say yes,'' Mr. Obama said on the tax and spending fight. On the subject of guns, he acknowledged the challenge of pursuing gun control in the face of political opposition from those same Reublicans.
''It won't be easy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: No-Layoff Company Now Writes Profit-Sharing Checks

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Marvin Windows and Doors, a family-owned business based in northern Minnesota, survived the financial crisis without any employee layoffs, a decision that won the company praise from presidential candidates and pundits alike.
On Friday, the company gave employees their first profit-sharing checks in four years, plus a ham. While the checks were relatively modest -- $799,379 was split among 2,573 employees, an average of $311 for each employee -- company officials said it was a sign that the worst of the crisis may be over.
''I think everyone believes that we are in the midst of a recovery, albeit a slow and painful one,'' said John Kirchner, a company spokesman. 
During the presidential campaign, President Obama referred to Marvin on several occasions as an example of a company that valued its employees over profits. Instead of laying off workers, Marvin officials cut back hours for hourly workers, eliminated some perks and cut pay for salaried employees, including executives and family members, with the goal of breaking even until the economy improved.
In his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, President Obama noted that Marvin did not lay off any of its employees when the recession hit ''even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants, even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business -- they give me hope.''
Ironically, Marvin's top executives are Republicans and reliable contributors to Republican presidential campaigns. The company's president, Susan Marvin, endorsed Mitt Romney at a rally with his running mate, Paul Ryan. In November, before the election, Mr. Romney visited a Marvin plant in Virginia.
''During a time when the housing market was in such distress, for them to be able to maintain their business and maintain their employee base is an extraordinary thing,'' Mr. Romney said, according to local news reports.
In an interview last year, several members of the Marvin family said the no-layoff policy was a long-term business strategy that they thought would give them a competitive advantage by retaining experienced workers when its competitors were shedding them. In addition, they said it would keep its hometown Warroad, Minn., vibrant at a time when others were being hard hit by unemployment.
''If we would have cut 1,000 people in early 2009, it would have had a devastating impact on the community,'' Jake Marvin, the chief executive, said in an interview on Friday.
The profit-sharing checks were delivered at the company's annual meeting, held in a hockey arena in Warroad, which is known as much for its hockey teams and walleye fishing as its sprawling windows plant. It was 3 degrees when the meeting began.
The size of the profit-sharing checks depended on an employee's job and years of service, he said. (Marvin employs 2,000 or so other employees who work for different brands and operate as separate businesses).
Kathy Fast, who has worked for Marvin for 55 years, said she was surprised when she received an envelope containing a green piece of paper, the deposit slip showing her share of the profits.
''I wasn't expecting that,'' said Ms. Fast, who is 76 and has worked in accounts receivable during her entire tenure at Marvin. ''That is great.'' She declined to say how much she received.

HIGHLIGHT: Barack, say it ain't so. 

 BODY:
Lots of chatter about the WSJ's account of how the deficit negotiations broke down, although -- a few fun quotes aside -- most of it is what we already pretty much knew. But here's a passage that bothered me: 
On Dec. 13, Mr. Boehner went to the White House at the president's request, joking he was going to the woodshed.
The president told him he could choose one of two doors. The first represented a big deal. If Mr. Boehner chose it, the president said, the country and financial markets would cheer. Door No. 2 represented a spike in interest rates and a global recession.
Oh, dear -- does the president still believe that failure to reach a Grand Bargain will cause an attack by the invisible bond vigilantes, and that this is the reason we should fear the fiscal cliff? How many times do we have to show that this notion is wrong both in theory and empirically? America can't run out of cash (except politically, if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling); it basically can't experience an interest rate spike unless people see an increased chance of economic recovery and hence a rise in short-term rates. And the people who have been predicting an interest rate spike any day now for four years shouldn't have any credibility at this point.
Oh yeah, and a global recession would surely mean lower, not higher, interest rates.
If Obama is still confused about this, it has real-world consequences -- in particular, it makes him too eager to reach a deal now now now, and hence too willing to concede on fundamental priorities.
Now, this wasn't a direct quote, and we can hope that whoever was talking to the WSJ got it a bit wrong. But not what I wanted to hear about administration thinking at this point.

HIGHLIGHT: National Rifle Association officials and lawmakers continue the debate over how to prevent gun violence on the Sunday shows. 

 BODY:
Just over a week since a massacre at a Connecticut elementary school left 26 dead, the debate over how to prevent future shootings continues. Following the National Rifle Association's announcement Friday of a new initiative to put an armed guard in every school, N.R.A. officials will join the Sunday shows to talk about the proposal. 
 David Keene, the president of the N.R.A., will join CBS's "Face the Nation" to discuss gun violence along with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who called the Connecticut shooting a "game changer."
Also on the program will be Representative Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican who has been tapped to fill retiring Senator Jim DeMint's seat, and the actor Ben Affleck, the founder of the Eastern Congo Initiative.
 Wayne LaPierre, a vice president of the N.R.A., will appear on NBC's "Meet the Press." Plus, as Congress and the White House break for Christmas without a deal to avert the looming fiscal crisis, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, discuss the prospects for compromise.
 Asa Hutchinson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration administrator and congressman who is head of the N.R.A.'s new effort to prevent school shootings, is scheduled to be on ABC's "This Week" and CNN's "State of the Union."
On ABC, Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, and Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, will also discuss talks to avoid the fiscal cliff and gun violence.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, will also talk about guns on CNN, and Representatives Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, and Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, will weigh in on the fiscal debate.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, will also talk about the struggle to reach a deal on "Fox News Sunday." Plus, Rick Warren, the evangelical minister and author of "The Purpose Driven Life," talks about his now 10-year-old bestseller.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles will be on Telemundo's Spanish-language public affairs program, "Enfoque," talking about gun control. TV One's "Washington Watch" also focuses on gun control and mental health care.
C-Span's "Newsmakers" has Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, incoming ranking Democrat of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, discussing the review of the September attacks in Benghazi, Libya.
And Bloomberg's "Political Capital" features Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican deputy whip, top Republican on the Joint Economic Committee and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.

HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times plus a look at the weekly addresses. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
The vice president of the National Rifle Association said steps other than gun control, like cracking down on criminals and fighting violence in the media, would be most effective in preventing mass shootings, Eric Lichtblau and Motoko Rich report. The N.R.A.'s proposal to place armed security officers in every school was met with widespread derision from school administrators, law enforcement officials and politicians across the nation.
 

        
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, was nominated to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, an appointment that is likely to further centralize policy decisions in the White House, Mark Landler writes.

        
President Obama called on Congress Friday to take action to prevent a fiscal crisis at the start of the year by raising taxes on the wealthy and extending aid for two million unemployed Americas, Jackie Calmes and Jonathan Weisman report. "Call me a hopeless optimist," he said, "but I actually think we can get this done."

        
Mr. Obama's political opposition -- unmoved by his re-election and unwilling to compromise on social policy, economics and foreign affairs - could severely constrictthe power of his presidency, Michael D. Shear writes in a news analysis.

        
Speaker John A. Boehner faces a formidable choice at the crossroads of his career: acquiesce to the will of a few Republican House members and watch the country enter a fiscal crisis, or come to an agreement with the White House, risking the persistent, and perhaps fatal, wrath of the party purist, Jennifer Steinhauer writes.
 Weekly Addresses 

        
Michelle Obama joined the president for this week's address to extend a holiday greeting to the nation and to thank the troops for their service. "This week, let's give thanks for our veterans and their families. And let's say a prayer for all our troops - especially those in Afghanistan - who are spending this holiday overseas, risking their lives to defend the freedoms we hold dear," President Obama said. "And remember, when our men and women in uniform answer the call to serve, their families serve right along with them," Mrs. Obama added. "In this country, we take care of each other. And in this season of giving, it's inspiring to see so many people all across America taking the time to help those most in need."

        
Speaker John A. Boehner used the weekly Republican address to remind Washington that Americans may have re-elected President Obama to the White House, but they re-elected a Republican majority to the House, too. "Unfortunately, the president and Senate Democrats have vowed to reject and veto all of our proposals while failing to offer a responsible solution of their own," he said. "The best way to address our crippling debt is to make significant spending cuts and fix our tax code to pave the way for long-term growth and opportunity. This is an approach most Americans support, and it remains Republicans' highest priority. But we only run the House. Democrats run Washington."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HANNAH, ANDREW LEE

 BODY:
HANNAH--Andrew Lee, 62, a longtime humanitarian organization executive, passed away suddenly at his home in Onancock, VA on Sunday, December 9th. Born in 1950, Hannah is the son of the late Virginia Sterling Hannah and Andrew Lee Hannah of Charleston, SC. "Drew," as he is known to friends and family, divided his time between New Canaan, CT and his home in Onancock on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. He attended the Notre Dame International High School, Virginia Military Institute and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a BA degree. 
Drew spent his entire career leading charitable causes, serving as a non-profit executive for more than 20 years. Previous to devoting his career to humanitarian causes, Drew was a contractor building homes across Colorado through the 1980s and 1990s. An accomplished skier and instructor, Drew spent his weekends teaching skiing to handicapped children. During that time, Drew also helped found the Christmas in April Program in Philadelphia (CIAP) in 1988. Since its founding, CIAP and its 1,000-plus volunteer force have helped hundreds of families rehabilitate and restore their homes throughout the west and North Philadelphia areas. He went on to become an executive with AmeriCares, a leading United States-based non-governmental humanitarian organization. One of Drew's greatest joys was as Director of AmeriCares Camp AmeriKids, a camp designed to enhance lives of youth living with HIV/AIDS. Following the aftermath of 9/11, Drew co-founded Bridge Foundation along with Stephen B. Skakel. The Bridge Foundation provides emergency and long term humanitarian assistance in response to disasters both man-made and natural -- across the U.S. and around the world. For the past decade, the foundation has led corporate and privately sponsored missions to such disaster hot spots as Darfur Sudan, Eastern Chad, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, Congo, Gabon, Albania, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Grenada and the U.S. Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. More recently, Drew led Bridge to facilitate humanitarian aid relief to Louisiana following hurricane Isaac and across the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area after Hurricane Sandy. Previously with Americares, Drew led missions to Bosnia, Cuba, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Chechnya, Azerbaijan, Georgia and North Korea. A hands-on expert on humanitarian relief issues, Drew, has been a sought-after source for media commentary on humanitarian relief issues. He has been interviewed by several news organizations such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Time, Newsweek and Business Week. He has also appeared on programs across the broadcast network spectrum including the CBS Evening News, NBC News with Tom Brokaw, the Today Show, Good Morning America, Larry King Live, the Charlie Rose Show, FOX News, CNN, and many others. Drew has also provided government testimony to the House Committee on International Relations and has participated on foreign relations-focused panel discussions at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, the University of Notre Dame Business School and the Woodrow Wilson Center. Through his work and his personal faith, Drew had a deep, personal commitment to take action on events and help people and families find their way through the most horrific of situations. Whether it was leading one of the first humanitarian airlifts to Haiti after the devastating earthquake, or delivering food, cooking oil (and candy) to orphanages in war-ravaged Afghanistan, Drew lived for these missions. When the call came in to rush medical supplies to a children's hospital in Iraq, or, closer to home, delivering bottled water and generators to power up an emergency operations center after a hurricane, Drew never said it couldn't be done. "We'll put our best people on it," was his stock response. And he delivered. Drew Hannah changed the lives of many people around the world and was fearless in his pursuits to help others. He also brought out the best of every person and situation. An accomplished chef, Drew was also an animal lover and a genuine connoisseur of fine wine and food. But most of all, he cherished the friendships he created over a lifetime of helping people. Drew is survived by his sister, Sterling Hannah, of Charleston, SC and his beloved dogs Raymond "Floyd" and Addie. There will be a remembrance celebration in his home town of Onancock, VA, Sunday, January 20, 2013, at Mallards at the Wharf between 2pm and 6pm. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to Bridge Foundation, PO Box 388 New Canaan, CT 06840, or the ESSPCA, PO Box 164, Onley, VA 23418. Memory tributes may be shared with the family at the website: www. williamsfuneralhomes.com Services by the Williams-Onancock Funeral Home.

HEADLINE: Critics' Picks: Great Performances Without the Guilt

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
1. Subaru BRZ (above)
2. Porsche Boxster (above left)
3. Honda Accord
4. Mazda CX-5
5. Volkswagen Up
6. Volkswagen Golf R
7. Acura RDX
8. Jaguar XKR-S
9. Lotus Evora S
10. Ford Escape 
1. SUBARU BRZ ($26,265 base, $28,265 as tested) Like the nearly identical Scion FR-S, the BRZ is a bracing antidote to the technology-encrusted cars that are sanitizing, homogenizing and digitizing the driving experience. The BRZ's chassis, steering, brakes and manual gearbox are all beyond reproach, and a compact boxer engine helps to keep the car low, balanced and planted on the pavement. It's all so simple and yet, aside from a clunky optional infotainment system, so close to perfect.
2. PORSCHE BOXSTER ($50,450 base, Boxster S as tested $88,720) Price creep has pushed the ''entry level'' Porsche ever further out of reach, but now that money gets you a prettier, more polished sports car with an all-grown-up interior.
3. HONDA ACCORD ($22,470 base, $24,980 as tested) I used to love you, Honda, but I think we can both admit that lately the thrill was gone. I felt you slipping away with each upsized, numbed-down redesign of the Accord, with hybrids that seemed unresponsive to my touch, with new Civics that made me feel cheap. But I can tell you want to patch things up, and your 2013 Accord has won back my heart. The car oozes competence with a brilliant but understated design that I appreciate more each time I start the engine. Once again, Honda is making America's best midsize mass-market sedan. Like Marlene Dietrich, I'm falling in love again.
4. MAZDA CX-5 ($21,490 base, $28,295 as tested) As noted here before, Mazda is turning out some great products -- like the delightful Mazda 3 compact car -- but not enough people are buying them. The appealing CX-5 should help to change that, with fuel economy and road manners that stand out from the generic crowd of compact crossovers.
5. VOLKSWAGEN UP (starting at $12,500 in Europe) No, you can't buy one here, and that's exactly the point. Detained while on a tourist visa, the tiny 3-cylinder Up was brilliant in Manhattan traffic and thoroughly composed upstate at autobahn-worthy speeds, returning 50 m.p.g. all the while. VW says it won't bring the Up to America, but it should, as an object lesson in the right way to build a city car that's seven inches shorter than a Mini.
6. VOLKSWAGEN GOLF R ($34,760 base, $35,490 as tested) A $35,000 Golf? Are you kidding? Well, no, although that money could get you a quite respectable Mustang or Camaro. But those pony cars don't come with the R's Haldex all-wheel drive, its turbocharged 256-horse 4-cylinder, its crisp 6-speed shifter or its unshakable twisty-road composure. The R needs no excuses: it's simply the hottest VW hatchback yet.
7. ACURA RDX ($35,215 base, $40,315 as tested) Finally, an upscale crossover utility that overcomes the biggest deficiency of the breed: the RDX drives like a car, and a very good one at that.
8. JAGUAR XKR-S (coupe $132,875 base, convertible $140,825 as tested) A lot of us love the idea of a Jaguar more than the actual cars the company has been turning out in the last few decades. But this 550-horse supercharged version of the XKR sports car is a rumbling, thundering, most exclusive cat that turns heads everywhere it roams.
9. LOTUS EVORA S ($78,895 base, $89,745 as tested) As a daily driver it's not as practical or comfortable as a Porsche 911, but this lightweight midengine exotic (albeit one with a supercharged Toyota engine) has a chassis that seems hard-wired to its pilot's brain, with exquisite handling and ridiculous levels of feedback. And it's pretty much the only small-batch exotic car that, at less than $100,000, falls into the just-out-of-reach price range.
10. FORD ESCAPE ($23,295 base, $37,025 as tested) Admittedly, this pick comes with flashing red asterisks. Already the 2013 Escape has had four recalls (three for fire hazards), and its touch-screen controls remain annoying and distracting. (Can't we leave Microsoft at the office?) But I was in possession of an Escape when Sandy surged in, and it was not just my lifeline for a week, it also proved a warm, eager-to-please companion with carlike manners and S.U.V. practicality. Ford got a lot of the important stuff right; now it needs to sweat the details. (Ditto for Fusion, Focus, Fiesta, etc.)

HEADLINE: Debating the Future of Charitable Deductions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Please Don't Mess With the Charitable Deduction'' (Economic View, Dec. 16), Robert J. Shiller was wrong to be seeking the deduction's preservation, and here's why:
I gave $500 to Planned Parenthood this year, but I'll get about $125 of that back at tax time next year. That means I will have indirectly forced the United States Treasury to donate $125 to Planned Parenthood. And that, in turn, means that every other taxpayer will have been forced to make a tiny contribution to Planned Parenthood, too. 
Of course, at least some of those taxpayers are strongly anti-abortion, who wouldn't countenance contributing to that organization.
And what if I had donated that same $500 to a church? Similar arguments would apply, but I'd also be forcing the Treasury to violate the restrictions of church-state separation.
Charitable donations should be personal and voluntary. When they are underwritten by the government, they are neither.

To the Editor:
With a sigh of resignation, I agree with Robert J. Shiller about the need to continue the charitable deduction. Eliminating the deduction would have a devastating effect on money donated to charities, so it must remain.
Yet if the charitable deduction ''springs directly from some of our deepest values,'' as the column says, why would eliminating it have such a consequence? If we were truly giving out of a sense of obligation, a deduction wouldn't factor into our giving.
But we live in the real world, where no one gets (or gives) something for nothing. We need to keep financially encouraging people to be generous.

To the Editor:
Charitable contributions are good, but do we need to reward those that give them? And do we need to reward the affluent givers more than their poorer sisters and brothers?
In the column, Professor Shiller rightfully cited the Marshall Plan as an outstanding moment in the history of our country. But it was not an act of individual charity; it was an act of community charity. As a community we can certainly continue to act charitably even if individual charitable contributions are not subsidized by the tax code.

To the Editor:
Robert Shiller makes a strong case for saving the charitable deduction, and for making it available to those who currently don't itemize their deductions. But no one, including the highest-income Americans, should be entitled to deduct the first dollar they give to charity, as itemizers may do today.
A more sensible rule would be to limit charitable deductions to amounts above a basic threshold. Then, the deduction would provide an incentive, and tax relief, only for giving generously. In fact, President John F. Kennedy once proposed that charitable deductions, as well as all other itemized deductions, be allowed only for amounts over 5 percent of a taxpayer's income.
Surely some threshold for the charitable deduction makes sense and may well encourage greater giving over all.
John O. Fox

To the Editor:
Professor Shiller's argument resonated with me. It reinforced both the overwhelming challenge of comprehensive tax reform, and the urgency with which it must be confronted. After all, charitable giving is important to many of us, and the tax deduction is a relevant incentive.
However, segments of society can make equally heartfelt and convincing arguments for the vast majority of tax deductions. It is this incrementalization of interests that has resulted in the remarkably cumbersome and unequal tax contributions we now endure.
Strong support for a truly blank slate on taxes, with the elimination of virtually all deductions, is the only way to ensure equal tax contributions by all citizens in the same economic position. I firmly hope that soliciting donations from after-tax income would have a limited impact on the philanthropic ideals that make America unique.
Mayer Rosenzweig
Manhattan, Dec. 16

To the Editor:
I agree wholeheartedly that the charitable deduction be maintained, to encourage giving to the less fortunate or for research to benefit mankind. But I object that thousands of charities support very similar missions, thus allowing for too many C.E.O.'s, presidents and other highly paid people performing similar roles in these organizations.
There should be a nationwide effort to streamline charitable organizations, thereby eliminating these duplicative but highly paid roles, and thereby allowing the organizations to reduce their administrative expenses.

HEADLINE: There's Something About Stevie

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON, PETER LATTMAN and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
You want the headquarters of Steven A. Cohen, one of the most successful financial speculators of our time, to look like Dr. Evil's secret lair. But it is just another office-park building, a low-slung affair of tinted glass and red brick, on the southern fringes of Stamford, Conn.
From the outside, there's nothing particularly special about this address, 72 Cummings Point Road. But inside -- well, everyone on Wall Street has heard the stories.
Some of them are even true. 
We are, after all, talking about the man known on the Street as ''Stevie'' -- hedge fund magnate, multibillionaire, prodigious art collector and, of late, person of intense interest to federal authorities. Inside his offices, vast fortunes are won and lost. Careers are made and unmade. Type-A egos are inflated and crushed, sometimes in the space of hours. And there, Mr. Cohen, a trader with an almost preternatural knack for reading fear and greed in the marketplace, prowls relentlessly for an edge over everyone else.
Mr. Cohen, 56, today sits at the center of more concentric circles of money and power and worry and suspicion than perhaps anyone else in the hedge fund game. Neither he nor the private investment firm that bears his initials, SAC Capital Advisors, has been accused of wrongdoing. But over the past half-decade, as a vast federal investigation into insider trading has unfolded in stunning detail, the questions have returned again and again. In soft-carpeted executive suites, on fervid trading floors, in Park Avenue co-ops and on Connecticut back lanes, the same subject keeps coming up: Just what is going on inside 72 Cummings Point Road?
It is, perhaps, understandable. On Wall Street, Mr. Cohen is envied and feared in equal measure. Hedge fund managers like him have helped redefine what it means to be rich, even if most ordinary people don't quite understand what they do or how they do it.
For years, the investigations had swirled around SAC, but that was about all. Then, on the afternoon of Nov. 28, the word went out across Wall Street: the Securities and Exchange Commission was warning that it might go after SAC, too. Elsewhere in the investigations, prosecutors have turned up damning evidence through F.B.I. wiretaps and reached into the boardrooms of some of the mightiest corporations. Seventy-one people have been convicted in a sweep that dwarfs the 1980s-era Wall Street scandals involving Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken.
But there is also this undeniable fact: The government inquiry has linked six former SAC employees to insider trading while at the fund; three have pleaded guilty. On Friday, a grand jury indicted Mathew Martoma, a former employee who was arrested last month on charges that he used inside tips about a clinical drug trial to help SAC earn profits and avoid losses totaling $276 million. (A lawyer for Mr. Martoma says his client is innocent.) In the Martoma case, prosecutors for the first time have tied Mr. Cohen to questionable trades.
And, of course, there are the stories. The mind-boggling investment returns. The office tantrums. The pressure-cooker environment inside SAC. The time that Mr. Cohen's wife, Alexandra, gave him an A.T.M. for Christmas, because he kept borrowing cash from her. The time she gave him an Aston Martin sports car for his birthday, and he promptly sold it.
All of those are true.
But there are other stories, too, like the one about how Mr. Cohen engaged in insider trading back in the 1980s, before hedge funds like SAC burst onto the scene. That claim was made by Mr. Cohen's former wife, in a 2009 lawsuit in which she sought $300 million. A judge dismissed her claims as little more than rumor and speculation.
And then there is the one about how Mr. Cohen and a cabal of other hedge fund managers waged a campaign of dirty tricks in the early 2000s to sink the share prices of several companies. Judges tossed out those cases, too. (SAC maintained that the various lawsuits were groundless, and one of the companies ended up issuing an apology.)
Mr. Cohen declined to be interviewed for this article. But a spokesman for SAC reiterated what the firm has been saying all along: SAC and Mr. Cohen acted appropriately.
Friends stand by Mr. Cohen. Several point to his charitable works.
''A lot of people will write a check. He goes beyond that,'' says Kenneth G. Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, who has worked with Mr. Cohen on a number of philanthropies.
Paul Tudor Jones, another hedge-fund giant and a founder of the Robin Hood Foundation, says: ''There has been no greater friend or benefactor to people in need in New York City over the last decade.''
SAC employees are far more reluctant to discuss their boss publicly. So are former employees, in no small part because SAC requires everyone to sign unusually strict nondisclosure agreements. Even those in the broader financial world don't want to be quoted by name, for fear of incurring Mr. Cohen's wrath and jeopardizing lucrative business with him.
But interviews with dozens of current and former business associates, hedge fund investors, Wall Street executives and personal acquaintances, as well as an examination of the regulatory record associated with Mr. Cohen's 34 years of Wall Street trading, paint a complex portrait. Mr. Cohen, all agree, is a masterful trader, perhaps one of the greatest. He is quick to take profits, quicker to cut losses. He is obsessed with trading, and he trades to win. If he cruises the Caribbean or flies off to London, an SAC advance team races ahead of him to set up trading screens.
INSIDE 72 Cummings Point Road, Mr. Cohen has created a tense, unpredictable atmosphere. Beyond the bright reception area (a showcase for Mr. Cohen's collection of contemporary art) and the pantry (a stockpile of chips and bottled water) the trading floor stretches out.
Row after row of traders, analysts and money managers -- mostly youngish men dressed in hedge-fund casual khakis, expensive shirts and SAC fleeces -- peer into computer screens. The place is weirdly quiet. The telephones never ring; instead, they flash. Mr. Cohen doesn't like to be disturbed. On his orders, the temperature is kept cool to help keep people alert. Off to one side is his office. Like the rest of the place, it is nothing special: a desk, some couches, a conference table.
In this setting, Mr. Cohen pits his money managers against one another in daily cage matches for his attention and money. Mr. Cohen wants investment ideas -- lots of them -- and he cherry-picks the best ones for his personal portfolio. (SAC oversees a total of $14 billion in assets, roughly $8.4 billion of which belongs to Mr. Cohen and his employees.)
The rules here are simple: Win and you get rich. Lose and you get fired. In fact, Mr. Cohen, a mercurial master, has been known to fire money managers for making one bad trade, even if they had made him millions before.
''He liked putting a team together and watching them destroy each other,'' a former SAC employee says. ''It's like the 'Hunger Games.' ''
On good days -- the days when Mr. Cohen is making money -- he tends to be fairly low-key, even a bit awkward. On bad days -- when he is losing -- he can seem like a tyrant, a schoolyard bully.
One former SAC employee recalls a time he mentioned a stock that he liked to Mr. Cohen.
''What's wrong with you? Are you a freak?'' this person recalls Mr. Cohen as saying.
''I don't think I'm a freak,'' the employee said.
''O.K., because you're weird.''
One day, according to someone then at SAC, when a money manager lost money, Mr. Cohen stood up and slowly clapped: Clap ...clap ...clap.
''It was vicious,'' this person says.
Still another former SAC employee recalls how Mr. Cohen seized on one of the employee's investment ideas and turned a quick profit. The employee encouraged Mr. Cohen to hold on, arguing that the company's business was growing, that this was a good long-term investment.
''It's just a stock,'' Mr. Cohen retorted, adding an expletive, according to this former employee.
One analyst who worked with Mr. Cohen says: ''He's a speculator fundamentally. He doesn't care if a stock is worth $10 or $100. He wants to know if it is going from $10 to $11 or $10 to zero.''
If the risks at SAC are great, so are the potential rewards. In good years, the firm's top portfolio managers earn tens of millions of dollars annually. Mr. Martoma, the former SAC portfolio manager indicted on Friday, was paid a $9.4 million bonus in 2008. He was 34.
And Mr. Cohen himself enjoys the trappings of wild success. He lives in a Gatsby-esque mansion in Greenwich, Conn., with his wife and seven children. Two summers ago, he spent time with Rupert Murdoch on a yacht off St. Martin. But Mr. Cohen hardly looks like a Wall Street slicker. He is bald and slightly paunchy, and his daily wardrobe tends toward baggy jeans and zip-up sweaters.
If Mr. Cohen is worried, he isn't showing it publicly. Last October, as investigations simmered, he took in a private Katy Perry concert sponsored by NetJets, the private-jet concern, at the Best Buy Theater in Times Square. He also was at the 12/12/12 benefit concert at Madison Square Garden. (Mr. Cohen has donated $500,000 to a relief fund for victims of Hurricane Sandy.)
Mr. Cohen was seated, naturally, right near the stage.
PLENTY of smart people head to Wall Street with dreams of getting rich. But how does anyone scale such lofty heights? Mr. Cohen's story begins in a simple house on Lawson Lane, in Great Neck on Long Island. That house, with its crescent driveway and small backyard, is only about 20 miles as the crow flies from Wall Street. It is many billions of dollars, and a world away, from Mr. Cohen's life today.
It was here that he grew up, the third of eight children. His father ran a company in the garment district in Manhattan that made women's dresses. His mother taught piano. The centerpiece of the house was her Lucite piano. She also collected Lucite figurines.
Steven Cohen told The Wall Street Journal in 2006 that his mother, who died in 2005, thought he was ''smart but lazy.'' She viewed his younger brother, Donald Cohen, as the financial success of the family. He is now an accountant.
No one in Great Neck could have predicted Mr. Cohen's future success. But early on, there were inklings. He was a fiercely competitive soccer player at Great Neck North High School. According to the 1974 yearbook, he scored 10 goals during his senior year and made the All Division team.
While at Great Neck North, he worked at a local grocery store but quit when he realized he could make more money playing poker -- hundreds of dollars at a time, his brother Donald once said. Among the local youths who played soccer and poker with him was Kenneth Cole, the designer. Mr. Cole and other high-school friends don't recall that Mr. Cohen talked about Wall Street. But Mr. Cohen told an audience at an investment conference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel last year that his love of trading started in high school. Even then, he was reading stock tables in the newspaper and watching the stock ticker scroll by at a local brokerage firm.
There ''was something in my blood, something that I loved,'' Mr. Cohen told the crowd, according to several people who attended the conference.
By the time Mr. Cohen arrived at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1974, it was clear that he had his sights on Wall Street. He studied economics and pledged Zeta Beta Tau, alongside several other young men who would go on to make a mark in finance: Joel Greenblatt, the head of the hedge fund Gotham Capital, and Marc Utay of Clarion Capital, a private equity firm.
But even at Wharton, Mr. Cohen stood out. He often wore a sports jacket around the fraternity. He read The Journal every morning, three of his fraternity brothers recall. And, as at Great Neck North, there was poker. Four, five nights a week, Mr. Cohen would preside over a game. And, more often than not, he won.
''They were playing for what I thought were extraordinary stakes for a bunch of college students,'' recalls Brad Gordon, a Zeta Beta Tau brother. ''I'm the world's worst poker player and Steve, who was quite the shark, would have me for lunch.''
AS his friends expected, Mr. Cohen took off for Wall Street as soon as he collected his degree in 1977. But the Wall Street of that era was almost unrecognizable from the Wall Street of today. Yes, traders traded and bankers cut deals. But the computer-driven trading that now dominates the markets was still in its infancy.
Instead, young men -- and it was mostly men -- brayed for money over the telephone. Traders scrawled ''buy'' and ''sell'' tickets by hand, and by the closing bell, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was slick with slips of paper. Many ordinary Americans were only beginning to discover mutual funds. The great bull markets of the 1980s and 1990s were still years off.
One thing, however, hasn't changed: information was, and still is, the most precious commodity of all.
It was into this milieu that Mr. Cohen stepped in 1978. For all his smarts and ambition, he didn't land at one of Wall Street's premier investment houses -- a Goldman, a Morgan, a Merrill. He ended up Gruntal & Company. At the time, Gruntal, which traced its history back to the 1880s, was pushing aggressively into a business that seemed tailor-made for Mr. Cohen: proprietary trading. Gruntal wanted to wager its own money in the markets and had created a proprietary trading desk. Mr. Cohen was the desk's second employee.
Despite his apparent savvy, Mr. Cohen almost was fired shortly after he joined Gruntal. One spring day in 1978, as the stock market fell and Mr. Cohen was losing money, he was so harried that he wrote every trading ticket incorrectly, recalls Andrew Redleaf, who worked with him at Gruntal and today runs a hedge fund in Minneapolis. A trading boss wanted Mr. Cohen let go.
But the next day, and then the next, the market bounced back.
''They made a few hundred thousand dollars,'' Mr. Redleaf says. ''And the rest was history.''
Mr. Redleaf, who collected two mathematics degrees in three years at Yale, says Mr. Cohen's talent for sensing changes in trading volumes -- ''reading the tape,'' in Wall Street parlance -- was ''supernatural.'' While Mr. Redleaf would leave to get lunch and stretch his legs, Mr. Cohen often stayed glued to his desk, his suit jacket slung over his chair, his tie hanging low.
Mr. Cohen was so focused that he often wouldn't pick up the phone, even when his boss was calling, Mr. Redleaf recalls. Before long the prop desk and its star, Mr. Cohen, had been given $2 million of Gruntal's money to trade with -- an enormous sum, considering that the firm had just $10 million in capital. On a good day, Mr. Cohen and his fellow traders might make $50,000 to $100,0000 for the firm. By the time Mr. Redleaf left Gruntal, in 1980, Mr. Cohen was collecting 60 percent of any profits he made on his own trades.
''He was always going to make more money,'' Mr. Redleaf says. ''I do consider it one of the mistakes of my career not watching longer and more carefully.''
BUT through the 1980s, as the merger mania of the junk-bond era presaged the scandals to come, controversy dogged Gruntal. Some on Wall Street wondered if the brokerage was playing square.
Mr. Cohen's former wife, Patricia Cohen, claimed that Mr. Cohen got a tip in 1985 about the impending takeover of RCA by General Electric and used it to make a quick, $20 million profit, according to a suit she filed in 2009. When Mr. Cohen was questioned about his trades by the S.E.C., he took the Fifth Amendment. A judge dismissed Ms. Cohen's case in 2011, and no charges were ever brought against Mr. Cohen. He, however, was censured by the New York Stock Exchange, and barred from the stock market for four weeks, for a trade in 1991. The Big Board panel determined that he had executed a trade that was designed to inflate the price of a stock he already held. That trade, for 100 shares, turned a $220,240.50 loss into a $120,178 one, the exchange said.
By this time, Gruntal had also become embroiled in an embezzlement fraud. A former executive vice president was sent to prison. Mr. Cohen wasn't implicated.
New management was brought in and decided that Mr. Cohen's prop desk had to go.
''It was the Wild West, and he was the biggest gunslinger,'' says one senior Wall Street official, who was a trader at the time.
And so Mr. Cohen took his winnings and struck out on his own to start a hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors. To raise additional capital, he sought out Peter Kellogg, a legendary trader who ran Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, a major brokerage firm on the New York Stock Exchange floor. Over breakfast at Spear Leeds offices, the two discussed the markets and Mr. Cohen's plans. Mr. Kellogg came away impressed, and he and his firm invested $2 million in the fledgling SAC, according to an executive involved in the negotiations. SAC went online with $25 million, roughly half of which was Mr. Cohen's, and fewer than a dozen employees.
A month later, Mr. Cohen returned Spear Leeds's money, along with a handsome profit. Having an investment from a brokerage firm placed constraints on SAC, like limiting his ability to participate in lucrative initial public offerings. ''He didn't want to give up any game,'' said a trader who worked with SAC early on.
If Mr. Cohen's business was looking up, so was his personal life. Two years after his divorce in 1990, he married Alexandra M. Garcia, a single mother who had grown up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.
Her influence on him was immediate. The year they were married, Mr. Cohen -- a famously private man -- landed in the tabloids after appearing on a television talk show. He told the host, Cristina Saralegui, that he had slept with his ex-wife while dating Ms. Garcia. The divorce, he explained, had been messy.
''It wasn't a clean separation,'' Mr. Cohen told the TV audience. ''We went back and forth for a while.'' Although Mr. Cohen was already rich by most standards, he didn't flaunt his wealth. He and Alexandra, known as Alex, rented an apartment on 79th Street and First Avenue -- the Upper East Side, but not Park Avenue. They later moved to Greenwich, and SAC would move its headquarters from Madison Avenue to the General Electric building in Stamford. Most days, Mr. Cohen got his lunch at the G.E. cafeteria and ate at his desk, a SAC employee recalls.
During these years, Mr. Cohen planted the seeds of a culture that has endured as the firm has grown. Mr. Cohen, for instance, instituted a Sunday call with his team. Traders would cut short family time and trips to the Hamptons for the conversation with Mr. Cohen. He wanted to hear their best ideas for the week ahead.
''I hated Sundays. I dreaded Sundays,'' a former employee says.
Mr. Cohen urged his traders to be bold. Every January, he had Ari Kiev, a psychiatrist who had built a career helping athletes and Wall Street traders achieve peak performance, and whom Mr. Cohen had met while at Gruntal, ask SAC traders to project their funds' performance for the year ahead. Mr. Kiev would work through their worries -- about a big loss, for example, or the mercurial Mr. Cohen -- and try to get them to think bigger. (SAC stopped the practice after Mr. Kiev died in 2009.)
Mr. Cohen certainly knew how to use incentives. ''The numbers were off the charts, and the compensation was unmatchable,'' says a portfolio manager who worked with Mr. Cohen and considers him a friend.
By the mid-1990s, SAC was on fire. It was around that time that analysts and salespeople at the mighty Goldman Sachs convened and were told that Wall Street was changing, in part because of people like Mr. Cohen. A senior institutional salesman at Goldman told the assembled crew that big clients like Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, were still important. But he added that the balance of power was tipping toward hedge funds, which traded heavily and, in the process, generated huge commissions for Goldman.
At the time, SAC was Goldman's No. 1 stock-trading client. And Mr. Cohen, the salesman said, wanted something in return for those commission dollars: to be notified first when Goldman changed its recommendations on stocks. Such a call was then perfectly legal -- and, for any investors, potentially lucrative. If Goldman called a stock a ''buy,'' you wanted to know about it, and fast.
THE SAC crew was in the crowd, toasting their boss at Mr. Chow, a Wall Street hangout on the East Side. It was the summer of 2006, and they were there to celebrate Mr. Cohen's 50th birthday. Along with the traders and money managers was Larry Gagosian, the New York art dealer, who had become a go-to specialist for Mr. Cohen as he built his formidable collection.
Some stood up and thanked Mr. Cohen for all the money they had made while working for him. Alex Cohen made a joke about the size of ''the rock'' on her finger. By the standards of the era, the party wasn't a blowout. Many people just stood around talking about the markets, according to two people who attended.
Yet, at that very moment, Mr. Cohen was on top of the world. The stock market was booming, and so was SAC. In 2003, he had personally made $350 million, a combination of compensation and investment gains. In both 2006 and 2007, he made $900 million, according to estimates from Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine. SAC was looking to expand. It even considered going public.
Mr. Cohen was turning heads in the art world, too. He had become a sought-after client for top dealers like Mr. Gagosian. He paid $8 million for ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,'' a 13-foot tiger shark in a tank of formaldehyde, by Damien Hirst. At one point, Mr. Cohen told an acquaintance that he was eyeing paintings of Mao Zedong by Andy Warhol. He figured that they would be good investment. The thinking was, ''there will be a lot of Chinese billionaires someday,'' a former SAC trader says.
But for all of SAC's money and power, storm clouds were already gathering. The first rumbles came in 2003, when a trader at SAC came under scrutiny from the S.E.C. for possible insider trading violations. Regulators wanted to know if he had been given early access to Wall Street research reports. He was never charged.
Two more blows came in 2006, when two separate companies -- the pharmaceuticals concern Biovail and Fairfax Financial, a Canadian insurance company -- filed lawsuits against SAC and other hedge funds, essentially accusing them of spreading lies in order to profit from a decline in their share prices. The Biovail case was featured on a ''60 Minutes'' report, which cast the company as the victim and the hedge funds as predators. Both lawsuits were dismissed and Biovail, in 2011, paid $10 million to SAC and issued an apology.
But not even Mr. Cohen could dodge the financial crisis. On one particularly dark day in 2008, one SAC trader recalls, Mr. Cohen said: ''I lost a billion dollars today. And probably $250 million in art.'' It turned out to be SAC's worst year ever, the only year it lost money. Its flagship fund plummeted 19 percent in value. Mr. Cohen personally lost $750 million, according to Alpha magazine.
Former employees say Mr. Cohen was furious about the big paychecks he awarded the previous year. He immediately began cutting expenses. SAC dismissed roughly a third of its money managers. For those who stayed, there were no more monthly birthday cakes.
BUT as much as anything else, Mr. Cohen is now grappling with the confluence of powerful forces. The proliferation of hedge funds over the past decade has made spotting winning trades much more difficult. Many funds simply crowd into the same investments, reducing the potential payoff for everyone.
On top of that, changing rules, particularly one barring corporate executives and research analysts from disclosing information to select investors, have dulled SAC's edge in information. SAC and others have increasingly leaned on so-called expert networks, which match industry specialists with financial players hungry for information. SAC, for instance, was a top client of the Gerson Lehrman Group, a top expert network firm.
Then, of course, there are all those investigations. In one case, a former SAC fund manager who pleaded guilty told investigations that he thought trafficking in corporate secrets was part of this job description. In another case, the government says Mr. Martoma had a 20-minute phone conversation with Mr. Cohen the day before SAC dumped $700 million in two pharmaceutical companies and proceeded to make a big bet against them. Prosecutors said Mr. Martoma had secret information about the companies' drug trials from a doctor.
In sworn testimony with an S.E.C. lawyer last summer, Mr. Cohen said he sold the stocks after the analyst told him that he had lost conviction about the investments, according to a person briefed on the case. Mr. Cohen said he could recall little else. In late November, amid all the headlines, the S.E.C. warned that it might file a civil fraud lawsuit against SAC related to the Martoma case.
Mr. Cohen has made a lot of people unimaginably rich, including himself. One question today is whether his investors -- who have profited handsomely from his trading prowess over the years -- will stand by him now. He has had a solid year, up 12 percent through November. Yet private bankers at Citigroup have advised clients not to invest more money with SAC. Investors who want to pull their money at their first chance, next March, have until Feb. 15 to advise SAC of their intentions. Inside 72 Cummings Point Road, the troops are worried. SAC employees have begun working the phones on weekends, exploring other job opportunities, says the chief executive of a bank that does business with Mr. Cohen's firm.
As for Steve Cohen, he could walk away tomorrow, return every dime to his investors. And, barring the worst, he would be left, in quiet splendor, to trade with a fortune few can even fathom.

In an essay accompanying a portfolio of graffiti murals on subway cars in last Sunday's Metropolitan section, David Gonzalez explained how the photographer, Henry Chalfant, captured the images. On The Times's Lens blog, readers responded with a debate about the value of graffiti as art. A selection of their comments and a response from Mr. Gonzalez are below.
I had to ride these vandalized subways with windows darkened at a time of sky-high crime. Not to mention frequent train breakdowns leaving one in filthy, darkened, defaced subways stuck underground. No no no no celebrating of vandalism. And sorry, if these are the cream of the graffiti crop you get an idea of how ugly and unoriginal this ''art'' was. No no no. Depressing. Infuriating. And yes, ugly. Still is ugly. Like the inferior commercial art that it is. And the point is made here that celebrating this behavior definitely encouraged it. Yes, document this historical phase somewhere by all means. But don't romanticize it for crying out loud.

While there are a million photos of the interiors of cars, tagged and dirty, which were indeed disgusting, I find these exterior full car works to be pretty amazing. I don't like all of it, but I like it a lot more than the full car advertisements that run on lines like the Shuttle these days. I'd rather see a full car advertising FUTURA than a full car advertising TARGET or MICROSOFT any day. Granted, one of them yields money to the city and the other doesn't. But that is how the decades have spun -- spaces and places and parks that used to be public three decades ago are now private and reserved only for advertising and for underwriters.

Any way you look at it, it's vandalism -- an attempt to frustrate, intimidate, and inconvenience law-abiding people. And if the reporter had had to ride inside it every day, perhaps he wouldn't be so sanguine today.

These kids made these pieces in the dark with zero formal art education and actually got to be remembered for something other than gangs, drugs and basketball. In a train yard with no more than 4 or 5 feet between two trains these kids, yes kids, did all of this work that's always tarnished by people who can't embrace it for what it is/was. Of course this is something to be remembered and documented as it is the next step in art history after the '60s. The canvas is dead and the city is alive. These kids deserve every bit of fame they get/got.

Ah the good old days when this city had a soul before it went all Disney. People tend to forget that this art form was only able to be done on these trains when the city neglected them and the whole system. These kids took it upon themselves to paint these then rust buckets to have something pretty to look at as well to feel like something in a time when things were just bad both economically and socially. It's funny how with the recent fare hikes we're still paying for the then transit neglect. I don't think they'll ever catch up so expect it to go again.

Having grown up and gone to school in the South Bronx -- until I went off to Yale -- yes, I rode those trains. A lot. The 4 and the D, and the CC -- which were so old that Father Principe at Cardinal Hayes used to joke Jesse James himself probably robbed them.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg, LaPierre And the Void

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
FOR a week after the Newtown shooting, the conversation was dominated by the self-righteous certainties of the American center-left. In print and on the airwaves, the chorus was nearly universal: the only possible response to Adam Lanza's rampage was an immediate crusade for gun control, the necessary firearm restrictions were all self-evident, and anyone who doubted their efficacy had the blood of children on his hands.
The leading gun control chorister was Michael Bloomberg, and this was fitting, because on a range of issues New York's mayor has become the de facto spokesman for the self-consciously centrist liberalism of the Acela Corridor elite. Like so many members of that class, Bloomberg combines immense talent with immense provincialism: his view of American politics is basically the famous New Yorker cover showing Manhattan's West Side overshadowing the world, and his bedrock assumption is that the liberal paternalism with which New York is governed can and should be a model for the nation as a whole. 
It's an assumption that cries out to be challenged by a thoughtful center-right. If you look at the specific proposals being offered by Bloomberg and others, some just look like reruns of assault weapon regulations that had no obvious effect the last time they were tried. Others still might have an impact on gun violence, but only at a cost: the popular idea of cracking down hard on illegal handguns, for instance, would probably involve ''stop and frisk'' on a huge scale, and might throw more young men in prison at a time when our incarceration rates are already too high.
But instead of a kind of skepticism and sifting from conservatives, after a week of liberal self-righteousness the spotlight passed instead to ... Wayne LaPierre. And no Stephen Colbert parody of conservatism could match the National Rifle Association spokesman's performance on Friday morning.
It wasn't so much that LaPierre's performance made no concession whatsoever on gun restrictions or gun safety -- that was to be expected. It was that he launched into a rambling diatribe against an absurdly wide array of targets, blaming everything from media sensationalism to ''gun-free schools'' signs to '90s-vintage nihilism like ''Natural Born Killers'' for the Newtown tragedy. Then he proposed, as an alternative to the liberal heavy-handedness of gun control, something equally heavy-handed -- a cop in every school, to be paid for by that right-wing old reliable, cuts to foreign aid.
Unfortunately for our country, the Bloomberg versus LaPierre contrast is basically all of American politics today. Our society is divided between an ascendant center-left that's far too confident in its own rigor and righteousness and a conservatism that's marched into an ideological cul-de-sac and is currently battering its head against the wall.
The entire Obama era has been shaped by this conflict, and not for the good. On issue after issue, debate after debate, there is a near-unified establishment view of what the government should do, and then a furious right-wing reaction to this consensus that offers no real policy alternative at all.
The establishment view is interventionist, corporatist and culturally liberal. It thinks that issues like health care and climate change and immigration are best worked out through comprehensive bills drawn up by enlightened officials working hand in glove with business interests. It regards sexual liberty as sacrosanct, and other liberties -- from the freedoms of churches to the rights of gun owners -- as negotiable at best. It thinks that the elite should pay slightly higher taxes, and everyone else should give up guns, SUVs and Big Gulps and live more like, well, Manhattanites. It allows the president an entirely free hand overseas, and takes the Bush-Obama continuities in foreign policy for granted.
The right-wing view is embittered, paranoid and confused. It opposes anything the establishment supports but doesn't know what it wants to do instead. (Defund government or protect Medicare? Break up the banks or deregulate them? Send more troops to Libya or don't get involved? Protect our liberties or put our schools on lockdown?) Sometimes the right's ''just say no'' approach holds the establishment at bay -- as on climate change and immigration, to date. But sometimes, as the House Republicans are demonstrating in the budget showdown, it makes the eventual defeat that much more sweeping.
What's missing, meanwhile, are real alternatives -- not only conservative, but left-wing as well. On national security, the left has essentially disappeared, sitting on its hands while President Obama embraces powers every bit as imperial as those his predecessor claimed. On economic issues, the Occupy Wall Street movement passed on the chance to actually advance an anticorporate agenda in favor of consciousness raising and theoretical self-gratification.
As for a conservatism with a serious program, and a real understanding of the challenges facing America today -- well, hopefully it will surface by the 2016 presidential campaign. Till then, it's the hubris of Bloomberg versus the humbug of LaPierre. Merry Christmas, America.

HEADLINE: For Poor, Leap to College Often Ends in a Hard Fall

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
GALVESTON, Tex. -- Angelica Gonzales marched through high school in Goth armor -- black boots, chains and cargo pants -- but undermined her pose of alienation with a place on the honor roll. She nicknamed herself after a metal band and vowed to become the first in her family to earn a college degree.
''I don't want to work at Walmart'' like her mother, she wrote to a school counselor.
Weekends and summers were devoted to a college-readiness program, where her best friends, Melissa O'Neal and Bianca Gonzalez, shared her drive to ''get off the island'' -- escape the prospect of dead-end lives in luckless Galveston. Melissa, an eighth-grade valedictorian, seethed over her mother's boyfriends and drinking, and Bianca's bubbly innocence hid the trauma of her father's death. They stuck together so much that a tutor called them the ''triplets.'' 
Low-income strivers face uphill climbs, especially at Ball High School, where a third of the girls' class failed to graduate on schedule. But by the time the triplets donned mortarboards in the class of 2008, their story seemed to validate the promise of education as the great equalizer.
Angelica, a daughter of a struggling Mexican immigrant, was headed to Emory University. Bianca enrolled in community college, and Melissa left for Texas State University, President Lyndon B. Johnson's alma mater.
''It felt like we were taking off, from one life to another,'' Melissa said. ''It felt like, 'Here we go!' ''
Four years later, their story seems less like a tribute to upward mobility than a study of obstacles in an age of soaring economic inequality. Not one of them has a four-year degree. Only one is still studying full time, and two have crushing debts. Angelica, who left Emory owing more than $60,000, is a clerk in a Galveston furniture store.
Each showed the ability to do college work, even excel at it. But the need to earn money brought one set of strains, campus alienation brought others, and ties to boyfriends not in school added complications. With little guidance from family or school officials, college became a leap that they braved without a safety net.
The story of their lost footing is also the story of something larger -- the growing role that education plays in preserving class divisions. Poor students have long trailed affluent peers in school performance, but from grade-school tests to college completion, the gaps are growing. With school success and earning prospects ever more entwined, the consequences carry far: education, a force meant to erode class barriers, appears to be fortifying them.
''Everyone wants to think of education as an equalizer -- the place where upward mobility gets started,'' said Greg J. Duncan, an economist at the University of California, Irvine. ''But on virtually every measure we have, the gaps between high- and low-income kids are widening. It's very disheartening.''
The growing role of class in academic success has taken experts by surprise since it follows decades of equal opportunity efforts and counters racial trends, where differences have narrowed. It adds to fears over recent evidence suggesting that low-income Americans have lower chances of upward mobility than counterparts in Canada and Western Europe.
Thirty years ago, there was a 31 percentage point difference between the share of prosperous and poor Americans who earned bachelor's degrees, according to Martha J. Bailey and Susan M. Dynarski of the University of Michigan. Now the gap is 45 points.
While both groups improved their odds of finishing college, the affluent improved much more, widening their sizable lead.
Likely reasons include soaring incomes at the top and changes in family structure, which have left fewer low-income students with the support of two-parent homes. Neighborhoods have grown more segregated by class, leaving lower-income students increasingly concentrated in lower-quality schools. And even after accounting for financial aid, the costs of attending a public university have risen 60 percent in the past two decades. Many low-income students, feeling the need to help out at home, are deterred by the thought of years of lost wages and piles of debt.
In placing their hopes in education, the Galveston teenagers followed a tradition as old as the country itself. But if only the prosperous become educated -- and only the educated prosper -- the schoolhouse risks becoming just another place where the fortunate preserve their edge.
''It's becoming increasingly unlikely that a low-income student, no matter how intrinsically bright, moves up the socioeconomic ladder,'' said Sean Reardon, a sociologist at Stanford. ''What we're talking about is a threat to the American dream.''
High School
No one pictured the teenagers as even friends, much less triplets. Angelica hid behind dark eyeliner, Melissa's moods turned on the drama at home, and Bianca, in the class behind, seemed even younger than she was. What they had in common was a college-prep program for low-income teenagers, Upward Bound, and trust in its counselor, Priscilla Gonzales Culver, whom everyone called ''Miss G.''
Angelica was the product of a large Mexican-American family, which she sought both to honor and surpass. Her mother, Ana Gonzales, had crossed the border illegally as a child, gained citizenship and settled the clan in Galveston, where she ruled by force of will. She once grounded Angelica for a month for coming home a minute late. With hints of both respect and fear, Angelica never called her ''Mom'' -- only ''Mrs. Lady.''
Home was an apartment in a subdivided house, with relatives in the adjacent units. Family meals and family feuds went hand in hand. One of Angelica's uncles bore scars from his days in a street gang. Her grandmother spoke little English. With a quirky mix of distance and devotion, Angelica studied German instead of Spanish and gave the fiesta celebrating her 15th birthday a Goth theme, with fairies and dragons on the tabletop globes. ''Korn chick,'' she fancifully called herself, after the dissonant metal band.
But school was all business. ''Academics was where I shined,'' she said. Her grandmother and aunts worked at Walmart alongside Mrs. Lady, and Angelica was rankled equally by how little money they made and how little respect they got. Upward Bound asked her to rank the importance of college on a scale of 1 to 10.
''10,'' she wrote.
Melissa also wanted to get off the island -- and more immediately out of her house. ''When I was about 7, my mom began dating and hanging around a bunch of drunks,'' she wrote on the Upward Bound application. For her mother, addiction to painkillers and severe depression followed. Her grandparents offered her one refuge, and school offered another.
''I like to learn -- I'm weird,'' she said.
By eighth grade, Melissa was at the top of her class and sampling a course at a private high school. She yearned to apply there but swore the opposite to her mother and grandparents. Protecting families from their own ambition is a skill many poor students learn. ''I knew we didn't have the money,'' Melissa said. ''I felt like I had no right to ask.''
New to Upward Bound, Melissa noticed that one student always ate alone and crowded in beside her. ''She forced her friendship on me,'' Angelica said.
Bianca joined the following year with a cheerfulness that disguised any trace of family tragedy. As the eldest of four siblings, she had spent the years since her father's death as a backup mother. To Bianca, family meant everything.
She arrived just in time for the trip at the heart of triplets lore -- the Upward Bound visit to Chicago. While they had known they wanted more than Galveston offered, somewhere between the Sears Tower and Northwestern University they glimpsed what it might be. The trip at once consecrated a friendship and defined it around shared goals.
''We wanted to do something better with our lives,'' Angelica said.
Ball High was hard on goals. In addition to Bosco, a drug-sniffing dog profiled in the local paper, the campus had four safety officers to deter fights. A pepper spray incident in the girls' senior year sent 50 students to the school nurse. Only 2 percent of Texas high schools were ranked ''academically unacceptable.'' Ball was among them.
Melissa now marvels at what a good parent her mother has become to her younger brother after she stopped drinking and was treated for her depression. But when she returned from the high school trip to Chicago, the conflicts grew so intense that Miss G. took her in one night. ''I really put her through a lot,'' said Melissa's mother, Pam Craft. ''Everything she did, she did on her own -- I'm so proud of her.'' Miss G.'s notes variously observed that ''there are limited groceries,'' ''student is overwhelmed'' and ''she's basically raising herself.''
While faulting her mother's choices in men, Melissa made a troubling choice of her own with her ambitionless boyfriend. Among the many ways he let her down was getting another girl pregnant. Yet as many times as they broke up, they got back together again. ''He is going to bring her down,'' Miss G. warned.
Despite the turmoil, Melissa earned ''commended'' marks, the highest level, on half her state skills tests, edited the yearbook and published two opinion articles in the Galveston newspaper, one of them about her brother's struggle with autism. Working three jobs, she missed so much school that she nearly failed to graduate, but she still finished in the top quarter of her class. It was never clear which would prevail -- her habit of courting disaster or her talent for narrow escapes.
Returning from Chicago, Bianca jumped a grade, which allowed her to graduate with Melissa and Angelica.
Angelica kept making A's on her way to a four-year grade-point average of 3.9. ''Amazingly bright and dedicated,'' one instructor wrote. A score of 1,240 on the math and reading portions of her SAT ranked her at the 84th percentile nationwide. When the German teacher suddenly quit, the school tapped her to finish teaching the first-year course.
Outside school, Angelica's life revolved around her boyfriend, Fred Weaver, who was three years older and drove a yellow Sting Ray. Fred was devoted -- too devoted, Mrs. Lady thought, and she warned Angelica not to let the relationship keep her from going to college. Fred's father owned a local furniture store, and everyone could see that Fred's dream was to run it with Angelica at his side.
Senior year raced by, with Miss G. doing her best to steer frightened and distracted students though the college selection process. Despite all the campus visits, choices were made without the intense supervision that many affluent students enjoy. Bianca, anchored to the island by family and an older boyfriend, chose community college. Melissa picked Texas State in San Marcos because ''the application was easiest.''
Angelica had thought of little beyond Northwestern and was crestfallen when she was rejected. She had sent a last-minute application to a school in Atlanta that had e-mailed her. Only after getting in did she discover that she had achieved something special.
Emory cost nearly $50,000 that year, but it was one of a small tier of top schools that promised to meet the financial needs of any student good enough to be admitted. It had even started a program to relieve the neediest students of high debt burdens. ''No one should have to give up their goals and dreams because financial challenges stand in the way,'' its Web site says.
Plus an unseen campus a thousand miles away had an innate appeal. ''How many times do you get the chance to completely reinvent yourself?'' Angelica said.
Rich-Poor Gap Grows
If Melissa and Angelica felt that heading off to university set them apart from other low-income students, they were right. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school. And among that group, fewer than half graduate.
Income has always shaped academic success, but its importance is growing. Professor Reardon, the Stanford sociologist, examined a dozen reading and math tests dating back 25 years and found that the gap in scores of high- and low-income students has grown by 40 percent, even as the difference between blacks and whites has narrowed.
While race once predicted scores more than class, the opposite now holds. By eighth grade, white students surpass blacks by an average of three grade levels, while upper-income students are four grades ahead of low-income counterparts.
''The racial gaps are quite big, but the income gaps are bigger,'' Professor Reardon said.
One explanation is simply that the rich have clearly gotten richer. A generation ago, families at the 90th percentile had five times the income of those at the 10th percentile. Now they have 10 times as much.
But as shop class gave way to computer labs, schools may have also changed in ways that make parental income and education more important. SAT coaches were once rare, even for families that could afford them. Now they are part of a vast college preparation industry.
Certainly as the payoff to education has grown -- college graduates have greatly widened their earnings lead -- affluent families have invested more in it. They have tripled the amount by which they outspend low-income families on enrichment activities like sports, music lessons and summer camps, according to Professor Duncan and Prof. Richard Murnane of Harvard.
In addition, upper-income parents, especially fathers, have increased their child-rearing time, while the presence of fathers in low-income homes has declined. Miss G. said there is a reason the triplets relied so heavily on boyfriends: ''Their fathers weren't there.''
Annette Lareau, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that the affluent also enjoy an advocacy edge: parents are quicker to intervene when their children need help, while low-income families often feel intimidated and defer to school officials, a problem that would trail Melissa and Angelica in their journey through college.
''Middle-class students get the sense the institution will respond to them,'' Professor Lareau said. ''Working-class and poor students don't experience that. It makes them more vulnerable.''
Matthew M. Chingos of the Brookings Institution has found that low-income students finish college less often than affluent peers even when they outscore them on skills tests. Only 26 percent of eight-graders with below-average incomes but above-average scores go on to earn bachelor's degrees, compared with 30 percent of students with subpar performances but more money.
''These are students who have already overcome significant obstacles to score above average on this test,'' Mr. Chingos said. ''To see how few earn college degrees is really disturbing.''
Triplets Start College
Melissa lasted at Texas State for all of two hours. As soon as she arrived, her car battery died, prompting a tearful call to Miss. G., who arranged a jump. Her dorm mates had parents to haul boxes and hover. Melissa unpacked alone. With four days left until classes began, she panicked and drove 200 miles back home.
For all the talk of getting away, her tattoo featured a local boast: she was ''B.O.I.'' -- born on the island. Her grandparents ordered her back to school. ''I really didn't want to leave'' the island, she said.
Midway through the semester she decided she had made a mistake by going to Texas State. She had picked the wrong time to leave home. She would move back to Galveston, join Bianca at community college and transfer to a four-year school later. But when she tried to return the financial aid to Texas State, she discovered it was too late. A long walk across the hilly campus led to an epiphany.
''I realized there was nothing in Galveston for me,'' she said. ''This is where I need to be.''
Angelica had a costlier setback. For an elite school, Emory enrolls an unusually large number of low-income students -- 22 percent get Pell grants, compared with 11 percent at Harvard -- and gives them unusually large aid packages. But Angelica had failed to complete all the financial aid forms.
Slow to consider Emory, she got a late start on the complex process and was delayed by questions about her father, whom she did not even know how to reach. Though Emory sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them, along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check. From the start, the wires were crossed.
As classes approached, she just got in the car with Mrs. Lady and Fred and drove 14 hours to Atlanta hoping to work things out. But by then Emory had distributed all of its aid. Even with federal loans and grants, Angelica was $40,000 short. The only way to enroll was to borrow from a bank.
Forty thousand dollars was an unfathomable sum. Angelica did not tell Mrs. Lady, to protect her from the worry. She needed a co-signer, and the only person she could ask was Fred. That would bind her future to her past, but she feared that if she tried to defer, she might not have a future -- she might never make it back.
''I was like, 'I don't care what kind of debt it puts me in -- I've got to get this done,''' she said.
Fred answered her request with his. They got engaged.
A few weeks later, Hurricane Ike hit Galveston, with Katrina-like consequences. About a sixth of the population never returned. Mrs. Lady lost her apartment and much of what she owned. Fred, consumed with rebuilding the store, reduced the modest sums he had promised to send Angelica.
Social life was awkward. She often felt she was the only one on campus without a credit card. Her roommate moved out, with no explanation. But one element of college appealed to Angelica and Melissa alike: the classes. Other debt-ridden students might wonder why the road to middle-class life passed through anthropology exams and lectures on art history. But Melissa was happy to ponder tribal life in Papua New Guinea and Angelica stepped off the 18-hour bus ride home and let slip an appreciative word about German film.
''My family said 'O.K., now you go to some big fancy school,' '' she said.
With A's, B's, C's and D's, her report card looked like alphabet soup. ''I was ready for Galveston College -- I wasn't ready for Emory,'' Angelica said. But she salvaged a 2.6 GPA and went home for the summer happy.
''I thought the hard part was over,'' she said.
At the end of the summer, Angelica and Melissa marked their ascent as college women with the perfect road trip. Melissa had decided to become a speech therapist. Angelica would practice child psychology. Somewhere between the rainbow in Louisiana and the blues bar in Orlando, they talked of launching a practice to help poor children. Fortune smiled all week.
''We were where we should be and we had the world at our feet,'' Melissa said.
Melissa
She returned to a campus that was starting to feel like home. She had a roommate she liked and a job she loved, as a clerk in a Disney store. But despite the feeling of deep change -- or perhaps because of it -- she got back together with her high-school boyfriend. ''That was one of the stupidest things I've ever done,'' she said.
In the middle of Melissa's sophomore year they became engaged. He moved near the campus to live with her, and Melissa charged most of their expenses on her credit cards. He was enrolling in the Job Corps program, and they agreed they would pay down the bills together after he became an electrician.
Melissa hit an academic pothole -- a C in a communications course, which kept her out of the competitive speech therapy program. But she decided to aim for graduate-school training, and her other grades soared, placing her on the dean's list both semesters her junior year. When her mother made a rare campus visit, Melissa hurried to show her the prominent display on the student center wall.
''That was one of the proudest moments of my life,'' Melissa said.
Just before her senior year, Melissa planned a trip to celebrate her 21st birthday. Preparing to leave, she discovered her money was missing. Only one person had her bank code. After finishing Job Corps, her boyfriend was jobless once again and acting odd -- as if he were using drugs.
No one but Melissa was surprised. Although she returned the engagement ring, she could not return the $4,000 in credit card debt he had promised to help pay. With her finances and emotions in disarray, she started her senior year so depressed she hung up black curtains so she could sleep all day. She skipped class, doubled her work hours, and failed nearly every course.
''I started partying, and I was working all the time because I had this debt,'' she said.
If the speed of her decline stands out, so does her lack of a safety net. It is easy to imagine a more affluent family stepping in with money or other support. Miss G. sent her the names of some campus therapists but Melissa did not call. She waited for an internal bungee cord to break the fall. She came within one F of losing her financial aid, then aced last summer's classes.
She is now a fifth-year senior, on track to graduate next summer, and her new boyfriend is studying to be an engineer. At home, she had a way of finding the wrong people. ''I haven't found any wrong people out here,'' she said.
With more than $44,000 in loans, she can expect to pay $250 a month for the next quarter century, on top of whatever she may borrow for graduate school. She hides the notices in a drawer and harbors no regrets. ''Education -- you can't put a price on it,'' she said. ''No matter what happens in your life, they can't take your education away.''
Bianca
Bianca missed the Florida road trip, though no one remembers why. She liked to talk of getting away, until it came time to go.
Among the perils that low-income students face is ''under-matching,'' choosing a close or familiar school instead of the best they can attend.
''The more selective the institution is, the more likely kids are to graduate,'' said Mr. Chingos, the Brookings researcher. ''There are higher expectations, more resources and more stigma to dropping out.''
Bianca was under-matched. She was living at home, dating her high-school boyfriend and taking classes at Galveston College. A semester on the honor roll only kept her from sensing the drift away from her plan to transfer to a four-year school.
Her grandfather's cancer, and chemotherapy treatments, offered more reasons to stay. She had lived with him since her father had died. Leaving felt like betrayal. ''I thought it was more important to be at home than to be selfish and be at school,'' she said.
The idea that education can be ''selfish'' -- a belief largely alien among the upper-middle class -- is one poor students often confront, even if it remains unspoken. ''Family is such a priority, especially when you're a Hispanic female,'' Miss G. said. ''You're afraid you're going to hear, 'You're leaving us, you think you're better.' ''
In her second year of community college, Bianca was admitted to a state university a hundred miles away. Miss. G. and her mother urged her to go. Her mind raced with reasons to wait.
''I didn't want to leave and have my grandfather die.''
''I had to help my mom.''
''I think I got burned out.''
Bianca stayed in Galveston, finished her associate degree, and now works as a beach-bar cashier and a spa receptionist. She still plans to get a bachelor's degree, someday.
''I don't think I was lazy. I think I was scared,'' she said. In the meantime, ''life happened.''
Angelica
After the financial aid disaster in her first year, Angelica met the next deadline and returned as a sophomore with significant support. Still, she sensed she was on shakier ground than other low-income students and never understood why. The answer is buried in the aid archives: Emory repeatedly inflated her family's income without telling her.
Angelica reported that her mother made $35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent. With her housing costs so high, Emory assumed the family had extra money and assigned Mrs. Lady an income of $51,000. But Mrs. Lady was not hiding money. She was paying inflated post-hurricane rent with the help of Federal disaster aid, a detail Angelica had inadvertently omitted.
By counting money the family did not have, Emory not only increased the amount it expected Angelica to pay in addition to her financial aid. It also disqualified her from most of the school's touted program of debt relief. Under the Emory Advantage plan the school replaces loans with grants for families making less than $50,000 a year. Moving Angelica just over the threshold placed her in a less-generous tier and forced her to borrow an additional $15,000 before she could qualify. The mistake will add years to her repayment plan.
She discovered what had happened only recently, after allowing a reporter to review her file with Emory officials. ''There was no other income coming in,'' she said. ''I can't believe that they would do that and not say anything to us. That seems completely unfair.''
Emory officials said they had to rely on the information Angelica provided and that they will not make retroactive adjustments.
''The method that was used in her case was very standard methodology,'' said J. Lynn Zimmerman, the senior vice provost who oversees financial aid. ''I think that what's unusual is that she really didn't advocate for herself or ask for any kind of review. If she or her mother would have provided any additional information it would have triggered a conversation.''
Unaware she had any basis for complaint, Angelica found a campus job she loved, repairing library books. It was solitary and artistic work, and it attracted a small sisterhood of women who appreciated her grandmother's tamales and her streak of purple hair. One day her boss, Julie Newton, overheard her excitedly talking about Hegel.
''She was an extremely intelligent woman and an unusual one,'' she said.
Yet even as Angelica's work hours grew, so did the rigor of her coursework. Meetings with faculty advisers were optional and Angelica did not consult hers. When it came time to declare a major, she had a B-plus average in the humanities and D's in psychology. She chose psychology.
By the end of her second year, she felt exhausted and had grades to show it. Her long-distance love life was exhausted, too, and she briefly broke up with Fred. She went home for the summer to work at Target and dragged herself back to a troubled junior year.
She moved off campus to save money but found herself spending even more. ''I would sit and debate whether I could buy a head of lettuce,'' she said. Fred was no longer helping, and her relationship with him snapped. That he had backed a $40,000 loan only made the split harder. They had been together since she was 15.
''It was days of back and forth, crying,'' she said.
This was no time to tackle Psychology 200, a course on research methods required of majors. The devotion of the professor, Nancy Bliwise, had earned her a campus teaching award. But her exacting standards and brusque manner left student opinion divided.
''Quite possibly the greatest professor at Emory,'' wrote one contributor to the Web site Rate My Professor. Others found her ''condescending,'' ''horribly disrespectful,'' and ''plain out mean.''
Midway through the semester, Angelica just stopped coming to class. Professor Bliwise called her in and found her despondent. ''She was emotionless and that scared me,'' the professor said in an interview. Angelica said she had to work too much to keep up, but could not drop the course without losing her full-time status and her aid. So she planned to take an ''F.''
Alarmed, Professor Bliwise raised other options, then asked -- empathetically, the professor thought -- if Angelica had considered cheaper schools. She herself had worked her way through Cleveland State then earned a doctorate at the University of Chicago.
Angelica sat stone-faced, burning. All she could hear was someone saying she was too poor for Emory. ''It was pretty clear if I couldn't afford to be there, I shouldn't waste her time,'' she said.
That was the beginning of the end. Angelica failed that course and three others her junior year, as her upside-down circumstances left her cheating a $200,000 education for a $9-an-hour job. She was not one to make it easy, but Emory never found a way to intervene. ''Is there a way to reach out to her?'' Professor Bliwise asked in an e-mail to the dean's office.
The dean's office left messages. Angelica acknowledged that she was slow to respond but said she got no answer when she did. The school did an electronic key card check to verify whether she was still on campus. More professors expressed concerns. ''Personal issues are interfering with her ability to concentrate,'' one warned. Angelica contacted campus counseling but said all the appointments had been taken.
Emory can hardly be cast as indifferent to low-income students. It spends $94 million a year of its own money on financial aid and graduates its poorest students nearly as often as the rest. Its failure to reach Angelica may have come up short, but that is partly a measure of the sheer distance it was trying to bridge.
When Angelica finally found a way to express herself, she did so silently. Her final piece for a sculpture class was a papier-mâché baby, sprouting needles like a porcupine. No one could mistake the statement of her own vulnerability.
''It was a shocking piece,'' said her professor, Linda Armstrong. ''She had a way of using art to tap into her deepest emotions and feelings. I don't think she understood how good she was.''
Angelica spent the next summer waiting for an expulsion letter that never came. Another missed deadline cost her several thousand dollars in aid in her senior year, and Emory mistakenly concluded that Mrs. Lady had made a $70,000 down payment on a house. (In describing the complicated transaction with a nonprofit group, Angelica failed to note that most of the money came from a program for first-time home buyers.) Emory officials said the mistake did not affect her aid, but the difference between the school's costs and her package of loans and grants swelled to $12,000 -- a sum she could not possibly meet.
She skipped more classes and worked longer hours.
''I felt, I'm going to be on academic probation anyway, I might as well work and pay my rent until they suspend me.''
Finally, Emory did -- forcing her to take a semester away with the option of reapplying.
The tale could be cast as an elite school failing a needy student or a student unwilling to be helped, but neither explanation does justice to an issue as complicated as higher education and class.
''It's a little of both,'' said Joanne Brzinski, a dean who oversees academic advising. ''We reached out to her, but she didn't respond. I always fault myself when students don't do as well as we'd like them to.''
''It's such a sad story,'' she added. ''She had the ability.''
Ms. Newton, Angelica's former supervisor at the library, wondered if her conflict went beyond money, to a fear of the very success she sought. ''I wouldn't go as far as to say she was committing self-sabotage, but the thought crossed my mind,'' she said. ''For someone so connected to family and Grandma and the tamales, I wondered if she feared that graduating would alienate her.''
A long bridge crosses the bay to Galveston Island. Angelica returned a year ago the way she had left, with Mrs. Lady and Fred at her side. She is $61,000 in debt, seeing Fred again, and making $8.50 an hour at his family's furniture store. No one can tell whether she is settling down or gathering strength for another escape.
A dinner with Melissa and Bianca a while back offered the comfort of friends who demand no explanations. Melissa suggested they all enroll at Texas State. But Bianca does not know what to study, and Angelica said that she had gone too far to surrender all hopes of an Emory degree.
''I could have done some things better, and Emory could have done some things better,'' she said. ''But I don't blame either one of us. Everyone knows life is unfair -- being low-income puts you at a disadvantage. I just didn't understand the extent of the obstacles I was going to have to overcome.''

HEADLINE: An Improvable Feast

BYLINE: By PAUL GREENBERG and CARL SAFINA. 
Paul Greenberg is the author of ''Four Fish.'' Carl Safina is the president of the Blue Ocean Institute, the host of the TV program ''Saving the Ocean'' and the author, most recently, of ''The View From Lazy Point.''

 BODY:
LONG ago the Roman Catholic Church decreed Christmas Eve a vigil during which the faithful should solemnly await Christ's arrival and his deliverance of a better world.
It took Romans and the rest of the Italian world about two seconds to blow past the abstinent part and retranslate La Vigilia di Natale as ''Here ya go; knock yourselves out.'' And lo, the most gut-busting piscatorial feeding frenzy ever known was born: the Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Fishes, in which seven seafood dishes come together to form a repast of oceanic proportions.
If you are fish guys like us, this presents a conundrum. We both love seafood, particularly the Italian preparations that usually make up the feast. One of us was raised and nourished by bona fide Italian-American parents; the other merely wishes the famed Italian cookbook author Marcella Hazan had been his mother. But we also make our living by writing and worrying about the ocean.
So this year we decided to think up a better Feast of the Seven Fishes, a seafood Dream Team. 
We start close to home: blue mussels, farmed in the coastal waters of New England and Atlantic Canada. Delicious when prepared as Cozze alla Triestina and as rich in omega-3s as salmon, mussels filter algae and particulate matter, improving water clarity, limiting nitrogen loading and thereby slowing the spread of oxygen-deprived dead zones. Humans have depleted wild bivalves, and in their places dumped untold tons of sewage. Part of reversing this pattern is to farm mussels, and to encourage mussel farming, we should encourage mussel eating. So, with mussels, knock yourselves out.
We move south for our second course. Introduced into Florida waters from home aquariums about 30 years ago, the beautiful Indo-Pacific red lionfish has reached plague-like proportions across the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. They scarf pretty much anything they can suck into their lightning-strike jaws.
Fortunately, enterprising spear fishermen have started marketing lionfish, making it something of a cottage industry. If you happen to befriend a spear fisherman this Christmas, ask for the biggest, most fecund lionfish in the catch bag and serve it whole in place of the more traditional, food-mile-intensive Mediterranean branzino. (Make sure to avoid the venom-tipped spines.)
Next, a lighter intermezzo from our freshwater coast: some Great Lakes smoked whitefish crostini. Smoked whitefish at Christmas? Well, with a name like Greenberg, the lead author of this article gets to make at least one culturally relevant pick.
You might, too, look askance at a freshwater choice. But get a little patriotic here; the lake whitefish is part of our nation's greatest environmental turnaround. Forty years ago, the Great Lakes were overwhelmed by pollution. One of Lake Erie's tributary rivers caught fire. Fisheries had declined to abysmal levels. Then Congress overrode President Richard M. Nixon's veto and passed the Clean Water Act. The Great Lakes have rebounded, and with them: whitefish.
Heading to the West Coast, let's have some thinly sliced crudo from the California white sea bass, a fish that was also once severely depleted. Today the white sea bass is back, in part because of a Pax Californiana: in 1994 the state banned the damaging practice of targeting big spawning aggregations of sea bass with nearshore gill nets. After sea bass rebounded, California set aside large sections of former fishing grounds as no-fishing breeding areas. If you want to have fish, you can't have just fish-taking areas. You need some fish-making areas. Which is why a few thin slices are appropriate. Just not too much. Remember, the vigil -- abstinence.
Next we take a dogleg to Alaska, arguably an unlikely place for an Italian cook to forage. Actually, Italian immigrants were some of the first European fishermen to work Alaska's salmon runs. They're memorialized in Dillingham's enormous Peter Pan cannery, which displays the ''Lament of the Italian Fisherman'' in a curio case at its entrance: ''We pulla da net/to catcha da fish/to makea da money/to buya da bread/to getta da strength/to pulla da net.''
And pulla da net we should. Alaska salmon, particularly the sockeye of Bristol Bay, are exceptionally well monitored and managed, with scores of counting towers and subsurface sonar sensors as well as dozens of human census takers.
The only thing threatening this vast salmon-generating wilderness is a massive copper mine proposed for the bay's headwaters. It is up to us, the feasters, to prove to Alaska's politicians that a good piece of eternal wild fish is more valuable than a one-time hunk of copper.
We're getting full, and we're only up to No. 6. This is a good juncture to thank the fish we've enjoyed and consider the fish we outright waste. To make sure as little fish as possible ends up in the trash, we'll head to Hawaii for some rod-and-reel-caught mahi-mahi.
Open-ocean fish like tuna and swordfish are usually caught using longlines: chains of hundreds of baited hooks strung out over what can be miles. They result in tremendous waste: sea turtles, sharks, albatross -- all end up on longlines; most get dumped overboard, dead.
Rod-and-reel fishing, though more labor-intensive, has relatively little waste. And with a fish like a mahi, which grows fast and is abundant and quick to take a lure, the fishing economics can work out.
Mio Dio, another fish? Yes, one more. Then the grappa. And though we'll have room for only a very little bit of this last one, its provenance represents the vast majority of the fish poundage that Italians and Americans eat today: farmed barramundi from Vietnam.
While the other six American seafoods mentioned are nice, more than 80 percent of our seafood comes from abroad, mostly Asia. This has tremendous environmental consequences. Shrimp farming has destroyed about a fifth of the world's coastal mangrove forests, which serve as fish nurseries and storm buffers. Tilapia can escape from lake-based farms and overwhelm freshwater ecosystems.
We choose barramundi as a kind of hope for the future. An American company with operations in Vietnam, called Australis, is growing this white-fleshed fish in a way that minimizes escapes, reduces environmental impacts and makes for a better, safer product.
Of course, there's a traditional vegetarian option for the eve. We called 87-year-old Rose Safina, the real Italian mother in the life of this writing pair, for her childhood memories of the feast. ''We were too poor for seven fishes,'' she said. ''Your grandmother made pizza from scratch. Her dough was absolutely delicious. We always wanted leftovers on Christmas morning.'' Rose didn't get to celebrate seven fishes until years later, when a little bit of money finally came through the door. She gives a mixed review: ''God,'' she recalls, ''that was a lot of food.''

HEADLINE: Send in the Clowns

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
WHEN thinking about the state of the Republican Party, I defer to a point that the Democratic consultant James Carville made the other day: ''When I hear people talking about the troubled state of today's Republican Party, it calls to mind something Lester Maddox said one time back when he was governor of Georgia. He said the problem with Georgia prisons was 'the quality of the inmates.' The problem with the Republican Party is the quality of the people who vote in their primaries and caucuses. Everybody says they need a better candidate, or they need a better message but -- in my opinion -- the Republicans have an inmate problem.'' The political obsessions of the Republican base -- from denying global warming to defending assault weapons to opposing any tax increases under any conditions, to resisting any immigration reform -- are making it impossible to be a Republican moderate, said Carville. And without more Republican moderates, there is no way to strike the kind of centrist bargains that have been at the heart of American progress -- that got us where we are and are essential for where we need to go. 
Republican politicians today have a choice: either change your base by educating and leading G.O.P. voters back to the center-right from the far right, or start a new party that is more inclusive, focused on smaller but smarter government and market-based, fact-based solutions to our biggest problems.
But if Republicans continue to be led around by, and live in fear of, a base that denies global warming after Hurricane Sandy and refuses to ban assault weapons after Sandy Hook -- a base that would rather see every American's taxes rise rather than increase taxes on millionaires -- the party has no future. It can't win with a base that is at war with math, physics, human biology, economics and common-sense gun laws all at the same time.
Do you know how troubled this party is? Two weeks ago, the former G.O.P. Senate majority leader Bob Dole, a great American, went to the Senate floor in his wheelchair to show his support for Senate ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of People With Disabilities. Nevertheless, the bill failed to win the two-thirds needed for ratification, because only eight Republicans dared to join Democrats in support of the treaty, which was negotiated and signed by George W. Bush! It essentially requires other countries to improve to our level of protection for the disabled, without requiring us to change any laws. It has already been ratified by 126 countries. But it failed in the Senate because Rick Santorum managed to convince the G.O.P. base that the treaty would threaten U.S. ''sovereignty.'' Santorum stopped just short of warning that space aliens would take over our country if we ratified the treaty.
Because they control the House, this radical Republican base is now holding us all back. President Obama was moving to the center in these budget negotiations. He reduced his demand for higher tax revenues to $1.2 trillion from $1.6 trillion; he upped the level at which Americans who would be hit with higher taxes to those earning $400,000 a year from $250,000; and he made his own base holler by offering to cut long-term spending by lowering the inflation adjustment index for Social Security. It seemed that with a little more Republican compromise, Obama would have met them in the middle, and we could have had a grand bargain that would put the country on a sounder fiscal trajectory and signal to the markets, the world and ourselves that we can still do big hard things together. That will have to wait. Now the best hope is some mini-, crisis-averting, Band-Aid.
The G.O.P. today needs its own D.L.C. The Democratic Leadership Council was founded by a group of Democratic governors and activists, led by Bill Clinton, in 1985 to lead the party back to the center from a failing leftward course that had resulted in it being repeatedly shut out of the presidency, except after Watergate. I asked Clinton's pollster, Stan Greenberg, what Republicans could learn from the Clinton/D.L.C. experience.
''There is a lot of pain,'' said Greenberg. ''You can't change the party without pain. You can't just make some head-fakes to Hispanics.'' The D.L.C., he noted, started by building an organization over 10 years and by running more centrist Democrats ''in the primaries.'' It didn't just wait to pivot to the center in the general election. It fought for and educated the Democrat base in the primaries, by D.L.C. candidates running in support of free trade, Nafta and welfare reform. ''With Clinton, we won the primaries in a way that defined us, so that he could run in the general election as the candidate of broad appeal.'' That fractured the party and produced Ralph Nader, which cost Al Gore the 2000 election. But after losing that election, said Greenberg, the Democrats came together around a moderate-left core and did not engage ''in dysfunctional primaries.''
Republicans need to go through a similar process of building new institutions and coalitions to support candidates who can move the party back to the center-right. Today, all their institutions, from think tanks to Fox TV, said Greenberg, ''are reinforcing the trends that are marginalizing their party.''
Unfortunately, we don't have a decade to wait for a G.O.P. D.L.C. Some leaders in that party need to stand up for sane compromises right now.

 BODY:
IN 1974, Nora and Al Galland, their two young sons in tow, packed up their belongings and traded in a cramped one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a five-bedroom colonial in Hastings-on-Hudson, in southern Westchester.
The Gallands wanted a home with a backyard where their children (another son was born three years after they arrived) could play away from traffic; where the ''ambience of the place,'' as Ms. Galland described it, was ''unpretentious''; where the public schools were highly rated; and the rush-hour commute to Midtown for Mr. Galland, who owned a personnel agency in Manhattan, was no more than 35 minutes. The 2.2 acres of Hastings, 10 miles from the New York City border, fit the bill.
Other attributes heightened its allure. The village is picturesque, with homes zigzagging up steep, tree-lined streets. Merchants in the shops downtown know most customers by name. And the population of about 7,900 is more socioeconomically diverse than elsewhere in Westchester, 2010 census number show. ''It reminded us in many good ways of Brooklyn Heights,'' Ms. Galland said. 
The Gallands still live in the house they bought for $74,000 nearly four decades ago, and even though they are now retired (she worked as an information technology specialist), they remain active. What is more, one of their sons -- Jeremy, 40 -- found growing up in Hastings such a happy experience that two years ago, he and his wife, Danielle, spent just under $1 million on a house, and are raising their own children there.
The younger Mr. Galland, a commodities trader, and his wife, an interior designer, commute to work in Manhattan. In his view, Hastings has not changed very much. It still has a highly rated school system, and his children and their friends can play ball in many of the same fields he did as a youngster.
Not that the village doesn't have its issues. Save for a restaurant, two new parks and a tennis club, the riverfront is marred by abandoned factories. Despite the $360 million being spent on removing heavy metals and PCBs from industrial sites operated by Anaconda Wire and Cable and Hudson River Stream Sugar Refinery, among others, there are no plans to rebuild on the valuable 40 waterfront acres. Debate between villagers and owners over how to best use the land has been ongoing since the factories were shuttered more than 50 years ago. The current owners are BP, which owns 28 of the 40 acres, and ExxonMobil, which has title to the rest.
Meanwhile, Peter Swiderski, the part-time mayor, is focusing on other municipal concerns, among them a deer population laying waste to the landscape. The village has begun to curb the destruction by darting the deer to sterilize them temporarily and reduce their numbers over time. ''It's a very Hastings, very leading-edge effort,'' said Mr. Swiderski, a bank executive.
The village is also to adopt a building code that, he said, ''will far surpass the state's Energy Star requirements.''
Another concern, Mr. Swiderski said, is retaining Hastings's socioeconomic mix, which has been affected by rising interest among people from the Upper West Side and Brooklyn. (Racially, like much of the county, the village is fairly homogeneous.) ''We're so close to the city, yet Hastings stills feels like small-town America,'' said the mayor, who left the Upper West Side 15 years ago. ''The question is how to keep it that way.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
An early British settler inspired by its hilly terrain is said to have named the village after Hastings on the southern coast of England, a cliff-top community overlooking the English Channel. Hastings-on-Hudson is spread across three hills and a valley -- its steep slopes dotted with Tudors, colonials, Victorians and contemporaries set against a backdrop of trees, with those near the top having broad westward views.
The fulcrum of the shopping district is the intersection of Warburton Avenue and Main Street, which slopes down to the river. Warburton is the site of most of the small shops, among them a gluten-free bakery and a pharmacy that carries homeopathic remedies.
Main Street in recent years has undergone stark changes, especially with the addition in 2008 of Riverton Lofts, a modernistic 25-unit condominium complex with a concrete-plank-on-steel construction and a facade of limestone, terra-cotta brick and zinc. Although Riverton Lofts contrasts sharply with the cottages, colonials and Victorians that flank the business district -- and although some residents find the new architecture jarring -- the units have sold well. A three-bedroom town house with river views there sold for $957,500 earlier this year, after a month.
There are 1,789 developed residential parcels in Hastings, and 184 undeveloped; in the latter group, according to Charles V. Minozzi Jr., the deputy building inspector, most are not buildable.
In addition to Riverton Lofts, Hastings has several condo and co-op complexes, and 1,275 rental units -- some in apartment buildings, others above stores or in multifamily homes, Mr. Minozzi said.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
While Mayor Swiderski said he feared that Hastings could become less diverse economically, he also noted that the wide price range of the housing stock would temper that trend and allow for a broader mix of buyers.
A recent search of the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service revealed that there are 24 single-family houses on the market, ranging from $189,900, for a one-bedroom cottage, to $1.675 million for a six-bedroom contemporary. The median sale price of a single-family home as of Dec. 11 was $625,000, down from $800,000 five years ago, according to Mary Madigan, a sales agent for Houlihan Lawrence.
Among the houses on the market in Hastings are a three-bedroom one-bath colonial for $449,500 on 0.22 acres, and a four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath split-level for $699,999 on 0.49 acres -- for which taxes are $22,776. (That is ''on the high end'' compared to other properties in that price bracket, ''but not outside the range,'' Ms. Madigan said.)
There were also eight condominiums for sale, ranging in price from $114,999, for a one-bedroom, to $750,000 for a two-bedroom.
Rental apartments are relatively expensive for Westchester, Ms. Madigan said, citing a 900-square-foot one-bedroom in a 72-year-old brick midrise complex for rent at $1,850 a month. The average rental for a one-bedroom in the county was $1,260, according to the latest numbers from the nonprofit Westchester Residential Opportunities.
THE SCHOOLS
The Hastings-on-Hudson School District has 1,580 students in three schools: 587 in kindergarten through Grade 4 at Hillside Elementary School; 469 in Grades 5 through 8 at Farragut Middle School; and 524 in Grades 9 through 12 at Hastings High School.
On state tests last year, 79.3 percent of fourth graders were found proficient in English, 85.9 percent in math. Statewide, percentages were 56.7 and 66.6.
SAT averages last spring were 580 in reading, 576 in math and 574 in writing, versus 483, 500 and 475 statewide, according to the office of Roy R. Montesano, the superintendent of schools.
Of the 129 most recent graduates, 82 percent are attending four-year colleges, and 13 percent are at two-year schools, records show.
WHAT TO DO
For Edie and Bob Magnus, who moved to a five-bedroom three-bath colonial in Hastings 15 years ago from the Upper West Side, the village's many parks have played a major role in their lives. Ms. Magnus, the director of media at Mercy College, made many friends in the early years when she took her sons -- Nick, now 17, and Sam, 15 -- to Reynolds Field, a popular meeting place for young mothers. The couple (Mr. Magnus is a producer for CNN) declined to say what they paid for the house, although Ms. Madigan, the real estate agent, said a house of that size with winter views of the river would have sold in 1997 for about $750,000.
In the years since the Magnuses moved to Hastings, two parks have opened on the river: MacEachron Waterfront Park and Kinnally Cove, the latter a favorite launch for kayakers.
The village has also been home to many artists and, as a result, attracts ''like-minded people -- artsy, journalist types'' who tend to gravitate to a creative environment, Ms. Magnus said. One 19th-century resident was Jasper Francis Cropsey, a leading painter of the Hudson River School. Many of his works are on display at the Newington-Cropsey Foundation gallery adjacent to his home in the village. And ''Between Heaven and Earth,'' a large 1950s sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz, another former resident, sits on the front lawn of the Hastings public library.
THE COMMUTE
The Hudson Line train to Grand Central Terminal during peak hours takes about 33 minutes; there is some station parking. A monthly ticket costs $229. The trip to Midtown by car south on the Saw Mill River Parkway and then the West Side Drive takes about 30 minutes, if traffic is moving.
THE HISTORY
The first European settlers of Hastings were the children of Dutch and French Huguenots who had put down roots during the late 17th century in areas now known as New Rochelle, Rye and Harlem, according to the Hastings-on-Hudson Historical Society.
