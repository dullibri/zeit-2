HEADLINE: Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree

BYLINE: By Susan Freinkel. 
Susan Freinkel is a fellow with the Alicia Patterson Foundation and the author of a forthcoming book on the American chestnut.

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
TO celebrate Arbor Day yesterday, President Bush added a new tree to the White House grounds -- an American chestnut. At first glance it may seem an odd choice, since chestnuts have been largely absent from the American landscape for more than half a century. Yet if any species can help us see the importance of trees to humanity, it is the American chestnut, and its story makes it the perfect emblem for Arbor Day.
 Chestnuts were once so plentiful along the East Coast that according to legend a squirrel could travel the chestnut canopy from Georgia to Maine without ever touching the ground. The trees grew tall, fast and straight. Many considered it the perfect tree: it produced nourishing food and a rot-resistant wood that was used for everything from furniture to fence posts. Chestnut ties were the sturdy foundation of the ever-expanding railroad lines; chestnut poles held up the lengthening miles of electrical and telephone wire. 
 Then in the early 20th century a deadly fungus imported from Japan hit American forests. Within 40 years this fast and merciless fungus spread over some 200 million acres and killed nearly four billion trees. The blight brought the chestnut to the brink of extinction. Even today new sprouts continue to shoot up from the roots of seemingly dead trees only to be attacked again by the fungus before they can flower and reproduce. 
 But, in memory at least, the tree endures. That's particularly true in Appalachia, where the chestnuts were vital to the local culture and economy. The sweet nuts that appeared every fall sustained people and their livestock. Families built their homes from chestnut logs, marked their property with chestnut fences and brewed home remedies for burns from chestnut leaves. 
 I recently spent several days in the heart of the tree's historic range: southwest Virginia, where old chestnut rail fences still snake across the land and memories of the tree remain sharp. One 92-year-old man pointed out an empty hillside that once held a grove of chestnut trees. Each fall he collected the small mahogany nuts in a tin bucket for his mother to sell at the general store. Chestnuts paid for school supplies, sugar, shoes -- things they couldn't make for themselves on their farm. 
 A retired schoolteacher showed me a photograph of the tall chestnut that bordered a field on her family's farm when she was a child -- the ''sentinel'' that meant she was nearing home. The elderly owner of a country store recalled how locals would cart in thousands of pounds of nuts to be hauled on horse-drawn wagons to railroad depots for shipment to cities like Richmond, Boston and New York, where they'd be sold hot and roasted on the streets. The last time he tasted an American chestnut, he said, was from a squirrel's stash he and his little sister dug up on June 7, 1928. The date is etched in memory because his sister died the next day. 
 Their stories paint a picture of another time -- of dirt roads, log cabins, fragrant haystacks and cool springhouses shaded by majestic trees. Whether the memories draw on direct experience or stories told by parents or grandparents, they are filled with a love and a longing that transcends mere nostalgia.
 Chestnut blight showed North Americans just how devastating an invasive species could be to trees. Now with the explosion of global commerce, forests nationwide are battling foreign pests and pathogens. The current patient roster includes white pines, beeches, ashes, butternuts, Eastern hemlocks and Port Orford cedars, as well as the newly designated national tree, the oak. 
 It is not yet clear whether Americans have the will or a way to preserve the many threatened species of trees that have helped define our communities. But the chestnut, which has inspired valiant efforts to pull it back from the edge of oblivion, suggests we might. The American Chestnut Foundation has been patiently interbreeding the American chestnuts with its blight-resistant Asian cousins to come up with a hybrid that looks like an American chestnut, but fights the fungus Asian-style. The foundation says it hopes to have its first crop of blight-resistant nuts ready by next year for trial plantings in forests. The White House chestnut tree is one of these hybrids. 
 The United States Forest Service has agreed to work with the foundation to get chestnuts back into the wild. Experts involved hope the project will be a model for saving and restoring other endangered trees. Of course, the best protection for our forests is prevention: stanching the influx of invasives with tighter controls on imported nursery stock and rules like those requiring anti-pest treatment of wood crates and pallets that have carried unwelcome stowaways like the gypsy moth. The more we do to improve the health of our forests -- using controlled fires to clear brush and thin the woods, for instance -- the better trees will be able to withstand any new onslaughts. 
 There are good economic and environmental reasons for bringing back the chestnut: it's a fast-growing source of good timber, a boon for wildlife and an efficient way to draw carbon and pollutants out of the atmosphere. But many of the people I have met would save the chestnut simply for its own sake, as a welcome companion. 
 When the blight hit southwest Virginia in the 1920's, the elderly shop owner told me, folks predicted the tree wouldn't be beat. ''They said it would be back in 100 years,'' he recalled. The chestnut probably couldn't have staged a comeback on its own, but thanks to the efforts of a devoted few, chestnuts and people may yet have a future together.

HEADLINE: Putin Urges Israel to Let Palestinian Security Forces Use Weapons

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, April 29 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia urged Israel on Friday to allow Palestinian security forces the weaponry required to fight terrorism as he completed a three-day visit to the Middle East intended to revive Russia's fading influence in the region.
 Mr. Putin met with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, for two hours to discuss peace talks and renewed Russian economic and security aid to the Palestinians, Moscow's former clients.
 In particular, Russia will provide Mr. Abbas with two transport helicopters to replace those of his predecessor, Yasir Arafat. Israel had destroyed them to limit Mr. Arafat's movements after the Israeli Army returned to the West Bank in the spring of 2002 to try to put a stop to Palestinian attacks, some organized by the security services. Israel also put severe restrictions on weapons allowed to the Palestinian police. 
 Mr. Putin wanted to provide the Palestinians 50 armored vehicles, a proposal reportedly supported by a senior American military official in the region, Lt. Gen. William Ward. But Israel objected, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, telling the Americans and Mr. Putin that armored cars could come later, after the Palestinians took more action against militants and reformed the security forces. 
 In a joint news conference with Mr. Abbas, Mr. Putin said pointedly: ''If we expect Chairman Abbas to fight terrorism effectively, he can't do it with slingshots and stones. We must understand this.''
 It was a Russian president's first visit to the Palestinian Authority, and he was welcomed with a red carpet and an honor guard and band that played a shaky version of the Russian national anthem. Mr. Putin, like most international visitors, had a wreath laid on the tomb of Mr. Arafat, where Mr. Putin stood silently, then bowed his head.
 Mr. Putin has been mindful of symbols throughout his visit, making gestures to the Israelis, including an unannounced midnight visit to the Western Wall and the obligatory trip to mourn at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. While reassuring the Israelis about Russia's concern for their security -- including promising careful monitoring of arms and technology sales to Syria and Iran -- he has also sought to be an advocate for Mr. Abbas and more rapid progress to peace.
 He also wanted to show that Moscow is back in the regional game as a serious player, even as American criticism of his rule has increased and some in Congress have called for Russia to be dropped from the Group of 8 major industrialized powers.
 Russia is one of the four co-sponsors of the peace plan known as the road map, along with the United States, the European Union and the United Nations, known collectively as the Quartet. But Mr. Putin's efforts to play host to an international peace conference this fall, announced on his first stop in Cairo, were quickly killed by Washington and Israel. Either Mr. Putin failed to consult beforehand, said one NATO country's ambassador, or he simply wanted to make a gesture of solidarity with the Palestinians.
 Israeli and American officials responded that the planned Israeli pullout from Gaza this summer was the first priority. They said any international conference, as called for in a later stage of the peace plan, must be preceded by Palestinian compliance with the first stage: moves to combat militants. The Israelis, in the first stage, have promised to stop all new settlement activity, but insist that they are in a ''pre-road map'' stage until the Palestinians complete their requirements.
 The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, later said Mr. Putin was really proposing a high-level meeting of the Quartet, but even that was judged premature by the Americans. In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told NBC News, ''We will have a Quartet meeting at the level of foreign ministers in Moscow on May 8th or 9th during the events there'' to commemorate the end of World War II. ''The Russians can be a part of this process in that way,'' she added.
 Mr. Abbas, who studied in Moscow and made an early visit there as president, welcomed Mr. Putin's support for an international conference, saying, ''The conditions are ripe.'' 
 The Palestinian leader says that without a ''political horizon'' toward Palestinian independence, so that Palestinians are sure that the Gaza withdrawal is not the end of Israel's withdrawal from occupied territory, new violence could break out. He wants the start of talks on a comprehensive peace treaty now, and not later, as the peace plan indicates, and his position is getting more support from European leaders, as well as Arab ones.
 Mr. Putin also promised Mr. Abbas help to build Gaza's battered infrastructure, and again defended Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran while saying that Russia opposes an Iranian nuclear weapon.
 ''We intend to continue in all our programs with Iran because we believe such programs have peaceful ends,'' Mr. Putin said. He added: ''Nuclear weapons proliferation is dangerous in general, and in such an explosive region as the Middle East it is very dangerous. From a military standpoint it is illogical, and from a humanitarian standpoint it is unacceptable.''

HEADLINE: President's Big Social Security Gamble

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
In proposing on Thursday night to cut Social Security benefits for future generations of retirees, President Bush made two big bets, one political, one on the substance of his policy, and if he is to succeed in remaking the retirement system, both of them will probably have to break his way.
 The political gamble is straightforward. Will putting benefit cuts on the table eventually break the legislative logjam by providing political cover to members of both parties who accept that something painful must be done to set Social Security right? Or, by imposing substantial cuts on middle-income workers relative to what the system currently promises, will the approach endorsed by Mr. Bush so permanently harden the wall of opposition from Democrats, as it seemed initially to have done, that no compromise becomes possible? 
 The White House and its allies sought to build a sense of momentum on Friday, following the news conference on Thursday at which Mr. Bush proposed a plan that he said would leave future retirees better off than if Congress failed to act and Social Security ultimately ran short of money to pay full benefits. After standing on the legislative sideline for weeks, House Republican leaders said that they intended to produce a bill in the Ways and Means Committee in June, and they tried to lure, or bludgeon, Democrats into negotiations. Speaking in Falls Church, Va., Mr. Bush said only ''a few isolated voices'' were resisting the need to act. 
 Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, said Mr. Bush's strategy ''has the potential'' to create enough bipartisanship to move legislation through Congress, ''but there are no guarantees.'' Mr. Kolbe has long called for benefit cuts to be part of a repair for Social Security. 
 Mr. Bush's proposal ''is the first faint flicker of hope of getting something moving that I've seen this year,'' said Charles Stenholm, a former Democratic congressman from Texas and one of the very few members of his party who support the general thrust of Mr. Bush's approach to Social Security. 
 But in the Senate, where Mr. Bush faces his biggest hurdle on the issue, there was no sign that Democrats would join him in calling for benefit cuts or budge from their unified opposition to the core of the president's approach, his call to allow workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into investment accounts. And if Mr. Bush is relying on public opinion to sway at least a few Democrats and a vital handful of centrist Republicans to come to his side, he has his work cut out for him. Despite 60 days of intensive campaigning by Mr. Bush and other top administration officials, the president's approval rating on the issue has been falling in most polls and voters appear unenthusiastic about his solutions.
 ''It's like throwing a drowning man a lead weight instead of a life preserver,'' Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said of Mr. Bush's decision to introduce benefit cuts into the equation. ''He's got a plan that neither the public nor his own party can support. Only good can come from Democrats' defending the right of the middle class to continue getting their benefits in full.''
 The more substantive gamble involves drawing clear lines between winners and losers. Mr. Bush's plan calls for lower-income people to be exempted from the benefit reductions, which would fall progressively harder on workers up the income scale. In that way, he is daring Democrats to oppose it, judging that they will ultimately come under intense pressure to be seen as protecting one of their core constituencies. 
 Under the plan that is the basis for Mr. Bush's approach, people in the lowest 30 percent of the income spectrum would get all of the benefits promised to them by current law. But the plan would reduce benefits relative to current law for everyone else, using a sliding scale that would impose deeper cuts on the upper end of the income scale than on the middle. For average-wage earners -- making around $36,500 this year -- the benefit cut would be 16 percent if they reach retirement age in 2045 and 28 percent if they retire in 2075. For upper-income people -- making $90,000 or above this year -- the benefit cut for those retiring in 2045 would be 29 percent, and for those retiring in 2075 it would be 49 percent.
 White House officials said the right point of comparison is not what current law promises but what the Social Security system can afford to pay down the road; under current projections, the system can pay full benefits for the next 36 years, and afterward just under 75 percent.
 ''People may agree or disagree with a specific point, but they are beginning to get a sense of what the tradeoffs are,'' said David Winston, a Republican pollster. ''Does that pull everyone to the table to begin a negotiation? We're about to find out.''
 It is by no means clear that Mr. Bush's plan will be judged on his terms, as a way to ensure the long-term survival of a popular program in the face of daunting demographic challenges. Democrats are already painting it as something quite different: a big step toward dismantling Social Security as we know it.
 The change Mr. Bush is embracing would by itself take care of around 70 percent of Social Security's projected long-term financial problems. On the surface, it would leave the basic framework of the current system in place, though with the addition of voluntary individual investment accounts. Anyone signing up for the accounts would have to agree to a further corresponding cut in the guaranteed, government-paid benefit.
 But Mr. Bush's approach would arguably lead to a gradual, decades-long but fundamental change in the nature of the system. Over time, the government-paid benefit for higher-income people would move closer to the benefit paid to lower-income people; in that sense, Social Security would become something more like a purer welfare system than what it is widely perceived to be now, a government-run pension plan in which benefits are tied to income.
 The end result would be a system in which many workers would rely more on the proceeds of their investment accounts and less on the government-paid benefit, and one in which upper-income people would have less of a stake in traditional Social Security, potentially undermining political support for it.
 ''This would represent a major change in the philosophy of Social Security,'' said Jason Furman, an economist at New York University and a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. ''If you combine progressive indexing with private accounts, you could threaten to unravel the entire Social Security system.''

HEADLINE: Energy Follies

 BODY:
It was fascinating to watch President Bush lay out intelligent approaches to pressing problems at his news conference on Thursday night, and then urge Congress to pass bills that would do almost nothing to solve them. Social Security was one case in point, but another egregious example was energy, an issue that has moved to center stage in the White House because of public concern over high prices for oil and gasoline at the pump. Mr. Bush had trouble with this issue all week, beginning with an embarrassing effort to persuade the Saudis to gin up production. He then stumbled through an almost incoherent presentation of his larger energy strategy in a speech on Wednesday at a Small Business Administration conference. 
 Mr. Bush was more honest than his Democratic critics when he conceded that nothing would reduce gasoline prices in the short term except an agreement by the Saudis and others to turn on the spigot, a step that is not all that easy when global demand is pressing up against supply. He was also unusually forthright in saying that America must reduce its dependence on foreign oil, begin to wean itself from fossil fuels generally and invest in technology to get to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.
 Yet, as always, he completely ignored the surest way to reduce demand and thus oil dependency, which is to improve the fuel efficiency of America's cars and trucks. Indeed, everything Mr. Bush said seemed designed to divert attention from this simple and technologically feasible idea, which nevertheless seems to terrify both him and the Congress. 
 In his Wednesday speech, for instance, having asserted the pressing national need to reduce dependency, he veered off into the merits of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas -- potentially useful ideas that have nothing to do with oil imports. Cars and trucks don't run on nuclear power and rarely run on natural gas. They run on gasoline, and if we are to reduce oil imports we must find substitutes for gasoline or use less of it, or, preferably, do both.
 In addition to confusing things, Mr. Bush offered no guidance to Congress beyond an exhortation to the Senate to replicate what he described as a ''good bill'' approved last week by the House. In fact the House bill is dreadful, and even insulting to Mr. Bush in that it fails to include the few good things -- tax credits for purchasers of hybrid cars, for instance -- that he had originally requested.
 Then, too, he could not resist the deceptions that make debating energy in Washington such a frustrating matter. These included the familiar assertion that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would be restricted to 2,000 acres, which is akin to counting just the greens on a golf course because it includes only the area to be occupied by drilling pads, not the spider web of roads and pipelines. 
 All of which leaves the job of fashioning a coherent strategy in the Senate's hands, specifically those of Pete Domenici of New Mexico. Mr. Domenici is first and foremost a nuclear power enthusiast and agrees with Mr. Bush on moving briskly ahead with domestic exploration. But he has also said he is willing to explore new ideas much favored by the think tanks (and mentioned in passing by Mr. Bush), like coal gasification and creating ''biofuels'' from agricultural waste. The key question is whether, unlike Mr. Bush, he has the political courage to push for the stricter fuel economy standards that are essential to any serious effort to lower consumption.

HEADLINE: Global Playing Field: More Level, but It Still Has Bumps

BYLINE: By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ. 
Joseph E. Stiglitz, university professor at Columbia University, won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001.

 BODY:

The World Is Flat
A Brief History of the 21st Century
By Thomas L. Friedman
488 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.50.
 The world is flat, or at least becoming flatter very quickly, Thomas L. Friedman says in his exciting and very readable account of globalization. In this flat new world, there is a level (or at least more level) playing field in which countries like India and China, long marginalized in the global economy, are able to compete. And while Mr. Friedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, celebrates the new vistas opening up for these countries, he describes forcefully the challenges globalization presents for the older industrialized nations -- especially the United States. 
 America is still the global leader in science and technology, but its dominance is eroding. As Mr. Friedman points out in ''The World Is Flat,'' Asian countries now produce eight times as many bachelor's degrees in engineering as the United States; the proportion of foreign-born Ph.D.'s in the American science and engineering labor force has risen to 38 percent; and federal financing for research in physical and mathematical sciences and engineering as a share of gross domestic product declined by 37 percent from 1970 to 2004. 
 About a third of ''The World Is Flat'' is devoted to describing the forces of leveling -- from the fall of the Berlin Wall, which eliminated the ideological divide separating much of the world, to the rise of the Internet and technological changes that have led to new models of production and collaboration, including outsourcing and offshore manufacturing. 
 The rest of the book is devoted to exploring the implications of this flattening, both for the advanced industrial countries and the developing world. In truth, Mr. Friedman's major points would come across more strongly if his 488 pages were edited more tightly. But he provides a compelling case that something big is going on. I was in Bangalore, India, in January 2004 -- just a month before Mr. Friedman -- visiting Infosys, one of India's new leading high-technology companies. I, too, was bowled over by what I saw: ''campuses'' more modern than anything I had seen on the West Coast, and business leaders as dynamic and thoughtful as anywhere in the world. 
 It may be true that fears of outsourcing have been exaggerated: there are only a limited number of radiologists, software programmers and back-office people whose jobs can be performed at a distance. But I side with Mr. Friedman: the integration of some three billion people into the global economy is a big deal. Even if only a limited number of American jobs are lost, the new competition will have striking effects, particularly on the wages of unskilled workers. While free trade may ultimately make every country better off, not every individual will be better off. There are winners and there are losers; and while, in principle, the winners could compensate the losers, that typically does not happen. Among other things, a flatter world means a less flat America -- more inequality. 
 The playing field may be getting more level, but not everyone is equipped to play on it. On that same trip to India, I spent more than half my time in the countryside surrounding Bangalore, where traveling 10 miles was like traveling back 2,000 years. Peasants were farming as their ancestors must have. What has enabled Bangalore to become a high-tech success story is that companies like Infosys have removed themselves from what is going on nearby. They communicate directly by satellite with the United States, and in a place where local newspapers list the number of brownouts the previous day, these companies can have their own sources of power. And while new technologies may close the gap between parts of India and China and the advanced industrial countries, they will also increase the gap between those countries and Africa.
 Mr. Friedman is right that there are forces flattening the world, but there are other forces making it less flat. At issue is the balance between them. So is the world really much flatter than before?
 For instance, the new technologies that Mr. Friedman praises as levelers have also given rise to new opportunities for monopolization. Mr. Friedman praises Netscape's leveling role: its browser has really helped to put a world of knowledge and information at each person's doorstep (or computer). But Microsoft was able to use its own market power through control of computer operating systems to effectively replace Netscape with its own browser, Internet Explorer. While Microsoft speaks eloquently of the need to reward innovation, the real rewards are often not reaped by the innovators. 
 In addition, the underlying research for major developments like the Internet and Web browsers is expensive. Large, rich countries can pay for it; poor, small ones cannot. Mr. Friedman notes, but does not emphasize as much as he might, the important role played by government in financing such research before allowing private entrepreneurs to bring the actual products to market -- and make the profits. American companies have a distinct advantage in benefiting from government-financed research, even though there are crumbs (some quite large) that those around the world can pick up. 
 Meanwhile, the new ''rules of the game'' that were part of the last round of global trade negotiations -- notably intellectual property regulations requiring all countries to adopt American-style patent and copyright laws -- are almost surely making the playing field less level. They will make it easier for those who are ahead of the game to maintain their lead. 
 One mark of a great book is that it makes you see things in a new way, and Mr. Friedman certainly succeeds in that goal. The world may not yet be flat, but there is no doubt that there are important forces -- some leveling, some the opposite -- that are changing its shape in critical ways. And in his provocative account, Mr. Friedman suggests what this brave new world will mean to all of us, in both the developed and the developing worlds.

HEADLINE: Iranians Seek Nuclear Deal in Meeting With Europeans in London

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, April 29 

 BODY:
Iranian and European negotiators met in secrecy here on Friday to seek agreement over Iran's nuclear program, and Iranian leaders increased pressure for a quick deal to permit them to resume enriching uranium for nuclear fuel. 
 Despite the tough talk from figures in Tehran, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, officials from both sides said the talks on Friday night were unlikely to reach any kind of breakthrough.
 The United States and Europe have pushed Iran to renounce all uranium enrichment as a guarantee against a clandestine program to make weapons-grade uranium. Under international pressure, Iran has suspended its uranium enrichment program and has been negotiating with Britain, France and Germany over the future of the program. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is exclusively for electric power generation. 
 The United States has warned that if Iran ends the talks and resumes enrichment, Washington will seek action from the United Nations Security Council, possibly leading to economic sanctions.
 The Europeans have taken a less confrontational tack, seeking to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear program in return for economic concessions.
 On the Iranian side, however, the issue has been wrapped up in the country's looming presidential elections on June 17, and European diplomats say they fear that recent Iranian statements may reflect political posturing. 
 Iran is seeking European assent to a small experimental enrichment program, but both the Europeans and the United States oppose the idea. In Tehran on Friday, Mr. Rafsanjani said Iran was ''determined to have all branches of nuclear technology, including uranium enrichment, and we will have it at any cost,'' Reuters reported.
 Mr. Rafsanjani's words echoed remarks on Thursday by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who said, ''If talks with European Union are not successful tomorrow, negotiations will collapse, and we will have no choice but to restart the uranium enrichment program.''
 But the senior officials from both sides who are conducting the talks seemed anxious to play down any high expectations from the London encounter.
 The head of the Iranian negotiators, Muhammad Javad Zarif, citing remarks by other Iranian officials, said: ''We engage in these talks in order to make a deal, and not to break one. We are hoping for tangible progress on reaching an agreement.''

HEADLINE: A Democrat on Bush's Social Security Team

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The intellectual force behind President Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security, the man the president calls his favorite ''Democrat economist,'' is not an economist. He is Robert C. Pozen, a lawyer and mutual fund executive who serves as chairman of MFS Investment Management in Boston.
 A registered Democrat, Mr. Pozen donated money to the presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry last year and voted for him on Nov. 2. He was a classmate of Hillary Rodham Clinton at Yale Law School. 
 But all that has not stopped President Bush from embracing Mr. Pozen's main idea to bring the nation's public pension regime into financial balance: a plan called ''progressive indexing'' because it would protect the lowest-wage workers from benefit reductions while progressively cutting benefits of higher-earning workers.
 Mr. Pozen, who served on Mr. Bush's commission in 2001 that developed initial plans for carving private accounts out of Social Security, has been thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Bush's embrace of his proposal. But Mr. Pozen says his ideas on public pensions are free of politics.
 ''I consider myself a middle-of-the-road guy who tries to be carefully nonpartisan on this issue,'' he said. ''I believe passionately in Social Security reform.'' 
 Opponents of the White House plan say that while Mr. Pozen's ideas may sound progressive, they are far from the Democratic mainstream. Mr. Pozen's proposals are ''bad policy,'' said Senator Max Baucus, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, after the committee's hearings on Social Security this week.
 The conservative side of the economics profession lauds progressive indexing. ''It is a pretty fair way to approach the problem,'' said Michael Tanner, who heads the Project on Social Security Choice at the libertarian Cato Institute.
 Mr. Tanner pointed to the political wisdom of pegging the plan to a Democratic thinker.
 ''It will be perceived by some as a benefit cut,'' he said, ''and there is a certain amount of spreading the blame around for that.''
 To Democrats, however, Mr. Pozen is just providing the president with political cover.
 Mr. Pozen ''does not speak for the Democratic Party,'' said Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution, a liberal research institution. The president drafted Mr. Pozen onto his commission, Mr. Orszag said, only ''because they were looking for Democrats that would restrict themselves to be in favor of private accounts.'' 
 Mr. Pozen's support for private accounts seems only natural given his long and successful career as a top-level executive in the fund management business. 
 After serving a stint as a lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Pozen joined Fidelity Investments, the financial powerhouse, in 1987. He left Fidelity 14 years later, substantially richer after rising to the position of vice chairman and after being in charge of the firm's big mutual fund group.
 ''It's fair to say I'm financially independent,'' Mr. Pozen said.
 Since then, he has served on President Bush's commission, was secretary of economic affairs for Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, a Republican, and taught at Harvard Law School. He took over as chairman of MFS in 2004 after it was battered by financial turmoil and scandal.
 At the Senate Finance Committee hearing this week, Mr. Pozen said that while personal accounts were not essential to solving Social Security's financial woes, they were the ''dessert'' to be offered to American retirees after they had eaten the ''spinach'' of benefit cuts needed to plug a financial hole estimated by Social Security actuaries -- in today's money -- at nearly $4 trillion over 75 years. 
 Mr. Pozen has said that progressive indexing, which would not start until 2012 under his proposal, would close 70 percent of the estimated gap by substantially limiting benefits for higher-income retirees. 
 Under the current system, the benefits set at retirement are supposed to grow, on average, at the same pace as wages, so that the comparative living standards of retirees, while generally lower than working Americans, do not erode below today's levels. 
 Mr. Pozen's plan would maintain that schedule only for the bottom 30 percent of the work force -- those with average annual earnings up to $25,000.
 At the top, those earning more than the taxable limit -- expected to be about $113,000 in 2012 when the plan would start, would have future benefits uncoupled from wages and linked instead to inflation, which tends to grow at a pace about 1.1 percentage points slower than wages. In the middle, benefits would be indexed by a mix of prices and wages.
 This re-indexing would substantially reduce benefit growth at the top. Today, for example, an American whose earnings are in line with the maximum income taxed by Social Security, currently $90,000, can expect to receive as much as 42 percent of that amount upon retirement. Mr. Pozen's proposal would steadily reduce that to 22 percent by 2061. 
 Mr. Pozen argued that personal accounts could be layered on top of this plan, eventually providing additional income. But even as the Bush administration has embraced Mr. Pozen's proposal for progressive indexing, it has steered clear of adopting his plan to raise taxes as part of a Social Security overhaul.
 Mr. Pozen has been recommending adding private accounts to Social Security since the mid-1990's, which may have been what brought him to the attention of the Bush White House.
 ''I'm not sure how I got invited to be a member'' of the 2001 commission, Mr. Pozen said, ''but I had worked on various Social Security projects over the years.''
 But now he worries that any plan to overhaul Social Security will fail unless it includes both benefit cuts and tax increases.
 ''As you know,'' Mr. Pozen said, ''both sides have got to win.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Robert C. Pozen, whose proposal to overhaul Social Security has been embraced by President Bush, misstated the effect of his plan on retirement benefits of a worker who consistently earned the maximum amount taxed by Social Security -- currently $90,000 a year -- and retired in 2061. The pension would be 17 percent of the final wage in 2061, not 22 percent -- down from 30 percent today, not from 42 percent.

HEADLINE: Speech Gives Republicans Lift in Social Security Fight

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders announced on Friday that they hoped to draft Social Security legislation by June, trying to demonstrate new energy behind President Bush's long-stalled initiative. Mr. Bush, a day after embracing a plan to restore the pension program's solvency by curtailing promised benefits for most future retirees, declared, ''I'm confident we're going to get something done.''
 Mr. Bush ended his 60-day campaign to highlight the financial problems in Social Security with the public still skeptical about his approach, but he said he was confident the mood would shift: ''The more they understand the nature of the problem, the more they're going to be saying to those of us who are serving, 'Go get it fixed.''' 
 But Mr. Bush's latest Social Security proposal, unveiled in a prime-time news conference on Thursday night, brought a firestorm of new criticism. Democrats asserted it would amount to deep cuts in benefits for most retirees and transform Social Security from a broad middle-class entitlement to a program aimed at the poor. AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans, also dismissed the latest Bush proposal, with John C. Rother, policy director for the group, describing it as ''an unnecessary and unfair benefit cut for the middle class.''
 Mr. Bush took his campaign to overhaul the 70-year-old retirement system to an audience of supporters and skeptics in suburban Virginia, highlighting what the poor would gain from his proposal. Under the approach he has embraced, people in the lowest 30 percent of the income spectrum would receive all the benefits now promised to them by current law. But the plan would reduce the growth in benefits now promised to middle-class and affluent retirees, using a sliding scale tied to income.
 Mr. Bush and his allies argue that the plan will solve most of the solvency problems in Social Security while protecting those who need it most. ''If you've worked all your life and paid in the Social Security system, you will not retire into poverty,'' Mr. Bush said at the James Lee Community Center in Falls Church, Va. ''And there's a way to make that happen, and that is to have the benefits for low-income workers in a future system grow faster than benefits for those who are better off.''
 In a 44-minute ''Conversation on Social Security'' that featured the president as a moderator on stage with six people who agreed with him, Mr. Bush never used the words ''cuts'' or ''reductions'' to describe his plan for Social Security. He left the details to his press secretary, Scott McClellan, who said in a briefing an hour later that doing nothing about Social Security would result in future benefit cuts to all retirees, regardless of income.
 Republicans also stepped up their efforts to cast the Democrats as obstructionists comfortably sunk into the status quo. 
 But Democrats seemed decidedly unfazed. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and his party's ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, declared: ''The main approach of Republicans to addressing Social Security's long-term financial challenge is big benefit cuts. They seem determined to make Social Security beneficiaries bear the entire burden of shoring up the system.''
 Democrats also reiterated that until Mr. Bush renounced his proposal to create private investment accounts in Social Security, financed by payroll tax revenues, they would not negotiate on strengthening the system. Such accounts have huge startup costs, putting additional strains on Social Security, experts say.
 In the face of those divisions, Republican leaders sought to quicken the legislative pace, setting the stage for a frenetic late spring and summer. Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said his panel would begin weekly hearings on May 12, with the goal of producing legislation in June that ''won't just be a Social Security bill,'' but would deal more broadly with retirement security, including new ways to encourage savings and provisions on long-term care.
 Mr. Thomas did not embrace the details of Mr. Bush's solvency plan, but he did express support for its underlying idea: that lawmakers should protect those most dependent on Social Security from any cuts while curtailing the growth in benefits for middle- and upper-income people. ''Those who have other options, perhaps, don't need to get as much as the current formula projects,'' Mr. Thomas said.
 But he added that those middle- and higher-income people would need assurance that there ''are provisions in there for them as well and that would be focused on pensions, retirement instruments, and the tax code itself.'' Mr. Thomas also reiterated that he supported Mr. Bush's proposal to create private retirement accounts.
 In a day of dueling news conferences on Capitol Hill, Democrats asserted that Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bush were bent on changing the fundamental nature of Social Security. Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, who is on the Ways and Means Committee, asserted that Republicans want to replace the government pension program with a system of private accounts for most Americans and a safety net for the lowest income. ''The lines now are very clearly drawn,'' Mr. Levin said.
 The partisan divisions were razor sharp. Mr. Thomas assailed the Democrats for what he called a decades-long effort to avoid the underlying demographic problems in Social Security and the plight of the poorest retirees. 
 In such a climate, 18 months before midterm elections, there was clear nervousness among the Republicans about the president's high-risk move toward limiting benefits. Some economic conservatives have warned that the party faces a growing risk in emphasizing solvency and advocating benefit cuts in the popular pension program. Stephen Moore, the president of the Free Enterprise Fund, a conservative lobby, said Friday, ''I think Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are probably opening up Champagne bottles celebrating that they've put Republicans in this trap.''
 Because of the high political stakes, many have expected the House to hold back until the Senate moves on Social Security. That way, House Republicans could be spared from casting politically difficult votes until they are assured that legislation can actually pass the Senate, which is far more hostile terrain to the Bush plan. Now, the legislative pace is hard to predict.
