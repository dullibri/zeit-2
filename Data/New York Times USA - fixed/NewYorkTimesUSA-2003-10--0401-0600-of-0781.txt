HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Up 0.3%, Mostly Because of Gasoline 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose by a modest 0.3 percent in September, mostly reflecting higher gasoline prices, the Labor Department announced Thursday.
 Another report showed that production at factories, mines and utilities rebounded. 
 The latest reading on the Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation barometer, should ease somewhat concerns by Federal Reserve policy makers about deflation, an economically dangerous and widespread weakness in prices. 
The report from the Federal Reserve on production showed that industrial output rose 0.4 percent in September, a turnaround from the disappointing 0.1 percent drop registered in August.
At factories, output rose 0.7 percent in September led by an increase in automobile production; production at mines was flat; and output at utilities fell 2.2 percent. 
Excluding energy and food prices, which tend to swing widely from month to month, core consumer prices edged up by just 0.1 percent in September for the second consecutive month. That showing on the core inflation rate suggested that most other prices were moderate.
In a second report from the department, new claims for unemployment insurance dropped for the second consecutive week, offering a hopeful sign that the pace of layoffs is slowing.
For the workweek ended Saturday, new applications for jobless benefits dipped by a seasonally adjusted 4,000, to 384,000, the lowest level since early February. The week before, claims fell by 17,000. 
The three economic reports depicted an economy that is perking up and for the most part is enjoying a stable price climate. 
"The reports should cheer those who have been hoping for signs of a more robust expansion," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. The Federal Reserve, he said, is likely to keep short-term interest rates at a 45-year low of 1 percent through the rest of this year. 
The Social Security Administration announced Thursday that benefit recipients will get a 2.1 percent cost-of-living increase next year, providing an extra $19 a month for the typical retiree.
Next year's raise is up from this year's increase of 1.4 percent, but continues to reflect an economy with inflation at a low ebb. 
In the overall inflation report, even with the recent increases in the C.P.I., Fed policy makers have expressed more concern about inflation going down, rather than up. 
For the 12 months ended in September, consumer prices rose 2.3 percent, compared with a 2.4 percent rise for all of last year. Core prices, meanwhile, went up just 1.2 percent, the smallest increase since 1966, and down from a 1.9 percent advance for all of 2002. 
The weakness in core prices is a byproduct of a lackluster economic climate seen last year and earlier this year. That climate had made it difficult for some companies to raise prices. 
Energy prices rose 3 percent in September led by a 6.3 percent jump in gasoline prices. 
In other economic news, businesses cut inventories by 0.4 percent in August and sales dropped 0.2 percent, a sign that companies have not totally let go of their wariness about the economy's direction.
And a survey by the Business Roundtable, an association of company leaders, found that chief executives were optimistic.

HEADLINE: Windsor Journal; 
Doctors Eying the U.S.: Canada Is Sick About It

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: WINDSOR, Ontario, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Drs. Siva Sriharan and Srinivas Chakravarthi may never get rich staying in this small auto-producing city little more than a stone's throw from downtown Detroit, but they can eat all the hamburgers, ribs and potato skins they want for the rest of their lives at Casey's Bar and Grill.
 For the next year, they can also get their hair cut free at the Touch of Class beauty salon, and lease a Pontiac Grand Am without charge from a dealer in nearby Essex. Patients have pledged free house repairs and landscaping for their properties, and nurses have teased them with offers of free massages. 
 All the two doctors have to do is continue practicing medicine in Windsor.
Residents started proffering gifts when rumors leaked out of Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital a few weeks ago that the two neurosurgeons -- of the four serving the city -- were toying with moving their practice to the United States.
"It's not about the money," said Dr. Sriharan, a 38-year-old immigrant from Sri Lanka. "We can't do our job properly with operating room time so extremely limited here."
Forced to compete for operating room time with other surgeons, he said that he and his colleague could complete only one or two operations on some days, meaning that patients whose cases were not emergencies could go months or even years before completing necessary treatment.
"Scarce resources are simply not being spent properly," Dr. Sriharan concluded, citing a shortage of nurses and anesthesiologists in the hospital where the single microscope available is old and breaking down.
The two surgeons are sharply critical of Canada's health care system, which is driven by government-financed insurance for all but increasingly rations service because of various technological and personnel shortages. Both doctors said they were fed up with a two-tier medical system in which those with connections go to the head of the line for surgery.
"It's the system that is pushing us out," said Dr. Chakravarthi, a 53-year-old Indian immigrant.
Many other Canadian doctors feel the lure of the United States these days, particularly if they live close to the border.
The supply of family doctors has increased at a rate lower than population growth in recent years, a problem that is complicated by an aging population and doctors seeking shorter hours. Waiting time for elective surgery is growing across the country, and becoming a hot political issue.
Meanwhile, there are signs that a brain drain of medical talent, particularly specialists to the United States,is becoming a serious problem.
There was a net migration of 49 neurosurgeons from Canada from 1996 to 2002, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, a large loss given that there are only 241 neurosurgeons in the country.
"Physicians across Canada are in an advanced stage of burnout due to work conditions," said Dr. Sunil V. Patel, president of the Canadian Medical Association, who attributed much of the problem to technological shortages and the powerlessness doctors feel when patients complain about long waits for treatment. "That burnout causes them to retire early or pull away from certain kinds of work or simply leave."
John O'Kane, 46, the owner of Casey's Bar and Grill, is leading the local crusade to keep the two neurosurgeons in Windsor. His offer of free food is rooted in personal experience; he is convinced that superior surgery performed on him last year by Dr. Sriharan to remove a broken piece of a spinal disk rubbing against a sciatic nerve is the reason he can again play ice hockey and tennis.
So far the doctors have not come by for any free food, nor have they responded to any of the other offers that have followed.
"For all I know they are vegetarians," Mr. O'Kane said with a laugh. (In fact, Dr. Chakravarthi is.)
The grass-roots surge of offers and almost daily letters to the editor published in the local newspaper urging the surgeons to stay put has not gone unnoticed by local politicians. Windsor's mayor, Mike D. Hurst, has speeded up a physician recruitment and retention initiative to combat local shortages of medical manpower.
"The popular response is an indication," he said, "that there is pure fear in our community of not having qualified, professional medical expertise available when it's needed."
As for the two surgeons, they say that while they are touched and embarrassed, they do not see how they can continue to work at the hospital under the present conditions.
But are they tempted by all the offers?
"Well," Dr. Sriharan smiled in a mock sigh. "I hear those girls at the beauty salon do very good highlights."

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Poor Proclaim Abiding Distrust of Globalization 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The many Indian protesters who choked the streets and highways of this Andean nation again on Thursday may be poor and speak broken or accented Spanish, but they have a powerful message. 
 It is this: no to the export of gas and other natural resources; no to free trade with the United States; no to globalization in any form other than solidarity among the downtrodden peoples of the developing world. 
 The force of that message may yet topple President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who tried to quell the unrest by offering a package of concessions late Wednesday night that the protesters rejected. 
Instead they vowed to continue with demonstrations meant to force his government to abandon a plan to export natural gas to the United States through a port in Chile. The protests have already left more than 80 people dead over the past month. 
Sensing that public support for the president, weak to begin with, has all but vanished, opponents of the gas export plan have now moved to press their advantage. 
"The blood that has been spilled is something sacred," Felipe Quispe, leader of the indigenous group that initiated the protests, said in response to Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's offer, made in a televised speech. "So we can't negotiate and we're not even going to talk."
Several thousand workers, mostly miners from the south and coca growers from the north, were reported to be marching on the capital Thursday. The armed forces demanded that they disperse, saying that the military would erect barricades to prevent them from entering La Paz, but the warning appeared to have gone unheeded.
More than merely threatening the longevity of Bolivia's government, the protesters have lent new energy to the discontent already percolating throughout the region. 
Across South America, labor unions, student and civic groups and a new wave of leaders -- Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil, and Nestor Kirchner in Argentina -- are expressing similar doubts about who actually benefits from a free flow of international trade and investment. 
But nowhere have those doubts been expressed as forcefully as in this poor nation of eight million people, increasingly divided along class and racial lines. A majority of Bolivians have Indian blood, descended from the original inhabitants of this continent who got a foretaste of globalization centuries ago with the age of exploration and the arrival of European colonizers.
"Globalization is just another name for submission and domination," Nicanor Apaza, 46, an unemployed miner, said at a demonstration this week in which Indian women in bowler hats and colorful layered skirts carried banners denouncing the International Monetary Fund and demanding the president's resignation. "We've had to live with that here for 500 years, and now we want to be our own masters." 
He and many other protesters see an unbroken line from this region's often rapacious colonial history to the failed economic experiments of the late 20th century, in which Bolivia was one of the first Latin American countries to open itself to the modern global economy. The $5 billion gas pipeline project is only the latest gambit.
Starting with the end of a military dictatorship two decades ago, Bolivia embraced the free-market model. State-owned companies were sold off. Foreign investment was courted. Government regulation was reduced, all in the name of a new era of growth and prosperity. 
The policies brought to heel runaway inflation. But otherwise, the average Bolivian has had little to show for the government's embrace of policies urged on it by the United States, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, now the focus of so much resentment. 
Exports have actually declined compared with their level 25 years ago. Growth has stalled for the past five years. Unemployment has soared, and Bolivia remains the poorest country in South America, with a per capita income of less than $950 a year -- by some calculations, less than it was before the free-market reforms. "After 21 years, the economic model in place has not solved the problems of poverty and social exclusion," said Carlos Toranzo of the Latin American Institute for Research here. 
The leading spokesman for the discontented here is Evo Morales, the charismatic 43-year-old leader of the coca growers' federation. As presidential candidate, he finished barely one percentage point behind Mr. Sanchez de Lozada in the election last year after a campaign that called for reversing the economic course. 
While few development experts see much benefit from reinforcing economic barriers around an already landlocked nation, talk of self-reliance has taken on great appeal.
"If you talk to average people about the Free Trade Area of the Americas or even the gas export law, they really don't know that much about them," said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian scholar who is director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Florida International University in Miami. "But Evo Morales and others have shrewdly used those ideas as a flag which plays on their deepest fears, the loss of identity and the giving away of what they consider to be their national patrimony." 
At a recent regional anti-globalization forum in Argentina, Mr. Morales maintained that the United States and multinational companies have "a plan to exterminate the Indian" in order to seize control of the riches of Bolivia and neighboring countries. 
"How much longer will the natural resources of Latin America remain in the hands of transnational companies?" he asked.
That suspicion is rooted deep in this country's bitter history. In the colonial era, silver from the mines of Potosi provided Spain with the wealth that allowed it to forge a global empire, and in modern times, tin made a few families, like the Patinos, fabulously wealthy.
"The wealth has always left the country and enriched foreigners, rather than staying here to improve our lives," said Pascuala Velazquez, an egg vendor of Aymara Indian descent, "but we cannot allow that to happen this time with the gas."
Rather than export gas and other resources, the protesters insist that they be used to help build an industrial base. But Bolivia does not have the money to carry out such a program on its own, and as a diplomat who represents a South American country asked, "Who in their right mind is going to be willing to invest in a country that is so unstable and hostile to foreign capital?" 
Perhaps another president could have convinced Bolivians of the merits of the gas project, expected to quadruple the country's exports over the next decade. But Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, 73, a loyal ally of Washington and a millionaire former mining executive, is regarded here as so much a puppet of the foreign and domestic economic interests that his every word is suspect.
One demonstrator, Remberto Clavijo, a shoe repairman of Quechua Indian descent, said, "He has governed this country for the benefit of the gringos and the multinational companies and the Chileans, not for the Bolivian people."

HEADLINE: Bill Would Penalize Colleges on High Tuition Rises 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Putting educators on notice, one of the Republican lawmakers overseeing higher education legislation in the House introduced a bill yesterday that would withhold federal money from colleges that raised tuition much faster than inflation, a category that could include hundreds of universities. 
 The congressman, Howard P. McKeon, a California Republican and a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, warned that as many as two million low-income students would be barred from pursuing postsecondary degrees in the next decade if college costs remained unchecked. 
 To keep that from happening, Mr. McKeon said his bill would create a government watch list of public and private universities that raised their tuition and fees more than twice the rate of inflation for three years in a row. If the offenders still did not curb their costs after another three years, they could lose their eligibility for millions of dollars in federal grants and programs under the bill. 
"I'm not just trying to make enemies for nothing," said Mr. McKeon, chairman of a subcommittee that has taken up the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. "What I'm hoping is that we really get the attention of thousands of schools across the country, that they understand that this is a serious issue." 
Even before the legislation was introduced, it had become perhaps the most heavily debated and controversial issue surrounding reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The proposal has inspired sympathy from Republicans, frustration from Democrats and an atmosphere akin to panic from colleges.
If the bill was in effect today, no fewer than 225 public universities, 470 private colleges and 625 for-profit trade schools would be placed on the watch list, according to the American Council on Education, an industry group. That is 24 percent of the nation's postsecondary institutions, the council said. House Education Committee staff members said the tally showed how rampant the problem of escalating tuition is.
"That obviously means that hundreds of schools are engaged in exorbitant tuition increases that hurt parents and students," said David Schnittger, a spokesman for the committee.
In their defense, colleges and universities argue that most of their costs are driven by expenses over which they have no control, like double-digit jumps in health care premiums or utility costs.
Beyond that, public universities contend that putting sanctions on them would be particularly unfair, since their tuition is mainly going up to compensate for deep cuts in state spending on higher education. They also point out that most public universities do not even control their own tuitions, but have them set by governors, legislatures or other publicly appointed bodies. Yet Mr. McKeon's bill would penalize them anyway.
Most important, the colleges argue, the legislation would ultimately hurt the very students it is intended to help. Although Mr. McKeon's bill would not withhold federal Pell grants and Stafford loans, two primary sources of assistance to low-income students, several other programs would be withdrawn. In particular, campuses could be cut off from federal money that helped pay student workers, provided scholarships and furnished low-interest loans to those in need of financial aid. 
"The federal government lacks a policy mechanism to control tuition without simultaneously hurting low- and middle-income students," said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education. "There is simply no easy way for the federal government to penalize the schools without simultaneously taking away money for students. That's all it can really do."

HEADLINE: Ford Reports Narrower Loss For the Quarter 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Buoyed by its financial operations and cost-cutting, the Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it had narrowed its loss and handily beat Wall Street estimates for the second consecutive quarter.
 The company raised its operating earnings goal for the full year, from 70 cents a share to 95 cents to $1.05 a share. 
 "We continue to make significant progress on cutting costs, building relationships and launching great products," William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
For the third quarter, the company reported a net loss of $25 million, or 1 cent a share, compared with a net loss of $326 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Ford's operating profit of 13 cents a share was well ahead of the consensus analysts' estimate for an 11-cent loss, as compiled by Thomson First Call. 
Ford's earnings report indicated progress, but also left much to fix at a company that lost $6.4 billion in 2001 and 2002. Several of Ford's problems are common among the Big Three automakers, though General Motors has shown the healthiest operating results of the group in recent years.
But both G.M. and Ford, the world's two largest automakers, have been struggling to make money in their primary business. Not only is a price war sapping profits in the crucial North American market, but foreign competitors like Toyota and Honda are taking market share with far lower levels of incentive spending.
Ford and G.M. are also leaning heavily on their financing operations for profit. In the third quarter, Ford Credit, Ford's lending division, reported pretax profit of $809 million, up about 75 percent from a year earlier, though analysts are doubtful the pace is sustainable.
"Rates are starting to move up, so their borrowing costs are as low as they're going to get," said Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, referring to Ford Credit's own cost of borrowing money. He added that Ford had also been scaling back its leasing program and its lending to people with poor credit histories, which means there will be fewer loans to generate income in the future.
Ford's worldwide automotive operations reported a pretax loss of $609 million, just a $9 million improvement from a year earlier. As with G.M., operations in Asia, driven by the surging China market, were the highlight of Ford's third quarter. While operations in Europe and South America lost money, Ford eked out a $1 million pretax profit in Asia.
Of most concern to analysts is the company's $116 million loss in North America. Despite heady industry sales in the United States, where automakers expect to sell close to 17 million cars and trucks this year, the Big Three have struggled to make money in their home market.
"They're making some progress on the cost side but they have a lot of progress left to make, here and abroad," Mr. Girsky, the Morgan Stanley analyst, said of Ford. "At the end of the day you have a car business that's barely profitable this year in a 17 million market."
Ford executives say their new version of the F-150 pickup truck, which recently went on sale, will bolster results. The F-Series line, which is mostly made up of F-150's, is the most popular vehicle of any kind in the nation and a critical profit center for Ford.
Don R. Leclair, Ford's chief financial officer, also said the company saw "the U.S. economy beginning to show signs of strengthening" but also saw the Big Three price war as likely to intensify.
To compensate, Ford increased its cost-cutting target for 2003 to $3 billion from $2.5 billion.
"We're all, year to date, down a few tenths of a point of share," said Lloyd E. Hansen, Ford's vice president for revenue management, referring to the market shares of Ford, G.M. and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler. "I think there will be a pretty healthy battle as we go through the fourth quarter and incentives will continue to stay strong."

HEADLINE: Times Company's Earnings Slipped 15% inThird Quarter 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported yesterday that its earnings in the third quarter fell 15 percent, as costs of paper and health care rose and advertising revenues slumped during July and August.
 The company posted net income of $50.1 million, or 33 cents a share, down from $59 million, or 38 cents a share, for the third quarter of 2003. Revenue rose 4 percent in the latest quarter, to $759.3 million, from $729.5 million in the period a year earlier. 
 In addition to its flagship paper, The Times Company owns 18 other newspapers (including The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune) and eight network-affiliated television stations.
The company had warned investors last month that because advertising demand was weaker than expected, its earnings would probably fall short of the 39 cents that Wall Street analysts had been predicting. At that time, executives had predicted earnings of 30 to 32 cents. But the company said yesterday that it beat that estimate by a penny partly because advertising had picked up since Labor Day.
The Times Company said September advertising revenue at its newspaper group -- excluding results from The Herald Tribune, an acquisition that The Times did not complete until January -- increased 2.3 percent compared with the month a year ago. Advertisements from entertainment, telecommunications, transportation and technology companies fueled those gains. Advertising revenue for the quarter grew 0.5 percent.
"We feel we are climbing out of the gloomier days of the advertising recession," Russell T. Lewis, the company's president and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. 
Company executives acknowledged that not all advertising indicators were positive last month. Retail advertising linage in The Times fell 4.7 percent in September from the month a year earlier, pulled down by the cautious spending of department stores. The company said, however, that it anticipated "strong" placements for the remainder of the year from chains like Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Marshall Field's.
The losses in retail advertising last month were more severe at the company's New England newspapers (down 11 percent compared with a year ago) and its regional newspapers (down 5.6 percent.) 
Classified advertising linage was also lower in September at the company's flagship newspaper compared with a year earlier (a drop of 10.9 percent), a function of the sluggish job market. The losses in classified advertising were less severe at its New England newspapers (2.7 percent) and regional newspapers (0.9 percent.)
The company alsoreported some success in the third quarter in its continuing effort to reduce expenses. Still, it said newsprint expenses rose 13.1 percent, compared with the period a year earlier. 
The Times Company's shares closed at $47.09, up $1.40, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Times Tower Is Delayed As Partner Awaits Loan 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it would delay construction of a new headquarters on Eighth Avenue until its development partner obtains financing for the 52-story project.
 The Times said its partner, Forest City Ratner, had had difficulty obtaining a construction loan in the current economy for the portion of the tower that Ratner will own. The tower will be on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets. 
 Russell T. Lewis, chief executive of the Times Company, said in a conference call yesterday with stock analysts that he did not anticipate moving into the new building until late 2006 or early 2007, about two years later than the company had originally anticipated.
Last month, the partners took possession of the property across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal where the skyscraper will be built. The 55 businesses on the site have all been relocated. But Forest City has been unable to land an anchor tenant for its space. Its negotiations with city officials for special tax-free financing known as Liberty Bonds are also at a standstill.
"Obviously it's a difficult climate for large commercial projects of that nature," Mr. Lewis said. "As long as there's no financing, the project will not go forward. We certainly expect that the market will improve in the future and then we would be prepared to move forward. Projecting exactly what will happen is not something I want to do."
But later in the day, Michael Golden, vice chairman and senior vice president of the Times Company, said he expected that Forest City would be able to get financing within the next year.
More than two years ago, the Times Company and Forest City reached a deal with the state's 42nd Street Development Project to build a new headquarters. The Times will own the 2nd through 27th floors, about 875,000 square feet, while Forest City will own the upper floors, about 725,000 square feet.
The partners are required to pay the acquisition costs of the land, but are liable only for $85.6 million. Anything above that will be refunded with interest over time. They are also required to demolish the existing structures and begin construction within a year after taking over the property.
But with rents falling and vacancy rates at relatively high levels, Forest City has not found a prime tenant. 
In recent months, Forest City began negotiating with city officials for $400 million in Liberty Bonds, which were designated for rebuilding New York after the attack on the trade center. Forest City ultimately applied for $150 million in bonds, but has been unable to get city approval.
Forest City declined to comment yesterday.
Some good government groups, urban planners and executives involved in downtown rebuilding have criticized plans to use Liberty Bonds they say were meant for Lower Manhattan. Regulations may allow it, they say, but Forest City should be forced to live by the deal it struck more than two years ago.

Slumping Sun Microsystems Posts Wider Loss

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
Showing continued signs of trouble, Sun Microsystems Inc. reported a wider loss yesterday for its fiscal first quarter and said that year-over-year sales declined for the 10th consecutive quarter. Company executives attributed the problem to continuing softness in corporate spending and said they had no plans to restructure or lay off workers.
 "We face an economic environment that has not improved and a difficult competitive landscape," Steve McGowan, Sun's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with financial analysts. 
 Sun's net loss for the quarter ended Sept. 28 was $286 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $111 million, or 4 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue was $2.54 billion, down 8 percent from $2.75 billion.
Analysts had forecast a loss of 8 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.
The company warned investors two weeks ago that its first-quarter loss would be far bigger than analysts had forecast and revised its fiscal fourth-quarter 2003 earnings from a meager profit to a $1.04 billion loss.
Total gross margin as a percent of revenue fell 1.1 percentage points during the quarter, to 40.1 percent. The company reported that cash flow from operations was a negative $49 million.
Before Sun's announcement, its shares closed at $3.63, down 16 cents. They fell as low as $3.58 after hours. 
Sun, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been under intense pressure from some investors and Wall Street analysts to acknowledge that its current strategy, combined with its reluctance to reduce its work force even more, appears to be failing. In mid-September, Sun said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs, or 3 percent of its work force. The company cut roughly 11 percent of its work force in 2002.
Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, recently wrote in an open letter to Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive, and the Sun board that the company was unfocused and could become "acquisition bait."
But Mr. McNealy and other Sun executives defended the company's strategy and said it was too early to take drastic measures like a corporate restructuring. Sun executives said the immediate focus would be on returning to profitability and improving cash flow, with both goals, they say, achievable in the coming quarters.
"If we are not able to achieve both of those over time we will take appropriate action," Mr. McGowan said. He said Sun was committed "to drive cost out of products and services" and to pricing its products more aggressively. 
Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he had hoped to hear Sun disclose specific plans to cut more costs. "This is a company in turmoil," he said. "But they're still unwilling to take a more aggressive stand."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Attendance is up, but caution still reigns as the big spenders on marketing gather again.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif. 

 BODY:
AS leading advertising marketers gather for a major annual conference, they remain wary of forecasting when the sputtering economic upturn will finally morph into the strong turnaround they have long expected.
 "I think the industry is in recovery, but growth isn't going to be robust," said James D. Speros, the chief marketing officer for the United States at Ernst & Young in New York. Mr. Speros is also the chairman of the Association of National Advertisers, which began its 93rd annual conference here last night. 
 "We are seeing some signs of bounceback," Mr. Speros said in an interview before the conference started, "but not tremendous bounceback." 
As a result, the agenda of the 2003 conference, which continues through Sunday, has been narrowed by Mr. Speros and the association leaders to topics of particular interest to members during tough times: measuring the return on investment for ad spending; becoming more innovative in making media decisions and more creative in developing campaigns; determining accountability; and building stronger brands.
The challenge is "bringing science to the art of marketing," said Robert D. Liodice, president and chief executive of the association, which is based in New York. It has more than 340 member companies that spend more than $100 billion a year on advertising and marketing communications for 8,000 brands.
"The economy is going to come back," Mr. Liodice said. "The question is when."
Until that time, which Mr. Liodice predicted would come sometime in 2004, "marketers will be focused," he said, "on squeezing every ounce of value from every dollar of their marketing spend."
As marketers seek signs of a potential turnaround, one sign may be close at hand: a surprising increase in attendance at the conference. The registration for the conference was 565 people, more than twice the attendance for the 2002 conference, held last October in Naples, Fla.
"It's good for the entire industry to get that many advertisers in one place to discuss important issues," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, who plans to attend the meeting of his marketer counterparts.
Attendance at the annual conferences for advertisers and agencies tends to mirror the health of their businesses, or at least the perceptions thereof among senior managers. Last year, about 400 people were initially expected at the conference, but only about 250 attended.
"The amount of members we had last year was paltry," Mr. Liodice acknowledged. "To be perfectly honest, we didn't manage last year's conference terribly well."
"We were quite concerned," he added, and determined "we either have to rebuild, and restore the luster to the conference, or do away with it."
A decision was made, Mr. Liodice said, to develop the agenda for the 2003 conference "by surveying our members and asking them what they want to know more about," then planning subjects and speakers based on those responses.
"We're doing simple marketing," he added. "We have learned that members come because of the content."
(Of course, the location of the conference, at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel hotel in what Fox Broadcasting would call "The O.C." -- Orange County, Calif. -- could not hurt.)
Mr. Liodice was named to his posts in July after serving on an acting basis since December, when his predecessor, John J. Sarsen Jr., left after almost nine years. Previously, as an executive vice president of the association, Mr. Liodice had a good perch for observing the highs and lows of the conferences over the years.
The low point, by all accounts, was a policy in effect from 1996 to 1999 enabling speakers to buy their way onto the conference agendas if they paid the association $100,000 each. The result was conferences replete with infomercial-style sales spiels from media companies, which left many attendees -- paying thousands of dollars for registration fees and hotel rooms -- disappointed and unhappy.
By comparison, the scheduled speakers for the 2003 conference include Jocelyn Carter-Miller, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Office Depot; Dawn Hudson, president of the Pepsi-Cola North America division of PepsiCo; Robert A. Lutz, chairman for North American operations at the General Motors Corporation; Keith Reinhard, chairman of the DDB Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group; and James R. Stengel, global marketing officer at the Procter & Gamble Company.
The conference opened with a dinner at which the trade publication Brandweek, owned by VNU, presented its annual Marketer of the Year awards. The Grand Marketer of the Year, chosen from among winners in 10 categories, was Mark LaNeve, general manager of the Cadillac division of General Motors.
Other winners included some nontraditional choices. One was Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, honored for becoming a brand himself by meting out what Brandweek called "tough love on Wall Street." Another was Dr. Robert Atkins, the creator of the Atkins diet, who became the first posthumous honoree.
Brandweek also presented awards to two top executives at Allergan, the maker of Botox antiwrinkle treatments: David E. I. Pyott, chairman, president and chief executive, and Lester J. Kaplan, president for research and development.
The award raised eyebrows among those attendees who could still do so.

HEADLINE: Agreement in West Will Send Farms' Water to Urban Areas 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: BOULDER CITY, Nev., Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Secretary of the Interior Gale A. Norton signed a contentious agreement here on Thursday that signals an epic shift in the struggle over water in the arid West from farmland to the swimming pools, showers and green lawns of cities.
 The agreement ends one of the West's longest-running water wars by requiring California, the nation's thirstiest state, to gradually reduce its dependence on the Colorado River, which acts as a huge spigot for snow melt from the Rocky Mountains for more than 25 million people from Denver to Los Angeles. 
 At its core, the agreement affirms a tough lesson for the bone-dry region: Because of finite supplies and a population boom, water reserved over the past century for irrigating crops must be diverted more and more to urban areas.
The deal calls for the largest movement of farm water to municipal users in the nation and will be in effect for at least 35 years. As compensation, farmers, some of whom might need to plant less, will be paid handsomely for water they get for a very small cost from the federal government. 
"With this agreement, conflict on the river is stilled," Ms. Norton said from a concrete perch overlooking the Hoover Dam, where a formal signing ceremony was attended by federal officials, representatives of the seven states that draw from the Colorado and four water districts in California that had been feuding over that state's share of the river.
The last time a water deal of this significance was reached on the Colorado, the federal government was represented by Herbert Hoover, who was then secretary of commerce under President Warren G. Harding. That deal, the Colorado River Compact, was signed on Nov. 24, 1922, and led to the construction of the Hoover Dam and California's commitment to limit its Colorado River water use to 4.4 million acre-feet.
In recent years, the state has been taking closer to 5.2 million acre-feet. An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons, or enough on average to provide for two households for a year. 
"This is a huge breakthrough," Ms. Norton said in an interview. "Even the agreement that allowed the construction of the Hoover Dam left some issues unresolved. This resolves issues that have been unresolved for over 70 years."
The deal comes at a time when the Colorado is enduring a fifth consecutive year of drought and California and its neighbors, experiencing unbridled population growth, are at loggerheads over how to meet everyone's water needs.
Ms. Norton and state and local water officials said the drought was a driving force behind the negotiations, as water districts across the West got a sobering view of how tight supplies could become.
"This deal has a huge economic impact by stabilizing the water supply not only for California, but for Nevada, Arizona and the upper basin states," said Pat Mulroy, director of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, referring to Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. "As all of these states develop, finding a point of water stability is essential."
Under the agreement, farmers in the Imperial Valley, a fertile basin in Southern California that would be a wasteland without water from the Colorado, must eventually sell hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water a year to San Diego County, a sprawling coastal metropolis of more than three million people with virtually no local water supplies.
The San Diego district will pay market prices for the water, or about $258 per acre-foot at the outset. The farmers typically pay only delivery fees for their water, which amount to $15 or $20 per acre-foot. 
An earlier version of the deal collapsed in December when many Imperial Valley farmers balked at the notion of selling their water, but as water experts predicted then, it was only a matter of time before agricultural interests relented to the unstoppable march of the urbanized West. 
"About every 100 years, we have something like this we can agree upon," said Maureen Stapleton, general manager of the San Diego County Water Authority. "It is a day of historic celebration."
Noticeably absent from the festivities on Thursday, which included a reception at Hoover Dam and a banquet in Las Vegas, were many Imperial Valley farmers, who for the first time in a century will be giving up large volumes of their water.
"There is very little interest in celebrating," said Michael B. Cox, president of the Imperial County Farm Bureau, who skipped Thursday's ceremony. "A lot of us understand we needed to do a transfer, but man, so many of those provisions are just hard to accept."
The Imperial Irrigation District, which provides water to the farmers, remains deeply divided on the issue, approving the agreement by a 3-to-2 vote two weeks ago. Many farmers fear that the agreement has opened the way for more demands on their supplies and that ultimately they will be driven out business by the unquenchable thirst of California's growing cities.
Already, the state's largest water district, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, receives nearly 9 percent of its supplies from agricultural sources, including some from the Imperial Valley.
"The farmers are split down the middle on this," said Bruce R. Kuhn, a district board member who was the swing vote. "This is a first. This is like the pioneers coming West."
But Lloyd Allen, an Imperial farmer who is president of the irrigation district, showed up on Thursday in his cowboy hat and heaped praise on Ms. Norton and Gov. Gray Davis of California, who pushed thenegotiations forward after December's impasse and helped break a deadlock by agreeing to state assistance for the Salton Sea, a salty body of water brimming with bird life in the Imperial Valley that relies on agricultural runoff to keep from drying up. 
"I am going to go out there in the middle of that bridge and I am going to get on my hands and knees and I am going to kiss that dam," Mr. Allen told the gathering. 
He continued, "This thing has made where I live a beautiful, beautiful valley. Now I find out it is going to make a lot more beauty over there on that coastal plain because you are going to get a lot of water from this."
California had promised to limit its use of Colorado River water in the 1920's. It was a pledge that Congress had insisted upon before approving construction of the dam, which created Lake Mead, a huge reservoir about 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas. .
But even with California's promises, the growing state continued to draw more than its share from the Colorado for the better part of a century, leading to protracted legal battles. Three years ago, the six other Colorado River basin states, along with the Department of the Interior, gave California an ultimatum: Get your house in order by Dec. 31, 2002 -- namely work out a deal where water from California's farms is shared with its cities -- or all supplies of river water above 4.4 million acre-feet will be cut off. 
When the deadline passed, Ms. Norton turned off the flows to the Imperial farmers and the Metropolitan Water District, an unprecedented punishment.
That jolt led to a new round of negotiations, which were completed only last Friday and were approved the same day by Ms. Norton. With the deal now signed, Ms. Norton said on Thursday that she would turn the water flows back on, and that California would be given 14 years to wean itself from its overdependence on the river.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE RECONSTRUCTION; 
UNANIMOUS VOTE BY U.N.'S COUNCIL ADOPTS IRAQ PLAN

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The Security Council unanimously approved Thursday an American and British resolution authorizing an American-led multinational force in Iraq. The measure also set a Dec. 15 deadline for the Iraqi Governing Council to lay out a timetable for creating a constitution and democratic government.
 The international unity on display in the Security Council chamber when all 15 ambassadors raised their hands in assent was something of a diplomatic triumph for the Bush administration after months of apparent isolation here. 
 The United States and Britain won an international mandate to carry out what is largely their vision of Iraq's political future while creating a United Nations-authorized multinational force under American command. Excerpts, Page A12. 
In a statement, President Bush welcomed the vote, saying: "The world has an opportunity -- and a responsibility -- to help the Iraqi people build a nation that is stable, secure and free. This resolution will help marshal even more international support for the development of a new, democratic Iraq."
The Senate voted on Thursday night to insist that Iraq repay up to $10 billion in reconstruction aid. Page A12. 
As soon as the United Nations resolution passed, several late converts -- including France, Germany and Pakistan -- made clear that it was still too flawed, in their view, to spur any contributions of troops or money beyond current assistance.
Pakistan, a Muslim nation, was one of the countries that Washington had hoped would contribute troops. 
Russia, France and Germany, the countries that had most visibly opposed the war, issued a joint statement saying, "We believe that the resolution should have gone further on two major issues: first, the role of the United Nations, in particular in the political process, and second, the pace of the transfer of responsibilities to the Iraqi people."
Those comments made it clear that the resolution did little more than paper over the fundamental differences dividing the United States from many Council members, who contended that the measure should have mandated a quick, time-limited transfer of responsibilities from the coalition authorities to the Iraqis.
Still, the vote ended the United States' diplomatic isolation. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called the vote "a great achievement for the entire Security Council, to come together again in this manner."
The resolution, Mr. Powell said, allows the international community "to move forward to restore full sovereignty of Iraq back to the Iraqi people in a careful, deliberate way."
The unanimous vote was the product of a last-minute deal brokered Wednesday between the United States and Russia, after China had indicated its support for the draft, Council diplomats said. 
Russia offered amendments giving the United Nations more flexibility in taking on political tasks and making clear that the multinational force's mandate would end when the political transition was complete.
But just when that transition will be over was left unclear. The Iraqi Governing Council must submit a timetable by Dec. 15 and allow it to be reviewed by the Security Council, but no stipulation on the nature of that timetable was included. That left the Bush administration with the room for maneuver that it had sought, officials said.
The administration appeared to have Russia to thank for the unanimous vote. "Russia was the catalyst," one Council diplomat involved in the talks said. Once China signaled support on Wednesday for the American text, Russia moved to get France and Germany on board, diplomats said, and all three announced their support Thursday morning.
About 90 minutes later, the Syrian ambassador, Faysal Mekdad, who had last talked to John D. Negroponte, the United States ambassador, at 1:20 a.m., told him that Syria, too, would go along, Mr. Negroponte said. 
But unanimity did not indicate enthusiasm. "We miss the clear signal that the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis will be accelerated," Germany's ambassador to the United Nations, Gunter Pleuger, told the Council after the vote.
The Germans and French had made clear that Western Europe can have no interest in any American -- or Western -- failure in Iraq, and Mr. Pleuger echoed that thinking. Political and economic reconstruction and the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty were crucial goals, hesaid, adding that "this can only succeed when the Security Council appears as unified as possible."
"We therefore did not want to stand in the way of unity of the Council," he said. 
Nonetheless, the unexpectedly complete success of the measure was deeply satisfying to Washington and London. The resolution gives the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority an international mandate to maintain troops to "contribute to the maintenance of stability and security in Iraq" while a constitution is drafted and ratified and a new government elected and established.
Jeanne J. Kirkpatrick, the American ambassador to the United Nations in the Reagan administration, said the overwhelming approval "has some symbolic value which can be cashed in for real value under the right circumstances."
She added, "I think, for instance, it is very important for Tony Blair in the U.K., and Tony Blair is very important for the U.S." Mr. Blair, the British prime minister, "is taking a real beating right now," she said, alluding to the strong criticism of Mr. Blair at home over Iraq.
Richard C. Holbrooke, President Bill Clinton's United Nations ambassador, said the vote "proves once again, that, flaws and all, the U.N. is a vital institution to American foreign policy." 
The new resolution was conceived after the Aug. 19 bombing of United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, in which 22 people died,

Museums

"ABOUT TIME: 700 YEARS OF EUROPEAN PAINTING," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, permanent installation. After three years in storage, the museum's European painting collection is back on view. Brooklyn owns some classy material, from Renaissance altarpieces to a clutch of smashing Monets. In this reinstallation, works from various periods have been linked with the theme of time, a good idea. The refurbished Beaux-Arts Court, with its large skylight, presents problems as an exhibition space, namely glare bouncing off Plexiglas-covered paintings. An exquisite small installation of early Italian painting from the collection is on the fifth floor. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3 (Holland Cotter).

* LOTHAR BAUMGARTEN, "Origin of the Night: Amazon Cosmos," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 30. The first New York screening of this overlong but mesmerizing film from the late 1970's offers another piece of the expanding puzzle of post-Minimalism. Up close and impersonal, it explores a busy day in the life of an Amazon tributary, offering close-ups of flora, fauna and shimmering water accompanied by written and spoken words and a marvelous musical soundtrack. Inspired by an ancient creation narrative, it is mostly a lyrical meditation on the facts of film, nature and language and the erosion of the wilderness by industrial progress. And as its setting is really a trashy swamp somewhere in Germany, it establishes Mr. Baumgarten's importance to 1980's setup photography. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Roberta Smith).

* "BESIDE 'THE ROSE': SELECTED WORKS BY JAY DEFEO," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Feb. 29. The Bay Area legend Jay DeFeo spent eight years painting "The Rose," which accumulated nearly a ton of pigment, built up at its thickest to 11 inches. This show includes 25 works from a career that spanned 40 years, out of which "The Rose" was only the most conspicuous part. Weight, scale, material experimentation, surface modulation, muted color and centripetal form: these were among the conceptual through-lines of DeFeo's art, with mystical ideas conveyed (but never stated outright) via transparent signs of physical exertion. "The Rose" is like a mandala. It is also an artifact of intractable effort, with a beauty that you can appreciate only when you stand in front of it and see how light plays across its face, in which there seem to be buried pentimenti of color. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).

* "CROSSING THE CHANNEL: BRITISH AND FRENCH PAINTING IN THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-77710, through Jan. 4. Although this show opens with a full-size replica of Gericault's "Raft of the Medusa," its 140 works give a substantial boost to what might be called the denationalization of the triumph of 19th-century French painting. Its startling diversity offers an accurate reflection of Romanticism's essential unruliness, and its careful tracings of the traffic in art, artists and ideas between Paris and London gives the British overdue credit for crucial influence on the French Romantics, especially Gericault and Delacroix. In the process, the show provides a finely detailed glimpse of a working art scene and the messiness that lurks beneath the surface of any art-historical narrative. Hours: Sundays, this Monday (Oct. 13) and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Smith).

"A FINE LINE: DRAWINGS BY ACADEMICIANS," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Jan. 4. This modest show of drawings by present and past members of the National Academy, organized by the Photo Realist painter Robert Cottingham, functions best as an instructive catalog of the varieties of line that artists may put into play. It includes the microscopically fine delineation of trees and a placid stream by the Hudson River School painter Jasper Cropsey; the jerky, primitivistic charcoal lines of a nude by Charles Cajori; the pale, feathery hatching in a still-life by William Bailey; the graphically definitive sketches of people, dogs and cakes from Wayne Thiebaud's notebooks; and much more. Hours, Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Ken Johnson).

* "EL GRECO," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 11. The world is full of second-class El Grecos, but they are not in this first-class show. The portraits are fresh, true to life and understated. Elsewhere, El Greco emotes. The pitch hardly varies or drops. It's no wonder people tend to fall in love with him when they are young. Modern artists especially love him, as if he were a protomodernist. As the Belgian painter Luc Tuymans says of El Greco's work: "Everything goes upward. That's its mystical meaning. It's about the evaporation of material life." The show is also gorgeously installed. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "GEORGE INNESS AND THE VISIONARY LANDSCAPE," National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Dec. 28. Inness's achievement hovers in the background of 19th-century American painting with all the mysterious haziness of his tantalizing, startlingly simplified late landscapes. This taut 36-work summary of his development shows an artist whose artistic virtuosity was given substance by a religious vision of nature and an equally deep faith in the autonomy of paint as an expressive material. Distilling the examples of the German Romantics, the Barbizon artists and the Hudson River School, Inness forged a less-is-more conception of pictorial unity that was years ahead of its time. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.50 (Smith).

* "PASSION FOR THE MOUNTAINS: 17TH-CENTURY LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS FROM THE NANJING MUSEUM," China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, through Dec. 20. The focus of this exquisite show is on the southern city of Nanjing between the defeat of the Ming dynasty in 1644 and the subsequent consolidation of the Qing dynasty. The scrolls, album paintings and fan paintings on loan from the Nanjing Museum distill both the verve of that cosmopolitan city and the mood of fatalistic nostalgia that has long defined classical Chinese art and was particularly acute in periods of political transition.A hand scroll titled "A Thousand Cliffs and Myriad Valleys" by Gong Xian, one of the great Nanjing artists, is a standout. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $3 (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

* "THE ART OF RINPA," Koichi Yanagi, 58A East 66th Street, (212) 744-5577, through Oct. 24. This show has fewer than a dozen objects, but doesn't think or feel small. Rinpa refers to an aesthetic impulse shared by artists working in various media from the mid-17th through 19th centuries. Although rinpa-style work may convey an initial impression of simplicity, it is defined by its decorative aplomb, as can be seen here in examples of calligraphy, ceramic, lacquerware and painting (Cotter).

"ENGLISH ROMANTIC ART, 1850-1920," Shepherd & Derom, 58 East 79th Street, (212) 861-4050, through Oct. 25. This extensive selection of Pre-Raphaelite, Victorian and Symbolist works is uneven but includes some beautiful things. There are, for example, startlingly vivid nature studies in watercolor by John Skinner Clifton, John Jessop Hardwick and Ruth Lindsay; a dopey yet magically luminous watercolor of children outdoors under a rainbow, by John Simmons; and a sweet, softly rendered pencil portrait of the artist's son by the once inordinately popular Edward Coley Burne-Jones (Johnson).

RICHARD POUSETTE-DART, "Mythic Heads and Forms: Paintings and Drawings From 1935 to 1942," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Nov. 5. At the ripe old age of 19, and without any formal training, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) turned out paintings of surprising strength and confidence, whose daring abstract idiom put him among the best of the first-generation New York School. Among the more powerful images in this small selection of oils and works on paper are "Head" (1939), a skull-like presence whose complex black-on-white linear markings seem a synthesis of African and American Indian art (Grace Glueck).

SAMUEL ROTHBORT, "Direct Carver," Hollis Taggart, 48 East 73rd Street, (212) 628-4000, through Oct. 25. Rothbort (1882-1971) was a Russian immigrant and self-taught modernist who made colorful, Ashcan-style paintings and sculptures carved from found pieces of wood and stone. Animals, self-portraits, mothers and children, and other motifs are realized with appealing rough immediacy. Some have Brancusian simplicity; some are surrealistic and some look like backwoods folk art (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

"AMERICAN EXPRESSIONISM: ART AND SOCIAL CHANGE, 1920'S-1950'S," Kennedy, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 541-9600, through Nov. 1. A group show of artists pegged by the show's curator, the art and cultural historian Bram Dijkstra, to the hopes, desires and economic troubles of the working classes in the Depression and afterward. The show's concept has been stretched to a one-size-fits-all cover for an improbable mix of artists whose styles run from the injustice imagery of Charles White and Harry Sternberg to the poetic modernism of Marsden Hartley and John Marin. Top-flight artists have been lumped with those who at best were mere illustrators. Yet nostalgia buffs who remember the socially concerned art of the 1930's and 40's will get a charge from some wonderful relics (Glueck).

MARILYN BRIDGES, Throckmorton, 145 East 57th Street, (212) 223-1059, through Nov. 1. Ms. Bridges's subject is monumental art and architecture seen from an extraterrestrial perspective. Through aerial photography, she uses distance, angle of vision and natural light to clarify the form, scale and sometimes the possible meaning of ancient sites. A pyramid at Giza seen from sky is dwarfed by its huge shadow. Borobudur in Java becomes a colossal mandala. Most fascinating are so-called Nazca line drawings in Peru, with gigantic images formed from narrow troughs incised in the earth (Cotter).

"THE 1940'S: MODERN AMERICAN ART AND DESIGN," Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through Nov. 1. Set up like the living room of a sharp-eyed collector of Modernist antiques, this exhibition gathers paintings by Mark Rothko and Dorothea Tanning; sculpture by Alexander Calder and Jose de Rivera; furniture by Charles and Ray Eames and Frank Lloyd Wright; and much more. In another room, Charmion von Wiegand's colorful, abstract gouache paintings, titled "Improvisations: 1945," are lightweight but infectiously playful. (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

FRED EERDEKENS, Spencer Brownstone, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through Oct. 25. In the darkened gallery, a spotlight shines on clumps of puffy cotton hanging from the ceiling, casting a shadow picture of a dramatic partly cloudy sky. Out of it emerges, like a divine revelation, the phrase "Neo-Deo." It's a neat, funny and mysterious trick (Johnson).

PHILIP GUSTON, BRUCE NAUMAN, RAYMOND PETTIBON, Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338, through Dec. 21. Converging from three directions -- Abstract Expressionism, Process Art and California Pop -- three artists arrive at a zone of mordant existentialism. Consisting almost entirely of black-and-white prints, the exhibition sets up an absorbing, triangular conversation by Guston's studio nightmares, Mr. Nauman's harsh wordplay and Mr. Pettibon's mix of hare-brained erudition and comic book illustration (Johnson).

ALEX KATZ, "Cartoons," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Nov. 15. "Cartoons" in this case refers to an old master technique for transferring images to canvas, wall or panel. Mr. Katz's elegant charcoal drawings of trim, good-looking people on large sheets of brown paper are richly atmospheric, in part because of the burnt sienna pigment he dusts over the fine perforations that follow the drawing's contours. Seeping through the pin pricks, the brown dust creates a ghost of the drawing on the underlying canvas for the painter (Johnson).

RYAN McGINNESS, "Worlds Within Worlds," Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, through Nov. 1. A slick and inventive designer, Mr. McGinness has developed an expansive vocabulary of eccentric, vaguely familiar symbols drawn from art historical and modern vernacular sources. He layers his babble of signs in glossy paintings that call to mind Lari Pittman, and he applies gridded fields of signs to skateboards and boutique clothing. As vinyl stickers, his emblems punctuate a walk-in maze of mirrored walls (Johnson).

SAVA SEKULIC, Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200, through Oct. 25. A self-taught, Croatian-born Serb, Sekulic (1902-1989) had a life of deprivation and hardship, yet his deceptively simple paintings and drawings exude a sweet, mysterious humor and off-beat eroticism. Totemlike amalgams of animals and weirdly transformed humans feel like fragmentary views of a whole imaginary world. The inexplicable painting of a brown piglike animal riding a red bird is a hoot (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JANINE ANTONI, "To Draw a Line," Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through Oct. 25. Ms. Antoni's portentous installation consists of two giant industrial spools with a thick rope of blond human hair stretched between them; on the floor is a big pile of raw hair into which the artist fell during a preopening, tightrope performance. If Ms. Antoni were making fun of artistic narcissism, it would be amusing, but she seems to be in earnest (Johnson).

INGRID CALAME, James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Nov. 1. Ms. Calame's splashy, colorful abstract paintings arise from a meticulous process. She traces random stains on city sidewalks and streets and then transfers these found forms onto aluminum panels. Painting them, in layers, in glossy enamels, she produces an absorbing congestion. Marks on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange were the basis for a wrap-around mural of green paint on Mylar, which would best be called an interesting experiment (Johnson).

RICK PROL, "The Metamorphosis," Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Oct. 31. A veteran of the early 80's East Village scene, Mr. Prol presents a series of big, expressionistic cartoon paintings of a lone man in a black suit having a manic fit of some sort. The paintings have heavily built-up, intensely colored surfaces, but the compositions are more static than you would expect, given the state of their zany subject. Don't miss the funky, bigger than life sculpture of a green monster -- part cat, part octopus -- frantically riding a bicycle (Johnson).

* JASON RHOADES, "Meccatuna," David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, through Oct. 25. The most memorable show in a while by this excessive slacker bricolagist and techno-installation provocateur. It includes one million Lego pieces; five enlarged casts of a petrified camel toe bone found in Florida, which Mr. Rhoades purchased on eBay; 48 cans of Geisha tuna from Saudi Arabia, and encircling the upper reaches of the walls, like calligraphy in Islamic architecture, colored neon signs bearing euphemisms for vagina. Sex and religion, crudely blended, make an incendiary cocktail, which Mr. Rhoades cheerfully serves up as festive comic spectacle, as if begging for a fight, while suggesting a purely aesthetic motif in the formal comparison of the Minimalist Kaaba to Minimalist sculpture, both as objects of reverence. The results are anything but minimal (Kimmelman).

* RICHARD SERRA, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Oct. 25. In his latest show under the Gagosian Big Top, Mr. Serra adds some extra curves and corners, subtly but markedly shifting the tone and meaning of his work. With their flattened S-curve surfaces, the five towering elements of "Wake," the show's magnificent centerpiece, fuse the industrial and the organic, conjuring both ships' hulls and undulating seaweed. The gentle weightlessness of this work is countered by the spatial effect of "Blindspot," a spiral ellipse whose angled planes proceed in disorienting fits and starts (Smith).

ARPITA SINGH, Bose Pacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Nov. 1. The psychological and the political merge in paintings by the New Delhi artist Arpita Singh. So do everyday life and allegory, Expressionism and ornament, historical sources from Bengali folk painting to Marc Chagall and a formal approach that is at once gauche and poised. Many pictures focus on the figure of a middle-age, worn-looking, often nude woman who may and may not be the artist. She occupies a dreamlike world of free-floating numbers and untethered objects: teapots, fetuses, knives, bright pink flowers. Toy-size warplanes fly like sharks through the air; a lotus serves as her pillow; men in dark suits stare or weep (Cotter).

"ARTAPPARATUS," Bryce Wolkowitz, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 243-8830 (through Nov. 1). This show presents four artists who make art in the form of machines and who also share an interest in looking and seeing. Alan Rath's funny, robotic machines seem to have human or animal consciousness; Jim Campbell uses L.E.D. (light-emitting diode) grids to create minimally illusionistic, curiously moody moving images; John F. Simon Jr. produces visually mesmerizing programs for laptop screens; and the electronic arts pioneer Steina presents a 1976 sculpture in which rotating video cameras and a mirror ball produce intriguing paradoxes of seeing and being in space (Johnson).

Other Galleries

* "EVERYTHING MATTERS: PAUL KOS, A RETROSPECTIVE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 6. Mr. Kos's name rings too few bells here. He helped germinate the Bay Area Conceptual movement that pioneered video, performance and installation art in the late 1960's and early 70's. The spirit of his work is lighthearted and sly. One of his best early videos, from 1974, was shot in Wyoming: "Pilot Butte/Pilot Light" switches back and forth between that butte and Mr. Kos fashioning a lens out of a block of ice (you see him spinning the block on the inside of the lid of a pot to get the proper curvature), then focusing sunlight through the ice to spark kindling. The constant is Mr. Kos's catholic approach to materials. He balances a candle and a bell on the tip of a broomstick, which he discovered one day would stand up on its own if he jammed the business end of the broom against the floor just right. Better late than never to remind New Yorkers that some of what we take to be fresh or our own discovery in art has been going on for a long time elsewhere (Kimmelman).

"FILM REVIVAL," Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317, through Nov. 10. Four artists draw on marginal elements of film to make semiabstract paintings, works on paper and sculpture. Todd Brandt creates optically arresting fields composed of hundreds of 35-millimeter film canisters; Stefana McClure produces Minimalist rectangles by layering the foreign language subtitles of films by famous auteurs; Jesse Amado turns words from movie scripts into compacted typographic sculptures; and Carter Potter makes film and painting hybrids by wrapping 70-millimeter film stock around wooden stretchers (Johnson).

* NASREEN MOHAMEDI, Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, Mnahattan, (212) 673-3096, through Oct. 25. Mohamedi (1937-1990) was born in Pakistan, spent time in London and Paris, and taught art in Baroda, India. She is best known for linear drawings that suggest perspectival Agnes Martins floating in fourth dimension. This show presents her photographs from the 1960's and 70's. Abstracted images of places and things -- Islamic architecture; painted directional markings on Japanese streets; ocean swells after a storm -- have clear connections to her drawings and reflect an artist who broke with essentialist ideas of what Indian art should look like, engaged with the advanced international art of her day, and left a deeply personal body of work (Cotter).

FRANK MOORE, Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337 (through Oct. 25). Moore, who died last year at 48, was not a painter's painter. His pictures are topical, discursive, busy, crafty, witty and, in the best sense of the word, illustrative. They dealt with a predictable menu of liberal issues -- race, gender, AIDS, the environment -- but with unpredictably imaginative and generously humorous verve. This exhibition includes late works and a fine selection of paintings from the last 14 years (Johnson).

Last Chance

ADAM DANT, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338, through tomorrow. This idiosyncratic English artist blends elements of comic books, illustration and graphic design into the fictive Bureau for the Investigation of Subliminal Imagery. It is a form of art-about-art that, loosed upon the museums of Europe, deepens into an examination of the complex process of visual perception (Smith).

PATRICIA TOBACCO FORRESTER, A.V.C. Contemporary Arts, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-1122, through tomorrow. Nature reaches out to Ms. Forrester, and vice versa, begetting these lush, dense watercolors of flowers, plants and trees. Alive with intense color and Expressionistic shapes, they are painted from life in mostly exotic locations, but through the interpretive lens of the artist's emotions. A large triptych, "Beech/Birch," crawls with densely tangled forest growth partly reflected in water; several vertical panels of floral effusions in stirring color, like "Waterlily Slice," bring complex interplays of leaves and blossoms close to the viewer's face (Glueck).

"THE GREENWICH VISIONARY: WORK FROM THE ESTATE OF BRUNO DEL FAVERO," Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3768, through tomorrow. A mason turned landscape gardener who lived most of his life in Greenwich, Conn., Del Favero (1910-1995) took to painting in his old age without any formal training. (He is not, for example, great on perspective.) Outsiderish things tend to happen in his painterly visions, like a river teeming with huge fish that appear to be swallowing it up; a snake hovering in the air of an animal-haunted cityscape, coiled in the middle of what seems to be a flame. His painterly visions appear to be stirred by a wistful yearning for adventure, physical and spiritual. A soul shines through the awkwardness of his work (Glueck).

* LYLE ASHTON HARRIS, "Memoirs of Hadrian," CRG, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766, through tomorrow. The large-format photographs in this New York artist's first local show since 1996 were inspired by Marguerite Yourcenar's fictional autobiography of the aging Roman emperor. At the heart of the story is the figure of Antinous, Hadrian's young lover, who drowned and was posthumously deified by imperial order. Their relationship is described in the book as a power struggle, with the emperor fixated on his lover's physical beauty and un-Roman exoticism. The focus of Mr. Harris's pictures is a young black boxer, played by the artist, an object of intense public fascination, but one routinely cast in racist terms of hero, villain and victim (Cotter).

"INTERNAL EXCESS," the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through tomorrow. Highlights of the center's latest selection of emerging artists include Arthur Aghajanian's sly charts analyzing familial relations; Mie Yim's pastel pictures of stuffed bears and bunnies in anxiety-fraught situations; Lamar Peterson's coolly surrealistic cartoon images of middle-class blacks; Douglas Florian's idiosyncratic abstractions painted on paper bags; Christine Hiebert's elegantly airy mural made of blue tape; and Astrid Bowlby's bewilderingly complex accumulation of cutout cartoon fragments (Johnson).

JULIAN LETHBRIDGE, Paula Cooper, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, through tomorrow. Mr. Lethbridge paints with a rough immediacy that calls to mind Terry Winters and harks back to the all-over gesturalism of Pollock and de Kooning. In grays or two-color palettes, he creates busy fields of short straight lines, which seem to circulate in response to invisible electromagnetic currents over more broadly and loosely painted lower layers. The paintings have frontal authority; what they want is more adventurous unpredictability (Johnson).

* MARILYN MINTER, Fredericks Freiser, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, through tomorrow. One of several artists of the 1980's whose work links the often-disparaged Photo Realism of the 1960's and 70's with the style's current stampede, Ms. Minter continues to cultivate multiple ambiguities in lush, close-up images (both paintings and photographs) of heavily made-up mouths and eyes. Sweat, acne and peach-fuzz add unexpected twists, confusing not only sex but also age, and sharpening these examinations of artifice and desire with the suggestion of vulnerability and threat (Smith).

LOTHAR OSTERBURG, "At the Edge of the Real," Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500, through tomorrow. Conjuring monumental phenomena with minimal means, Mr. Osterburg presents picturesque photogravures of events like a zeppelin over Timbuktu or a landing craft's approach to a celestial body. But the settings and props are all contrived in his studio using mundane materials like twigs, toothpicks, peanut butter and wee electrical parts. Photographed through a magnifying glass or a macro lens, his pictures are given a romantic, retro look through photogravure. Blowing up small objects and settings to make large-scale photographs is nothing new, but Mr. Osterburg's skill in constructing his scenes and suffusing them with nostalgia is quite special (Glueck).

"PULP ART: VAMPS, VILLAINS AND VICTORS FROM THE ROBERT LESSER COLLECTION," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Sunday. This murky exhibition showcases the small, gaudy, largely unappreciated paintings commissioned for the covers of the pulp magazines that ruled the newsstands between the wars. While ultimately a bit repetitious, their overheated depictions of sharp-jawed heroes, compromised heroines and various human and nonhuman villains highlight talents like George Rozen and Paul R. Frank. They also give vent to the dark, violent, libidinous underbelly of the American psyche, to the same degree that Norman Rockwell's paintings bless its wholesome, repressed, preternaturally sunny side. The show is essential viewing for anyone interested in popular culture past or present. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Jobless Rate Is Up, But So Is Job Creation 

BYLINE:  By Janny Scott (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
 The unemployment rate for New York City jumped to 8.8 from 8.1 percent in September, according to monthly figures released yesterday by the state's Department of Labor. But the city also gained about 12,300 government and private-sector jobs, prompting economists to trace the jump in the joblessness rate to a surge in the number of New Yorkers actively looking for work. 
William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, said the city's one-month job gain was the largest since September 2000. Statewide, the unemployment rate rose to 6.4, from 6.2 percent in August. Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate firm, said the securities, banking, employment services and film industries added jobs. There were job losses in insurance, computer and data services, and retail trade. Janny Scott (NYT)

HEADLINE: The Sweet Spot 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"What we have here is a form of looting." So says George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate in economics, of the Bush administration's budget policies -- and he's right. With startling speed, we've blown right through the usual concerns about budget deficits -- about their effects on interest rates and economic growth -- and into a range where the very solvency of the federal government is at stake. Almost every expert not on the administration's payroll now sees budget deficits equal to about a quarter of government spending for the next decade, and getting worse after that. 
 Yet the administration insists that there's no problem, that economic growth will solve everything painlessly. And that puts those who want to stop the looting -- which should include anyone who wants this country to avoid a Latin-American-style fiscal crisis, somewhere down the road -- in a difficult position. Faced with a what-me-worry president, how do you avoid sounding like a dour party pooper? 
 One answer is to explain that the administration's tax cuts are, in a fundamental sense, phony, because the government is simply borrowing to make up for the loss of revenue. In 2004, the typical family will pay about $700 less in taxes than it would have without the Bush tax cuts -- but meanwhile, the government will run up about $1,500 in debt on that family's behalf.
George W. Bush is like a man who tells you that he's bought you a fancy new TV set for Christmas, but neglects to tell you that he charged it to your credit card, and that while he was at it he also used the card to buy some stuff for himself. Eventually, the bill will come due -- and it will be your problem, not his.
Still, those who want to restore fiscal sanity probably need to frame their proposals in a way that neutralizes some of the administration's demagoguery. In particular, they probably shouldn't propose a rollback of all of the Bush tax cuts.
Here's why: while the central thrust of both the 2001 and the 2003 tax cuts was to cut taxes on the wealthy, the bills also included provisions that provided fairly large tax cuts to some -- but only some -- middle-income families. Chief among these were child tax credits and a "cutout" that reduced the tax rate on some income to 10 percent from 15 percent. 
These middle-class tax cuts were designed to create a "sweet spot" that would allow the administration to point to "typical" families that received big tax cuts. If a middle-income family had two or more children 17 or younger, and an income just high enough to take full advantage of the provisions, it did get a significant tax cut. And such families played a big role in selling the overall package.
So if a Democratic candidate proposes a total rollback of the Bush tax cuts, he'll be offering an easy target: administration spokespeople will be able to provide reporters with carefully chosen examples of middle-income families who would lose $1,500 or $2,000 a year from tax-cut repeal. By leaving the child tax credits and the cutout in place while proposing to repeal the rest, contenders will recapture most of the revenue lost because of the tax cuts, while making the job of the administration propagandists that much harder.
Purists will raise two objections. The first is that an incomplete rollback of the Bush tax cuts won't be enough to restore long-run solvency. In fact, even a full rollback wouldn't be enough. According to my rough calculations, keeping the child credits and the cutout while rolling back the rest would close only about half the fiscal gap. But it would be a lot better than current policy.
The other objection is that the tricks used to sell the Bush tax cuts have made an already messy tax system, full of special breaks for particular classes of taxpayers, even messier. Shouldn't we favor a reform that cleans it up?
In principle, the answer is yes. But an ambitious reform plan would be demagogued and portrayed as a tax increase for the middle class. My guess is that we should propose a selective rollback as the first step, with broader reform to follow.
Will someone be able to find the political sweet spot, the combination of fiscal responsibility and electoral smarts that brings the looting to an end? The future of the nation depends on the answer.

HEADLINE: A German Banker on Welfare Among Miami's Palms 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Maybe it is the image of a former banker, deeply tanned and dipping his toes in the surf on a Miami beach, while people here trudge windswept streets in dismal burgs. Or maybe it is the notion of a housekeeper, paid for by the German government, to keep the fellow's apartment tidy.
 Whatever the reason, the curious case of Rolf John, 64, living in Miami on $2,200 a month in German welfare checks, has driven people here batty. 
 "He's laughing at all of us," declared Bild, the mass circulation tabloid that broke the story of the man it nicknamed "Florida Rolf." Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has condemned the case as "a really horrible example of welfare abuse." 
When the German Parliament votes Friday on a sweeping package of tax cuts and welfare reforms, it is not a stretch to say it will be responding, at least in part, to the anger aroused by people like "Florida Rolf."
While his case is extreme -- and the German Health and Social Security Ministry has since said it will stop paying his benefits if he stays abroad -- it is not unusual. Stories of welfare recipients who own yachts and luxury cars are a staple of the German news media.
Mr. Schroder is expected to win Friday's vote after trying for months to persuade left-wing members of his coalition that Germany must finally take a scalpel to its welfare system, which can make being unemployed more lucrative than working.
As a symbol of the excesses, Mr. John played a role in spurring the debate.
"It's the perfect case for everybody to get upset about," said Josef Joffe, the editor of the weekly Die Zeit. "In a welfare state that was not collapsing under its load, you would just accept it and move on to the next case file. But we're living in another world in Germany today."
Mr. John is from the northern city of Osnabruck, but he has not lived there since 1979. When reached by telephone in Florida on Thursday, he sounded simply fed up with all the attention.
"They've written a lot of lies about me," he said. "I live a very simple life. I have a normal, one-bedroom, American-style apartment. When I moved here in the late 1980's, the rent was $450 a month."
Mr. John's apartment does not, according to German reporters who have visited it, command ocean views. But as a reporter for The New York Times found when trying to visit on Thursday, it is in a middle-class, gated complex with private security guards and located just 200 yards from the beach.
Mr. John said he decided to move to Miami after his marriage fell apart in Germany in the late 1970's. He said he worked for a few years as a banker in Florida, but lost all his money because of onerous divorce payments and the failed business venture of a close relative.
Later, he said, he became ill with diabetes and pancreatitis. After being turned away by a welfare agency in the United States, he filed for welfare benefits from the German government.
Germany has only loosely regulated the welfare benefits it extends to German citizens abroad. Mr. John's package includes $1,023 a month for rent, an $854 living allowance and $170 to pay for a housekeeper, since Mr. John is considered disabled.
When German authorities tried to cut back his housing allowance to $702, Mr. John's lawyer persuaded a court in Lower Saxony that he would fall into a depression if he were forced to leave his apartment and circle of friends in North Miami. 
Mr. John is similarly unmoved by outrage over the housekeeper. "I have a cleaning woman, sure," he said. "But I'm 90 percent disabled." Mr. John said he needs the housekeeper to clean his apartment, do his laundry and drive him to doctors' appointments, and he referred further questions to lawyers in Frankfurt and Miami, neither of whom would discuss the case. 
After Mr. John's case was publicized, the Health and Social Security Ministry researched other cases of Germans living abroad on welfare. They discovered that 1,055 people in more than 80 countries are claiming benefits at an annual cost to Germany of roughly $6.4 million. 
In September, Ulla Schmidt, Germany's health and social security minister, said the government would tighten the regulations allowing welfare benefits to German expatriates. Under the new rules, the only people to receive benefits will be Germans who are receiving long-term medical treatment outside the country or who are in foreign jails.
"There won't be any more welfare under palm trees," Ms. Schmidt told German reporters in a comment that made widespread headlines in following days.
Mr. John said he had written a letter of protest to Chancellor Schroder. In the meantime, he said he has no intention of pulling up stakes from Miami. 
"I've lived here for 25 years," Mr. John said in softly-accented English. "I have a lot of friends here. My homeland is the United States."

HEADLINE: Stressing U.S. Right to Attack Foes, Bush Leaves for Asia 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SAN BERNARDINO, Calif., Oct. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush embarked on his longest trip to Asia on Thursday by reasserting America's right to take pre-emptive action against its enemies, and with a warning that the world cannot allow Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, to be "defined" by Islamic extremists.
 Mr. Bush's comments, in a speech here just a few hours before he departed for Japan and in comments to Asian and Australian reporters that were released by the White House, marked an assertive declaration of what he called "a new American strategy" as he headed to several countries where anti-American sentiment runs high. He told the reporters that part of his aim during the trip would be "to make sure that the people who are suspicious of our country understand our motives are pure." 
 Mr. Bush rarely talks so directly about his pre-emption strategy, unveiled 13 months ago in a national security strategy that has come to define a major turn in America's approach to the world. His comments here were notable both for their timing, as he urged Asian nations to enter a new phase of a campaign against terrorism, and for the setting -- he delivered them on a stage alongside Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose "Terminator" movies came to define an image of America around the world that is more vivid than most White House policy papers.
"America is following a new strategy," he said. "We are not waiting for further attacks. We are striking our enemies before they can strike us again."
Among those enemies, he made clear in the interview, are the militant Islamic groups in Indonesia and the Philippines that have been closely linked to Al Qaeda. He said he would use his three-hour visit next week to Indonesia, where he is to land on Bali, the country's primarily Hindu tourist resort, "to make it clear to the world that, by far, the vast majority of Muslims in that country value democracy and want to have a peaceful life."
"At the same time, it's very important not to allow a few killers to define Indonesia," he said, adding that he would tell President Megawati Sukarnoputri that "there needs to be a focused, concerted effort to bring people to justice."
That could be a particularly difficult message for Ms. Megawati, who is constantly balancing her commitment to fight terrorism with pressure from a significant minority in the country that wants to see it transformed into an Islamic state.
Some Asian diplomats have expressed concern in recent days that Mr. Bush's affinity for direct language and his determination to turn an economic policy meeting in Thailand into a forum on security issues could backfire, highlighting the president's public image in the region as a leader who is intent on expanding American influence, by military means if necessary.
"The way he chooses his words about North Korea, about Indonesia, will be very important because it will be amplified this week," said one senior Southeast Asian diplomat involved in helping plan the trip, which includes a speech on Saturday to the Philippine Congress. "We've been trying to make that clear to the White House."
In California, though, Mr. Bush gave no indication of moderating his tone, declaring that America was still at war, and "wars are won on the offensive."
Mr. Bush's speech on Thursday was described by the White House as a policy address, but much of it was identical to recent speeches he has given at Republican fund-raising events, including two here on Wednesday that raised $1.8 million for his campaign.

HEADLINE: Bush and Schwarzenegger Bond in Low-Key Reunion 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SAN BERNARDINO, Calif., Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Perhaps the Sacramento-Washington deep freeze has begun to thaw.
 After two and a half years in which requests for federal aid from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, have largely gone unanswered from the Republican administration in Washington, it seems that the soon-to-be governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has a friend in the White House. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger met President Bush for 45 minutes this morning as Mr. Bush stopped briefly in California on his way to Asia. According to accounts from both sides, little of substance was discussed. Instead, the meeting was the beginning of a bonding ritual between two leaders who may have a lot to offer each other in the months to come. 
Mr. Bush and Mr. Schwarzenegger said they used their time to renew a relationship that began more than 10 years ago, when Mr. Schwarzenegger served Mr. Bush's father as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.
"We did have a good visit, and during that visit I was able to reflect upon how much we have in common." Mr. Bush said at the start of a speech on terrorism and the economy to a business group in San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles. "We both married well. Some accuse us both of not being able to speak the language. We both have big biceps. Well, two out of three isn't bad."
The president added: "Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be a fine and strong leader for California. I'm proud to call him friend."
Mr. Schwarzenegger, introducing the president, said: "After speaking to the president this morning at great length about the problems of California, I can tell you one thing: There is no greater ally that this Golden State has in Washington than our president."
The meeting appeared choreographed so that Mr. Schwarzenegger, the most visible star in the political firmament, would not outshine the president.
Journalists were not allowed to photograph the one-on-one session, Mr. Schwarzenegger's introduction of the president was brief and low wattage, and the two men did not appear together to take questions from the throng of reporters. Mr. Bush left the convention hall immediately after speaking. Mr. Schwarzenegger appeared 45 minutes later for a 20-minute news conference.
A White House aide who sat in on part of the meeting said Mr. Bush and Mr. Schwarzenegger met one on one for 15 minutes and were then joined by a small group of advisers. The two also rode in the president's limousine from Riverside to San Bernardino, a 15-minute trip.
At their meeting in a hotel in Riverside, Mr. Schwarzenegger said to the president, "You were governor of a big state," and asked for general advice about the demands of the post. He did not relay the answer.
Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said the meeting was "an opportunity to discuss shared positions and their common approach to governing on issues like education and the economy."
The governor-elect, speaking to the news media later, said his goal was to create a basis for better relations between California and the federal government. He said, however, that he had not made any concrete proposals. That would come, he suggested, after he is sworn in as governor next month.
"I did not go and present the president with any kind of detailed kind of request, a laundry list of things," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "I thought at the first meeting it would be more beneficial if we started the meeting by building a relationship, building a foundation rather than jumping in there right away and asking about specific things."
He declined to criticize Mr. Davis for the chill between Sacramento and Washington that existed even before Mr. Bush took office.
"I cannot talk about what the past administration has done," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "I will make sure that we will from now on have a good relationship with the White House and a good relationship with the federal government."
Mr. Schwarzenegger said that he and Mr. Bush did not discuss politics and that the presidential campaign was not mentioned. Republican leaders in Washington and in California see Mr. Schwarzenegger's election and the 60 percent of Californians who voted for Republicans in the recall as a sign that the president could possibly carry California next year. Six months ago, that would have seemed a pipe dream.
James L. Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, the Republican leader in the State Senate, said California suffered numerous "self-inflicted wounds" under Mr. Davis, in part because the governor had no friends in the White House or the Republican majority in Congress. That could all change with Mr. Schwarzenegger in Sacramento, Mr. Brulte suggested.
Mr. Schwarzenegger, too, expressed confidence after his meeting with Mr. Bush that Washington would be more helpful to California as it struggled to correct a serious budget imbalance.
"It was a good meeting," he said. "We had some laughs and all that."

HEADLINE: Mississippi Incumbent Surprises His G.O.P. Opponent 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Miss., Oct. 15 

 BODY:
With his money, national Republican connections, political savvy and personal charm, Haley Barbour looked to many people last winter like a sure bet to be elected governor of Mississippi this year.
That was especially true because the Democratic incumbent whom he was challenging had presided over the weakest state economy in years in a region where President Bush is particularly popular and at a time when anti-incumbent sentiment seems to be increasing.
But the handicappers underestimated Gov. Ronnie Musgrove. He raised nearly as much money as Mr. Barbour, conserved most of it for the last few weeks before the November election and proved to be a relentless campaigner. 
Now, although no polls have been published, the candidates and political experts agree that the race is extremely tight. On the surface, it seems to boil down to two questions.
The first is whether Mr. Barbour can persuade voters that Mr. Musgrove is at fault for the tens of thousands of jobs lost in the state in his term.
The second question is whether the governor, a career politician who has never lived outside the state, can convince voters that Mr. Barbour is unfit to hold high office in Mississippi, because he spent most of his adulthood as a lobbyist and Republican wheeler-dealer in Washington.
Just below the surface, an undercurrent of racial division is also driving the campaign, just as it does every statewide campaign here.
The questions of the sour economy and the differences in the candidates' careers recurred throughout a debate between them on Tuesday night at Delta State University here.
"Mississippi has gone backward in the last four years," Mr. Barbour proclaimed at the outset.
Mr. Musgrove declared that he had spent his life in Mississippi "as a public servant" trying to "improve our schools and create better jobs" while Mr. Barbour had been "up there being paid millions of dollars to represent interests that want to hurt Mississippi."
Mr. Musgrove, 47, cannot deny that the state has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs; that the unemployment rate, 6.3 percent in August, is the highest in years; or that the situation is grimmest in the Delta, the poorest region in the state.
So he relied on the tack that politicians from President Bush down take when the economy is weak on their watch. He pointed to some bright spots, particularly the opening of a Nissan plant near Jackson, and said the situation would have been worse had he not been so vigilant in generating new jobs.
Mr. Musgrove passed the fault, in his case to Washington for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which led many manufacturers to leave Mississippi for cheaper labor in Mexico, and to Mr. Barbour in particular, for supporting the agreement.
Similarly, Mr. Barbour, 55, cannot change his resume. Over the last 20 years, he has been a political adviser in the Reagan White House, a two-term national Republican Party chairman, a strategist and prodigious fund-raiser for Republican candidates and a highly paid lobbyist for major corporations like cigarette makers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and communications companies.
So he emphasizes that in all his years in Washington, his family stayed in his hometown, Yazoo City; that his children, now grown, went to school there (private schools, not public schools like Mr. Musgrove's son and daughter, who are in high school); and that he came back home almost every weekend.
In an interview after the debate, he argued that his connections could be used to benefit Mississippians. Noting that the state receives 37 percent of its budget from Washington, he said, "Having a governor who knows how to work the federal government will be valuable to Mississippi."
Mr. Barbour has made the most of those connections. Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, as well as several cabinet members, have come here to campaign and raise money for their friend.
In Washington circles, no one can remember a back-room insider like Mr. Barbour running successfully for high office. But he is the rare operative who enjoys the gladhanding of politics as much as the behind-the-scenes maneuvering. 
Mr. Barbour raised a pile of money, $7.6 million as of Sept. 30, more than twice the sum any previous candidate for governor ever raised in Mississippi. Mr. Musgrove raised $5.2 million. 
Although Mr. Barbour, who began television commercials in February, had $977,000 left in his accounts, Mr. Musgrove squirreled away his money and had $3.4 million remaining for the last five weeks of the campaign. That disparity can be explained by the fact that Mr. Barbour had already paid for all his television time through Election Day, and Mr. Musgrove had not. But in terms of money, the governor is clearly competitive.
Mr. Musgrove is a tireless campaigner who regularly stumps from before dawn till nearly midnight. His exhausted staff members say the governor needs but three or four hours of sleep a night.
Usually in Mississippi, close races are decided by the relative sizes of the black and white turnouts. About one-third of the voting-age population in the state is African-American, the largest proportion of any state, and almost all who go to the polls vote Democratic. A large percentage of white Mississippians vote Republican in statewide races. The rule of thumb, political strategists in the state say, is that Democrats need 20 percent to 30 percent of the white vote to win, depending on the turnout sizes. In 1999, Mr. Musgrove narrowly defeated his Republican opponent, Mike Parker, 49.6 percent to 48.5 percent, and the black turnout was the largest in state history for a governor's race. The governor says he is doing everything in his power to achieve that turnout this year.
Mr. Barber seems to be taking subtle steps to encourage a strong white turnout. He wears a lapel pin bearing the United States and Mississippi flags. The state flag features the Confederate battle emblem and is a sore subjects with most blacks. Last year, Mr. Musgrove supported a proposal in a statewide referendum to adopt a new design for the flag. It lost, two to one. 
In the debate, Mr. Barbour raised an issue that had not come up much, advocating requiring voters to prove their identities at the polls, to prevent election fraud. Many blacks say the identity requirement reminds them of white authorities' intimidation in the days of segregation. Despite Mr. Barbour's repeated mentions of the topic on Tuesday, Mr. Musgrove ignored it. His campaign manager, Lisa McMurray, said he opposed voter identification.
There is some evidence that African-Americans are less enthusiastic now about Mr. Musgrove than they were in 1999.
Representative Bennie Thompson, the most prominent black elected official in the state, said he was lukewarm about the governor and sensed that his constituents felt the same way.
"He has a long way to go to get the excitement back to where it was four years ago," Mr. Thompson said.
In an interview, Mr. Musgrove said there were some bad feelings between him and Mr. Thompson because of "policy differences" over the years.
Joseph B. Parker, a political scientist at the University of Southern Mississippi, said Mr. Thompson's coolness was a bad sign for the governor. 
 "Bennie Thompson," Mr. Parker said, "probably saved Musgrove's bacon last time."

HEADLINE: Dean Says Economic Priorities Are Jobs and a Tax Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, on Thursday put forward the broad strokes of an economic plan, including $100 billion to create jobs, the elimination of $100 billion in tax loopholes and the creation of a small-business loan fund.
 Dr. Dean, a Democratic presidential candidate, spelled out his proposals in a Georgetown University auditorium where Bill Clinton made several major policy speeches in his first national campaign. 
 The staple of the plan was a two-year, $100 billion Fund to Restore America that would give states and municipalities grants to create jobs in domestic security, infrastructure, education and health care. 
But beyond the jobs fund, the economic speech was often short on specifics. 
As he does every day on the road, Dr. Dean vowed to balance the federal budget but failed to say by when. He said he would restore the Clinton administration's performance review system to root out government inefficiencies but named no fat bureaucracies ripe for the knife.
As for the small-business loan program, he said only that it would be modeled on mortgage financing. He planned to flesh out the details this weekend.
Dr. Dean also promised to "set about making the tax system fairer and simpler" and shift more of the tax burden from individuals to corporations, as well as crack down on tax shelters for corporations that move their headquarters overseas to avoid taxation. 
Dr. Dean denounced the Bush administration as practicing what he called "Enron economics," a reference to the failed energy trading company. As he has in the past he called for repealing all of President Bush's tax cuts.
"The tax cuts weren't written for the majority of America," Dr. Dean told the crowd of about 500 students in Gaston Hall. "These tax cuts, like Enron's finances," he said, "are a scheme to make the rich richer, to starve Social Security and Medicare, and to put our nation's financial strength at risk by creating the largest debt in American history."
Dr. Dean's call for a $100 billion jobs fund was similar to a program proposed a few weeks ago by Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army officer also seeking the nomination.
Besides the new job-growth fund, Dr. Dean said he wanted to push for deficit reduction by encouraging the return to the practice of finding savings or new revenues to offset any spending increases approved by Congress, and require a vote of 60 senators for any expansion of the national debt. 
Several of Dr. Dean's competitors jumped on him for his insistence that all of President Bush's tax cuts be repealed.
"He is right to note that this president is shifting the burden from wealth to work," Senator John Edwards of North Carolina said in a statement. "Unfortunately, instead of addressing the problem, he makes it worse by raising taxes on the middle class."
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said, "Howard Dean wants to correct George Bush's mistake by penalizing the middle class, and that's wrong."
After the speech, Dr. Dean went across town to Asbury Methodist Church, where he picked up his first union endorsement, from Local 25 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union.At the same time, 12 trade unions agreed to join forces on Thursday to create a labor federation that will support the presidential campaign of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and focus on the issues of trade, jobs and health care.
The new federation, called the Alliance for Economic Justice, will represent about 3.5 million workers, including members of the Teamsters, United Steel Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers Union and Laborers' International Union. The AFL-CIO, opted not to endorse Mr. Gephardt -- or any other Democratic candidate -- earlier this month.

HEADLINE: Bush to Face Asian Fears of New U.S. Unilateralism 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
When President Bush arrives for the annual meeting of Asian and Pacific nations this weekend, he will be met by Asian leaders newly fearful that the United States is veering toward protectionism at home and losing sight of its role as leader of global trade.
 In this first major economic gathering since the breakdown of global trade talks in Cancun, Mexico, last month, Asian leaders will tell the United States that the developing world has not forgotten its desire to win more concessions to open the American and European markets for its agricultural products and textiles. 
 Above all, leaders of countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum will be looking for an American vision of world trade that is greater than its current focus on two-way and regional trade agreements.
"First, we will want to hear that the U.S. joins us in wanting to make the Doha round work," said Heng Chee Chan, Singapore's ambassador to the United States, referring to the current global trade talks known as the Doha round. "We want a strong statement promising to push the talks forward in December, when we meet again in Geneva," she added. 
For his part, Mr. Bush will be carrying a message to the meeting, in Bangkok, that security is at the heart of economic prosperity and that his war on terrorism must be at the forefront of the group's agenda. He will hold discussions with a number of countries on their contributions to the war in Iraq and to Afghanistan.
He will also address what he sees as imbalances in the trading world, notably asking China and Japan to let their currencies float freely in the open market.
The potential for misunderstanding is considerable.
In this, the fastest-growing trading region in the world, nearly every nation -- including India, China, Japan, the Southeast Asian countries and Australia -- is opening its borders to more trade with its regional partners, negotiating agreements with each other and throughout the area.
And while they are all too aware of the threats poised by terrorism, they are insistent that expanded markets and trade are essential to chip away at the roots of poverty.
Before leaving Washington, the President and his senior aides set out an agenda for the Asia-Pacific meeting that failed to erase some of these fears. To the Asian giants -- Japan and China -- Mr. Bush said this week that he would push them to let the markets determine exchange rates for their currencies, a goal heavily promoted by Republican and Democratic lawmakers who say that tens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs have been lost because of cheap Chinese imports.
His national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said that the trade agenda included individual discussions with Thailand, completing an agreement with Australia, regional talks to encourage Southeast Asian nations to further open their markets, and a commitment to continue global trade talks when the president thinks that countries "are ready to be serious about moving forward."
"There's a lot going on in the region," Ms. Rice said at a White House briefing this week. "This fits nicely into the president's multitiered approach on trade."
To Charlene Barshefsky, the former United States trade representative who negotiated China's entry into the World Trade Organization for the Clinton administration, this agenda looks suspiciously like an attempt to use China as "an excuse for their own failed economic policies."
"China's currency isn't going to solve our economic problems," she said in an interview, "and telling people to go into their own corners and create their own trading blocs isn't going to help global trade."
Robert B. Zoellick, the current United States trade representative, met with Thai officials on Thursday to prepare for the talks and will travel to China once the Asia-Pacific meeting is over to continue discussions with Chinese officials on several trade issues.
Robert Kapp, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said that Mr. Bush should be given credit for attending this meeting, given the security concerns in the region, and that it should come as no surprise that the war on terrorism is at the top of his agenda.
But he also said that Asian leaders would be eager to see whether the United States adopts a unilateralist tone with them, expecting them to follow the American lead on a series of issues.
"If the administration takes the 'my way or the highway' approach, then I suspect the APEC nations won't take it very well," he said.
The winner in that case could be China. With its expanding markets and increased foreign investment, China is poised to eclipse the United States in economic influence in the region.
In a report issued by the World Bank, Asia was given high marks for its strong growth and for "increasing integration of the region, evident most strikingly in booming trade with China."
Cambodia, the newest nation to join the World Trade Organization and among its poorest members, is one of the countries that sees expanded trade as essential for its survival.
"We need to catch up very fast, with no time to waste," said Roland Eng, the Cambodian ambassador to the United States. "That means we need to build up trade and investment. And the trend now is that the market opening up is China." 
China and India are members of a new group of developing nations formed at the Cancun talks to win concessions from the United States, Europe and other wealthy nations to reduce their agricultural subsidies and open their markets to farm products from the developing world.
Both these countries have begun negotiations with the Association of Southeast Nations for a regional free trade agreement. And in the preliminary negotiations, China has already offered to open its market to some farm products.
Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development in Washington, said that the United States would have the opportunity at this weekend's meeting to show that it wants to help the developing world in global trade talks that would open rich markets for agriculture, or it could continue pursuing two-party trade talks with Asian countries. 
"The APEC summit," she said, "may consolidate a major shift in American policy away from taking leadership in the world stage of trade toward a new tactic of ticking off countries one by one in bilateral talks. The weak nations can only lose in those kind of negotiations."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE SENATE; 
Defying Bush, Senate Votes To Make Iraq Pay Back Loan

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The Senate defied the Bush administration on Thursday by insisting that Iraq repay up to $10 billion in reconstruction aid, even as a divided House took a different path and prepared to grant President Bush's $87 billion request for Iraq and Afghanistan without conditions.
 A bipartisan coalition of moderate senators, saying that American taxpayers should not bear the entire burden of rebuilding Iraq, prevailed against strong administration opposition in a 51-to-47 vote Thursday evening. Their amendment -- approved shortly after Vice President Dick Cheney failed to bring wavering senators in line through a round of phone calls -- would require half of the $20.3 billion in reconstruction aid to be a loan to Iraq, unless the administration persuaded other countries to forgive 90 percent of Iraq's existing debt. 
 If the $150 to $200 billion in foreign debt is forgiven -- which appears highly unlikely -- the full $20 billion in aid would be given to Iraq. The amendment was principally sponsored by Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana. It won the support of 8 Republicans, 42 Democrats and one Independent. 
"The American people are very generous," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a co-sponsor of the loan plan. "But the American taxpayer does deserve to be repaid eventually for some of our investment in this country. And Iraq deserves to be treated as a country that has the enormous economic potential that it clearly has."
For many senators, the administration's unyielding approach to postwar reconstruction could not be reconciled with the waves of opposition that their constituents have voiced in the five weeks since Mr. Bush announced his intention of spending $87 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan. At a time when record-high deficits have squeezed public-works projects at home, many senators said it was only fair to ask Iraq to contribute to its own rebuilding with its future oil revenues.
"All we're asking the Iraqi people to do is to take part of that $130 billion or $150 billion, whatever it will be that it adds up to, and share part of it with us, just share $10 billion with us," said Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia.
Sponsors of the amendment said that by linking the loan to a forgiveness of Iraq's foreign debt, they hoped to provide an incentive for the administration and other countries to reduce Iraq's burden of payments. The amendment essentially says that if other countries forgive Iraq's debt, the United States will forgive repayment of the $10 billion.
A similar amendment in the House, sponsored by Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, was ruled out of order by the Republican leadership. On a 200-to-226 vote, the House rejected an amendment by Representatives David R. Obey and Tom Lantos, Democrats of Wisconsin and California, that would make half the $20 billion a loan, with no conditions.
Administration officials and supporters, who say they hope the House can persuade the Senate to drop the loan plan in negotiations next week, argued that loans would be too burdensome for Iraq, and would make it hard to raise money at a donors conference in Madrid next week.
"They have inherited a country that was so ignored by Saddam Hussein, so devastated by his terrible plundering of the country for frankly military purposes, their ability to pay back debt is almost nonexistent for some time," said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma.
The debate about loans versus grants, however, could not obscure the administration's overall success in persuading both chambers to endorse the basic framework of its postwar Iraq policy. The president is virtually certain to command solid majorities in both houses for a vast majority of what he is asking for -- and a mandate for a strong role in overseeing Iraq's future.
By linking billions of dollars for the troops to Iraq's reconstruction, the administration forced lawmakers to either support a huge, unpopular spending bill or be branded missing in action in the war on terrorism.

HEADLINE: Clinton Officials Attack Bush on Environment 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
A group of Clinton administration officials, including former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Carol M. Browner, onetime E.P.A. administrator, have joined with environmental advocates to raise money for an election-year campaign critical of the Bush administration's environmental record in swing states.
 The four states that the group has decided to study first, for insight into the leading environmental issues of each, are Florida, New Mexico, New Hampshire and Oregon. In the 2000 election, the outcome in all four was extremely close -- Florida and New Hampshire tipped to George Bush, New Mexico and Oregon to Al Gore -- with Ralph Nader of the Green Party getting more votes in each than the margin of victory there. 
 But the campaign, called Environment 2004, is also looking at Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Iowa.
"We're a small, nimble organization," Ms. Browner said in an interview. "We want to focus our resources in the places where we can make a difference in the outcome of the election." 
Environment 2004 will buy commercial advertising, conduct voter education campaigns and schedule speakers in local communities.
While it is trying to raise $5 million from membership donations -- and seeks $1 million by the end of the year -- it currently has only $500,000 in pledges or actual contributions.
A memorandum that the Republican pollster Frank Luntz issued to his party before last year's elections warned, "The environment is probably the single issue on which Republicans in general -- and the president in particular -- are most vulnerable." 
Ms. Browner, who is now a principal at the Albright Group, a Washington-based global consulting firm, would not disagree.
"This is simply the worst environmental administration ever," she said, "and the American public needs to know this so they can make a choice in the upcoming election."
The environment is expected to be only an ancillary theme in 2004, however, with national security and the economy overshadowing all other issues. 
"Not every voter puts environment at the top of their list," Ms. Browner acknowledged. But she added, "There are certain voters -- especially among women and swing voters -- that this issue is an important issue, and it can certainly frame their opinion about the election."

HEADLINE: Class With the 'Ph.D. Diva' 

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Calif. 

 BODY:
Tricia Rose's imitation of a white girl acting like a black girl -- hand on hip, an exaggerated swivel of her neck -- sent cascades of laughter through the class. It was Ms. Rose's first lecture of the year in an introductory African-American studies course, and her departure from professorial decorum was welcome after nearly an hour of sober statistics about slavery and rapid-fire provocations about race.
 "What's the difference between minstrelsy and black behavior, black culture?" Ms. Rose asked the class of about 125, waving her hands as she paced, her dark curls shaking. The students were crammed into a careworn auditorium with high wooden beams and minimal lighting. You would have no idea that the setting in this city was a sunny, hilly campus, dotted with redwood trees. 
 Can you buy "Puerto Rican pants" or an African-American dress to be racially transformed? Professor Rose asked the students, who were mostly white. Is culture a set of practices or has it become so commodified that it can be acquired like clothing? Ms. Rose's performance was prompted by an article in The New York Times about a new television sitcom starring Whoopi Goldberg, in which a white female character adopts the mannerisms, speech and dress of a black woman steeped in hip-hop culture. 
But here in the flesh is Tricia Rose -- native New Yorker, prep school and Ivy League graduate, biracial child of working-class parents -- a woman who really knows hip-hop culture. Ms. Rose is widely recognized as the first person in the country to write her Ph.D. dissertation on hip-hop. (That was in 1993 at Brown University.)
Her dissertation morphed into a widely acclaimed first book, "Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America" (Wesleyan University Press, 1994). That year Ms. Rose was also co-editor of a book on youth music and culture. Her articles and lectures have earned her the moniker of rap's reigning "Ph.D. Diva"' as she holds forth on black culture, politics and sex in places as diverse as the Op-Ed page of The Times and Essence magazine. 
Ms. Rose moved to the University of California at Santa Cruz last year and in July was named chairwoman of its American Studies department, after teaching for nine years in the Africana Studies program at New York University.
This spring she published her second book, "Longing to Tell: Black Women Talk About Sexuality and Intimacy" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), the first compilation of black women's oral histories about all aspects of sexuality. It has been applauded by scholars like Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of African and African-American Studies at Harvard. Mr. Gates said black sensitivity to stereotypes of hyper-sexuality has too often meant silence on sexuality or excessive policing of it in popular culture and among scholars. 
Ms. Rose, 41, said her second book is not simply a departure from hip-hop but a continuation of her fascination with representations of black women and men. In the same way that "Black Noise" brought together the social criticism, history and aesthetics reflected in the music of the post civil rights generation, "Longing," has a bigger mission than publicizing women's sexual experiences: losing virginity, sexual abuse, love.
"This book began as an attempt to answer a scholarly question: how has the history of race, class and gender inequality in this country affected the way that black women talk about their sexual lives?" Ms. Rose wrote in the foreword.
She herself interviewed the 20 women featured, choosing them from a range of ages, classes and experiences. Using pseudonyms, they discuss how skin-color distinctions among blacks shaped their lives, as well as discrimination and sexual harassment by men of all colors.
The only general conclusion that Ms. Rose draws from the stories is that many of the issues the women discuss, like being considered "exotic," cannot be untangled from the larger context of economic and sexual exploitation of black women and men, sexism and sexual myths. 
"The stories we know help us see who we are," Ms. Rose said in her fast, urgent way, her gaze never drifting from behind metal-rimmed glasses. She was sitting over a mug of coffee in a funky, fashionable downtown restaurant. "If we don't take those stories seriously and understand them as part of our social and political formation, then we may be increasingly manipulated in ways we may not want to be."
From her perch, the stories are bleaker than ever. She still listens to a lot of hip-hop, a genre she deeply appreciates despite its warts and contradictions. But straying from the music's roots in alienation, the narratives and videos of today's best-selling commercial hip-hop are more misogynistic and more infected with brutal images of black masculinity, she said. The pimp is a recurring trope, reflecting black needs for power and control of women and white fantasies about black sexuality and violence. 
Hollywood is no better. She was particularly appalled and baffled by Queen Latifah's performance this year in "Bringing Down the House," in which she plays a convicted bank robber who utters lines like "Who dat?" and is a vulgar mess overall. Ms. Rose lauded Queen Latifah in "Black Noise" for her independence and talent.
Halle Berry and Denzel Washington won historic Oscars in 2002, but it was no coincidence, Ms. Rose said, that Ms. Berry played "a pathologically dependent dsyfunctional mother who's sexually excessive in many ways" and that Mr. Washington portrayed "a cracked-out renegade cop who's basically a gangster."
Ms. Rose concedes that some lovely representations seep through hip-hop, mentioning, for example, those of the singer and performing poet Jill Scott. Still, she is concerned about those images driven by a legacy of "scholarly, cultural and political representations around black sexual dysfunction, around violence, around deviance," she said. "So when we play those roles, it seems real." Because they feel authentic and familiar, they are reproduced over and over, even when black artists have some creative control, she added.
Ms. Rose said she believed that many rap artists had the talent to take on more positive and nuanced themes but that they feared that those images wouldn't be as popular. 
George Lipsitz, one of Ms. Rose's Ph.D. advisers, recently joined the American Studies faculty at Santa Cruz, largely because of his admiration for her. Mr. Lipsitz said he was intrigued by her ambitions to develop a graduate program called Comparative United States Studies and to create "research clusters" of students and faculty members to work on intellectual questions.
"She has an extraordinary ability to mix social criticism, social history and cultural criticism and an advanced study of aesthetics, and to see how they all fit together," Mr. Lipsitz said. "She understood that hip-hop was the most valuable archive of what happened to black youth in the 70's and 80's." 
Tricia Rose spent the first years of her life in Harlem, the child of a courageous marriage of a white legal secretary and a black bus driver. (They wed in the 1950's.) Her mother's white skin prompted curiosity, at the very least, and Ms. Rose recalls that she never met another biracial child until eighth grade, when she entered Dalton, the elite Manhattan prep school. There she was different because of class and race, with a two-hour commute each day from Co-op City in the Bronx. But she was also popular. 
While her time at Dalton and then as an undergraduate at Yale were intellectually stimulating, Ms. Rose said she was always aware of how complicated it was to be among the few blacks at such places. It helped that her parents made her and her older brother (also a college professor) feel emotionally secure and challenged them to excel and be independent. 
For now, Santa Cruz, with its temperate climate and slower pace, allows Ms. Rose and her husband of six years, Andre C. Willis, "to develop more of our inner lives," she said. They live downtown, among more than a few transplanted New Yorkers. Mr. Willis is completing a dissertation on the study of religion at Harvard and teaching at San Jose State University. 
Although Ms. Rose's latest work has focused on black women's sexuality, she finds that she is still frequently asked to talk about the music, the artists and the video images of hip-hop. And she takes satisfaction in that. After all, she remembers when some of her professors at Brown warned her that hip-hop was fleeting and certainly not intellectually serious. Now, she said, "it is the lingua franca for talking about race and popular culture."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 2, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on Oct. 22 about Tricia Rose, chairwoman of the department of American studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, misstated the precedent for Ph.D. dissertations on hip-hop. Ms. Rose's, written in 1993, was not the first. Several earlier ones included that of Cheryl L. Keyes, in 1991; she recently e-mailed The Times to point out the error.

HEADLINE: Home Construction Up 3.4% As Builders Work on Backlog 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The rate of home construction rose in September to its second-highest level since 1986 as Americans sought to lock in low mortgage rates and construction companies worked to fill a backlog of orders, a government report showed yesterday. 
 Builders started work on 1.888 million homes at an annual rate last month, up 3.4 percent from the revised 1.826 million started in August, the Commerce Department said. The September figure exceeded the median forecast of a 1.83 million annual rate in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. 
 "The housing economy continues to surprise everyone but the builders," said Joel H. Rassman, chief financial officer of Toll Brothers Inc., the largest builder of luxury homes in the United States. "There's a huge pent-up demand that has yet to be satisfied." 
Demand is increasing in part as Americans gain confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for October increased to 89.4 from 87.7 in September, beating the median forecast. Yesterday, economists at Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch raised their estimates for third-quarter growth to 6 percent, which would be the fastest growth in almost four years. 
Economists had forecast a reading of 88.2 for the consumer sentiment index, based on the median of 57 estimates in a survey. They also estimated that housing starts would rise from the previously reported 1.82 million in August.
Building permits, an indicator of future production, slipped 2.2 percent, to 1.86 million. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen less than a percentage point from a record low reached in June. 
Homebuilder optimism this month was the highest in almost four years, according to the National Association of Home Builders. The group's housing market index rose to 72 in October from 68 in September. 
Residential construction accounts for 5 percent of the value of goods and services produced in the United States and has been supporting economic expansion. 
Starts of single-family homes climbed 3.1 percent in September, to a rate of 1.52 million after a 1.47 million pace in August. Starts of apartment buildings and other multifamily homes rose 4.5 percent, to a 368,000 rate in September.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Decline Again on Disappointing Earnings News

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street extended its pullback yesterday after downbeat forecasts from companies like eBay prompted investor worries that the market had risen too far. The three main indexes finished mixed for the week.
 "The marketplace is a little too sanguine, and expectation levels might have to be tempered going forward," Stephen Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities, said. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69.93 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 9,721.79, for a three-day loss of 91 points.
Broader stock indicators also finished lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.75 points, or 1 percent, to 1,039.32, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 37.78 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,912.36.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.5 percent, the Nasdaq lost 0.2 percent, and the S.& P. edged up 0.1 percent.
Poor earnings reports from several companies late Thursday, including Sun Microsystems and DoubleClick, weighed down technology shares yesterday.
EBay reported a 69 percent surge in profits, but analysts said the period of rapid growth might be fading for the company, which conducts online auctions. Shares of eBay dropped $2.64, to $54.86.
"I think a lot of the expectations are already priced in the numbers," Neil Massa, an equity trader at John Hancock Funds, said. "Companies not only have to do better, they have to guide higher. But earnings over all have been fine, and the economic numbers point to a recovery."
Sun Microsystems fell 7 cents, to $3.56, in heavy trading on the Nasdaq after reporting a wider-than-expected loss. The company, a network computer maker, is struggling with weak demand and questions about its strategy.
DoubleClick, the online advertising company, plunged $2.98, to $9.26, after the company it gave an outlook for its fourth-quarter performance that missed Wall Street's estimates.
The American depository receipts of Royal Ahold, the Dutch-based global food retailer, dropped 50 cents, to $9.56, after the company offered a grim outlook, the first time it has discussed performance since a recent accounting scandal.
Gainers included Micron Technology, which rose 2 cents, to $12.85, despite a downgrade by a UBS analyst.
The disappointing corporate news outweighed several encouraging economic indicators. The Commerce Department reported that residential construction rose in September from August, climbing to the second-highest level so far this year.
The report reinforced hopes that a strong housing market, which is being fueled in part by low interest rates, is helping to drive the economy out of its doldrums.
A separate survey from the National Association of Home Builders found that builders were optimistic about sales prospects for October and for the next six months, yet another positive sign for the sector.
Also, the widely watched consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan was higher than analysts expectations, rising to 89.4 in mid-October from 87.7 in September. Economists had been expecting 88.2.
"We'll probably trade sideways for a while until earnings are out," Mr. Massa said. "I think we're looking at a very good year for the markets over all. It's all in the guidance going forward. Will companies be buying more? Will capital expenditures go up?" 
Treasury prices climbed yesterday as recent rises in rates enhanced the allure of government debt.
The 10-year Treasury note gained 18/32, to a price of 98 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.39 percent from 4.46 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed 22/32, to 101 24/32. The bond's yield dipped to 5.25 percent from 5.31 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: The Netherlands: Warning From Grocer 

BYLINE:  By Gregory Crouch (NYT)

 BODY:
 The Dutch grocer Royal Ahold warned investors that its 2003 results would suffer as a result of the $1.1 billion accounting scandal still plaguing the company. Ahold, which reported a 4.33 billion euro ($5 billion) net loss in 2002, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that accounting fees and legal costs would have a "significant impact" on 2003 results. 
The company added that competition in its home markets along with a worldwide economic malaise was cutting into sales, too. Some analysts speculate that Ahold will announce a sizable equity issue in the coming weeks as part of a drive to reduce debt. Ahold also said it had completed the sale of its Golden Gallon convenience store chain in the United States to the Pantry Inc. for $187 million. Gregory Crouch (NYT)

Samsung Posts Profit Rise And Exceeds Predictions

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL LEN and KEN BELSON

DATELINE: SEOUL, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Propelled by robust sales of memory chips and liquid crystal display screens, the Samsung Electronics Company reported a 6.6 percent rise in quarterly profit Friday compared with the year-ago period, beating market forecasts.
 Also, a Samsung executive said on Friday that the company might be close to a deal with another of the world's biggest electronics makers, the Sony Corporation, to co-produce next-generation flat-screen displays for televisions and computers. 
 The companies would each contribute 100 billion yen ($909 million) to the 50-50 venture, which would operate in South Korea and be run by a Samsung executive, according to a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun in Tokyo. The new factory would start operations by the end of 2004, the paper said. 
The venture, which could be arranged as early as next week, would give Sony access to one of the fastest- growing segments of the electronics business, where it has no production of its own. Samsung in turn could benefit from Sony's industry-leading television technology and its global brand and marketing network.
On Friday, Samsung reported a net profit for the third quarter of 1.84 trillion won ($1.57 billion), on sales of of 11.26 trillion won ($9.6 billion), a 15 percent rise from the period a year ago and a quarterly record for the company. Operating profit rose to 2.05 trillion won from 1.82 trillion won in the third quarter of 2002.
Samsung said that its fourth-quarter earnings would probably set a company record.
"The forecast for the fourth quarter is for continued recovery in the U.S. and global economies and for the industry," said Chu Woosik, vice president for investor relations at Samsung Electronics.
"We are very confident about the fourth quarter," he said. "Our dominant position in the market enables us to especially benefit from improvements in external conditions."
Samsung also said on Friday that it would revise upward its capital spending this year to more than 7 trillion won, almost $6 billion, including investment to increase production of semiconductor chips and liquid crystal displays. The company had originally earmarked 6.78 trillion won for capital spending.
Greatly aiding earnings, the average selling price of Samsung's dynamic random access memory chips, used in a range of electronics products, rose, and remained above $6 during the third quarter.
"At this point, it looks possible for chip prices to continue rising, at least until mid-November," said Chin Yeong Hoon, an analyst at Daishin Securities. "And there's the seasonal rise in demand for personal computers during the Christmas season." 
Sales are booming for Samsung's flash memory chips, used in the latest camera cellphones, MP3 players and other portable devices. Samsung, the industry's largest supplier of NAND flash-memory chips, has said demand is outstripping supply.
Samsung, ranked No. 3 after Nokia and Motorola in global sales of cellular phones, sold 15 million mobile handsets in the third quarter, a 25 percent rise from the April-to-June period. Samsung raised its cellphone sales goal for this year to 55 million units from an earlier projection of 52.5 million units.
Sales of liquid crystal display screens, viewed among the next wave of products propelling Samsung's growth, rose to 5.2 million units, up 19 percent from the previous quarter. 
"We are positively considering a tie-up with Sony," Mr. Chu of Samsung said. "This means that we can share both profits and burdens with Sony."
By pooling their resources, the companies will try to reduce the growing financial burden of producing larger liquid crystal displays. With prices for flat-panel displays falling by about 25 percent a year, manufacturers are having a hard time recouping their investments in new technology and bigger, more complex factories.
"Samsung's a leading L.C.D. panel maker and Sony is a great television company, so it's a great combination for them to work together," said Kazuharu Miura, a consumer electronics analyst at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo.
Still, Mr. Miura and others warned that the cost of building factories, coupled with the rapid decline in retail prices of flat-panel televisions and computer screens, has made it harder for companies to turn a profit even though sales are growing.
And prospects for flat-panel displays are bright. According to DisplaySearch, a research company based in Austin, Tex., shipments of L.C.D. monitors and L.C.D. personal computers jumped 44 percent in the second quarter compared with the period last year.
Samsung was the second-biggest producer of branded L.C.D. monitors, after Dell, and the largest producer of panels overseas, according to DisplaySearch.

HEADLINE: In a State Once His, Gephardt Labors Hard 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: MUSCATINE, Iowa, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
In 1988, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri roused this struggling industrial town on the Mississippi River with his tough talk on trade and went on to a victory in the Iowa caucuses that temporarily made him a top contender during his unsuccessful bid for the presidency that year. 
 This week, Mr. Gephardt returned with his sights set again on the White House and was welcomed with hearty handshakes and warm applause. But this time, his supporters admitted, they feel anxious about how he will fare. 
 Nowhere is the political challenge more important for Mr. Gephardt than in Iowa, the state that put his career on the national stage and propelled him to the leadership of the Democratic Party in the House. Then, as now, his aides believed he had to win here to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
But after spending months at the top of local polls, Mr. Gephardt is now running neck and neck with former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, and his future is hanging in the balance. After 26 years in Congress, Mr. Gephardt is fighting what may well be the final battle of his political career.
"I'm hoping that Gephardt has a good showing in Iowa, but I'm worried," said Betty McMahon, who is the co-chairwoman of the local Democratic Party and has supported Mr. Gephardt since 1987. "This one is going to be a battle. I think it's going to be darn close."
The state he has cultivated for more than a decade is a place he cannot afford to lose. It will either catapult him toward his party's nomination or toward retirement. (He says he will not run for re-election to the House of Representatives.) And as he darts across Iowa, from union halls to senior citizen centers, he is dogged by the inevitable question: Can he win again?
"I believe we're going to win here," Mr. Gephardt, 62, told cheering union supporters during a weekend swing through 10 cities. "I believe we're going to start the march to the White House right here!"
Mr. Gephardt still remembers the thrill of victory in 1988, the moment that brought him tantalizingly close to his dream of becoming president. But he shrugs away questions about history and the comparisons between then and now. "That was a long time ago," he likes to say.
Still, in this campaign, there is no escaping the echoes of the past.
During almost every trip to the state, Mr. Gephardt steps into union halls where he shouted his throat raw during the first campaign, and meets old acquaintances who wait patiently to shake the hand of the man they have supported for years.
Mr. Gephardt no longer stays in the spartan apartment that he and his family rented during the campaign summer of 1987. ("Stark, empty, just enough furniture to get by," recalls his daughter Chrissy Gephardt.) But he has kept the same campaign focus on jobs, trade and middle-class families and has reassembled much of his original campaign team.
Steve Murphy, who was his Iowa campaign director in 1988, is now his campaign manager. Bill Carrick, whomanaged the campaign in 1988, is now the media consultant. Ed Reilly, who served as the campaign pollster, is the campaign pollster again. And as in 1988, the strategy calls for an Iowa victory that propels Mr. Gephardt to a strong finish in New Hampshire and elsewhere.
Joe Trippi, Mr. Gephardt's deputy campaign manager in 1988, is now the strategy chief for Dr. Dean and he criticizes Mr. Gephardt for relying on what he describes as the same Iowa-dominated strategy the campaign pursued in 1988. 
Even so, Mr. Trippi says, it would be a grave mistake to take his former boss lightly.
Mr. Trippi pointed to Mr. Gephardt's penchant for working until his body gives out.
"I would never underestimate him," Mr. Trippi said, sizing up the challenge Mr. Gephardt poses to Dr. Dean. "They're both going to fight with everything they've got."
Mr. Gephardt is more seasoned now and has spent years mastering issues in the Congressional Democratic leadership, but many voters say they want a fresher face. And they say they also want a more pointed critic of the war in Iraq than Mr. Gephardt, who helped negotiate the Congressional resolution authorizing force and stood with President Bush in the Rose Garden last year in a ceremony dedicated to the resolution.
Still, Democrats in Iowa say Mr. Gephardt's call for universal health insurance, his opposition to trade deals with Mexico and China and his commitment to Medicare and Social Security still resonate in a state where 40 percent of Democratic caucus participants are elderly and a third come from union households.
But Dr. Dean has made inroads even in labor households, where Mr. Gephardt has traditionally had strong backing.
Mr. Gephardt's supporters say Dr. Dean has outspent the Gephardt campaign and visited Iowa more often than any other candidate, running the first television advertisements of the political season and leaving small towns awash in Dean posters and T-shirts. Meanwhile, Mr. Gephardt has had to work harder than expected to raise money and garner union support.
Dr. Dean has made such inroads that Mr. Gephardt's union supporters addressed the issue at a Teamsters meeting last weekend that drew hundreds of workers from across the state to support the Gephardt campaign.
Mike Mathis, the Teamsters' political director, told the crowd in Des Moines: "Some of you in this room I know have talked to your local unions and said, 'Yeah, you know he's a great guy for us; he's always been there for us, but can he win?' " 
Mr. Mathis said the answer is yes. Though the A.F.L.-C.I.O. decided against an early endorsement, Mr. Gephardt has support from 19 unions nationally, more than any other candidate. Already, hundreds of workers have begun fanning across the state to support the campaign and Mr. Gephardt has begun stepping up his presence.
In recent weeks, Mr. Gephardt has sharpened his attacks on Dr. Dean and on President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq and the economy. Voters say his spirited performance in debates has captured attention. He has also livened up his speaking style since his last presidential campaign. He often punctuates his words with a jabbing finger and a shaking fist, and peppers his speeches with personal anecdotes. 
He tries to turn his experience into an asset, promising an experienced hand in dangerous times. 
"He's got a great message; he comes across very positively," said Bob Meredith, a financial consultant, who said he was still uncertain about whether Mr. Gephardt could win the caucuses, which will be held on Jan. 19.
These days, Mr. Gephardt likes to compare himself to the tortoise that ultimately beats the hare.
"Things change fast," he said, dismissing the polls.

HEADLINE: Company Is Foreign at Tax Time, But Seeks Americans-Only Work 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
A big oil-well drilling company that has used one law to escape American taxes by taking addresses in Bermuda and Barbados is now trying to use another law to qualify for business open only to American companies.
 Competitors are crying foul, saying they cannot survive if the Bermuda-Barbados company, Nabors Industries, is allowed to vie for contracts while paying little or nothing in taxes. 
 The competitors, most of them family-owned businesses, say that unless Congress acts to level the playing field they will lose so much business to Nabors that they will go broke within a decade or be forced themselves to try to become Bermuda companies so they can also escape taxes.
The issue is part of a much larger debate about how a hodgepodge of tax laws enacted starting in 1986 give big advantages to multinational concerns over domestic companies.
The debate comes as official reports show that corporate tax revenues are plummeting because of a weaker economy and tax shelters, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating it will raise $136 billion this year, down from $207 billion just three years ago. 
Nabors Industries is the nation's largest operator of oil-well drilling rigs and has its working headquarters in Houston. But since late 2001 the company has used a Bermuda maildrop as its tax headquarters and a Barbados office as its legal headquarters.
There is no corporate income tax in Bermuda and under a treaty with Barbados, profits are taxed at 1 percent. The United States corporate tax rate is 35 percent. The savings to Nabors was $10 million last year.
Now Nabors wants to qualify fully for business under the Jones Act, which since 1916 has required that ships engaged in purely domestic trade be built in American shipyards, owned by American companies and operated by American crews. Nabors owns 33 ships serving oil drilling platforms, a tenth of the fleet of about 350 ships that ferry supplies like drill pipe in the Gulf of Mexico.
Nabors argues that its American subsidiary qualifies it for business under the Jones Act, and that under a 1996 law that allows foreign financing of such ships, its Bermuda parent is simply providing the money for these ships.
Competitors call the arrangement improper, and have some support in Congress.
Minor Cheramie Jr. of Golden Meadow, La., whose family operates 18 Jones Act ships, called it "grossly unfair that we pay taxes for certain services and this big corporation goes foreign and they get the benefit of the same services without paying for them."
He said that because Nabors pays little in taxes it can underbid competitors, growing until it dominates the industry. 
If Congress lets Nabors keep its ships and operate more, Mr. Cheramie said, "I won't have a choice but to become a Bermuda company."
Each side is seeking a rider to one of the appropriations bills expected to be voted on in the next few weeks that would put its stance into law. No bill has been introduced and Congress has not held any hearings, which is common with special-interest legislation affecting taxes.
Calls to Nabors offices in Houston and Barbados were not returned. A Nabors lobbyist, Kenneth J. Kies, expressed confidence that Congress would back the company, but would not say who was taking its case forward. Some senators and congressmen who rivals said were Nabors's supporters said they were not involved.
Nabors's opponents are more vocal. Representative David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said Congress never intended to create a loophole for foreign companies like Nabors to finance an American subsidiary. "This was for a bona fide bank" to provide financing, he said, calling the Nabors arrangement "an abuse."
Representative Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi, said he was "angry that a company that became foreign so it would not have to pay taxes still gets all the benefits the taxpayers provide, with the Coast Guard to rescue their ships if they get in trouble and the Navy Seals if they are attacked by terrorists.
"They have an advantage against companies that pay taxes."
Last year Nabors paid 7 cents in taxes out of each dollar of profit.
Mr. Taylor said the 1996 law "was presented to Congress as a way for these ship companies to lower their financing costs, but turns out to have been cleverly written to give a competitive advantage" to foreign companies.
Mr. Kies, the Nabors lobbyist, said the Nabors arrangement complied with the 1996 law. "Those are the guys we like to call the whiners," Mr. Kies said of the other shipowners. 
"There is nothing unfair" about what Nabors has done, he added.
Mr. Kies agreed that Nabors pays a much lower tax rate than the other companies because of its Bermuda arrangement. He added that he was certain that the competitors would not be able to lower their tax rates by making Bermuda their tax headquarters because Congress would enact a ban on such moves, making it retroactive to last year.
While that may seem unfair, Mr. Kies said, the issue is better viewed as just "one loony example" of "a corporate tax system that is really bizarre."
Mr. Kies, who was chief of staff for Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation in the mid-1990's, said that without fundamental change many more such examples will come to light as some companies take advantage of what the law allows to cut their tax rates, leaving competitors at a disadvantage. And, he said, foreign companies will continue to expand in the United States because of tax rules that favor them over American-owned companies.
The result, he said, will be that American companies will wither, creating few jobs, while competitors flourish.
A French company, Groupe Bourbon, is financing 10 ships being built in Alabama that will be owned in part by Larry Rigdon, a New Orleans ship entrepreneur. He says these ships also qualify under the Jones Act.
Representative Taylor, who represents the Mississippi Gulf Coast, said, "We could have taxpaying American companies building those ships." 
Nabors and Groupe Bourbon can convert otherwise taxable profits earned in the United States into tax deductible expenses paid to the offshore parent in the form of interest, royalties and fees.
Laney Chouest, whose family company operates 10 Jones Act ships and employs 4,000 people in Galliano, La., said he was astonished that members of Congress would even take up the cause of foreign-owned companies against family-owned American businesses. 
"Should foreign-owned companies like Nabors have these lobbying rights?" he asked.
"If what's going on is some in Congress want to get rid of corporate taxes, then, fine, let's debate that, but not just for some foreign-owned companies" while companies like his must continue to pay taxes. 
Last year, news that companies were using Bermuda maildrops to escape taxes angered many voters. On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats competed to make the toughest statements about acting against companies that moved offshore to escape taxes.
Congress passed a law that appeared to ban companies that acquired a Bermuda tax address from getting federal contracts. But a close reading of the law showed that it explicitly allowed American subsidiaries of the Bermuda companies to hold federal contracts.
Congress did not enact any laws to either stop the Bermuda moves or to protect domestic companies from those that use a Bermuda mailbox to operate nearly tax-free. 
Bob Alario, president of the Offshore Marine Service Association in New Orleans, which represents the competing shipowners, said that Gene M. Isenberg, Nabors's chief executive, told them he was confident Congress would eliminate any doubt as to the Jones Act qualification of his company's 33 ships and would allow Nabors to expand.

HEADLINE: Sniper Jury Is Empaneled; Arguments Start on Monday 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO; Lisa A. Bacon contributed to this article.

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Their ranks include a retired Navy pilot, a nurse, a bartender, a hardware-store employee and an eighth-grade teacher. They are mostly women and overwhelmingly white. Most are married and middle age. Several are retired, with grandchildren. 
 For the next month or more, all will sit on the jury that decides whether John A. Muhammad killed a Marylander, Dean H. Meyers, and if so, whether he should be put to death. Mr. Meyers was the seventh of 10 victims killed last fall in the sniper shootings in the Washington area . 
 With the final selection of the 15-member panel on Friday -- three will be alternates -- Mr. Muhammad's trial on capital murder charges will begin hearing opening arguments on Monday morning, followed immediately by the prosecution's first witnesses.
On Monday, Lee B. Malvo, 18, who is accused of being Mr. Muhammad's accomplice in the shootings, is also expected to be escorted into court under subpoena from the prosecution, officials said. He is not expected to testify, but will be available so that prosecution witnesses can identify him, officials said.
When Mr. Malvo enters the courtroom, he is expected to be seated a few feet from Mr. Muhammad and from six of Mr. Meyers's relatives, including two of his three brothers. Asked how he would feel about seeing Mr. Malvo brought into court, Mr. Meyers's younger brother, Bob, said the moment would be "sensitizing." 
"But at the same time," Mr. Meyers, 50, said, "it's not our position to take vengeance or to make judgments. It's our position to let the process continue."
The jury was culled in nearly four days of questioning from an initial pool of 123 Virginia Beach residents. 
The final group includes 10 women and 5 men; 13 are white and 2 black. Nearly half said they had served in the military or had close relatives who had served. Virginia Beach is at the hub of one of the nation's largest complexes of military bases, including the Norfolk Naval Station and Langley Air Force Base. 
At the order of the presiding judge, LeRoy F. Millette Jr., the jurors' names have been kept secret, and they have been referred to in court by numbers. They will not be sequestered, but the judge has prohibited journalists from trying to interview them before the trial ends. 
Still, some biographical information about each of juror emerged in individual questioning by the lawyers. 
One juror was a retired Navy officer and pilot who had a brother whom the police killed in an attempted robbery 25 years ago. The man -- tall, balding and authoritative in his bearing -- said he had presided over nonjudicial disciplinary proceedings against sailors under his command, but not courts-martial.
The man, a championship golfer at his local club, also said he understood the gravity of sitting on a death penalty case.
"Having spent most of my adult life in the military," he said, "I understand the taking of life."
Another man said he had been robbed more than once while working as a cabbie. He also said he had been accused by an off-duty police officer of stealing a videocassette recorder, but said the officer was drunk and did not file charges. 
Most said they had paid little attention to the sniper shootings as they occurred. A real-estate agent said she was too busy making arrangements for her nephew's wedding. A widow said she was visiting a child in Hawaii and did not hear much news about the shootings. An unemployed woman in her 20's said she did not give them much thought, because "I felt it was a one in a million chance" that they would affect her.
All said they did not have firm opinions on the death penalty. But a few expressed qualms about it.
A woman who had been a Navy intelligence officer for seven years specializing in antisubmarine warfare said she had conflicting opinions, saying, "Part of me thinks it's wrong, but part of me agrees with it."
Asked by a defense lawyer what she disagreed with, she replied, "Thou shalt not kill." Asked what she agreed with, she said, "It's the law."
A man who designs communications systems said his jury notice had caused him to do some soul searching about capital punishment. 
"I felt very cavalier about it until I received the jury notice," the man, a grandfather, said. "Taking someone's life is very serious."
Two of the victim's brothers, Bob and Larry; Bob Meyer's son; and their wives visited the courthouse in preparation for watching the trial. Larry Meyers, 60, the oldest brother of four in the close-knit family, said he had been asked to testify for the prosecution about his brother next week. 
Outside the courthouse, the brothers recalled fond memories of Dean Meyers. Bob Meyers showed photographs of his canoeing in Virginia and described how he had planned to build a home at the headwaters of the Rappahannock River. Larry Meyers called Dean Meyers "my best friend."
Asked whether he felt anger about the killings, Larry Meyers expressed only empathy for the defendants.
"They were regular guys at one time, I think," he said. "And something happened, and it turned them into something that went outside the bounds of society. And so, that's why they're here and that's why we're here."

HEADLINE: Trading Firm Pursues Return To Downtown 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Cantor Fitzgerald, the stock and bond trading firm, is negotiating to return to Lower Manhattan, where its work force was decimated by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center two years ago.
 Only a year ago, Howard W. Lutnick, the chief executive of Cantor, had vowed that his firm would never go back to the neighborhood where 658 employees died in the collapse of Tower 1. But time has eased the emotional trauma, and relatively lower occupancy costs have made Lower Manhattan attractive. 
 According to numerous real estate executives and government officials, Cantor is negotiating to buy a 200,000-square-foot office condominium at 10 Hanover Square, a building one block from Wall Street that is being vacated by Goldman Sachs. 
Executives in the financial district, as well as state and city officials, agree that Cantor's return would be a richly symbolic example of the beleaguered downtown district's rebound. But Mr. Lutnick is demanding an array of subsidies and has touched off a battle between the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who supports Cantor, and, on the other side, city and state officials and the Real Estate Board of New York, an influential trade group.
Opponents of the subsidies would welcome Cantor's return downtown from 57th Street and Lexington Avenue, but oppose ladling out any additional benefits beyond the $30 million in cash and millions of dollars in tax breaks, tax-free financing and low-cost electricity already available to the company if it moves to Lower Manhattan.
Few politicians or real estate executives are willing to tangle publicly with the Assembly speaker. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff would say only that the city was "working on a solution."
The dispute has been simmering for months and is rife with policy disputes, blood feuds and a sense of the familiar.
"With all due respect for the enormous loss of life at Cantor, the company shouldn't trade on the horrors of 9/11 to get an unconscionable windfall for a single company," said Harvey Robins, a top city administrator in the 1980's and early 1990's. "Every time the city and state do these deals, we lose as a city because resources are not being equitably distributed."
Cantor lobbied successfully in Congress last year for a special appropriation for companies that "suffered a disproportionate loss" of their work force. State officials have agreed to give Cantor $24 million of the $33 million appropriation for a new headquarters.
The company would also be eligible for an estimated $6 million grant from the federal Liberty Zone program to rebuild Lower Manhattan, as well as tax-free Liberty Bonds, accelerated depreciation and other tax breaks. Mr. Silver has proposed to amend an obscure city program in a way that would grant Cantor millions of dollars in additional tax breaks to move downtown.
Cantor Fitzgerald and its supporters contend that the company suffered a uniquely devastating blow in the terrorist attack when 658 of its 960 employees at the trade center were killed. Mr. Lutnick has rebuilt the company and expects to double the size of its New York headquarters over the next two years.
A year ago, Cantor was seeking to build a new headquarters in a former department store building 2.5 miles north of Wall Street in Union Square, but the deal fell through, and now the firm is looking downtown.
"It's a great message for the rest of the world," Mr. Silver said yesterday. "Downtown is back, alive and well."
The two sides are at odds over a city benefit known as the Relocation and Employment Assistance Program, or REAP, and Mr. Silver's proposed modifications, which would benefit Cantor. REAP was devised years ago to stem the flow of offices and jobs from Manhattan to less expensive office space in New Jersey or Connecticut. It provided companies with benefits worth $3,000 per employee for 12 years if they moved instead to Long Island City in Queens or downtown Brooklyn.
But the program expired in June, much to the dismay of local development officials in Queens and Brooklyn, when the State Legislature failed to extend it. Since then, Mr. Silver, who controls the State Assembly, has blocked the city's efforts to reinstate REAP as the two sides argued over specific provisions. Recently, the Downtown Brooklyn Council sent a letter to Brooklyn legislators urging them to reauthorize the program quickly or risk losing more jobs to Jersey City.
"Without REAP, it will be extremely difficult to compete with New Jersey, which has its own programs," said Michael Burke, executive director of the council.
Mr. Silver wants REAP to cover companies moving from Midtown to downtown, a change that would provide Cantor alone with at least $1.5 million a year in benefits for the next 12 years. Mr. Silver said the downtown economy remained severely wounded and now deserved the same protection and incentives as Queens and Brooklyn.
"In order to ensure that downtown remains a thriving commercial district, we're going to need more tools than the dwindling pot of federal money," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership.
But city and state officials say Mr. Silver's provision would cause a budget disaster by unnecessarily giving away tax revenues. Already, they say, there are millions of dollars in federal tax breaks and cash incentives for companies willing to move downtown or remain there.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said that Mr. Silver's modification would trigger rent wars between downtown and uptown landlords at a time when, according to Newmark & Company Real Estate, rents are already 29 percent cheaper on average in Lower Manhattan.
"We shouldn't sacrifice the rents in Midtown out of a desire to fill empty space in Lower Manhattan," Mr. Spinola said.
Mr. Silver also wants to make companies moving from downtown to Queens or Brooklyn ineligible for REAP benefits. Local development officials say that such companies are choosing between Jersey City and Brooklyn, not downtown and Brooklyn. But city officials appear willing to compromise with Mr. Silver by restricting the REAP benefits for companies moving outside Lower Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Bolivian Leader Resigns and His Vice President Steps In 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada resigned as president of South America's poorest and most unstable country late Friday after nearly a month of increasingly violent clashes between army troops and predominantly Indian demonstrators that have left more than 80 people dead.
 A special session of Congress formally approved the step in a vote just after 10 p.m., and there were conflicting reports on Friday night as to the former president's whereabouts. Some television and radio stations said he had flown by helicopter to Peru, while others reported that he was boarding a commercial flight to the United States from the eastern city of Santa Cruz. 
 Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, 73, an advocate of free-market policies, had been under increasing attack here because of a proposal to export natural gas to the United States through a port in Chile, Bolivia's traditional enemy. 
Last weekend he ordered troops to suppress the unrest, a move that has led to mounting deaths and more resistance to his rule. On Friday the last pillars of his political support crumbled, and Mr. Sanchez de Lozada reluctantly took the step that he had always insisted he could never take because it would fatally wound democracy here.
With his resignation, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada became the fourth South American president to be forced out of office by popular unrest since 2000. Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador, Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Fernando de la Rua of Argentina were the others, and in all but Mr. Fujimori's case, unpopular economic policies were also the main factor in their fall.
In the letter offering his resignation, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada attributed his undoing to what he called a "seditious" movement seeking to overturn the verdict that voters had delivered when they elected him last year, and he also warned that the crisis was not over. "The dangers that hang over our fatherland continue intact," he wrote.
That political passions are still running high became clear during the joint session, which started more than five hours late because many legislators were delayed by roadblocks and blockades, and needed a military escort. During a minute of silence for victims of the violence, some opposition legislators cried out "murderer, murderer," and the first attempt to read Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's letter out loud failed because it was drowned out by shouts, whistles and personal insults.
Nevertheless, Hormando Vaca Diaz, who as president of the Senate presided over the joint session, described the resignation as "a solution that is not ideal, but which preserves the constitutional order, which had been at risk." Other legislators and political analysts expressed relief that this nation of eight million had managed to avert a civil war or a military coup.
Even before legislators voted 97-30 to accept the resignation letter, jubilant protesters at the Plaza of Heroes, one of the main sites of recent demonstrations, cheered, waved flags and burst into song and dance. "Goni is gone, Goni is gone," they chanted, referring to Mr. Sanchez de Lozada by his nickname.
As stipulated by the Bolivian Constitution, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada was replaced by his vice president, Carlos Mesa. A 50-year-old historian and television journalist who gained national popularity as the host of a program called "Up Close," Mr. Mesa was initially chosen as Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's running mate because he belonged to no political party and had a reputation as a corruption fighter.
Once he took office, however, Mr. Mesa clashed with many of the career politicians with whom he will have to deal as president. He broke with the government earlier this week, but with no political base of his own, he has sought to position himself between the warring camps and to offer himself to the public as a neutral healer and conciliator.
"I am not with the philosophy that reasons of state justify death," he said at his last public appearance, on Thursday. "But neither am I with the radical banners that the moment has arrived to destroy everything in order to construct a utopia that nobody wants or knows where it is going."
From the city of Cochabamba, Evo Morales, leader of the coca growers'federation and runner-up to Mr. Sanchez de Lozada in the election last year, said he would support the "constitutional" solution that would make Mr. Mesa president. "Let's hope that Carlos Mesa understands all of the demands that have been put forward by the people," Mr. Morales said Friday night after the vote, in which he chose not to take part.
The position of the other principal Indian leader, Felipe Quispe, whose organization began the demonstrations, was less clear. He refused to pledge support to Mr. Mesa when reporters asked him on Friday afternoon what the bloc he controls in Congress would do, though his followers eventually voted in favor of the change of government.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's last day in office began with the news that his spokesman, Mauricio Antezana, had resigned. Shortly afterward, the leader of one of the parties in the precarious governing coalition, Manfred Reyes Villa, a former army captain, emerged from a meeting with the president and announced that his group, the conservative New Republican Force, was also withdrawing.
"I'm not one to jump off the boat, but we can't go on rowing against the tide, against an entire people who are seeking his resignation," Mr. Reyes Villa said.
"We are not going to be part of the biggest massacre of the people," he added. "We can't go on like this."
On the streets, the demonstrations, which have mostly been led by indigenous movements, appeared during the day to be strengthening, with even middle-class neighborhoods joining in. Elegantly dressed women banged pots and pans in protest, and as a sign of mourning for those killed over the past week, many businesses hung the red-yellow-and-green Bolivian national flag with black ribbons added in the center or black bunting put around the edges.
"Goni has got to go," said Mirta Camacho Valdivieso, a middle-class housewife alarmed by the food shortages and general chaos. "Too much blood has been shed and too many hatreds awakened for him to continue in office."

HEADLINE: A Fair Fight in the Philippines 

BYLINE:  By Brett M. Decker; Brett M. Decker is writing a book on Al Qaeda in Southeast Asia.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush is in Manila today to visit his ally in the war against terror, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines. Mr. Bush has already announced some $340 million in aid to the Philippines this year, and President Arroyo has said she plans to request additional military assistance to fight terrorism. There's only one problem with this alliance: American aid hasn't improved the Philippine military so far, and in many ways it has benefited the Islamic militants it seeks to combat.
 In August, Gen. Narciso Abaya, chief of the Philippine armed forces, made an alarming statement about the condition of his military: "I admit there is graft and corruption at all levels." A significant share of the military budget is lost to graft. Selling military hardware on the black market is another common practice. Recent raids of bases of the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front have turned up caches of arms with Philippine military markings. 
 Even American assistance is siphoned away. Testimony before the Philippine Congress in the past several months revealed that American M-16's provided to the Philippine armed forces have been recovered in camps belonging to Abu Sayyaf, a band of guerrillas and kidnappers. Assault rifles, grenade launchers and other American arms have been used by Muslim radicals against Philippine troops -- the very troops United States funds are supposed to assist.
American aid to help fight Islamic radicals is often offset by bribes soldiers take from terrorists to let them get away. Operatives affiliated with Al Qaeda have escaped from maximum-security military prisons, once using a helicopter.
If Washington and Manila are serious about eliminating Abu Sayyaf, the United States Special Forces should be given the assignment. The terrorist group consists of about 100 poorly trained amateurs. They would be no match for American soldiers already in the Philippines, but they are still eluding Filipino troops.
The Philippine Constitution does not allow foreign troops to wage combat missions on Filipino soil. It does, however, allow the United States to come to the defense of the Philippines if the islands are attacked. Such an action can be justified in the present case because the terrorist groups get foreign money.
The mission could win support on Capitol Hill because the situation in the Philippines is precisely what the one in Iraq is not: there is a known enemy of limited ability and numbers on a few small, isolated islands with scant local support. There is minimal risk of escalation because the country is only about 5 percent Muslim. Perhaps more important, fellow Filipino Muslims do not support Abu Sayyaf. Separatist Moros view them as a for-profit gang of thugs rather than a religious movement to defend Islam. The provincial governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao ordered his security force to cooperate in the hunt for Abu Sayyaf.
Unless the integrity of arms transfers to the Philippine military can be guaranteed, which is not likely, the United States should consider cutting off military aid to the Philippines and replacing it with economic support to help develop the poor Muslim islands in the south.
There has been some success in winning local "hearts and minds" already. After building a few roads, bridges, sewers and wells last year, American soldiers were cheered by appreciative Muslims as the troops pulled out of Mindanao. More aid for infrastructure could go a long way to soothing centuries of resentment derived from being shut out of the national economy.
A reorientation of American aid would have the added benefit of helping bolster Philippine democracy. The military has instigated coups in every administration except one since 1965. Withholding support from the Philippine brass sends the message that Washington -- the nation's most important ally -- expects the military to keep its hands off the civilian institutions of government.
The White House should carefully assess what course will best help stabilize one of its most reliable allies in Asia. Despite the inevitable complications, the Philippines is worthy of American assistance.

HEADLINE: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BROOKS; E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When it comes to the future of Iraq, there's not just one Democratic Party; there are three. 
 First, there are the Nancy Pelosi Democrats. These Democrats voted against Paul Bremer's $87 billion plan for the reconstruction of Iraq. The essence of their case is that the Bush administration is too corrupt and incompetent to reconstruct Iraq. If Bush is for it, they're against it. 
 Their hatred for Bush is so dense, it's hard for them to see through it to the consequences of their vote. But if Pelosi's arguments had carried the day, our troops in Iraq would be reading this morning about the death of the Bremer plan and the ruination of our efforts to rebuild Iraq. 
Saddam Hussein would be jubilant in Pelosi's Iraq. He has long argued that America is a decadent country that will buckle at the first sign of trouble. If the Pelosi Democrats had won yesterday's vote, the Saddam Doctrine would be enshrined in every terrorist cave and dictator's palace around the world: kill some Americans and watch the empire buckle. 
A few days ago the Pelosi Democrats came up with a fig leaf alternative to the Bremer plan, which would have reduced U.S. control of reconstruction and shifted power to the World Bank. When that plan went nowhere, the Pelosi Democrats were faced with a choice: trust Americans or choke off the funds. They voted to choke off the funds. 
And so in Pelosi's Iraq, there would be little money for children's hospitals, jails, clean water and schools. In Pelosi's Iraq, everyone would begin preparing for the post-U.S. power vacuum. The Kurds would rush to independence, the Sunnis would stock up on weapons, and the Shiites would call in Iran to help them in the coming civil war. The dream of an Iraqi constitution would die in its crib.
For the roster of the Pelosi Democrats, look at those who voted against the Bremer plan. Some names are obvious: Dennis Kucinich, Ted Kennedy and Barbara Boxer. But there are some names you wouldn't expect to see on that list: John Kerry and John Edwards. France, Russia and Syria don't oppose the Bremer plan, but the Pelosi Democrats are to the left of Bashar al-Assad.
Next we come to the Evan Bayh Democrats, named after the Indiana senator. These Democrats can see past their dislike of the president. They would appropriate some money for Iraqi reconstruction. But siding with the anti-foreign-aid Republicans, they'd turn the rest of the aid into loans. The Iraqi people have been raped, tortured and left bloodied on the floor. The Bayh Democrats say to them: Here's a credit card. Go buy yourself some treatment, and you can pay us back later. 
The Bayh Democrats are centrist but not visionary, and they seem to worry more about adding an extra $10 billion to the deficit than about the future of the Middle East. They may have read memos from the Democratic pollsters on the unpopularity of the $87 billion plan, but they don't seem to have read about the Versailles Treaty and what happens when strong nations impose punitive burdens on proud ones.
Finally we come to the Cantwell Democrats. This group could be named after Joe Biden, Joe Lieberman or Dick Gephardt, but Maria Cantwell, the Washington senator, sits at Scoop Jackson's old desk on the Senate floor. The Cantwell Democrats are dismayed with how the Bush administration has handled the postwar period. They'd like to see the rich pay a bigger share of the reconstruction cost. But they knew yesterday's vote wasn't about George Bush. It was about doing what's right for the Iraqi people and what's right, over the long term, for the American people. These Democrats supported the aid package, and were willing to pay a price to give the Iraqis their best shot at a decent future. This week, Gephardt, who has to win over Iowa liberals to have any shot at the White House, is the bravest man in Washington.
Those are the three Democratic visions -- the good, the bad and the ugly. Right now the Pelosi wing of the party is dominant, and the Cantwell wing is beleaguered. So this is a party teetering on the brink of full-bore liberal isolationism.
Who is going to pull it back? Probably not Wesley Clark. The Clark Democrats are actually the fourth category in the party: the ones who are too mealy-mouthed to take a stand either way.

Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Foes of Idle Hands, Amish Seek an Exemption From a Child Labor Law 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BIRD-IN-HAND, Pa., Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Over the din of a buzzing band saw, the Amish furniture maker complained that Uncle Sam was out to get owners of woodworking shops like his simply for trying to teach Amish youths a trade.
 The Amish just want to be let alone, he said, but the federal government is meddling in their lives and livelihoods by fining Amish sawmills and woodworking shops that employ teenagers, in violation of child labor law. 
 "What are we supposed to do with them if they don't work here, have them stay on the street all day?" said the furniture maker, who insisted on anonymity. "I see what other teenagers do when I'm installing kitchens in people's homes. I see kids watching TV. They don't know what to do with themselves. Shouldn't they be occupied doing something worthwhile?" 
Federal law has long barred children under 18 from working in sawmills and woodworking factories, because they are so dangerous. The Amish have upset opponents of child labor by pushing Congress for an exemption based largely on religious grounds.
Amish religious rules require children to leave school after eighth grade and then learn a trade. For generations of young men, that trade was farming: the austere horse-drawn buggies traveling the back roads of Bird-in-Hand, Paradise, Intercourse and other Amish communities here in eastern Pennsylvania once passed endless miles of pasture and plowed fields.
But today the roadsides are increasingly punctuated by sawmills and woodworking shops, scores of them, producing tables, chairs, beds, gazebos, entertainment centers. As economic pressures and a scarcity of farmland fuel a shift from farming to small business, the Amish see a fast-growing need to train teenage boys in woodworking. (Teenage girls, as always, learn skills like quilting or work in retail shops.)
The Amish, who number more than 150,000 in rural communities in 25 states, predominantly Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, have persuaded several allies in Congress, including Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, to introduce a bill that would let Amish children age 14 to 17 work in sawmills and woodworking factories. Supporters say the bill, after falling short in previous Congresses, has a good chance of passing in this one, given strong backing within the ranks of the Republican majority.
Although those youths would remain barred from operating machinery, many children's advocates oppose the proposal, saying some would inevitably get too close to dangerous saws. They note that the fatality rate in sawmills is four times the rate throughout industry.
"This is the 21st century," said John R. Fraser, who headed the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division in the Clinton administration and opposedthe Amish exemption when it was first proposed in the late 1990's. "We should certainly respect and tolerate religious and cultural beliefs that date from centuries ago, but it would be irresponsible and dangerous to begin to tolerate 17th- and 18th-century practices with respect to child labor."
But while child-labor opponents seek to keep teenagers away from hazardous machinery, the Amish have an additional goal: to keep those teenagers busy with gainful work and away from hazardous enticements.
At Furnace Road Structures, just yards from dairy barns, cornfields and bright green spreads of alfalfa, a dozen workers use saws, drills and hydraulic-powered hammers to produce 2,000 utility sheds a year. The owner looks forward to the day when his son, now 11, can begin learning the trade. 
"What's my boy going to do if he can't?" the owner said. "Sit on the couch. We're going to lose our work ethic if they can't do this."
William Burkholder, an Amish sawmill operator in northwestern Pennsylvania, told a House subcommittee last week that sawmill work would be safe for teenagers because the legislation now in Congress would require them to remain far from the machinery. (The bill specifies only "sufficient distance," along with adult supervision of youths in the mill, leaving greater definition to regulations that would interpret the new law.)
Mr. Burkholder acknowledged that he lost part of a finger when, as an adult, he absent-mindedly touched a sawing machine, and noted that a 50-year-old employee recently lost most of his right arm when he tried cleaning out some wood without turning off the saw.
But in an interview he emphasized that the Amish urgently needed a way to keep boys from idleness.
"If we couldn't put our boys to work and they didn't do nothing until they were 18, they'd be absolutely worthless," he said. "We want them to be obedient and to learn a trade. If they don't, they'll be out and getting into mischief. Next thing you know, you'll have a bunch of them getting into dope and drinking and partying."
"Our kids don't do that," he said. "If you have a boy that goes to work, he feels tired and he don't want to go out howling around all night."
The Amish generally require plain clothing and prohibit driving, use of computers, and television- and movie-watching. They also forbid use of electricity from the power grid; diesel engines are typically allowed, to produce hydraulic and pneumatic power needed to run their businesses.
"What we're seeing is a clash of two different cultures, a clash of modern industrial culture with a more traditional, rural cottage-industry culture," said Donald B. Kraybill, a senior fellow at the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at nearby Elizabethtown College and author of "Amish Enterprise: From Plows to Profits."
"The outside community," he continued, "has a distorted assumption of the Amish." Outsiders "don't appreciate the value of children's socialization and orientation right on the job. They think it's oppressing the children when in fact it's not. This is an incubator for Amish values and culture."
Senator Specter, who recently toured several Amish furniture factories, says he came away convinced that Amish teenagers would not be endangered if allowed to become woodworking apprentices.
"I know where the young people would be positioned, they'll be away from the saws and the heavy action," he said. "It's been worked out to make sure that safety is assured. It requires adult supervision." 
Representative Joe Pitts, a Republican who represents this area, the nation's oldest Amish community, has introduced a companion bill to Senator Specter's in the House. 
"These are little family businesses trying to keep their kids in their way of life," Mr. Pitts said. "These are not sweatshops in New York City. If the Labor Department wants to find some real violations, they should find some sweatshops."
But some lawmakers remain very skeptical. "Any provision that weakens safety protections for children must be scrutinized with a careful eye," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
Some critics argue that the exemption would be unconstitutional because it would treat the Amish differently from people of other religions. 
"The bill would deny Amish children the very real benefits of government health and safety protection that are afforded Catholic, Baptist, Jewish or any other children of non-Amish faith," said Nicholas Clark, a child labor expert with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
Jim Lapp, operating manager of a non-Amish sawmill in Paradise, said the exemption would give the Amish a cost advantage.
"I guess an Amish 14-, 15-, 16-year-old will work for less than an 18-year-old," said Mr. Lapp, who, like others, also cites the safety issue.
"My question is whether adults will be next to them all the time," he said. "If so, that's fine. If there's not an adult around all the time, that's a problem."

HEADLINE: Bush Thanks Japan for Iraq Aid; No Accord on Currency 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
President Bush thanked Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Friday night for Japan's $1.5 billion commitment to rebuilding Iraq. But the two men emerged from a meeting and informal dinner here with what appeared to be a muddled message, and no agreement, on the value of the dollar.
 That issue is politically critical for both of them at a moment when Japan and the United States are both struggling to revive manufacturing jobs. 
 Mr. Koizumi announced his decision to make a substantial financial contribution to Iraq in the days before Mr. Bush arrived, so that it did not appear that he was acting under pressure. 
On Air Force One, a senior administration official told reporters that Mr. Bush would use his meetings this week with Asian leaders to seek similar contributions, but cautioned that the administration did not expect that many countries would be able to match Japan's contribution and that few would send troops.
Mr. Bush landed in Manila on Saturday for an eight-hour visit that includes a meeting with the Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and an address to the Phillipine Congress.
Mr. Koizumi, an American official said, made no commitment about whether he would deploy Japanese peacekeeping forces to Iraq. In July, Japan's Parliament authorized sending 1,000 troops, but on Thursday the government said it was still studying the appropriate time and place.
Mr. Koizumi, who is up for re-election on Nov. 9, has tried to keep the issue out of the public eye until after election day.
The senior Bush administration official said it was not clear whether troops from Turkey, whose presence in Iraq has been opposed by the American-appointed Iraqi Governing Council, would ever be deployed. 
"The Iraqis are obviously an important party in this," the official said. "I think it's time to just let people try and work it out."
According to Japanese officials, Mr. Koizumi urged Mr. Bush to work more within the United Nations structure, citing the Security Council vote on Thursday on Iraq as an example of how the United States could use the institution "as a bridge" to support its goals in Iraq and the Middle East as a whole. 
Mr. Bush, the Japanese officials said, responded by describing the United Nations as an aging and slow institution and made no commitments. American officials, in briefing reporters, made no mention of any discussion of the United Nations.
The leaders met at what was described as a social dinner for Mr. Bush at the Akasaka State Guest House, one of the palaces surrounding the main Imperial Palace in the center of Tokyo. The dinner was a deliberately low-key affair: both men were in open-collared shirts, and they avoided the kind of scene they made 18 months ago when they ate in a crowded Tokyo restaurant. 
While they said nothing to reporters, they allowed in photographers to underscore what they describe as a close, informal working relationship. 
That is particularly important for Mr. Koizumi, as his party faceselections in a few weeks. He must balance, one Japanese diplomat said Friday night, "a closeness with America and a recognition of the great sensitivity" about deploying Japanese forces to a region where deadly violence is still a daily event. 
Polls show Japanese extremely reluctant to put their military in harm's way, though Mr. Koizumi seems intent on avoiding the trouble Japan ran into in 1991, when it sent plenty of money for the Persian Gulf war but no troops.
The consensus between the men broke down when the subject turned to the strength of the dollar, which could become a major political problem for Mr. Bush.
The president is under pressure from American manufacturers, including some of the biggest donors to his campaign, to let the dollar fall in value relative to some major Asian currencies. A weaker dollar would lower the price of American goods abroad, which would help American companies to export more. On the other hand, it would make Japanese and Chinese imports more expensive in the American market.
Mr. Bush clearly wants to accommodate the exporters, but he is also aware of the benefits of a strong dollar for many sectors of the economy. So he has split the difference, saying the United States still favors a strong dollar but wants "the market to determine exchange rates." 
That last phrase is a signal to American companies, administration officials say, that Mr. Bush believes that China and Japan should stop intervening in the markets to keep the dollar artificially high.
In short, the new American policy appears internally contradictory. Mr. Bush is declaring that the dollar should be strong, while calling for a freeing of markets that would, most experts guess, send its value down in relation to the Japanese and Chinese currencies. 
"It's a combination of statements that make no sense, when you think about it," one senior American official deeply involved in the issue said just before Mr. Bush left Washington on Wednesday. "Either you want a strong dollar or you want the markets to determine the rate, but you can't pray at both altars."
Mr. Koizumi's problem is the mirror image of Mr. Bush's. He wants a strong dollar and a weak yen, to improve Japan's exports.

HEADLINE: Asian Leaders Find China A More Cordial Neighbor 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
More than 50 years of American dominance in Asia is subtly but unmistakably eroding as Asian countries look toward China as the increasingly vital regional power, political and business leaders in Asia say.
 China's churning economic engine, coupled with trade deals and friendly diplomacy, have transformed it from a country to be feared to one that beckons, these regional leaders say. 
 That new, more benign view of China by its neighbors has emerged in the last year as President Bush is perceived in Asia to have pressed America's campaign on terror to the exclusion of almost everything else.
The most recent efforts by the administration to persuade China to revalue its currency are seen, many in the region say, as an unproductive use of American political capital. 
Symbolically, perhaps, the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, landed a day ahead of Mr. Bush in Thailand, still basking in the afterglow of China's first space mission. The Chinese leader was welcomed with banner headlines and a sumptuous dinner given by King Bhumibol in his golden-roofed Bangkok palace.
Both leaders are being accorded a state visit to Thailand before the opening on Monday of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. Then, almost in tandem, they will move south to Australia, where Mr. Bush will address Parliament on Thursday, followed the next day by Mr. Hu.
The United States' two most important strategic Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, are particularly benefiting from China's growth. Last year for the first time, Japan's imports from China surpassed those from the United States. At the same time, Japanese exports to China surged by 39.3 percent. China has now become South Korea's largest trading partner.
One prominent Singaporean businessman, Ho Kwon Ping, illustrates the shift in Asian attitudes toward China. Compared to a year ago, he said, Asians are viewing China as a "cup half full, not half empty."
Mr. Ho, the executive chairman of the Banyan Tree Resorts hotel chain and a member of the board of Singapore Airlines, gave speeches in Hong Kong and London last year describing China as a juggernaut poised to smother the weak economies and less educated populations of Southeast Asia.
Now, he says, "The perception is that China is trying to do its best to please, assist, accommodate its neighbors while the United States is perceived as a country involved more and more on its own foreign policy agenda, and strong-arming everyone onto that agenda."
China is streaking ahead, developing its technology, advanced education and scientific and other research at extraordinary rates, and Asian countries now see that as an opportunity. 
"They are not seeing a China that threatens their economic livelihood," Mr. Ho said.
The United States remains the region's biggest trading partner, but trade between China and the rest of Asia is booming, and China is also offering attractive add-ons: new investment and nonthreatening diplomacy. In a direct challenge to the United States, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China urged Southeast Asian nations last week to achieve $100 billion worth of trade with China in two years, nearly double the current $55 billion volume. American trade with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, was $120 billion in 2001.
There, and farther south, in Australia, China is scooping up raw materials that it needs for its rapid modernization: liquid natural gas from Indonesia and Australia, iron ore from Australia, rubber and palm oil from Malaysia.
In Australia, President Hu is planning to sign an agreement that will make China not just a customer but an investor in the North West Shelf gas venture.
China began its formal courtship with the countries of Southeast Asia a year and a half ago when it offered a free trade agreement with the members of Asean by 2015.
The United States countered last October with the Enterprise for Asean Initiative, a plan to offer bilateral free trade agreements with Southeast Asian countries that were already members of the World Trade Organization.
Washington completed the first of those with Singapore this summer. President Bush is expected to announce the start of a similar agreement with Thailand this weekend.
The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said Friday in an interview here that China's offer of a free trade accord with Southeast Asia was a "thoughtful move" that "institutionalized what these countries now recognize: that China's growth is a benefit to them."
But Mr. Zoellick said that once trade agreements between individual Asean members and the United States were completed they would be worth more than deals with China.
"Ours are more complex and comprehensive," he said, noting that the United States still represented more than 25 percent of the world's economy.
In Singapore, one of America's staunchest Asian friends, the political leadership has begun to sketch what it sees as the coming redistribution of power in Asia.
The prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, last week outlined a situation in which the relative roles of Japan and South Korea would diminish and that of China would grow.
The United States would remain the most significant power in the region, but the inevitably competitive relationship between Washington and Beijing would have far-reaching consequences, Mr. Goh said.
"All Asian leaders are looking ahead at the relentless economic march of China," he said.
On the diplomatic front, China and the United States are enjoying a friendly phase, one that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell described recently as the best since 1972, when President Nixon visited Beijing. Formal diplomatic relations began in 1979.
For now, this cordiality helps other Asian countries deepen their contacts with China without forcing a choice between Washington and Beijing, diplomats in the region say.
Some of China's specific diplomatic moves in the last few months, particularly its efforts to bring Washington and North Korea together, have been widely praised elsewhere in Asia.
In a less publicized but important step, President Hu met with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan on May 31 in the Russian city of St. Petersburg, a gesture viewed as a way to start improving the icy Chinese-Japanese relationship.
That kind of Chinese diplomacy is contrasted by Asians with some of President Bush's remarks about the region.
Answering a reporter's question before leaving Washington, Mr. Bush said mostly white Australia was not just a deputy sheriff for Asia, as the reporter suggested, but a "sheriff."
This word, particularly associated with a major American military ally, provokes shudders and distaste across Asia. The Australian defense minister, Robert Hill, hurriedly disowned the comparison.
"It remains too soon to pronounce that Asia has become 'China-centric,' " said David Shambaugh, professor of international affairs at George Washington University and a specialist on the Chinese military. 
"But the trend lines are clearly moving in that direction," he said. "To some extent this means that the United States is being replaced as the main power in Asia, but that perspective is really too simplified. The reality is that the United States and China together are dominating the region."

HEADLINE: Presidential Ecospeak 

 BODY:
President Bush's nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Mike Leavitt, finally won committee approval this week, but not before a half-dozen senators had openly expressed exasperation at his habit of retreating behind ecofriendly phrases when asked about his record as Utah's governor. Which means, of course, that Mr. Leavitt will fit right in with the Bush administration. Indeed, Mr. Bush himself may fairly be said to have become the master of the ostensibly ecofriendly sound bite, offering oversimplified solutions to complex environmental problems and wrapping them in tempting slogans that hide their generally pro-business tilt. 
 "Healthy Forests," for instance, describes an initiative aimed mainly at benefiting the timber industry rather than the communities threatened by fire. "Freedom Car" (to be powered by "Freedom Fuel") describes a program to develop a hydrogen-fueled car that, while beguiling in the long term, absolves automakers from making the near-term improvements in fuel economy necessary to reduce oil dependence and the threat of global warming. 
 These verbal contortions reached a new plateau a few weeks ago in back-to-back presidential appearances at a power plant in Michigan and in the Rose Garden. Mr. Bush's purpose was to defend his controversial decision in August to rewrite the Clean Air Act in ways that spared power companies the expense of making investments in pollution controls whenever they upgraded their plants and increased emissions. His basic argument was that the old rules thwarted modernization and economic growth, costing American workers their jobs, and that his own initiative -- dubbed "Clear Skies," in the come-hither nomenclature favored by the White House -- would achieve equal results at lower cost.
It sounded tidy, except for two things. Clear Skies will not, even by E.P.A. estimates, improve air quality as surely and swiftly as the steady application of current law. Second, there is no persuasive evidence that tough environmental laws impede efficiency or economic growth. Quite the contrary. As Mr. Bush himself observed, air pollution has declined steadily in the last 30 years even as the population grew and the economy boomed.
At a minimum, this happy state of affairs would seem to argue for leaving the clean air laws much as they are, leaving room, of course, for streamlining and simplification. Yet Mr. Bush insists that to protect jobs, only radical surgery will do. It is all very dizzying. The only explanation for what amounts to a willing suspension of history and logic is that American industry, which for 30 years has cried wolf about the costs of major regulatory initiatives -- the phaseout of lead in gasoline, catalytic converters on cars, controls on acid rain -- has at last found a sympathetic ear in the White House.
It is this reality -- the relationship between Mr. Bush and his corporate underwriters -- that could give his frustrated critics an opening. This week, a group of people responsible for environmental policy in the Clinton administration -- former officials like Carol Browner, Mr. Clinton's chief of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Bruce Babbitt, his secretary of the interior -- announced a campaign to mobilize voters unhappy with Mr. Bush's environmental record.
One of the points they intend to focus on is the administration's reflexive tendency to interpret the laws in ways that favor private claims over larger public interests. Our own modest hope is that they will also encourage more plain speaking.

 LOVE AND HATE
IN JAMESTOWN
John Smith, Pocahontas,
and the Heart of a New Nation.
By David A. Price.
305 pp. New York:

 "English America was a corporation before it was a country," David A. Price explains in his solid and engaging new history of Jamestown, the first English-speaking colony in North America that managed to survive. Since Price was a business reporter before he turned historian, a reader might expect him to expatiate on how capitalism shaped Jamestown and on the inspiring business model chosen by the Virginia Company, which raised the money to start it. 
The expectation would be disappointed. Price does take advantage of his background: he calculates, for example, that in the initial public offering, a share in the Virginia Company cost between $2,500 and $2,850 in 2001 dollars. But by and large, the business angle on Jamestown doesn't offer much of a view. Colonists were supposed to repay investors by shipping back to England gold and other precious metals and by navigating a water route to the Pacific -- profit centers that happened not to exist. As for management technique, the company forbade its American employees to relay any bad news. It advised colonists to "have great care not to offend the naturals" -- that is, the Native Americans -- and not to let them figure out that 17th-century English guns were louder than they were accurate. In other words, wishful thinking seems to have been its core business. As the company's most volubly disgruntled employee, John Smith, complained many years later when he had safely returned to England, "the Company here thinke all the world was Oatmeale there."
Price focuses instead on the human story of Jamestown, nearly mythic in its resonances, and he interprets it not with market economics but with political philosophy -- in particular, the subfield devoted to negotiations with people who would prefer you dead. At the dawn of the 17th century, the English forswore the brutal tactics of the Spanish, who plundered and enslaved Indians. The Indians did not therefore love the English, however.
If the colonists had landed among disorganized or indecisive tribes, the inhospitality might not have mattered. But Jamestown was located in Tsenacommacah, the empire of Chief Powhatan, a ruthless military leader and brilliant diplomatist who presided over more than two dozen tribes. When captured, feckless colonists were very gradually disjointed and skinned with mussel shells, while they themselves watched, until they expired and were burned at the stake. 
In short, the English had landed in the sort of delicate, high-stakes, multicultural imbroglio that is best handled by an arrogant, contumacious, know-it-all bully. Fortunately, in addition to a number of well-connected gentlemen, the Virginia Company had appointed to the colony's ruling council John Smith, a commoner who had read Machiavelli in his youth, self-consciously, and had fought the Ottoman Turks as a free lance in Eastern Europe. 
One by one, the upper-class councilors failed to lead Jamestown to safety, let alone prosperity. The first president declined to fortify the colony,because he was afraid the local tribes would find it insulting. After they attacked, a palisade was built, but then the colonists mysteriously stopped working. Price speculates that they lost heart, because they had come to America with no purpose higher than moneymaking and it had become evident that Virginia would make none of them rich. 
Smith simply thought they were spoiled. "They would rather starve and rot with idleness," he wrote, "then be perswaded to do anything for their owne reliefe without constraint." Malnutrition aggravated disease, and many died. Finally Smith took charge of building houses, ordering the colonists around and, most important, trading with the Indians for food. 
Remembering his Machiavelli, he always negotiated from a position of strength. When he first approached the neighboring Kecoughtans, they saw no need to pay a high price for his metal goods, because they thought the English were starving and desperate. Smith changed their minds; he would later tell two stories about how he did it. According to the first, he bluffed. He offered to sell at prices that were as scornfully high as the Kecoughtans' were scornfully low, and he handed out gifts to the tribe's children. The Kecoughtans decided he wasn't desperate after all, and the next day Smith was able to bring 16 bushels of corn back to Jamestown. Smith's second version did not feature such subtle psychology. In that account, Smith merely "let fly his muskets, ran his boat on shore, whereat they all fled into the woods." In the scuffle that followed, the English seized an idol sacred to the Kecoughtans, who filled his boat with wild game and bread to ransom it. 
Price adopts the first version and doesn't mention the second. I bet he made the right choice, and dispensing with the grounds for his decision makes for a cleaner tale, but Smith contradicts himself so often that historians used to write him off as a chronic liar, and Price might have said a bit more about the hazards he navigated, here and elsewhere, in taking Smith at his word. 
Smith's word is the only evidence for the most famous episode of his life. In December 1607, still hoping to find a passage to the West Coast, he undertook to survey the Chickahominy River and was captured by one of Powhatan's brothers. He was brought before the emperor and invited to wash his hands and eat. Then he was dragged to two large stones, on which his head was laid. Powhatan's men stood "ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines," Smith later recalled, but before they could strike, "Pocahontas the Kings dearest daughter . . . got his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death." 
Almost all scholars nowadays think Smith was telling the truth about the incident, but many think that he misunderstood what he experienced and that the threat of death was symbolic only, part of a ritual of adoption. Price trusts Smith's judgment. He points out that Smith was the best student of Algonquian language and culture that the English had and would have ample opportunity afterward to correct his first impression if it turned out to have been mistaken. 
Knowledge was a valuable weapon to Smith, because he and Powhatan threatened, deceived, provoked and double-crossed each other constantly. Price reduces the dizzying series of feints and blows to a vigorous, straightforward tale. While Smith was in charge (he finally became president himself in September 1608), the conflict between Indians and English resembles that between Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner -- astonishingly little blood is spilled, considering the extreme situations into which they maneuver each other. Smith took to heart the Machiavellian precept that it is better to be feared than loved. "The alternative to intimidation was not love and friendship," Price explains; "it was open war -- which the English, in 1608, would have lost to the last man." 
Management, however, did not appreciate Smith's achievement. Nor had he won friends in high places by his edict to the gentry of Jamestown that "he that will not worke shall not eate." He was cashiered in September 1609. Almost as soon as he sailed out of Chesapeake Bay, relations with the tribes went from Coyote versus Road Runner to Freddy versus Jason: no one previously knew that so much gore was possible. The English attitude toward the Indians abruptly soured. Soon the colonists were using fife and drum to lure them into lethal ambushes and ordering the execution of captive women and children. 
In later life Smith became a publicist for North America. He returned to the continent only once, to map the coastline of New England, and the second half of Price's book is concerned largely with the history of Indian-English relations in Virginia after he left, including the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe, the Englishman who at last figured out what would make Virginia profitable -- tobacco. In 1614 the company brought Pocahontas on a publicity tour to England, where she caught a pulmonary infection, which the coal dust in London's air rendered fatal. The colony that she helped to save survived, but not as a business. James I, who liked neither tobacco nor the republican politics of the company's C.E.O., dissolved its charter in 1624. 
In a late chapter, "March 22, 1622: Skyfall," Price recounts how Powhatan's brother devised the massacre of between a quarter and a third of the English colonists in Virginia on a single day. (The chapter title and Price's tone bring 9/11 to mind.) When Smith heard about the massacre, he volunteered to lead an army that would drive the Indians back. The Virginia Company didn't take up his offer, but it probably wouldn't have helped if they had. By then Smith's understanding of the Indians had coarsened, in step with his country's.

 SAVING THE SUN
A Wall Street Gamble to Rescue Japan
From Its Trillion-Dollar Meltdown.
By Gillian Tett.
Illustrated. 337 pp. New York:
HarperBusiness. $26.95.
 MORE than a decade after the air first began gushing out of the Japanese economy, the country still hasn't recovered. Economists have debated many technical fixes. But in "Saving the Sun," her narrative of an American private equity fund's takeover of Japan's Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB), Gillian Tett suggests that the barriers to recovery are more cultural than economic. Japan's problem, according to Tett, is the deeply held belief that risk and reward must be shared, that group cohesion trumps strict economic considerations. 
Tett, a correspondent for The Financial Times of London, diagnoses the economic problem thus: Japan's banks lent indiscriminately throughout the postwar period, especially during the boom years of the 1980's. During that time they had little regard for standard banking considerations -- like a client's ability to pay back a loan. The trouble was that this led to huge overcapacity, since borrowers never had to explain how they might generate returns on the bank's investment. That's where Japan's culture of socialized risk comes in. In a well-functioning economy, the banks would have pulled the plug on their worst borrowers in order to redeploy capital more productively later on. In Japan, the idea of letting longtime borrowers fend for themselves was anathema. The banks kept throwing good money after bad, in hopes that the economy would improve and the delinquent borrowers become profitable.
To American eyes, of course, the flip side of economic inefficiency is economic opportunity. And that more or less sums up how Tim Collins, the politically well-connected manager of a highly profitable "vulture fund" called Ripplewood, saw the Japanese banking system in the late 1990's. In the spring of 2000, Collins and his partner, Chris Flowers, a mergers and acquisition specialist from Goldman Sachs, took control of the recently nationalized LTCB. 
Needless to say, there was trouble from the get-go. Tett describes how efforts to convince the Japanese that Ripplewood intended to reform, not cannibalize, LTCB (subsequently rechristened Shinsei Bank) came undone at the company's first press conference. After Flowers answered his cell phone while a high-ranking Japanese official was speaking, the local press became convinced that he had arranged the call to put the official in his place. 
Tett, who began her career as an anthropologist, has a keen eye for these details. She recounts, for example, the horror of the Japanese bankers at finding a team of Indian technology experts, whom the Americans had hired, casing the Shinsei headquarters in search of new efficiencies. Perhaps the most comic scene in the book comes just after the takeover, when Vernon Jordan (one of Collins's many high-powered friends) joins a couple of American executives for lunch in the company cafeteria. Trying to be friendly, Jordan et al. sit down at a table of low-level secretaries and commence making small talk. Their efforts elicit only frozen stares. 
But the biggest flashpoint between the Americans and the Japanese comes, not surprisingly, over the issue of liquidating bad loans. During their negotiations with the Japanese government, Collins and Flowers had insisted on a provision that would protect them from being swallowed up by LTCB's loan portfolio. In response, the government offered what's known as a "put," meaning the Americans were entitled to return any loan they deemed "nonperforming" in exchange for a kind of refund. The catch was that the Japanese never intended for Shinsei actually to use the put; in Japanese culture, a bank was expected to stand by its major borrowers through thick and thin. Shinsei created a national scandal the first time it handed back a loan. 
Throughout the saga, Tett implies that the attempt to impose American-style capitalism on the Japanese amounted to a misunderstanding of the implications of culture for economics. "Flowers -- like most of the Shinsei investors -- did not give much credence to the idea that Japan needed to be special," Tett writes, with a hint of a sneer. "Money was money." She suggests that the wiser approach would have been a kind of third way to restructuring the nation's banks -- much like the Scandinavian countries' approach to their own financial crises in the early 1990's. Indeed, when Shinsei finally begins showing signs of life, Tett concludes that it has stumbled upon a uniquely Japanese approach to reform -- more gradual, more respectful of consensus. Her point here seems to be either that no economic system can function if it's not in tune with a country's cultural values, or that radical economic change can really be accomplished only through cultural change. 
But is this true? It's not clear. The Scandinavian reforms Tett alludes to were actually a lot like what the Ripplewood team had in mind for Japan. In Sweden, the government either took over or bailed out major banks, stripped them of their problem loans and then returned the banks to the private sector as quickly as possible. Moreover, the supposedly welfare-state-loving Swedes managed to cut costs and rationalize management like regular Wall Street raiders. 
Likewise for Japan. What Tett sees as the third way seems to me a lot more to me like the "American way," perhaps with a slight Japanese sheen. Yes, Shinsei's American managers learned to be slightly more tactful with their Japanese colleagues and clients. But none of the progress Shinsei made between March 2000 and March 2003, as the proportion of bad loans in its portfolio fell from over 20 percent to roughly 5 percent, could have been accomplished had the Japanese not come around to the "American way" of thinking -- namely, that a bank can't stay afloat if it's not figuring out which customers are likely to pay it back.
Perhaps Tett was guided by an anthropologist's identification with her subjects. Some of the most moving passages in the book revolve around Katsunobu Onogi, an ousted LTCB president who was torn between his fidelity to tradition and his knowledge that the bank's practices were unsustainable. Yet what she sees as cultural obstacles to reform look more like convenient excuses by reluctant politicians and executives. It seems that economics isn't nearly as constrained by culture as she suggests. Or that a culture can change pretty quickly when it has to.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
Two More Business Incubators Are in the Works

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
TWO business incubators -- developments that combine commercial real estate, government-supported economic development and academic research -- are being added to the eight that have already been developed on Long Island over the last decade.
 In eastern Suffolk County, an incubator that would relate to the farming and fishing industries is near completion. Situated in Calverton on a heavily treed portion of the former Grumman plant, where military aircraft were once assembled, the 15,800-square-foot building will include new businesses in the agricultural, aquaculture and environmental technology industries. It will be managed by Stony Brook University, which has operated an incubator for fledgling companies in the high-technology and biomanufacturing industries on its campus since 1992. 
 Another incubator, which is in the planning stages in western Nassau, will serve the bioscience industry. It is to be at I.park, a 1.4-million-square-foot office and industrial complex in Lake Success. 
In the past 20 years, incubators have become a popular economic development tool aimed at helping new businesses survive until they can become profitable, with a long-term hope that they will enhance a region's economy by staying in the area as they expand. The incubators offer space at below-market rents and are usually situated in an academic setting, where the companies have access to research.
Of about 950 incubators operating in the United States, 75 are in New York State, according to the National Business Incubation Association, a nonprofit group based in Athens, Ohio. 
That group and the Long Island Incubator Council list eight different incubators on Long Island, including six operating under state-assisted programs, like the one at Stony Brook and another at Farmingdale State University. In 2002, those six incubators had a total of 57 tenant companies, 699 employees and $72 million in revenues, according to Ann-Marie Scheidt, chairman of the Long Island Regional Incubator Council. 
The Calverton incubator is expected to benefit local industry on the East End, said State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, a Republican from Selden, who was instrumental in securing the $3.5 million in state grants paying for the construction of the incubator. "There is a symbiotic relationship with the farming and fishing communities, and the companies that establish here would use the sea and land plants, for example, for pharmaceuticals," he said.
It is hoped that once a company is ready to expand and leave the incubator space, it would find a home in the adjacent Epcal industrial park, Senator LaValle said. 
He added that there are "sufficient incentives to locate there because it is an Empire Zone" -- a state-designated economic development area that offers its tenants such benefits as tax abatements, reduced utility rates and sales tax exemptions.
The building, which could accommodate 20 tenants, was designed by Ehasz Giacalone Architects, based in Farmingdale. It will have eight aquaculture labs, 269 to 600 square feet; seven environmental labs with a salt water supply, ranging from 290 to 1,200 square feet; and five 150-square-foot offices. There will also be a 1,226-square-foot lecture hall that could be partitioned off into four classrooms and a conference area. The building has been designed to allow for a 40,000-square-foot expansion, Mr. LaValle said.
Tenants will have access to all Stony Brook University facilities and personnel, local Cornell Cooperative Extension research farms and the nearby Brookhaven National Laboratories.
Once an advisory board is created for the Calverton incubator, the rents, leases and criteria for tenancy will be established, said Monique Gablenz, executive director of Riverhead's Industrial Development Agency. When construction is completed, the state will receive title to the property. 
So far, there have been five applicants, Ms. Gablenz said. They include a company that plans to grow European sea bass in indoor tanks and an ornithologist who is interested in office and outdoor space for recording birds and other wildlife, in the interest of developing acoustic monitoring projects for the Department of Homeland Security.
THE incubator is on a 50-acre portion of the sprawling 2,900-acre Grumman site, which was owned by the Navy until it gave the property to the town of Riverhead in 1998.
In 2001, the property's 491-acre industrial core was sold for $17 million to an East Meadow developer, Jan Burman. It included 18 industrial buildings totaling 900,000 square feet on 225 acres, which have since been sold, according to Jack O'Connor, a senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company that is marketing the property.
Currently, Riverhead is in the process of approving the subdivision of the entire industrial property. The undeveloped section is zoned for a building on five acres.
Of the industrial site's remaining undeveloped 267 acres, 60 have been dedicated as a conservation area, 75 are in contract, and the other 132 acres will be divided into 12 lots, including one that is 95 acres.
The West Babylon developer Robert Birnbaum, who purchased one of the existing buildings, is planning to construct up to five buildings on 35 acres totaling 300,000 square feet of industrial space for 60 to 65 tenants. The spaces would range from 2,500 to 10,000 square feet. "This wouldbe the perfect place where companies at the incubator could expand to," Mr. O'Connor said. "Once the subdivision is approved, we expect other developers will look to the same theme."
Rental space that could be divided into smaller units is also available in some of the existing buildings, he added.
Land at the site sells for $125,000 an acre today compared with $60,000 an acre in 2001, he said. Market rents for industrial space in the area -- for an average 5,000-square-foot unit -- is about $6.50 to $7 a square foot a year.
About 35 miles west at I.park, the 35,000-square-foot $6 million incubator and a training center are being developed by a nonprofit public-private partnership called Bio Partners Initiative, which involves Nassau County, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and I.park.
The training center would "train and retrain workers to support the life science and biotechnology industry in Nassau County," said Peter Sylver, Nassau's deputy county executive for economic development. And the incubator would offer start-up space for companies in the bioscience, clinical-trial and pharmaceutical industries. Annual rents are expected to be about $19 to $21 a square foot, Mr. Sylver said.
Long Island's established incubators include Stony Brook University's Long Island High Technology Incubator, which has "graduated" more than 20 tenants. At least 15 have remained on Long Island, including the Collaborative Group, which makes ingredients for the cosmetic, personal care, pharmaceutical and biotechnical industry. 
According to Dr. Scheidt, who is the university's director of economic development, Collaborative began more that 10 years ago with less than 1,000 square feet of space and two part-time employees. It has grown to a company with 200 employees and four subsidiaries.
These units' sites include the incubator's entire 30,000-square-foot wing, added in 1994 to the original 42,000-square-foot one-story building, which was built in 1992. "It is good to have successes as anchor tenants for the other companies to model themselves after, and network with," Dr. Scheidt said.
In Farmingdale, the 63,500-square-foot incubator at Broad Hollow Bioscience Park, which is on 20 acres on the campus of the Farmingdale State University, is planning to add a new 50,000-square-foot building. It would have space for six start-up companies and for the school's new bioscience program, according to Greg Blyskal, the park's executive director.
The three-year-old incubator, which focuses on bioscience companies, is a collaborative venture of the school and the nearby Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a leading biological research institution. 
About three miles west, at Briarcliffe College in Bethpage, a 17,556-square-foot technology incubator is managed by the nonprofit Long Island Software and Technology Network, known as Listnet. Four years ago, the state paid $500,000 for the creation of the incubator, which is on the college's second floor. It is fully occupied, with 17 tenants, which pay $15.50 a square foot in rent and have free Internet access. Six companies have graduated since the incubator was created, according to Pattie Simon, the manager.

To the Editor:
Thanks to Amy Harmon "What Price Music?," Oct. 12 , I have written my first food article, "What Price Meat?" In it I expose restaurants like Peter Luger for charging $20 to $30 for a pound of meat when McDonald's sells a pound of the stuff for a few bucks and manages to throw in bun, lettuce, tomato and pickle. 
 An original copy of "Revolver" may have cost $4.50 in 1966, and adjusted for inflation that might equal $26, but were you to buy a clean, original British copy today it might set you back well over $100. Why? You'd have to hear it played back properly, look at it and touch it to understand. Thirty-seven years from now, what do you think those MP3 files will fetch? 
 I've taken an absurdist tack here, but consider what reducing recorded music to an undifferentiated commodity does to the musicians and the recording, mixing and mastering engineers who produce it (not to mention listeners who appreciate the difference between quality and convenience). Don't get me wrong: I use and enjoy my iPod, and I eat fast-food burgers, but I never confuse them with a gourmet meal.

$870 Million Development Under Way in Hartford

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
ADRIAEN'S LANDING, the roughly $870 million riverfront development that was perceived for years as a quixotic idea, is at last under construction in downtown Hartford. 
 As the centerpiece of a broader plan by Gov. John G. Rowland for sparking a downtown renaissance, Adriaen's Landing replaces a brownfield site with three major components: a convention center, a hotel and a retail-entertainment-apartment complex. 
 "Our Hartford program," said Governor Rowland, "is all about generating this economic ripple effect. We set up the authority to strategically invest public funds to leverage new private investment in the market -- from hotels to apartments to jobs." 
The 30-acre tract, bounded by Interstate 95, Whitehead Highway, Prospect Street, Grove Street and Columbus Boulevard (excluding the Travelers Plaza), overlooks the Connecticut River and a five-mile park where people picnic, attend concerts and festivals and board riverboat cruises named for the city's favorite son, Mark Twain. 
The program is administered by the Capital City Economic Development Authority, whose chairman, R. Bartley Halloran, described its method of attracting investment. "A private developer is building the Hartford Marriott," he said, "because we are building the Connecticut Convention Center. Private developers are building retail because we're helping build apartment units and bringing in conventioneers. A private developer renovated half the G. Fox department store because we turned the other half into the Capital City College campus. As soon as the steel started to rise on the Convention Center, we saw entrepreneurs jumping in." The rest of G. Fox has been turned into a complex of offices, stores and restaurants.
In recent weeks, passers-by along Columbus Boulevard, which runs through Adriaen's Landing, have paused to gape at the steel skeleton delineating the massive bowed facade of the 500,000-square-foot Convention Center under construction. The $190 million glass-sheathed building, which already has 12 advance bookings, will have a 140,000-square-foot exhibition hall, a 40,000-square-foot ballroom and 65,000 square feet of meeting space. The remainder will be circulation areas, kitchens and utility and technology systems. Underground parking and a new garage behind the center will accommodate 2,360 cars of the 3,400 spaces in Adriaen's Landing over all.
While the center will have its own entrance, it will also have a common entrance with the $77 million, 22-story Marriott Hotel, which broke ground on Sept. 25. Initially, the hotel will have 409 rooms and eight luxury suites, but it is designed so that an ell could be added to raise the room count to 700. An enclosed indoor swimming pool and fitness center will be on the roof, and there will be two restaurants and a bar and 13,500 square feet of meeting and banquet space. The buildings are expected to open simultaneously in mid-2005. 
THE project is named for Adriaen Bloch, a Dutch explorer who sailed up the Connecticut River in the early 1600's and landed near the area that is now being developed.
Adriaen's Landing "is our subsidiary and owner of the hotel," said Len Wolman, chairman and chief executive of the Waterford Group, master planners of the development. "We will manage the hotel, and we have a contract to manage the convention center for the state. The hotel will be a few notches above anything else in the city and a bit more expensive." 
Waterford Group provided $22 million for the hotel construction, with the rest coming from loans from several banks and the Connecticut Development Authority. The Waterford Group developed and operates the Mohegan Sun Casino in Montville, Conn., and 29 other hotel properties in 12 states.
The third component of Adriaen's Landing is Market Square, the new name for Front Street, a nine-acre marketplace that flourished a century ago with immigrants who opened barbershops, saloons, grocery stores and other small businesses. It was razed in the 1950's and will be resurrected by Capital Properties of New York with 150,000 square feet of shops, night clubs, restaurants and 200 market-rate rental apartments in several buildings. 
Excavation of the lot has begun. The rear of the defunct Hartford Times building will be demolished, but the imposing stone front will be preserved and the remaining structure will become office space. Construction is to begin early next year. 
According to Daniel S. Matos, a principal, Capital Properties is investing up to $150 million in Market Square, and the state is contributing $50 million to build two roads through it and two garages. His company is also rehabilitating Constitution Plaza, outside Adriaen's Landing on State Street. Built in the 1960's, it required the razing of a number of ethnic neighborhoods but never fulfilled its promise as an office, retail and hotel complex. "We bought a partnership interest in it in 1999," Mr. Matos said, "and now that there is a market for those things, we are upgrading it."
The idea for Adriaen's Landing goes back to the 1990's, when Hartford, like the state's other largest cities, Bridgeport and New Haven, was extraordinarily beleaguered. From the 1950's to 2000, an exodus to the suburbs caused Hartford's population to shrink from 175,000 to 129,229, reducing the residential tax base and worsening the burden for retailers, restaurants and businesses, causing many to leave. Even the insurance companies, heavily invested in real estate, became victims of the real estate meltdown of the 80's and early 90's.
In 1997 Robert Fiondella, president of the Phoenix Insurance Company, suggested to the heads of the Travelers and Connecticut Natural Gas that an urban development by the river would be good for the city. The two insurance companies are adjacent to the Adriaen's Landing site, and the gas company, which was later demolished, was on it. 
The plan became part of the governor's proposals to aid downtown Hartford. Last year the State Legislature authorized issuing $645 million in bonds, of which $92 million paid for building Rentschler Field, which opened in August as the stadium for the University of Connecticut for outdoor sports and concerts. Another $425 million was allocated to Adriaen's Landing property acquisition, environmental remediation and building the Convention Center. The remaining $148 million is for renovating the Hartford Civic Center and developing 100 units of housing on Trumbull Street.
The Landing's location makes it part of awalkable city center, near several prestigious institutions. Across Prospect Street or within a block or two are the Wadsworth Atheneum, America's oldest art museum; the award-winning Hartford Stage Company; Center Church, founded in 1636, and its ancient burying ground; the Old State House, built in 1796; and Bushnell Park, America's first public park. 
Creating housing that will bring people back to live is the No. 1 priority of Mayor Eddie A. Perez, a Democrat, formerly of New York City and originally from Puerto Rico. He looks forward to the completion of 3,000 units of housing now in the pipeline or under construction and retail establishments to serve them. 
"The first grocery store downtown is planned for Front Street," he said. A "gap" program is intended to increase home ownership in some of the worst neighborhoods surrounding downtown, including Mortson Putnam and Frog Hollow, where the Latin Kings and Solidos gangs once reigned. Subsidies from HUD and the Connecticut Housing and Finance Authority are filling the gap between a private developer's cost of, say, restoring a two-family house for around $230,000, and a sale price of $130,000. 
Owners must occupy one unit for 10 years, and each year a tenth of the mortgage loan is forgiven. Corporate commitments totaling $1.97 million are dedicated to Hartford's home ownership program. 
Ken Greenberg, an international urban planner in Toronto, was a consultant and recommended some of the initiatives Hartford is taking, like "getting people down on the sidewalks." Hartford has a number of pedestrian skyways between buildings. 
Other new housing includes the renovation of the Hartford Civic Center by Northland Investments of Newton, Mass. The arena will have market rate apartments on two sides. College Street L.L.C. of New Haven is converting the Southern New England Telephone building into 55 on the Park, with 135 apartments, and 77 have been rented. Prices range from $942 to $1,600 for spacious one- and two-bedroom units.
William Farley, a Hartford real estate executive since 1961, now president of the New England region of CB Richard Ellis, drives by the emerging convention center every day. "It represents a whole new layer of activity," he said, "but apartments will drive commercial development. It's a matter of getting residential density downtown. As young people move in, employers are saying downtown is more favorable as an office location."

HEADLINE: Here Come The Glamour Gumshoes 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
FOR a seasoned private investigator like RichardDietl, it was a standard case. A wealthy Greenwich, Conn., executive was desperate to find his 15-year-old daughter, who ran away to follow the band Phish. Mr. Dietl knew that the easiest way to track her down was to go undercover as a tie-dyed Phish fan. But for someone his age (52) and sartorial tastes (pinstripes with white collars and French cuffs), blending in wasn't an option.
 So Mr. Dietl called upon a 24-year-old associate, Sean Lanigan. Mr. Lanigan flew to Las Vegas, where Phish was playing. He disguised himself as a hippie, hit the parking lot party scene and soon found the girl -- selling peanut butter and jelly sandwiches from the back of a Volkswagen van. By nightfall, her father was on board his private jet, on his way to pick her up. 
 "You send in a 40-, 45-year-old retired police officer, he looks suspicious," Mr. Lanigan said. "When you see me, your first impression is not 'This guy's a cop.' " 
In the old days, private investigation firms were staffed mostly by former police officers supplementing their pensions with a little gumshoe work. But times, along with the investigation and security industry, have changed. Private investigators now devote themselves to corporate background checks, high-tech surveillance, retrieving deleted e-mail messages from company hard drives and, of course, the occasional old-style sleuthing, like trailing cheating spouses. 
These new snoops are more likely to have liberal arts or computer science degrees than experience walking a beat. They're much more likely to pack iPods than .38 Specials. And unlike Jake Gittes, the reluctant P.I. played by Jack Nicholson in "Chinatown," who urges the suspicious wife Mrs. Mulwray to "let sleeping dogs lie," today's young sleuths comb through databases to learn the particulars of private lives with the same sense of eagerness with which they might Google their next dates or play the latest edition of Grand Theft Auto.
"It's exciting and voyeuristic to be looking into people's lives." said Amy Gray, 28, a graduate of Brown, who wrote about her three years as a private investigator in "Spygirl" (Villard). "The work intrinsically has a satisfying quality of solving a puzzle or playing a video game. There's a 'getting the bad guys' kind of feeling."
In recent years the number of college students studying forensic science has boomed, in part because media portrayals of private eyes and crime solvers in shows like "CSI" and "Cold Case" have glamorized the field, especially its computer-driven technical side. Where in the past P.I.'s were portrayed as "fumbling, bumbling people," said Robert J. Louden, a professor of science and protection management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, "more and more they're showing digital video and the use of electronic devices, which portrays it as high-tech and exciting."
Another reason is simple economic opportunity. Although there are no statistics about employment in the risk management industry -- as private investigation companies now call themselves -- many firms say that in the wake of last year's corporate scandals and the threat of terrorism, the paranoia business is booming. Revenues at Kroll, a 2,300-employee company with offices around the globe, were up nearly 40 percent in 2002, to $289 million, compared with 2001. Robert Tucker, 33, who is the chairman and chief executive of T&M Protection Resources, one of New York City's largest security and investigations firms, said his company now has 800 employees, six times as many as it had in 1999. 
"If you're good at it, there's an untold amount of work," he said.
Perhaps the biggest change has been in the industry itself, which has come to favor computer-savvy database wizards over the old-school door-knocking detective. Mike Pattishall, 26, a researcher at Corporate Risk International in Fairfax, Va., said that by searching the online services his company subscribes to, he can get the skinny -- court records, motor vehicle information, property filings, even photographs -- on almost anyone.
"Where in the past it required sending a field agent out to gather information," he said, "now 9 times out of 10 you can find it online."
A walk around the Midtown office of Beau Dietl & Associates, Mr. Dietl's firm, paints a vivid picture of this new way of sleuthing. While former police officers occupy the corner offices -- law enforcement plaques on their walls, pistols on their desks -- a group of people in their 20's with "Law & Order" looks sit in a row of cubicles, clicking away at computer terminals and checking resumes of potential hires of Fortune 500 companies to see, for example, if they really graduated from the schools they list. 
Around town, other investigation firms have similarly youthful staffs. At BackTrack Reports, a background checking firm with offices in a Flatiron district loft, most of the staff members are in their 20's, according to the company's president, Chris Manthey, 37, and no one is older than 40. Mr. Tucker of T&M Protection said that his company employs perhaps 100 people in their 20's, mostly as researchers, to work alongside former F.B.I. agents and police officers.
At Kroll, only about 5 percent of the employees are former police officers, said Jules B. Kroll, the company chairman. The rest, he said, "are the same people who go for analyst positions at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, consulting positions at McKinsey or paralegal positions at top law firms."
At Beau Dietl & Associates, the young researchers are supervised by Frank Renaud, who has a Ph.D. in economics and whose desk is neatly stacked a foot high with color-coded case files. Mr. Renaud said he is less interested in the educational backgrounds of job candidates than in their curiosity.
"I like people who play chess and do crossword puzzles, people trained to ask questions," he said. Starting salaries at a large firm can range from $35,000 to $50,000, depending on experience and expertise. Top-notch investigators can make well into six figures.
Jennifer Elliott, 24, a researcher on Mr. Renaud's team, said that in the course of her computer searches, she had found executives at prominent companies who lied about their college educations. ("We got 'em," she said.) She has been on a couple of surveillances and has found she is good at what the industry refers to as "pretext calls" -- calling people under false pretenses to get information from them. 
"People will tell you anything about themselves," she said.
Ms. Elliott said there is an additional benefit to her job -- telling dates what she does for a living. "I guess you could say they're impressed," she said.
A few desks over, Stephen Heskett, 27 a graduate of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy -- "My formal training," he says -- is working on behalf of a businessman who says he was wrongly accused of attempted murder by a jilted former spouse. Mr. Heskett is out to establish that the accuser is unstable, and he says he is well on his way.
"I don't have a gun and we never jump on cars," Mr. Heskett said when asked if the job lived up to its television billing. "The only weapons we have are laptops."
About 1 of every 10 background checks shows something negative in a person's past, said Peter Turacek, 35, a managing director at Kroll. Many times, he said, the company that asked for the background check ignores alarming information. Mr. Turacek once discovered that a subject was a "bag man" in a murder for hire, but his client was unfazed.
"They said, 'It was 15 years ago,' " he said.
While the majority of P.I. work takes place on a computer, there is still the occasional need for old-school sleuthing, and even that pursuit has been made easier by technology. Mr. Lanigan, the surveillant, has a trove of electronic eavesdropping gadgets, including a pair of sunglasses with a pinhole video camera mounted in the bridge. (He also has a more traditional implement: a gun.) Mr. Lanigan has gone undercover at a nursing home as a janitor; he once caught a 78-year-old woman being unfaithful to her 80-year-old husband; he tailed a rabbi recovering from sex addiction to make sure he had not reverted to his old ways (he had not). And more than once, Mr. Lanigan has had to tell a tearful, suspicious wife that her husband is cheating. "You never like to tell anybody that their worst fears are confirmed," he said. "But it's part of the job."
Mr. Dietl said he is careful to give recruits a reality check about what they can expect if he senses they've been watching too much "CSI."
"A lot of young people are getting the idea from TV that this life is more glamorous than it really is," he said. "The majority of it is tedious work." Even surveillance can be dull, he said. "You're out there for 12 hours looking at a freakin' door."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Is There Still Growth On These Menus?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
IN the post-Sept. 11 world, many Americans have made it plain that eating away from home should no longer be considered discretionary.
 Despite concerns that people would stay home because of anxiety over their safety or the economy, spending at restaurants has held up well during the last two years, in what is now a $300 billion to $400 billion industry. 
 This year, a Bear Stearns unweighted index of 26 restaurant stocks has been up 19.2 percent. A number of companies, like McDonald's, up 50 percent, have increased much more than that. 
Joseph Buckley, a restaurant analyst at Bear Stearns, discussed whether there is still some sizzle in the stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Why didn't people stop going out to eat after 9/11?

A. Eating away from home has become such an important part of everyday life. Currently, close to half the dollars spent on food are spent on meals away from home. That is a dramatic shift over the last three or four decades.
 The move to two-wage-earner families, and the fact that baby boomers have grown up with the chains, many of which are about to celebrate their 50th birthdays, are other reasons. 
 In short, dining out has become so ingrained in the American lifestyle that it is cut back very begrudgingly, if at all.

Q. Is the restaurant business still growing?

A. Some parts of it are. In the casual dining sector, which is defined as an average check of $10 to $20 with full service and having alcohol as an option, growth has been great. As America has shifted its food budget to spending more and more away from home, they have become more sophisticated in their spending.
 But the quick service sector is a mature business. For most of these companies, cash from existing stores is far greater than what they can reinvest in the business in general, including new stores.

Q. Why have restaurant stocks done so nicely this year?

A. There has been a resurgence in the fast food sector.
 Last year sales were aggravated due to very intense price discounting, led by McDonald's. Prices softened in the middle of 2002, and they stayed soft until about the middle of this year. So many of these stocks started their move upward from pretty low levels.

Q. Have healthier menu choices helped the quick service companies?

A. Over the last year or so, salads have played a significant role in driving sales at McDonald's and Wendy's. It will be interesting to see if the consumer continues to buy them.

Q. Have events of the past couple of years had an adverse effect on international sales of fast-food chains?

A. Very few of these companies have a significant international business. McDonald's is by far the biggest. Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, has a presence, and Starbucks is trying to develop an international business.
 McDonald's international business has been soft, but I don't think it is because of what has happened since 9/11. 
 Of their three major European markets, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, France has been the best. And there has been more tension between the United States and France than the others. International business at Yum, which is much more skewed to Asia, has been very strong.

Q. Will restaurant chains pay bigger dividends?

A. There will be much more significant dividend payments. Last month, McDonald's raised its dividend by 70 percent, to 40 cents from 23 cents. The reason they are going to do it is because now they are more mature businesses, they don't need the cash flow.
Yum doesn't pay a dividend now, but we think they will initiate one in the next 12 to 18 months. Wendy's pays a small dividend now, and we think it is likely to increase it. The same is true for Applebee's.

Q. Which individual stocks do you especially like?

A. We like McDonald's and Yum in quick service, and Applebee's and Brinker, which has an investment banking relationship with Bear Stearns, in the casual dining area. We are looking for improved sales at McDonald's and Yum.
 We think consensus sales estimates for McDonald's are too low. As a result, we think there is further upside to the stock. Yum has transitioned from a financial restructuring story to an operating story. Investor perception has lagged that change. 
 Brinker has a very broad restaurant portfolio, which includes Chili's, Macaroni Grill and On the Border. They can grow units at 10 to 12 percent, which is well above average for the industry. 
 We like the franchising model at Applebee's. And their takeout business has been a catalyst for growth.

HEADLINE: The Two Worlds Of Justin Moore 

BYLINE:  By LAUREL GROSS

 BODY:
JUSTIN MOORE, a 27-year-old transplant from Florida who came to New York nearly three years ago, talks about his goals as if he has already achieved them. All he has ever wanted to be is a rock star, and he may have what it takes. Slinky and lean, with silky dark hair and a mysterious scar on his left cheek, he radiates charm and a certain bad-boy mystique. There is something sweet about him, too. 
 Leaning across the counter of Mail Boxes Etc., the package and mailing store on Eighth Avenue near West 12th Street in Greenwich Village where he has worked for about 15 months, he folds his hands across his chest and looks eager to please. He believes in doing a job well, even a job that involves making a prodigious number of photocopies and drowning in bubble wrap. 
 By night, he is every inch a rock 'n' roller. And even in these tight quarters, it is easy to imagine him on a stage electrifying an audience, his long hair whipping across his face while the music rips, his entire body vibrating as intensely as the strings of his own guitar. 
 For almost three years, Mr. Moore and the band Orange Park have been making the rounds of clubs on the Lower East Side like Arlene Grocery, Don Hill's, Sin-e and Mercury Lounge, as well as Brooklyn night spots like Galapagos in Williamsburg and Southpaw in Park Slope. On Saturday, Orange Park will perform at Luna Lounge on Ludlow Street as part of the annual CMJ Festival. 
 That the band's first gig was atop the World Trade Center, at a party and rock show at Windows on the World, is in some ways deeply telling. The attack of Sept. 11, 2001, combined with a punishing local economy and housing costs that are prohibitive for most young people, have made it ever tougher to chase a dream to the big city. 
 Yet every New York minute, another young hopeful arrives in town yearning to write the ground-breaking novel, to score the hit role, or even the part in the chorus. Even in hard times, it seems, everyone wants to eat breakfast at Tiffany's. 

Heading North in a U-Haul
 The band's journey began in Orange Park, the Jacksonville, Fla., suburb that gave the group its name and the place where Mr. Moore and his three band mates grew up. Justin and his older brother, Jeff, wanted to be rock stars ever since they were little children using hairbrushes as stand-in guitars. Although Justin's only musical training was a year of guitar lessons when he was a child, he was raised in a house filled with music; an uncle was a gospel singer and another relative was a jazz pianist. 
 The Beatles and especially John Lennon were an important influence. 
 "I remember me and my brother sitting on the living floor when we were kids," Mr. Moore said, "and my aunt gave Jeff the Blue and Red albums of the Beatles. We used to lie on the floor and listen to them. I think it was "Sergeant Pepper," where the music gets really crazy at the end and it goes on and on, and we used to just twirl around in circles and get really dizzy and lie down and close our eyes to that last part. And it's like I'll never forget that." 
 By age 15, Justin, along with brother Jeff, a cousin, Jaye Moore, and a high school friend named Chris Harvey, who even back then went by the name Harv, formed a band called the Lysergic Garage Party that performed in local clubs and bars. But the two brothers eventually had what Mr. Moore calls a falling out over who would call the shots in the band, and the group, minus Justin, came north in 1997. 
 The two brothers talked only a few times over a couple of years, Justin recalls. But one night around 3 a.m., he got a call from Jeff, who was living in Williamsburg with the other two band members: Would Justin consider coming to New York to see if they could all work together again? 
 Several weeks later, Justin was heading north in a rented U-Haul with his longtime girlfriend and all his stuff. He arrived the day he left, driving straight through to the city on New Year's Day 2001. Three weeks later, reborn as Orange Park, the four musicians did their first gig together, at Windows on the World. It is weird, Mr. Moore says, to think of it now. 

I'm George, You're Paul
 As with their beloved Beatles, each member of Orange Park has a different persona. There's the angry but sensitive young man (Justin), the quiet one (Harv), the artistic one (Jeff) and, well, the drummer (Jaye). The two brothers share lead vocals, guitar and songwriting duties, and fastidiously alternate their songs in performance and on their two self-produced CD's. 
 These days, the band members perform wearing jeans and T-shirts, and they play as a tight, controlled unit, with a bouncy, melodic sound that is reminiscent of the Beatles; The Village Voice described their music as "enthusiastically dreamy vocal-and-guitar harmony power-pop." Other reviewers have likened Orange Park to Cheap Trick, the Foo Fighters and Dinosaur Jr.
 But in the old days, they used to let it all hang out, almost literally. 
 Mr. Moore once appeared in a show in Jacksonville wearing nothing except his guitar and one of those little aprons that waitresses wear to stash tips. Harv used to wear dresses. 
 "It was partly an excuse to party, you know, drink beer and alcohol and make music," Mr. Moore said. "We always had songs back then, but we were also about going nuts." 
 "You have to keep back a little to actually play well," he said. "It's hard to do that when you're jumping around and freaking out." 

Master of the $2 Expenditure
 Much as Mr. Moore glories in his life as a musician, the personal costs are high. Since coming to New York, he has lost one apartment after another. He has lived in four different places; his last room, in a shared apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, was turned into somebody's darkroom. At the moment he is what he calls "in between homes," staying downtown with a friend. 
 Mr. Moore isn't the only band member with an unlikely job that helps pay the bills. His brother trucks apples from orchards outside the city and delivers them to fancy-food shops. His cousin waits on tables at the Ginger Man restaurant on East 36th Street near Fifth Avenue. Nobody's sure what Harv does for a living. "You have to ask Harv," they say. At least with strangers, Harv doesn't talk much. 
 Mr. Moore might as well have a master's degree in frugality; it seems that no one could make so much of so little. He is master of the $2 expenditure: The $2 meal. The $2 bar beer (Pabst Blue Ribbon). The $2 thrift-shop T-shirts he wears on stage. 
 He is also a master at making several meals out of what most people would consider one. Eight dollars buys spaghetti four times a week. All you need, he says, is "Ragu and three different kinds of pasta shells, and you fool yourself that it's a different meal each time." Other menu options involve turkey sandwiches and cheese. "I like cheese," he says. 
 He is immensely inventive. He used a portable tape recorder to record his songs whenever inspiration struck. When the recorder broke, his solution was phoning in the lyrics and music into his girlfriend's answering machine. 
 Still, in his eyes, the desire to perform and to get his music heard is worth the effort; nothing turns him on the way music does. "Nothing ever came close," he said. "There's no other reason to be here, for me, really. I mean really, literally. There's not." 
 For him, chasing this dream is like being a trapeze artist flying without a net. There's no fallback position, no plan B. Anyway, he added: "This is the only thing that we all thought we were halfway decent at. So we might as well give it everything we have. It's like, what else do we have in this life to do?"

Days Amid the Cartons
 It's a big dream to squeeze into such a small place, and like so many other young people who hold tedious day jobs while trying to make it in the arts, Mr. Moore checks his dreams at the door when he comes to work in the morning. The shop itself is shaped like a mailbox, a narrow sliver of a corridor with a counter at the far end and copier machines flanking the walls. 
 Cartons are stacked up in the window, and from where Mr. Moore stands, it's a long way to the door. Especially at the end of a long day, when the weight of his double life gets the best of him, one gets the feeling that he might like to pack himself into one of those cartons and get himself mailed away, straight to stardom. 
 Mr. Moore is not the only worker at Mail Boxes with a double life; nearly everyone he works with has one; his colleague, Richard Rose, has appeared on television shows like "The Gilmore Girls" and "E.R."; another, Dennis Gereritz, freelances for Latino publications. Jenn Feldman is studying education at Queens College. But most of the customers have no idea what Mr. Moore does when he's off duty. 
 For Mr. Moore, this particular day in midsummer is much like any other. What he wants to do is sing, write songs, play guitar, or all three. Instead he is wrestling with an expensive but ill-behaved modern chair that someone wants to ship somewhere. He has wrapped it carefully in bubble wrap, but it won't fit into any box he tries. 
 What makes this moment more poignant is that Orange Park is about to go on tour, eight cities in 13 days, and Mr. Moore seems edgy. He looks exhausted, from rehearsing and working, and he hasn't been sleeping. For weeks, he has been wired. 
 While Orange Park has been on tour before, often opening for the band Longwave, they have never spent so many days away or gone to so many places. The band will cover 8,700 miles traveling cross country and back; one leg of the return journey, from Montana to Pennsylvania, will require 30 hours of straight driving. At 6-foot-1, Mr. Moore doesn't like long car trips. 
 Meanwhile, he's struggling with that recalcitrant chair. With the help of Ms. Feldman, they finally tuck the thing into a larger box and cut away some of the bubble wrap to reduce the bulk. Mr. Moore takes over the job of pouring in packing peanuts. 
 Even with such a prosaic task, he is a perfectionist, and for good reason: Mistakes that are due to a packer's negligence can be costly; damages can be docked from pay. Mr. Moore takes home $350 a week for working 35 or 40 hours, and every dollar counts. 
 A couple of months after the tour, Mr. Moore was back at Mail Boxes, this time sitting on the curb outside the store. It was a mild September evening, the shop was shut tight for the night, and he was waiting for the band to pick him up in their van. They were going to Luna Lounge to perform, and the boys were running late. 
 Something he had said on another occasion seemed to resonate this evening: 
 "It's like I'm two different people. I feel like a totally different person when I'm walking in with the band, and when I come to work. It's like Clark Kent and Superman. It's just a little hard one night to be signing autographs for fans, and the next day signing a fax for someone." 
 His father, Mack Moore, describes his son's character switch another way.
 "He is a little different when he's at Mail Boxes, or at work," said his father, who works as a headhunter for mortgage banking companies. "He is somewhat reserved, but when he starts performing, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He really gets into it."

Pyrotechnics in the Performance
 The Justin Moore who played Luna Lounge that September evening was anything but reserved. He was as plugged in as his guitar.
 The band doesn't go in for gimmicky costumes or special effects. The pyrotechnics are in the music and the performances. In the big send-off, for example, Jeff's song "Wouldn't Change a Thing," the two brothers unleashed a let-it-all-go dueling guitar riff that made you fear their strings would pop. 
Audience members on the banquettes along the walls leaned forward on their pillows; others climbed on the backs of their seats to get a better view. The floor in front of the stage was a sea of bobbing heads; a female fan, a regular, danced in the front row. 
 The band performs only its own songs, and Mr. Moore seems to write his as a way of making sense of the people in his life, especially the women. Some of those songs can be heard on the band's Web site, www.orangeparkmusic.com.
 "The song 'Glass' is about a girl I was with at the time," he said, "and I realized that I could never really figure her out, which is so weird to me. When you look at someone and see how they are, and it's like, 'You live your life in a box made of locks' and I could never figure out the combination." 
 "Once in My Life" tells the story of the wrenching breakup of a long relationship. It was inspired, Mr. Moore said, by the end of his affair with the woman who came north with him and with whom he had lived for seven years. 
 What to say and what you said 
 Words have gone and love is dead 
I wish that I would have known 
 What to say and what to do 
 When everything has died in you, 
 I wish that I would have known. 
 At the time of the breakup, he said, he felt pretty hopeless about everything. But, he explained: "Those seven years, and all that I went through afterward, was worth it to get that three minutes of song. No matter how awful life gets, it's O.K. if you get a good song out of it. The situation fades away. But the song lasts forever."

Why the City Has All Those Cars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "No Room to Vroom: New Memories of Gridlock Past" (Oct. 12): The return of gridlock to Midtown is not a result of New York's economic recovery, but due to actions taken by the city in the past year that encourage the use of motor vehicles. 
The city looked the other way while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority drastically raised transit fares. It sidelined the plan to replace the 9/11 car pool restrictions with congestion pricing modeled after the scheme used in London. 
 Public transit is already the dominant of mode of travel to Manhattan's central business district, accounting for 88 percent of the 1.3 million people in the area at midday. Mass transit is an acceptable way to travel, and the city ought to help make it more popular by charging a modest fee for drivers and using the proceeds to improve mass transit. With fewer cars, the city could allocate more street space for pedestrians, greatly improving the economic viability of its central business district.

The Fabric of Lubbock's Life

 BODY:
Lubbock is a rock-solid, conservative kind of place, located where northwest Texas meets the southernmost part of the great American plains. Its citizens like to think of themselves as self-reliant straight talkers. It seems strange, then, to think of this region as a sprawling welfare case. 
 But the cotton farms that give Lubbock much of its identity thrive from huge government subsidies that drain the federal treasury and shelter the industry from the discipline of the market. The rest of the world rightfully regards those subsidies as unfair to poor countries, whose cotton farmers cannot compete against the below-cost prices at which American cotton sells. 
 America's cotton farmers are currently at the center of an international outcry against the way rich countries rig the trade game with protective tariffs or agricultural subsidies. "Judging by what's written in some Eastern newspapers you'd think I murdered my parents or something," says Ronnie Hopper, a cotton grower in nearby Petersburg. Mr. Hopper, 57, grows some of the most coveted cotton in the world on a 2,500-acre high-tech farm. But most years his costs exceed the global price, which is why he has relied on nearly a half-million dollars of subsidies since 1995.
"Why do you want to get rid of me?" asked Mr. Hopper, who works hard and plays by the rules as the government sets them. Like many farmers who receive subsidies -- a glaring exception to America's ostensible free-market values -- he argues that the United States needs some agricultural self-sufficiency and that no cotton farmer could break even at market prices.
Indefensible as the subsidies are, it's impossible not to feel sympathy for his situation. Lubbock is in the heart of the national cotton belt, and the idea that the United States is no longer well positioned to grow cotton at all is shocking in the top-producing cotton state, where in Dallas last weekend, Texas played Oklahoma in the venerable Cotton Bowl.
There is actually no sign that American cotton farmers are going to suffer from anything but hurt feelings in the short run. The 2002 farm bill's complex cotton subsidies will continue at least until 2007, giving farmers the right to a direct payment of 6 cents for every pound of upland cotton, plus loans pegged at 52 cents a pound. Besides helping growers pay off their loans if the price dips below that, Uncle Sam then makes what are known as countercyclical payments to allow farmers to obtain a lofty "target price" of 72 cents a pound. All told, with this web of federal supports -- which can exceed $3 billion in some years -- American taxpayers often end up footing as much as two-thirds of the cost of growing America's exported cotton. 
This helps the United States, among the world's highest-cost cotton producers, rank first in exports. Dumped abroad at below cost, our cotton depresses prices and hurts farmers in poor nations like Mali or Burkina Faso that cannot set aspirational "target prices."
African farmers are aware that they are competing in a fixed game -- many believe, incorrectly, that President Bush is a cotton farmer himself. They are rightfully outraged that a nation that enjoys all the benefits of open markets for its industrial products keeps putting up walls around its farmers. 
At the recent World Trade Organization meeting in Cancun, where attempts to reform the agricultural trade rules ended in failure, widespread outrage against American cotton subsidies dominated the headlines. 
If all protectionism disappeared tomorrow, the poor farmers of the world would not all benefit. Small corn or wheat growers abroad might not be able to compete against the huge, efficient farms of the fertile American Midwest. Peasants with tiny plots of land would inevitably give way to bigger agricultural enterprises. There is no magic fix to a world order in which the rich countries invariably hold most of the cards. But the global community has to start moving in the right direction, giving farmers in the poorest countries an opportunity to compete where they have a chance to do so.
The "cotton-picking truth," as they might say in rural Texas, is that the United States has no business growing 16 million bales of cotton a year. Continuing to deny this reality is patently unfair. If the United States eliminated the subsidies, the world prices for cotton would rise, helping farmers overseas but having minimal effect on consumers (there is only about a dollar's worth of cotton in a pair of jeans). It would save the American taxpayers billions of dollars, and it would allow Americans to strike a very visible blow for fairness between rich countries and poor.
The pain in Lubbock, of course, would be real, as it is in any region where new economic patterns deal a mortal blow to a local industry. The government needs to help such places make the transition to businesses with a future. But it cannot afford to prop up inefficient ventures forever. It is not fair to other regions that were forced to accept change, lost jobs and an end to old ways of life. It is not fair to the poor, cotton-producing countries. The subsidies are a bad deal for everyone but the American cotton farmers, and they leave the United States in an unconscionably hypocritical stance when it faces the rest of the world. Free trade cannot work a la carte, only for those sectors where we stand to win.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Wal-Mart, Driving Workers and Supermarkets Crazy

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
IN February Wal-Mart will open its first grocery supercenter in California, offering everything from tires to prime meats, and that could be a blessing for middle-class consumers. The reason is simple: Wal-Mart's prices are 14 percent lower than its competitors', according to a study by the investment bank UBS Warburg.
 But not everyone is rejoicing about Wal-Mart's five-year plan to open 40 supercenters in California, stores combining general merchandise and groceries that are expected to gobble up $3.2 billion in sales. California's three largest supermarket chains, Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons, are scared, and so are tens of thousands of supermarket workers whose union contracts have put them solidly in the middle class. The three grocers' fears of fierce competition from Wal-Mart and their related drive to cut costs are widely seen as the main reason behind the week-old strike by 70,000 workers at 859 supermarkets in Southern California. 
 Wal-Mart has already helped push more than two dozen national supermarket chains into bankruptcy over the past decade. That list includes names like Grand Union; Bruno's, once Alabama's largest supermarket chain; and Homeland Stores, formerly Oklahoma's largest. And unionized supermarket workers fear that Wal-Mart's invasion will oust them from the middle class by pulling down their wages and benefits, which, taken together, are more than 50 percent higher than those of Wal-Mart workers. At Wal-Mart, the average wage is about $8.50 an hour, compared with $13 at unionized supermarkets.
"Wal-Mart's superstores are going to have a devastating impact on California's supermarkets," said Burt Flickinger III, a retailing consultant, noting that union wages and prices are higher in California than in most of the country.
Eager to stay competitive against Wal-Mart, Albertsons, Vons (owned by Safeway) and Ralphs (owned by Kroger) have demanded a two-year wage freeze for current workers, a lower pay scale for new hires and greater employee contributions for health coverage. Those employees now pay no health insurance premiums, while Wal-Mart employees often must pay premiums of $200 a month and deductibles of up to $1,000 a year, if they qualify. 
With Wal-Mart in mind, supermarkets have engaged in tough bargaining across the country. That has led to a 12-day-old strike by 10,000 supermarket workers in Missouri and a six-day-old strike by 3,000 workers at 44 Krogers in West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. 
It is hard to underestimate the power of Wal-Mart. It has 1.4 million employees and had $245 billion in revenues last year, equaling 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product. Each week 138 million shoppers visit Wal-Mart's 4,750 stores. Last year, 82 percent of American households bought at least one item there.
Wal-Mart sells 32 percent of the nation's disposable diapers, and it is the largest customer for Walt Disney and Procter & Gamble. It has singlehandedly persuaded music companies to issue sanitized versions of CD's. Its 1,397 supercenters account for 19 percent of the nation's grocery sales, making it the largest grocery retailer. With Wal-Mart planning 1,000 more supercenters in the next five years, Retail Forward, a consulting firm, estimates that Wal-Mart's grocery and drug sales will double to $162 billion, giving it 35 percent of the domestic food market and 25 percent of the drug market.
When Wal-Mart goes like gangbusters into an area, as it plans to do in California, competitors often feel panic. In Dallas, its share of the grocery market has soared to 16.4 percent from 8.5 percent in the past two years, according to TradeDimensions International.
"We have been in business for 68 years, and in that period of time, we have seen dozens of competitors come and go," said Jack Brown, president of Stater Brothers, a supermarket chain in the Orange County and San Diego areas. "However, Southern California has never seen as big a competitive threat as the Wal-Mart supercenter." 
Many factors explain Wal-Mart's ability to charge low prices, including economies of scale, the pressures it puts on suppliers and its embrace of imports -- it imported $12 billion in goods from China last year, one-tenth of American imports from China. 
Another big factor is Wal-Mart's relatively low wages. Its sales clerks average about $8.50 an hour, or about $14,000 a year, while the poverty line for a family of three is $15,060. In California, the unionized stockers and clerks average $17.90 an hour after two years on the job. Mr. Flickinger said wages and benefits for Wal-Mart's full-time workers average $10 to $14 per hour less than for unionized supermarket workers.
"The strike out here involves workers who enjoy decent wages, vacations and health benefits," said Kent Wong, director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California at Los Angeles. "These things were taken for granted, they made them part of the middle class, but now these workers are threatened with having these things taken away."
A big savings for Wal-Mart comes in health care, where Wal-Mart pays 30 percent less for coverage for each insured worker than the industry average. An estimated 40 percent of employees are not covered by its health plan because many cannot afford the premiums or have not worked at Wal-Mart long enough to qualify.
"What this means is, if I'm a Wal-Mart employee and I hurt my hand and go to the emergency room, who's going to pay for it? The taxpayer is," said Mr. Brown, the supermarket executive. "Wal-Mart's fringe benefits are being paid by taxpayers."
Wal-Mart officials say that their expansion will be a boon for California consumers and that their wages and benefits are competitive. Why else, they ask, would 600,000 workers take jobs at Wal-Mart each year?
Greg Denier, chief spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers, said the fear of Wal-Mart's supercenters is the main cause for the California strike, but he argued that the supermarkets have exaggerated the threat as a strategy to squeeze their workers. 
"They keep saying they have to do this because Wal-Mart is bringing supercenters to California," he said, "but it's part of a national program to ratchet down wages and benefits." 
Yet Wall Street analysts and retailing consultants say the California supermarkets, like others across the country, risk being stomped by Wal-Mart.

HEADLINE: U.S. OVERCAPACITY STALLS NEW JOBS 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
Much of the public outcry over America's failure to generate jobs has focused lately on a surge in the outsourcing of work to China and India. But another dynamic closer to home is weighing on job creation -- the slow process of working through a glut of boom-era investment that continues to litter the economy with underused factories.
 Procter & Gamble, for example, has been dumping its weakest brands and the plants that produce them. At its Ivorydale industrial complex here, in Procter's hometown, the company has sold factories that make Crisco shortening, Olean fat substitute and Ivory soap to three manufacturers, each with plans for squeezing efficiencies from the operations. Hiring more workers is the last item on their agendas. 
 "As long as there is extra capacity available in manufacturing, there is going to be room to move work around among companies without having to add workers," said Thomas A. Kochan, a labor and management expert at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
That is true with a vengeance today. Not since the severe recession of the early 1980's has capacity use in manufacturing stayed so low for so long, government data show. Production as a percentage of total capacity fell precipitously in the aftermath of the last recession, which ended in 2001, and 23 months into the recovery, the upturn has still not come. On average, manufacturers are using less than 73 percent of their capacity. 
Struggling to get rid of this costly glut, many companies continue to shut plants and lay off the workers, as the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company is doing in Huntsville, Ala., where it is closing a tire plant that employs 1,100 people. Or they have consolidated operations in one or two sites instead of a dozen, as Procter itself has done in the production of detergents, eliminating workers in the process. Other companies, notably the nation's automakers, have discounted prices and offered rebates to sustain production at respectable rates of capacity -- a tactic that squeezes profits and discourages hiring.
And now some companies, Procter among them, are selling or leasing plants to others who gamble they can make a profit by finding buyers for the excess output. Whatever success the newcomers have in this endeavor contributes to the nation's sharply rising productivity growth rate, by increasing output without adding workers -- a dynamic that prolongs the "jobless recovery." 
"We overbuilt capacity; we hired too many people," A. G. Lafley, Procter's chairman, said in a speech last spring. The company invested in the 1990's in anticipation of reaching $50 billion in annual sales, but Procter's managers now find themselves rattling around in a company with $43.4 billion in sales. Cutting back, Mr. Lafley has focused resources on the largest, most profitable brands -- Pampers diapers, for example -- and freed cash from lesser operations. 
Procter still markets soap under brand names like Ivory, Old Spice, Camay and Olay. Marketing, after all, is the company's core competency, as Mr. Lafley puts it. But manufacturing the soap bars themselves in Cincinnati is not considered a good use of resources -- certainly not in a plant operating at only 50 percent of capacity, as the factory here is. 
"We could have consolidated the Ivorydale production at our bar soap factory in Mexico," said R. Keith Harrison Jr., the Procter vice president in charge of product supply. But the consolidation would have required a $40 million to $45 million investment, he said.
Instead, Procter sold the brick-and-concrete Ivorydale plant last spring to a 10-year-old company, Trillium Health Care Products, which specializes in operating soap factories. As part of the deal, Trillium supplies 235 million pounds of soap a year to Procter and hopes that it will eventually be able to sell another 235 million pounds elsewhere.
For Procter, the supply contract "offered the same cost structure that we could get if we consolidated in Mexico" -- minus the investment, Mr. Harrison said. 
But the arrangement forces Trillium to squeeze labor costs until it can line up more customers and benefit from the rising returns of a factory finally operating at full capacity.
"P.&G. would never bring a direct competitor into this plant to fill up volume, but as a contractor we can do that," said Alan Wedgeworth, a spokesman for Trillium, which is based in Newmarket, Ontario, just north of Toronto.
Trillium hired 165 of Procter's 230 employees, maintaining their old wage of $21 to $24 an hour. But new hires replaced 50 other Procter employees at wages $5 to $8 an hour less. Trillium also brings in more temporary workers than Procter did to handle upward fluctuations in production, Mr. Wedgeworth said, rather than adding to its staff. 
The Employees Representation Association, an independent union that represents Procter's Ivorydale workers, now has contracts with Trillium and three other companies that have bought or leased Ivorydale operations over the last 20 months. Each contract sets a wage scale for new hires that is lower than the old Procter scale.
New hiring, meanwhile, is still in the future for Trillium, which took possession of the soap plant on April 1. For now, "P.&G. is our only customer," Mr. Wedgeworth said. 
Twin Rivers Technologies, another contract manufacturer, has had better luck, although starting from a much lower base. The one newer plant at Ivorydale produces Olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that Procter developed in the late 1990's and markets as Olean for use in snack food like Fat-Free Pringles.
Procter listed a value of $150 million for the seven-year-old plant, whose collection of cooking vats and piping makes it look like a high-rise refinery. But a health warning from the Food and Drug Administration, only recently lifted, held down Olestra sales, and the plant was operating at just 10 percent of capacity when Procter sold it to Twin Rivers in February 2002. 
Twin Rivers has since doubled output to 20 percent, said Paul J. Angelico, the company's president -- but not because Procter has increased its purchases of Olestra, or because other buyers have signed up in significant numbers.
Rather, Twin Rivers has managed to market a different form of the ingredients in Olestra as a food additive, Mr. Angelico said. And his engineers are producing another product, partly refined glycerin, at the Olestra plant. But that, in turn, allowed Procter -- which makes glycerin at Ivorydale for use in hair- and skin-care products and in toothpaste -- to shift some of the processing to Twin Rivers, eliminating more than five jobs, Mr. Angelico said.
"You take over a process that used to take place there," he said. "It reduces output there, and we did not have to add any staff to increase output here."
Twin Rivers employs 34 people at the Olestra plant, two-thirds of them technicians hired from Procter, and the rest new people hired at lower wage rates. The payroll will not grow, Mr. Angelico said, until capacity use climbs to at least 50 percent.
Procter took a different approach with Crisco, the shortening first made at Ivorydale in 1911 and now produced here in Cincinnati in a highly automated factory surrounded by 30 acres of processing facilities and storage tanks.
Crisco and Jif peanut butter, made at a Procter plant in Lexington, Ky., had fallen far down Procter's list of priorities. They were "not going to be part of our long-term strategic fit," Mr. Harrison said. So in June 2002, the company sold the brands and their factories to the J. M. Smucker Company, the manufacturer of jams and preserves. 
Smucker paid in stock -- one Smucker share for every 50 Procter shares, a handsome bonus for Procter's stockholders. Without incurring any additional costs, Smucker doubled its annual revenue overnight, to nearly $1.4 billion. And while Smucker took on 190 workers at the Criscoplant and 150 in Lexington, no jobs were created by the transaction.
"We are organized to operate at multiple plant locations; even our sales staff has not grown," said Stephen Landry, the Crisco plant manager, who now says "we" in referring to Smucker. "We were already calling on the jam and jelly buyers at the supermarkets, and they are the ones who also often buy peanut butter and Crisco," he said.
Procter, meanwhile, freed marketing personnel to work on more profitable brands. It has also shrunk its work force, mainly through early retirements, which were an option for some of the displaced Ivorydale workers, including several who had worked at the complex's steam and electric power plant. Procter got rid of that, too, leasing the plant a year ago to Cinergy, a utility company. 
Within six months, the 34 boilerhouse job slots had been cut to 17, and a big portion of the maintenance was turned over to employees already on the Cinergy payroll. The 17 survivors all came over from Procter at their existing pay of nearly $25 an hour, but new hires, if any, will start at $16 an hour. 
Procter & Gamble is not done with this sort of cost cutting. "I intend to not see any cost increase," Mr. Harrison said of the manufacturing and supply operations he oversees. "In fact, I'm looking for about another 10 percent cost decrease over the balance of the decade."

A Family Problem Prompts a Career

BYLINE:  By Abby Ellin; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Until a few months ago, Sam Williams never really thought of himself as a career man. Instead, he worked at odd jobs that required no specific skills: as a visiting nurse's escort; a mailroom clerk at a local hospital; a day laborer on various construction sites. But nothing spoke to him except one thing: asthma prevention.
 East Harlem, where Mr. Williams lives, has one of the highest asthma rates in the United States. A 2002 study conducted, in part, by Harlem Hospital and the Harlem Children's Zone, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that 25.5 percent of children under 13 living in a 24-block area in central Harlem were asthmatic. 
 These statistics hit home for Mr. Williams: his daughters, 8 and 17, have battled asthma since infancy. "I wanted to learn more about it so I can help my kids," said Mr. Williams, 38. "They each get hospitalized at least twice a year. They need steroids to open up their lungs."
 Dr. Suzanne Gaynor, assistant professor of community and preventative medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the co-founder of the East Harlem Asthma Working Group, an organization dedicated to combating asthma, points out that "East Harlem has the highest rate of pediatric asthma hospitalization in the country."
 Last year, Dr. Gaynor received a one-year grant from the Environmental Protection Agency and a three-year grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop a program to alleviate Harlem's high asthma rates and to provide long-term asthma management. In the hope of hiring East Harlem residents to help her improve home environments, she called Strive, a 19-year-old nonprofit job training and placement agency that focuses on socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
 Around the same time, Mr. Williams, who has one year of college under his belt, returned to Strive, with which he had been involved off and on since its inception.
Lawrence Jackson, director of Strive's Career Path program, knew about Mr. Williams's asthma concerns, and told him about the organization's relationship with Mount Sinai. Mr. Williams was intrigued, and enrolled in Strive's Brownfields training program, an eight-week course that teaches students how to monitor the air for pollutants and toxic waste as well as how to clean up affected areas. On completion, participants receive OSHA certification and become proficient in First Aid, CPR and lead abatement.
 After Mr. Williams graduated, Strive helped him land a position as a technician with Microecologies, an indoor-environmental consultancy in Manhattan that was one of Mount Sinai's contractors. He spends his days cleaning mold-infested walls, repairing underlying pipes and installing safe molding. "I've got all these new skills now," Mr. Williams said.
 "The goal is to remove any asthma trigger in the home: roaches, rodents, dust, mold," said Dr. Gaynor, who oversees the project. "We go in and do a hands-on approach, working with mothers to clean the homes properly." More than 50 apartments have been inspected and cleaned in the six months since the program began.
 Although no one knows for certain why the asthma rates are so high in East Harlem, experts believe that mold, mildew, fumes from gas stoves, dust and cockroach droppings play a large role. Cigarette smoke doesn't help. Nor, for that matter, does air pollution.
 In September, hundreds of East Harlem residents and Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton demonstrated against the opening of a bus depot on East 99th Street. According to environmental experts, diesel exhaust can also contribute to high asthma rates.
 If Mr. Williams has his way, he will be part of the team helping to fight asthma for a long time to come.
 Dr. Gaynor is equally hopeful that Mr. Williams will continue to be involved. 
 "He'll have 18 solid months of employment in a specialized-skills area, and it's possible there will be a permanent job for him with Microecologies," she said. "Unfortunately, this kind of work is very much in demand."

Some Stories Are So Jarring They Don't Go Away

BYLINE:  By FRAN SCHUMER

 BODY:
ON the last Monday in September, about 5 p.m., my son and I were driving past the Short Hills train station when we noticed four men placing a white sheet over the tracks. We had just come from the orthopedist's office, which is why I had a book with me. For the third time, I was reading "Anna Karenina," whose grim ending -- in which Anna throws herself in front of a train -- we had recently discussed. Perhaps that's why we guessed instantly what had happened.
 Richard Josephs, an unemployed banker, apparently threw himself in front of a train, and the body of his 7-year-old son, Eric, was later found at home with marks on his neck. An official said the boy had probably been strangled. 
 By now the story is old news, but some stories don't go away, no matter how hard you wish they would.
 Every time I drive by the white Tudor house with red trim and a picket fence, I think about how a person could have found himself in such despair that he was willing to sever what psychologists call his social contract, his connection with the human race. And I wonder if anyone else I know, a colleague, a relative, could find himself in that position.
 In the United States, a person commits suicide every 17.2 minutes. Women attempt it three times as often as men, but men succeed by much larger numbers. The ratio of male to female suicides in the United States is currently four to one, a figure that holds for other countries with some exceptions. In China, the suicide rate is highest among rural women for reasons experts are still trying to fathom.
 Within the United States, depending on the year, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York generally trade places as the state with the lowest rate. In 2001, the last year for which statistics were available, New Jersey ranked 49th, which sounds hopeful until you consider that even at the bottom of the list, it lost 588 residents to suicide. The greatest frequency is in Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico -- the mountain states -- and for two main reasons: firearms are more available -- suicides by firearms are by far the most common -- and the population is less dense. Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, says that in those states, "the distance between the person in trouble and the persons who can help them is great."
 Richard Josephs was 53 when he, presumably, took his life -- midlife crisis, people are apt to assume. But among men, the rate dips slightly in middle age. Among women, the reverse it true: women from 45 to 54 have the highest rate. Hormones and the emptying nest are the main reasons psychologists cite, but the sad truth is, suicide among the middle aged is wildly understudied.
 "I know personally experts on suicide and seniors and suicide and adolescents," says Dr. John Kalafat, an associate professor at Rutgers and a past president of the suicidology group, "but off the top of my head, I couldn't name an expert on middle-aged suicide."
 Despite New Jersey's low rate, the state has a highly regarded network for survivors. Groups for friends or relatives of suicides exist in Madison, Dumont, Jersey City, Piscataway, Fair Haven, Hamilton, Brant Beach, Lakewood and Somerdale, said Peggy Farrell, chairwoman of the state chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. 
 Ms. Farrell, who is also a facilitator of the Piscataway group, lost a son, an assistant district attorney in New York, to suicide. When she and her other son and three daughters first approached the survivor's group, she thought, "these people aren't going to be like us," she said. "Then you walk in and there they are, just like us."
 Survivor groups function as life rafts, says Karen Dunne-Maxim, a founder of the foundation, who lost a brother to suicide. "Grief is like a sea and you initially feel you're going to drown. You have to try to tread water, but in the water, you are thrown life preservers -- family, friends, reading, talking to other survivors -- and you just need to hang on to those to get to the other side."
 Coping isn't the same as achieving closure.
 "It's a bad word for us because there is no closure," says Ms. Farrell, who adds that even now, a visit to a survivor can stir up old pain. But there is also recovery. "If I can remember Michael now with more joy than sadness, then I can say I've healed."

 BODY:
THEY mark off their goals with trash cans, call their own fouls and play without any real sidelines. They each bring two jerseys -- one red and the other yellow -- so they can split up into two teams and play no matter who shows up.
 "This is the longest-running pickup game in America," said Joe Stepien, a regular at the four-times-a-week soccer game, which has made its home in Essex County's Brookdale Park since at least 1981. 
 But two weeks ago, on a Sunday morning, their game was stopped and the 26 soccer players were ushered off the field by a county police officer who arrived with lights flashing. A group of men playing a pick-up football game nearby were also ejected. The confrontation set off a firestorm of emotions, as well as phone calls and e-mail messages to the Essex County executive, Joseph DiVincenzo. 
 "It was quite a scene," said Michael Aron, a political correspondent for New Jersey Network, who was one of the soccer players. "My guys were getting furious at the enormous injustice."
 Although it rarely happens so dramatically, tension is growing across the state because of the shortage of playing fields. At its root is a simple imbalance in supply and demand. The number of organized youth sports leagues has sharply increased over the past two decades. And although the state has added to its reserves of parkland through the Green Acres program, fields of green are still at a premium, particularly in the more developed areas.
 As Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental protection, put it, "There are unmet park needs across the state."
 New Jersey Youth Soccer, to name just one sport, now has 167,000 players, compared with about 100,000 only 10 years ago, according to the organization's executive director, Jeanine Willis. At the same time, every year development in the state gobbles up another 28 square miles of open land, according to New Jersey Future, an anti-sprawl group based in Trenton. 
 "We're using up land over three times faster than we're adding people," said Barbara Lawrence, the group's executive director. "It's estimated that we'll be the first state to build out. That means that all the developable land will be developed." 
 Forget about "if you build it, they will come." If a farmer turned his cornfield into a baseball diamond and Shoeless Joe Jackson came back from the dead, he would have to wait in line for a turn to play.
 In real time, the shortage of playing fields pits sport against sport, league against league, residents against non-residents and, as in the case of Brookdale Park, organized teams against weekend scrimmagers.
 "The groups are always in a constant state of negotiation," said William Foelsch, executive director of the New Jersey Recreation and Park Association, a trade group for park administrators. "It does become, in some respects, a turf war."
 Ashley Hammond, president of the Montclair-based Ashley Soccer Camps, which is also a big user of Brookdale Park, agreed with Mr. Foelsch. "There's no question there's a turf war," said Mr. Hammond. "We fight with rugby. We fight with football. There are turf wars everywhere." 
 Only a few miles from Brookdale Park, in nearby Passaic County, a battle is shaping up over Clifton's Littari Park, where the Board of Education there wants to build a middle school. On the gate of the eight-acre community park, which features an adult softball field, tennis courts, a basketball court and a playground, an orange poster declares: "Save our Park. Say No to School. Why Waste Open Space." 
 "It's a tough issue," said Marilyn Laguna, a Clifton resident who on a recent Saturday, was watching her 9-year-old daughter Megan in a recreational tennis clinic at Littari Park. "There is definitely overcrowding in the school. But on the other hand, you have activities like this."
 Even before Littari Park was fingered for possible extinction, Clifton's recreation director, Debbie Oliver, seemed distraught trying to schedule all the games.
 "We're very land-bound," said Ms. Oliver. "There's really no place to grow. If your garage only holds two cars, you can't buy four." 
 Like recreation directors across the state, Ms. Oliver schedules her fields for almost nonstop play, even though she knows it is bad for the resources. "We can't let our fields rest," she said.
 Nor is recreational congestion limited to Clifton. "You could call any town in the state of New Jersey," said John Roberts, executive director of the Recreation Department in Princeton. "Every time we make progress, there are more organized sport groups coming out of the woodwork."
 As a result, municipalities, counties and sports organizations are resorting to unusual, creative and sometimes unsavory, solutions -- like building ball fields on top of former dumps. "We're looking at a capped landfill area as a site for soccer and Little League," Mr. Roberts said.
 Don Murphy, president of the Pop Warner football league in Jackson, said his league is finally leaving a landfill field.
 "We've had such a growth in the township that we basically had to practice on top of a dump," Mr. Murphy said. 
 The league is now midway through building a $750,000 field complex on land leased from the town, he said. He blamed "poor planning" for the shortage of fields, complaining that municipalities issue building permits for new housing but do not require developers to add recreational facilities.
Another solution is to erect lights for night games and practices, though as Ms. Oliver said, "it does put a burden on the neighbors."
 But even if games were scheduled 24 hours a day, satisfying the appetite of every league and pick-up team, there would still be the problem of overuse. Athletic fields, like farmland, should be rested periodically. 
 As for artificial turf, one possible solution, Mr. Roberts of Princeton said: "It's an alternative we're all looking at. But it's unbelievably expensive."
 When the current crop of baby boomers was growing up, the main sport was baseball, and it was all boys, and it usually started at age 8. But Title IX, the 1972 law that prohibited gender discrimination in schools, brought girls onto the playing field. 
 Since then, soccer and, more recently lacrosse, has become hugely popular. Even more exotic sports popularized by recent immigrants -- like cricket and rugby -- have begun to take hold in New Jersey. In addition, parents have demanded sports opportunities for even younger children. New Jersey Youth Soccer, for example, has "micro mini" leagues for children as young as 3, and T-ball starts at 4. 
 And all these children need playing fields.
 This is the demand side of the equation - fueled by a potent combination of expert marketing and parental insecurity.
 Greg Heinzman, director of the Rutgers Youth Sports Research Council, an organization that trains volunteer coaches across the state and studies trends in the field, says that youth sports suffer from an overabundance of parental angst. "The pressure on parents to get their kids signed up is extreme," Mr. Heinzman said. "They're hardly out of their superhero underwear."
 Even more troubling, according to recreation experts, is the way children are being pushed by parents and coaches to specialize in sports -- often with college scholarships in mind -- and playing the selected sport year round. Mr. Heinzman says children's bodies are not built for this kind of activity, and that young athletes are beginning to suffer from the kinds of repetitive-motion sports injuries that were once the province of collegiate and professional athletes.
 "They're specializing to the point of lunacy," said Mr. Roberts.
 One result of specialization is that specific sports are no longer satisfied with a single traditional season. Instead, many have spread their calendar to include two, three and sometimes all four seasons.
 These days, traditional fall sports like soccer are played in the spring too. In Montclair, an indoor soccer facility has extended the season to the winter and the summer. Spring sports like lacrosse have added fall seasons. And baseball is played spring, summer and fall.
 The calculus is undeniable. Add girls, pre-schoolers, new sports and then extend their calendars and the result is teams queuing up like airplanes waiting for a runway.
 Fields do not rest, nor do recreation directors. "You used to have fall soccer and spring baseball," said Ms. Oliver of Clifton. "Now there's fall baseball and spring soccer. It's ruining the fields."
 Pity the poor recreation director, who has to satisfy everyone. "No disrespect to anyone, but if you're a soccer program, that's all you care about," Ms. Oliver said. "You go back to the organization and try to get them to understand that we just can't keep growing seasons. Soccer would play right through the winter if you let them."
 Too much youth sports? Not according to everyone. A few weeks ago on a Saturday, the Clifton Wildcats, a champion travel baseball team that plays three seasons, was on the Eddie Mayo Field in Clifton. Fall baseball only started there in the mid-1990's, one father said, but already it is a proud tradition.
 "It keeps them off the street," said Jack Gomez, the manager of the team.
 Given the rise in childhood obesity, it is hard to argue with children running around on fields. "A whole generation is just exercising their thumbs on video games," Mr. Foelsch said.
 The supply side of the equation is more complicated. In a town like Clifton, for instance, it is not hard to understand why playing fields are scarce. Like many of the older inner-ring suburbs that surround New York City, Clifton is one of the first stops in the western migration of immigrants. Townhouse communities -- some dating from the mid-20th century and some new - are crammed between strip malls, medical complexes and schools. And like most urban areas, the town is people rich but land poor.
 In nearby Paterson -- much more of an urban setting -- the deserted Hinchliffe Stadium, a former high school football field, stands as a symbol of decaying recreation resources. 
 Covered with graffiti, its artificialturf worn thin, and with trees actually sprouting from its bleachers, the eerie relic looks like an ancient coliseum or the setting for a bleak futuristic movie. Although the stadium was earmarked for preservation, there are no signs of it.
 The truth is that concrete-clad stadiums dedicated primarily to high school football are dinosaurs. "The reality of those stadiums is that they're aged," said Mr. Foelsch. "I don't think you're going to see many high school arenas built like they used to be." 
 But the statewide picture of supply -- what lands are available for athletes to run around on -- is not completely bleak. The New Jersey State Outdoor Recreation Plan, published every four years, says in the current issue that the state has almost 200,000 more acres of what it calls "public parkland" than it did in 1994.
 In 1999, Gov. Christie Whitman established the Garden State Preservation Trust with the lofty goal of spending $1 billion to preserve a million acres of open space in the state by 2008. The McGreevey administration is trying to stretch that money further by taking advantage of low interest rates. On the Nov. 4 ballot, voters will be asked to allow the state to borrow an extra $150 million -- capitalizing on the lower interest rates -- for purchasing open space.
 In addition, the McGreevey administration is using state Green Acres funds to renovate parks in the state's denser areas. Earlier this month, Essex County received a $6.9 million state grant to revamp its parks. Part of the money will go toward artificial turf for a playing field in Brookdale Park -- the same one where the pick-up football players were booted off.
 All this is laudable, groups like New Jersey Future and the New Jersey Recreation and Park Association say, though not enough.
 While the state may be preserving open space and parkland, that does not necessarily translate into more playing fields. Much of the land saved is in remote areas and protects aquifers, or as Mr. Foelsch said, "lands that are not conducive to active recreation -- steep slopes, wetlands."
 Mr. Foelsch also believes that other methods besides land acquisition are needed to counteract development. "I don't think there's a balance yet," he said. As a result, his organization recently asked for an additional $50 million in the state budget to improve services in state parks, and it also wants the state's land-use law changed so developers can be assessed "impact fees" to pay for park and recreation space.
 Ms. Lawrence of New Jersey Future thinks that the state will run out of money before accomplishing Mrs. Whitman's goal of buying up a million acres. In the meantime, she is worried about that areas that now seem land-rich -- the rapidly developing towns in the state's exurbs -- will end up in the same land-locked state that inner-ring suburbs now find themselves. "They can't imagine what's going to happen to them," Ms. Lawrence predicted.
 On idyllic fall days when the air is crisp and the trees are crimson, soccer fields look like they have been painted by God. Weather and sports combine in a conspiracy of outdoor delight. That is, unless, you are playing ball under the lights in a climate-controlled environment.
 Rex Plex, a 200,000 square foot "recreational megaplex," as it calls itself, opened three years ago in Elizabeth. Comparable to Chelsea Piers in Manhattan only smaller, Rex Plex offers four indoor soccer fields, a roller hockey rink, a paintball field, two basketball courts, a skate park, a rock-climbing wall as well as the kind of coin-operated entertainment fare found in a Chuck-E-Cheese. Adult soccer leagues and bar mitzvah parties compete for space. There is also an artificial turf outdoor field.
 "I was always looking for places for my kids to play, especially in the fall and winter months," said Randy Taylor, the chairman of Rex Plex. "It's a direct response to what initially was a need for soccer facilities. There's just not enough quality recreation facilities out there." 
 In short, Rex Plex offers a 21st century, for-profit version of the old-fashioned sandlot. Children are dropped off by their mothers and pay $10 or $12 for a session of the sport they're interested in. 
 "Everything is more structured now than it used to be," Mr. Taylor said. "And all these things are organized."
 Mr. Taylor is convinced that Rex Plex is the future of recreation in America, and that the Elizabeth location is just the "beta site" of what will become a large empire.
 Throughout the state, indoor sports complexes dedicated to single sports are also cropping up. Mr. Hammond, of Ashley Soccer Camps, has a 30-year lease on the Soccer Domain, a year-round soccer bubble in downtown Montclair. He uses the field for his own programs, or rents space for as much as $300 an hour to organizations ranging from the Las Vegas Gladiators, a football team that used it for recruiting recently, to the pick-up soccer team that got booted from Brookdale Park.
 "We'd love to find another place to build another facility," Mr. Hammond said. "Everyone and their mother wants to build an indoor facility."
 If Paterson's crumbling coliseum, Hinchlilffe Stadium, is the ghost of Recreation Past, places like Soccer Domain and Rex Plex are the specter of Recreation Future. The same imbalance of supply and demand that has recreation directors pulling out their hair becomes - in a market economy - highly profitable. What could be more American? 
There is only one problem. What to do when the weather is good?
 Even Ashley Hammond appreciates the conundrum. "Who wants to play indoors," he asked, "in the middle of June?"

HEADLINE: THE LAW; 
In New Jersey, Rogue Lawyers Are on the Rise

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
DAVID JOHNSON has seen some strange cases in 27 years of chasing bad lawyers, but the rogue members of the New Jersey bar always find something new to surprise him.
 Take the lawyer who stalked his girlfriend, practiced without a valid license, falsified evidence and lied to a court. Or the attorney who hired a private investigator to snoop on a federal judge presiding over his case. 
 "Who knows why people do what they do," Mr. Johnson said. 
 As director of the state's Office of Attorney Ethics, Mr. Johnson leads 58 investigators and auditors who track down the lawyers who steal from, lie to or otherwise abuse their clients. And it is a job that is getting busier every year, he said.
 Last year set a record for the number of complaints and lawyers disciplined by the courts. The two previous years also saw increases in the number of complaints.
 "It is hard to draw conclusions in year-to-year changes," Mr. Johnson said. "But if you look over the last five years, clearly the trend is up."
 In 2002, the office filed disciplinary charges against 1,472 attorneys. While the number represents a small proportion of the state's 57,484 practicing lawyers, it is enough to leave Mr. Johnson's staff digging through a backlog of cases.
 The most outrageous offense, in Mr. Johnson's opinion, was an attorney who repeatedly called opposing lawyers as witnesses to try to disqualify them, berated judges and accused the court system of conspiring against her. She was suspended, but kept practicing. The court finally disbarred her.
 Most cases are not so spectacular. The majority of lawyers seriously disciplined mishandle or misappropriate their clients' money; just over one-third of all disciplinary cases involve client funds.
 "There are a lot of reasons for it," Mr. Johsnon said. "Certainly the economy does not help. Lawyers, like everyone else, can get financially stressed."
 To many, the words legal and ethics fit together like an elephant in a bikini, but state courts take attorney discipline seriously. After a report criticized the lengthy backlog of cases in 1995, New Jersey poured money into the discipline system, adding staff and strengthening a unit that randomly audits lawyers' business accounts. 
 As for investigating and disciplining lawyers, "New Jersey is considered one of the more aggressive states," said Mark A. Armitage, president of the National Organization of Bar Counsel and a member of the American Bar Association's committee on professional discipline. 
 Mr. Armitage, who is associate director of the legal disciplinary board in Michigan, said New Jersey's reputation for stringent discipline comes from its random financial audits and harsh penalties. He said New Jersey was one of only 10 states that permanently disbar lawyers; most others allow offenders to apply for reinstatement. 
 "New Jersey has the reputation of being very, very tough," he said. 
 Still, the system has its critics. John Paff, president of Citizens for Justice in New Jersey, an advocacy group, said there was too much secrecy involved in the disciplining of lawyers. Currently, the Office of Attorney Discipline screens out about 95 percent of the complaints without filing charges, most of which involve such minor complaints as speaking rudely to clients or failing to pay the office rent on time. 
 But Mr. Paff said there was no way of knowing what the complaints involved because they are kept secret by the Office of Attorney Discipline unless formal charges are filed, and in fact the forms used by the office instruct complainants to keep charges confidential until formally evaluated. 
 Mr. Paff criticized the policy as a restraint of free speech that effectively bars oversight of the discipline system.
 "We are concerned that mistakes might be made on some of them," he said.
 Another complaint about the system centers around the the time it office takes to investigate some cases. Mr. Paff, whose group maintains a list of New Jersey lawyers charged with disciplinary infractions on its Web site -- www.cjnj.org -- said the Office of Attorney Discipline recently filed charges against a lawyer accused of misconduct in September 1996. 
 "What could take seven years to investigate?" Mr. Paff asked.
 The failure to resolve cases speedily was a concern also expressed by lawyers. 
 "I think there are cases that take an astoundingly long time to reach a resolution," said state Senator John Adler, a Democratic from Cherry Hill who is co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "Some cases take three, four, five years before they reach a decision."
 Mr. Adler, who has been a lawyer for 19 years, said professional oversight has become more important as the pool of lawyers has expanded. According to the state court, New Jersey had only 11,408 people licensed to practice law in 1970 as against 77,958 last year. (Of those, the state considers 57,484 to be active practitioners based on payments to legal funds.) 
 "As society gets bigger, there is less accountability," he said. "Years ago, you knew who the dishonest lawyers were and you could deal with them by snubbing them professionally. As our society gets bigger, it is harder to keep tabs on who the bad actors are."
 Walter K. Olson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who writes frequently on legal issues, said the culture has changed as the law has become more of a business.
 "The idea that was inculcated not that long ago was that lawyers had special obligations that other businesses did not," Mr. Olson said. "Lawyers were officers of the court."
 On the other hand, defenders of the legal profession say the bar has tried to keep up with the changes by strengthening disciplinary boards and by requiring ethical instruction for new lawyers.
 John Leubsdorf, who teaches legal ethics at Rutgers in Newark, said that when he attended law school in the 1960's, ethics was mentioned in passing, and that most states did not begin to require formal instruction until the 1970's. 
 Now, law students are supposed to receive instructions on matters like handling their clients' money or dealing fairly with opponents. 
 "One thing that has happened to the subject in general is it has become less a subject of moral aspiration and more a matter of enforceable law," Mr. Leubsdorf said. 
 Howard M. Erichson, a professor at Seton Hall Law School, said the number of sanctions handed out for unethical conduct was "impressively low."
 "Despite a vigorous attorney discipline process in New Jersey, the total number of sanctions handed out was 237, which is about one-third of a percent of the number of lawyers," Mr. Erison said. "The real question is to what extent is there unethical conduct that does not enter into the system."
 Both Mr. Luebsdorf and Mr. Erichson said it was impossible to measure the effectiveness of an enforcement system simply by looking at the number of sanctions meted out. They said it would be unrealistic, for example, to say that lawyers are behaving better simply because the number of ethics charges decreased without knowing how efficiently the system was working.
 Several years ago, Mr. Leubsdorf said, he studied the legal discipline system in France and found that very few lawyers faced discipline charges in any given year.
 "Is that because they are behaving better, or because they have a weaker discipline system?" he asked.

HEADLINE: A Choice That's Close to Home 

BYLINE:  By Barbara Whitaker

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER has been a happy place to live for a number of small and medium-size companies, including Cybersettle, an online dispute resolution service for insurance companies.
 When the company was getting its feet on the ground, it chose Manhattan for its office. At the height of the technology craze, the company occupied nearly 10,000 square feet on the 16th floor of the MetLife building, paying about $54 a square foot in rent. 
 But in 2000 the world changed. Charles S. Brofman, co-founder and president, started looking for ways to scale back. One of the first things he did was pare staff and move his business to Mount Kisco, closer to his home in Waccabuc. 
"I think when we first started we kind of perceived that in order to make it you have to be in the center of the universe, which is Manhattan," said Mr. Brofman. "Although I love Manhattan and go there all the time, I think that has changed."
The high cost of doing business in the city forced him to look around. By moving to Mount Kisco he cut his rent to $22 a square foot.
"I could have moved to Dutchess County, Rockaway or Long Island," said Mr. Brofman. "But I wanted to be closer to home and I wanted to support Westchester."
Now the county is helping to support him. He recently signed a long-term lease and moved to a building in White Plains where he pays $16 a square foot. The county gave him sales tax breaks to buy office equipment.
Another representation of the strength of the Westchester economy can be seen at Terra Tile and Marble, the ceramic tile distribution business Manuel Gasch started about 15 years ago in a small showroom in Ossining. 
A native of Spain, he built his business on importing tiles from around the world, primarily from Spain. When he started, high-end decorative tiles accounted for only about 25 percent of his business. Today the high-end tiles account for 75 percent and he has moved well beyond tile into marble and granite, which is fabricated for flooring, counter tops and walls. 
"The high-end tiles, they have been raising our business continually," said Mr. Gasch, whose business has moved to Briarcliff Manor. It is positioned near wealthy suburbs in Westchester and Connecticut where customers are not afraid to spend money. 
"We are in a place where the price doesn't count," said Mr. Gasch, whose business has been growing 15 to 20 percent in each of the past three years. "You have what the client wants and that's it."
Recently, the county agreed to exempt the business from some sales and mortgage taxes to help him build a $1.3 million fabricating plant in Millwood. 
His expansion did not stop there: he recently opened a showroom in Manhattan.
But life, of course, is not universally rosy for businesses in Westchester. Tony Philip's Vision Quest music and sometimes electronics store has been through any number of hard times in Yonkers.
Vision Quest started in 1992 inside a downtown discount store selling a variety of music and electronics, then hit tough times in the mid-90's and downsized to a smaller shop down the street. Within two years it was getting back on their feet and moved across the street to 102 New Main Street, where it stayed for a few years, until the building was condemned. 
Mr. Philip recently opened a 10,000-square-foot business at 24 Main Street in Getty Square, where he receives a variety of tax breaks as part of the downtown revitalization effort. Sales are mediocre at best right now, he said, and the future is challenging as file swapping and bootlegging take a toll on the music and film industry.
But, he said: "I'm trying to focus on the positive. We're still a work in progress." Barbara Whitaker

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Who's Smiling Now?

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
EVERYBODY knows the economy is down, but you can't prove it by Manuel Gasch. His tile and stone business, Terra Tile and Marble, based in Briarcliff Manor, has been growing 15 to 20 percent in each of the last three years, with special strength in high-end imports. Business is so good that he has just opened up a new store, in Manhattan. 
 Times are also good for Pete Khader, owner of the Waterfront Deli in Yonkers. He has just moved his downtown restaurant around the corner from a 166-square-foot space to a spacious new site on Larkin Plaza, across the park from the new library and just down the block from the newly refurbished train station. His business has tripled in six weeks at his new location. 
 Both men have reason for optimism. The economies in Westchester County and other New York City suburbs are stronger than the economy in New York City, which continues to struggle. Housing prices remain strong in Westchester, unemployment in most areas is falling and construction is booming. 
It's a far cry from what followed the recession of the early 1990's, when the Hudson Valley was the last area in the metropolitan region to show improvement.
"When this all started, I remember everyone thought the boom was going to fall and we were faced with a repeat of the early 1990's," said Marc M. Goloven, senior regional economist with J.P. Morgan Chase. "Quite the contrary, that never did occur and you have to ask yourself why that is."
The answer, according to Mr. Goloven and others, lies in efforts to retool Westchester's job base from one reliant on major corporations to one catering more to small and mid-size businesses. Also, the suburbs benefited from some other economic news: low interest rates that bolstered the housing market, for example, and a tendency of jobs to leave New York City after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. 
One of the clearest measures of success is in jobs. For the most part, Westchester, as well as Rockland and Putnam Counties, has been able to hold the line on job losses during the recent recession. In August, the jobless rate in Westchester was 4 percent compared with 6.2 percent for the state (5.8 percent for the nation) and 8.1 percent for New York City, according to the State Department of Labor. In Putnam County, the unemployment rate was even lower at 3.4 percent and in Rockland County it was 4 percent, the same as in August 2002.
In the 12 months that ended in August, Westchester added 2,100 jobs, a gain of 0.5 percent while Rockland added 1,700, a gain of 1.5 percent, and Putnam added 100 jobs, or 0.4 percent. While that news is good, the area still lags from where it was before the recession of 2001. Westchester added only 300 total jobs for a gain of 0.07 percent in the period between August 2001 and August 2003, when the private sector lost 3,500 jobs, a drop of 1 percent. (The county gained 3,800 government jobs, including 2,500 in local education.) In contrast, however, New York City lost 193,700 jobs during the same period, a drop of 5.2 percent.
"This recession hit New York City particularly hard," said Chris Jones, vice president for research at the Regional Plan Association, a private nonprofit research and planning organization. "The decline on Wall Street was the biggest factor of this recession and although that's an industry important to the entire region, it clearly hits New York hardest."
In addition, the city's economy was obviously harder hit by the 9/11 attack. The buildings collapsed, and suddenly the jobs that were there were gone. Businesses small and large that depended on those jobs, from restaurants to copy shops to retail stores, struggled. High technology continued its swoon. The financial industry, which had started its slide, began to send even more jobs outside the city as part of businesses' planning for another similar disaster. Some of those jobs landed in Westchester and other counties in the Hudson Valley, with Morgan Stanley moving some operations to Harrison and New York Life doing the same in Mount Pleasant.
Still, the picture in Westchester isn't entirely rosy.
"In general things are hopeful, but there are still lots of challenges out there," said Thomas J. Morley, regional director of the Westchester Small Business Development Center. "Basically, the rich are richer but the poor are poorer, and I think that is particularly noticeable in Westchester."
While some homeowners in the county have been able to enjoy increases of more than 10 percent a year in property prices, those without such assets have continued to struggle. With an office based in Yonkers, Mr. Morley contrasts development around the waterfront with some neighborhoods in other parts of the city that have no grocery store, leaving residents to rely on more expensive bodegas. The number of Westchester families living in poverty rose 41 percent from 1989 to 1999, to 15,173 or 6.4 percent of all families, according to the Census Bureau. Westchester's Department of Social Services listed 690 homeless families and 410 homeless individuals in January 2002.
IN addition, while there is job growth in some sectors, those looking for work say the kind of jobs available has changed.
Harold J. Plaut, 32, an information technology specialist whohas been out of work since July, said the jobs that are available are paying tens of thousands of dollars less than what they did just a year or two ago.
"I remember the days of $80 to $100 an hour," he said, sitting at a state job center in Yonkers. "Today it's $30 to $50 an hour."
Joseph Conigliaro, 41, also in information technology and unemployed since December, chimed in. "I've seen as low as $12," he said. "I'd rather go work in Kmart."
Although he made it clear that Kmart was not a serious option, his comment hit one of the most common complaints about the retooling of the economy in Westchester: many of the new jobs are in retail sales paying only about $8 an hour.
The information industry, which lost 300 jobs between August 2002 and August 2003, continued to struggle. Other problem areas, according to state labor statistics, are manufacturing, with a loss of 1,400 jobs in that same period, and finance, losing 600 jobs.
In contrast, 600 jobs were added in construction, 600 in retail and 300 in leisure and hospitality. Another 2,600 jobs were added in the category that includes services like nail and beauty salons, appliance and automotive repair and laundry services.
Another issue confronting Westchester is that nearly 37 percent of the work force commutes outside the county to jobs in New York, primarily Manhattan, making the area vulnerable to continuing economic problems there, said Frank M. Surdey, regional administrator for the State Labor Department in the Hudson Valley.
Still, the economy in the Hudson Valley has been able to rebound more quickly than it did after the recession of the early 1990's.
"The recession of the early 90's was almost like the perfect storm for the region and the Hudson Valley in particular," said Mr. Jones.
Wall Street fell, military spending cutbacks hit some parts of the region, and major corporate restructuring played a big role in weakening Westchester's economy.
As jobs at the likes of I.B.M., Kraft Foods and AT&T disappeared, the unemployment rate went up and the office vacancy rate soared, in some areas to more than 30 percent. To make matters worse, the real estate market went dormant until it began to rebound in the mid-1990's, with housing sales peaking in 1998 and 1999.
But other parts of the economy were not as fortunate. Office vacancy rates and unemployment remained a problem.
"Westchester's reputation was absolutely terrible," said Salvatore J. Carrera, looking back to 1998 when he became director of economic development for the county. "There was a stigma. There was office vacancy, high unemployment and no deal making."
These days the picture is changing, with White Plains at the forefront.
Cranes hover over downtown where just weeks ago Fortunoff opened an $85 million, 180,000-square-foot retail complex that includes a Cheesecake Factory and a soon-to-open Morton's steakhouse and Whole Foods market. Nearby at the old Macy's site, the City Center is being constructed at a cost of $350 million with a just-opened Target discount department store and a 15-screen movie theater, Circuit City, Legal Sea Foods, Applebee's and Barnes & Noble not far behind.
The center is also supposed to have 600 units of residential housing, just part of the 1,800 residential units, most of them apartments, under construction downtown today.
"Ten years ago it was a rough scene," said Paul Wood, a spokesman for the city who heads economic development in White Plains. "Basically downtown was dominated by vacant stores."
Easing zoning restrictions and streamlining the building process were two factors the city credits with stimulating growth, a formula county officials are also using along with incentives like sales tax breaks to attract businesses.
A consultant was hired to evaluate the county's strengths and weaknesses. A full-time employee was brought in to deal with real estate and economic development issues.
"We found in everything we do the real key to economic development is growing your own companies," said Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano. "It's a fallacy to believe that attracting large companies from the outside is the key."
At the heart of that philosophy is jobs, he said: "If everybody's working, I've got less crime. I've got less everything to deal with. Jobs are the key to the economy and the social fabric."
Sean MacDonald, regional economist for the State Department of Labor's Hudson Valley region, said that in contrast with the economy during the recession 10 years ago, the economy of the Hudson Valley had become much more diversified. There has been expansion in distribution, warehousing, financial businesses, small banks and mortgage companies, as well as biotech jobs and health care.
For example, New York Presbyterian Hospital is planning a biotechnical research and development project in White Plains, which is expected to create 900 jobs. Morgan Stanley is relocating part of its Manhattan operation to the county, bringing with it 2,500 jobs. New York Life is bringing part of its operation to Mount Pleasant, with 1,000 employees. 
The county has also had success recently retaining midsize companies like Fuji and Heineken, both of which were shopping around for new locales before expanding their operations.
While White Plains has garnered attention for its business development and residential growth, other cities have also been experiencing redevelopment, including Port Chester and Yonkers along their waterfronts.
"I think in this region we've been seeing some pretty good numbers over the past year, and the losses in manufacturing have at least stabilized," Ms. MacDonald said.
At the same time, the real estate market has remained strong through much of the recession. The median price of houses in Westchester has continued to climb, hitting $570,000 in the second quarter of 2003, a jump of 9.6 percent or $50,000 over the second quarter of 2002. Meanwhile, the median family income in the county has reached about $60,000.
"If I was only looking at the home prices I would think this would be the best of boom times," said Mr. Goloven of J.P. Morgan Chase.
Greg Rand, a managing partner with Prudential Rand Realty in White Plains, said one of the biggest differences between the recession of the early 90's and the most recent one was that real estate helped bolster the economy this time. People turned away from Wall Street and toward real estate for their investments.
In addition, he said, the economy remained fine for many Westchester households. There weren't huge layoffs.
"The first thing we saw was just an incredible wave of demand of people that wanted to upgrade," he said. "They bought bigger houses."
Housing sales in Westchester have remained strong throughout the recession. The housing market in Putnam County, north of Westchester and with long commuting to the city, heated up, another indicator of growing demand and strong prices. The trend has continued, although it has cooled somewhat in recent months.
"We did 4,000 real estate transactions last year," Mr. Rand said. "The ones who were buying were climbing all over each other to get their bids accepted." The scene was even more frantic a few years ago, he said.
The housing market has had a strong ripple effect. Low interest rates and a flight from the stock market have brought a wave of refinancings, allowing homeowners to trade up or work on their homes, providing business for contractors, financial institutions, and businesses like home furnishings.
"I think much of what is happening is real-estate driven," Mr. Jones said. "As housing prices go up it stimulates a lot of industries." 
Real estate agents say they are also seeing a trend toward seeking investment properties. John E. Durante is among them. He started buying condominiums in White Plains in late 2001, first renting them as he waited for them to appreciate. He has now started selling them at a price about $60,000 over what he paid. Last year he bought several storefronts and apartments a few blocks from the train station in Mamaroneck followed by a 14,000-square-foot building in New Rochelle.
He hopes to close on an eight-family apartment building in Yonkers next week. "I think Westchester has everything to offer," he said, noting the easy commuting into New York City. 
Several residential developments around White Plains, once planned as apartments, are now going to be as condominiums, which economists cite as another indication of an improving economy.
While it remains to be seen if those ventures will be successful, economists say that Westchester's success could bring some problems. "Westchester's challenges, as I see them, are what I call the challenges of prosperity," Mr. Goloven said.
If the labor market continues to tighten, where will workers come from? What about housing for people of modest incomes? What can be done about traffic congestion that is worsening around major thoroughfares?
"Those are the types of impediment that could eventually stifle economic growth," Mr. Goloven said.
On the ground, the economic strength Mr. Goloven sees looks good for Philip Leggio, just a few blocks away from Mr. Khader's new deli in Yonkers. 
In a ragged area, where efforts at revitalization are starting to grow stronger, Mr. Leggio has opened a high-end white-tablecloth restaurant called Zuppa. After 26 years in the restaurant supply business, Mr. Leggio is banking on economic strength in Yonkers for his new venture, and on success in drawing a fine-dining clientele to an urban-pioneer area -- in other words, on factors that he knows are beyond his control. Yet he remains optimistic.
"I'm taking a gamble," he said. "But the harder you work the luckier you get."

HEADLINE: Corruption and Despair Choke Zimbabwe 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
The Herald, the relentlessly sunny pro-government newspaper in Zimbabwe's threadbare capital, insists on its front page that life here is on the mend. But the classifieds suggest otherwise. 
 An enterprising merchant named Zariro advertises 260-pound concrete slabs for mourners to cover and protect the fresh graves of departed loved ones. 
 "These days when you bury your dead, you have to spend the night there," Preston, a 27-year-old who supports his family through black-market currency trading, explained on a recent day. "If you don't look after the grave, the next morning you'll come back and find the body lying on the ground, and the coffin gone." 
Many here might call that a good analogy for Zimbabwe itself.
This nation was once one of Africa's most prosperous states. But it is prostrate today, its vital signs flickering, asphyxiated by ever-tighter governmental curbs on the economy and basic freedoms. Driven by desperation, greed or simply a sense that the end is nearing, its rulers and citizens are methodically stripping the country of its assets.
Zimbabwe has been officially off limits to foreign journalists since February, when President Robert G. Mugabe's government pushed a law through Parliament effectively banning outside reporters as tools of European and American critics. But a low-profile tour of the country for 11 days this month found no shortage of domestic critics, both black and white, and an outright glut of human misery. 
Desperate citizens here have become dark-of-night scavengers of coffins, copper electrical cable and even aluminum street signs, now in such shortage that finding an address is a trial.
Zimbabwe's nights are dark indeed: here in Harare, downtown street lights are turned off for lack of foreign currency to pay South African and Zambian power suppliers. 
If the nights are black, the days often exude an eerie surface calm. In Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, the handful of Western-style supermarkets remain bustling and half full of goods, though prices rise so fast that any three bottles of ketchup are likely to bear three different price stickers. Inns reflexively hand out candles and matches to visitors to address power failures. 
But much of the calm is government-enforced, courtesy of a domestic intelligence organization and a rural youth militia, the Green Bombers, widely feared for its brutality.
Although it went widely unreported, hundreds of factory workers in Bulawayo and Harare clashed violently with the police recently after trying to protest the cruelest of ironies: Zimbabwe's soaring inflation has pushed them into the 45 percent tax bracket once reserved solely for the rich. 
A better measure of life is the fenced-off compound of the British and South African High Commissions in Harare's suburbs, where crowds of Zimbabweans camp out nightly, hoping to be first in line when visa offices open the next morning. 
At 7 a.m., a half-block-square area outside the South African commission is jammed with hundreds of applicants. The crush is so great that South Africa now requires Zimbabweans to post a bond of about 160 American dollars for a mere two-week visa, a sizable sum intended to guarantee their return. 
"I haven't had a job in two years -- nobody here has a job," a 27-year-old man, a onetime roofer who identified himself only as Moses, said as he waited to pick up his visa recently. "I'm going to Pretoria to try to find something." 
He is one of the lucky ones. In a ramshackle open-air market south of Victoria Falls, hard against two camps of hundreds of shacks of scavenged planks and cardboard, Sibangisiwe Masuku, 19, buys corn kernels at the equivalent of $1.44 in American currency for 2.2 pounds, grinds them into flour and sells them for $2.24. On a good day, she makes well under a dollar in profit. 
Her parents are dead -- of what, she would not say. She moved in with a sister, who died of tuberculosis last month. Now she stays with a second sister, living on corn porridge and tea.
The ravages of hyperinflation, 455 percent a year and rising fast, are evident everywhere. It now costs 234,000 Zimbabwean dollars to spay a dog. Chicken feed is anything but: $91,500 for a 110-pound bag, more than twice the price a week earlier.
A gallon of gas costs $11,000, but is only available on the black market. In Victoria Falls, for example, most people go to nearby Botswana to fill up their tanks.
Trying to cope with an inflation-induced currency shortage, the government is churning out new $500 bills. Because the paper and ink are imported, each bill now costs more than $1,000 to print. 
(Not that $500 is a princely sum: today, it is worth about 8 American cents. Five years ago, the same bill was worth more than 9 American dollars. The average per-person income is probably about 90 cents a day, down one-third in five years.) 
"This country is truly in a crisis," said Collen Gwiyo, the 38-year-old first secretary general of the Zimbabwe Coalition of Trade Unions, a locus of opposition to Mr. Mugabe's government. "It's a political crisis, leading to an economic crisis, feeding a humanitarian disaster." 
The nature of this journalist's visit made it impossible to speak to representatives of the government, but in the past Mr. Mugabe has blamed white colonial powers, particularly the United States and Britain, for his country's problems. These countries, he says, are trying to punish Zimbabwe for its policies. 
Since 1998, when Mr. Mugabe began seizing white-owned farms, capping prices and fixing exchange rates in a populist scheme to revive his fading popularity, Zimbabwe's economy has been slowly choking. In the last year, foreign investment has vanished, and only 1 in 10 workers now holds a steady job. Agriculture, the economic mainstay, is in precipitous decline.
In a nation that exported beef and wheat only three years ago, four million people -- one in three -- now subsist on foreign food donations. Four in 10 children are stunted or wasting away from malnutrition, according to the United Nations.
Hunger, however, is not just an abstract statistic: in the Matabeleland South Province, near Botswana, the United Nations reports, the regional hospital in the town of Shangani closed in mid-September because it lacked even corn porridge to feed patients.
Members of the country's elite, critics here and elsewhere say, are scooping up the country's real wealth. They have taken control of Zimbabwe's best farmland and game parks, played the currency market with government money and channeled billions of Zimbabwean dollars in government spending through companies they or their relatives own. 
Mr. Mugabe has criticized those diversions of land and money, but there is little evidence that either has been returned. To the contrary, many here say, the scramble to get a scrap of Zimbabwe's remaining riches seems to have accelerated.
The government floated a bond issue last year, ostensibly to finance resettlement on the seized farms. Of the 7.2 billion Zimbabwean dollars raised, $4 billion went to a company owned by the nephew of the Parliament speaker, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who many say is the anointed successor should Mr. Mugabe, 79, retire or die.
Mr. Mugabe is putting the finishing touches on his own 130,000-square-foot, 25-bedroom retreat north of the capital, a $9 million palace with a Chinese tiled roof and ceilings adorned by the work of Arab craftsmen. 
A few miles farther north, at a 15,000-acre farm once nicknamed Little England, government forces evicted 1,000 settlers in September to clear the way for occupation by Mr. Mugabe's relatives and a handful of other families. 
Transparency International, the anticorruption watchdog, pegged Zimbabwe this month at No. 106 -- among the worst -- in a ranking of corruption in 133 countries. Zimbabwe was No. 71 just one year ago.
Zimbabwe's troubles began when Mr. Mugabe's government, facing rising discontent among supporters of the guerrilla movement that carried him to power in 1980, began allowing the so-called war veterans to occupy white-owned commercial farmland. 
Since then, in a period of five years, the government has confiscated 25,000 square miles of farmland, all in the name of compensating black Zimbabweans for a century of oppression under British rule.
Officials once claimed that they had resettled 300,000 families on the farms; a new government report, still unreleased, reduces that figure to 127,000. 
Mr. Mugabe and his supporters say Zimbabwe suffers largely because white leaders in Europe and the United States, angry over the land seizures, are plotting its failure. 
Both America and the European Union have cut off economic aid, blacklisted top officials and frozen some foreign bank accounts in disapproval of Zimbabwe's economic and human rights conduct. The Harare government also has blamed a yearlong drought for this year's disastrous harvests. 
The drought has hurt. But many outsiders and Zimbabweans alike blame the government for the country's woes.
The seizure of commercial farms, it turns out, kicked away the legs of the economy. With property rights no longer assured, foreign money fled.
With no foreign money, Zimbabweans could no longer buy imports. Without imports -- fertilizers, spare parts, gasoline -- large-scale agriculture has collapsed, and with it most of the industry that supported farmers.
At the same time, the ousting of all but about 600 of the nation's 4,500 white farmers also uprooted nearly 300,000 black workers on those farms, almost all of whom are now jobless. 
"They came to us and said, 'You have 10 minutes to leave this farm' -- 10 minutes -- that's it," said Edson, a 29-year-old foreman on what was once the Shrewsbury farm 40 miles south of Harare. Fearing reprisals, he spoke on the condition that his last name not be used. "We lost all our money, all our property -- everything." Since then, he said, the 600-acre tract has lain fallow. 
That is a recurring theme in conversations with local Zimbabweans of all races and economic levels. They say many of those who have taken over farmland were never farmers, but in fact were local backers of Mr. Mugabe's party who elected to reap quick profits by selling off seized assets instead of plowing and sowing crops. 
Others simply lacked the ability to run a farm -- or, because the government has yet to give them legal title to the land, had no collateral for the loans needed to buy seed and tend crops. 
The choicest farms were awarded to senior government officials and party leaders. "Of the people who got good, arable farmland, 99.2 percent are cabinet ministers, wives, political cronies, relatives, girlfriends," Barnabas Thlondlan, the associate editor of the recently banned Daily News on Sunday, said in an interview. "We call them cellphone farmers -- all they do is call every once in a while and ask, 'How's everything on the farm?' " 
Bad would be the only answer. Corn production has fallen by nearly half from its peak. Harvests of wheat, a profitable commercial crop, are down by 90 percent.
A white commercial farmer from Bulawayo who, with three other farmers, lost 50,000 acres of land to Zimbabwe political kingpins, said of those enriching themselves: "They're making their own bed to sleep in. But I tell you what: they're going to starve there."

HEADLINE: Daily Choice Turned Deadly: Children Left on Their Own 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Last Sunday, as her night shift neared, Kim Brathwaite faced a hard choice. Her baby sitter had not shown up, and to miss work might end her new position as assistant manager at a McDonald's in downtown Brooklyn.
 So she left her two children, 9 and 1, alone, trying to stay in touch by phone. 
 It turned out to be a disastrous decision. Someone, it seems, deliberately set fire to her apartment. Her children died. And within hours, Ms. Brathwaite was under arrest, charged with recklessly endangering her children. 
The investigation is continuing, and an arrest in the arson may soon overshadow the criminal charges against Ms. Brathwaite, who is not a suspect in the fire, investigators say. But she is now facing up to 16 years in prison for a decision that, surveys and interviews with experts suggest, cuts uncomfortably close to some choices made every day by American families.
Nationwide, parents themselves report leaving more than 3 million children under 13 -- some as young as 5 -- to care for themselves for at least a few hours a week on a regular basis, according to a recent study by Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization in Washington, D.C., that analyzed census information and other data.
And so the Brooklyn case highlights a much broader debate, one with few fixed legal guideposts. For state statutes typically set no age under 18 when a child is legally considered old enough to stay home alone. Thus parents are left with many case-by-case judgments, and prosecutors with vast discretion when something goes wrong.
The cases that surface are almost always the notorious failures, like the story of the 9- and 4-year-old cousins in Little Ferry, N.J., who went joy-riding in a leased S.U.V. or the former welfare mother in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, who was afraid to lose her night job processing checks at a bank, and instead lost her unsupervised toddler in a fall from a ninth-floor balcony.
But how those cases are treated, and whether they result in prosecutions, can vary widely. Several years ago, after two grand juries in Santa Fe, N.M., refused to indict parents when they had left young children at risk -- one child was left freezing in a car while her father drank in a local bar -- the local district attorney altered his policy for arresting and prosecuting parents in such cases.
"The grand jury is reflective of a community standard," the district attorney, Henry Valdez, said after his second failed prosecution.
A professor of family law at New York University, Martin Guggenheim, said that the ambiguity in criminal laws on the "home alone" question made wide discrepancies in the handling of cases inevitable.
"It puts all parents at peril in making parental choices, without warning them that certain choices are forbidden," he said.
Brooklyn prosecutors argue that no matter what, Ms. Brathwaite should not have left her children, 9-year-old Justina Mason and 1-year-old Justin Brathwaite, alone in a basement apartment in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, especially children as vulnerable as hers.
Both had sickle cell anemia, a blood disorder that often requires hospital care. And though prosecutors concede that Justina and her mother were talking by phone as late as 10 p.m., when the baby sitter had still not arrived, such conversations fall far short of the adult supervision needed in an emergency.
"She knew they were at risk," said Ama Dwimoh, the chief of the Crimes Against Children Bureau in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. "I'm not trying to do a rush to judgment, but this is why you can't leave kids home alone -- because it can result in death.
But others, from Ms. Brathwaite's lawyer to researchers of family life, say her case needs to be seen in a broader social context.
She was, they note, a single mother -- by some accounts quite devoted -- living a life of complicated choices. 
Recently promoted to assistant manager at the McDonald's, Ms. Brathwaite was required to work a rotating mix of morning, midday and nighttime shifts that made reliable child care nearly impossible to keep on her modest wages. Nor could she leave early, since she was responsible for securing the day's receipts. When desperate calls to the missing sitter and a neighbor went unanswered, her lawyer said, she was afraid of losing the job that supported her children.
"She is guilty of nothing more than being a single mom working a 12-hour shift," said her lawyer, Douglas Rankin.
Richard Wexler, the director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform who has compiled research on children left at home, said many parents take similar risks, often because better options are not available. "Although news stories repeatedly say there is 'no firm rule' concerning when a child can be left alone, actually there is one," Mr. Wexler said. "It's the rule of fate. If something goes wrong, then you are a bad parent and you will be charged. If nothing goes wrong, you won't."
Ms. Dwimoh, of the Brooklyn prosecutor's office, was not swayed. "Just because everybody does it doesn't make it right," she said. And a spokesman for the district attorney's office, Jerry Schmetterer, argued that tragic results cannot be disregarded.
"The case will be presented to a grand jury and the people of Brooklyn will speak," he said. "But our position is we had to charge -- two babies are dead."
Of course, the decision by parents whether to leave children alone usually depends on many factors besides age, such as the capabilities of the children, the ability to pay for care, cultural traditions and the perceived safety of the neighborhood.
Linda Gordon, a history professor at New York University who has written extensively on America's shifting definition of child neglect since the 19th century, said that in an immigrant nation with wide economic inequalities, beliefs and customs differ.
"This may have been an extremely competent 9-year-old," Professor Gordon said, referring to the older child in the Brooklyn case. "There are all kinds of societies where 9-year-olds take care of children. And what would have happened if the mother had been there? It's not so obvious that it would have been different."
The Child Trends researchers found that higher-income children between 6 and 9 were actually more likely than poor children to be left unsupervised for several hours, even after controlling for the fact that the better-off parents were more likely to have jobs. 
The authors of the report, "Left Unsupervised: A Look at the Most Vulnerable Children," warned that leaving children under 13 routinely on their own may put them at risk for injuries and developmental problems. But they also hedged, writing: "Self care is not always harmful. Children typically become more independent as they mature, gradually spending more and more time alone and taking increasing amounts of responsibility."
When unsupervised children become notorious, the legal system may feel extra pressure to hold parents accountable, even when the case did not end in tragedy.
In the case of the child joy riders in the S.U.V. in New Jersey, an elderly pedestrian who was knocked over suffered no lasting injuries.
Lawyers for the mothers of the two cousins said they were hard-working single moms in their 30's who were juggling responsible jobs, one at a bank during the day, the other in a hospital at night. By their account, the lack of supervision was just the result of a misunderstanding with a 22-year-old niece who was also in the patchwork child care mix.
But six weeks later, the children are still in New Jersey foster care while the State Division of Youth and Family Services investigates. And criminal charges of endangering their children are pending against the two mothers, said Dolores Aretsky, the lawyer for one, last week.
In the Ohio case of the toddler falling to his death, the 23-year-old mother, Tanisha Gill, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for choosing to leave for her job when her baby sitter did not show up. She had said the child's father promised to be right over, to watch the sleeping boys, Charles, 2, who died, and his 4-year-old brother. The father denied it.
In the end, a judge placed her on probation for three years after she pleaded guilty to reckless homicide.
Yet in other strikingly similar cases, parents were not prosecuted.
In one of the cases in Santa Fe that were rejected by grand juries, an illegal immigrant, the mother of seven, had gone to work at McDonald's, leaving a 6-year-old daughter in charge of siblings aged 3 and 1. The frightened girl had called 911. But supporters -- including the sheriff who bailed the mother out of jail -- saw her as a desperate single mother fearful of deportation who was doing the best she could in poverty.
A district attorney in Greeley, Colo. declined to prosecute Jennifer Farrell, a more affluent mother who left her six children home alone for 17 days while she vacationed in Italy. He found no evidence that the children - aged 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 14 - were harmed or faced imminent danger when the single mother left them with a stocked kitchen, a debit card for buying more food, and a list of friends and relatives to call if they needed help, The Denver Post reported.
Annette Lareau, a Temple University sociologist who has studied the child-rearing practices of poor, middle-class and affluent parents, said of the Brooklyn case, "You could say this family had very bad luck."
Professor Lareau said that among the well-off families she followed for her new book, "Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race and Family Life (University of California Press, 2003), were a pair on an out-of-town trip to a soccer championship who left two 10-year-olds, two 8-year-olds and a 5-year-old alone in a hotel room while the two sets of parents went out to dinner a mile away.
"They left the kids with cell phones, pizzas and videos saying to each other, 'They'll turn us in,' " she recalled. The children did not turn them in, however, and no fire broke out.

HEADLINE: City Pension Fund Is Venturing Into Real Estate 

BYLINE:  ByJOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
The largest pension fund for New York City employees has decided to invest in commercial real estate for the first time, committing up to $100 million to it. 
 Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., the investment adviser to the fund, the New York City Employees Retirement System, said on Friday that its action was a "prudent investment" for its members "and one that supports the growth and redevelopment of our city's economy." 
 The stock market's fall over the last three years has combined with mandated pension benefit increases to reduce the system's assets to $31.2 billion from $44.4 billion in 2000. The assets of all city pension funds have fallen to $74 billion from $105 billion in that period, said a spokesman for Mr. Thompson, Scott Taffet. 
The Employees Retirement System provides pensions to 130,000 retirees, while 200,000 current employees contribute to it. Its $31.2 billion in assets is largely invested in stocks and bonds, though it has also invested in residential real estate, Mr. Taffet said. He cited a project involving the rehabilitation of four apartment buildings in Harlem.
The system covers city employees except police officers, firefighters, teachers and other school employees, with each group having its own fund. The other funds are not part of the commercial real estate investment program, Mr. Taffet said. 
The pension money earmarked for the program will be used in ventures to "develop, redevelop and acquire premium commercial property throughout the five boroughs," Mr. Thompson said. During the next three to five years, the money will be turned over to a realty investment group, Tishman Speyer/Travelers NYC Real Estate Venture V, L.P., and the group will invest it for the pension fund. No projects have been designated yet, Mr. Taffet said.
Though the other pension funds are not participating in the commercial realty program, all but one, the fund for nonteacher school system employees, have also decided to diversify their assets more, Mr. Thompson said.

HEADLINE: J.F.K. Project Would Reopen Famed Terminal 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
JetBlue Airways and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have agreed on a plan for the airline to build a modern 26-gate terminal adjacent to Terminal 5 at Kennedy International Airport, the historic Trans World Airlines Flight Center designed by Eero Saarinen, officials said yesterday.
 After intense discussions in recent weeks, JetBlue and the Port Authority, which operates the airport, reached a consensus and submitted their final comments to the Federal Aviation Administration last week. The agency has final approval on airport projects and is expected to make a decision within a month. 
 Richard J. Smyth, vice president of redevelopment at JetBlue, said all parties "feel pretty good" that the plans will be approved.
"We finally arrived at a consensus and made a formal recommendation to the F.A.A. with an approach that seems to be the best plan for everyone," he said.
If approved, the $600 million project would be a bold, ambitious move during a dismal economic time in the airline industry and would help JetBlue, the largest domestic carrier at Kennedy, greatly expand its operations there.
The deal would also revive Terminal 5, famed for its distinctive modern style but closed since October 2001 when Trans World Airlines ceased operations.
"With the building empty, it continues to deteriorate," Mr. Smyth said. "This plan saves a historic building and allows the appropriate upgrade for a modern airline, so we can grow at J.F.K."
The 41-year-old terminal is a city landmark. But after it closed, several New York preservation groups feared that it might be declared obsolete by airport officials and demolished. They began fighting for a development project that would include it as a functioning terminal, rather than a museum piece.
Frank E. Sanchis III, executive director of the Municipal Art Society, which was involved in the discussions, called the final recommendations a "happy solution."
"The plan provides a functional use for one of the most wonderful buildings ever designed to board an airplane from," he said.
Alan Hicks, a Port Authority spokesman, said the agency was working with all parties, including JetBlue and the Municipal Art Society, to make sure that Terminal 5 remained in use. "It is a magnificent work of art, and we are very proud of it," he said.
Mr. Smyth said the existing terminal would serve as an alternative entrance to the proposed terminal behind it and would have automated JetBlue ticket kiosks. The Port Authority would control the older terminal, he said, and evaluate proposals for uses, which could include a conference center, restaurants, shops and offices.
The new terminal would be connected to the existing one by its two well-known tubular passenger walkways, which were used in the 2002 film "Catch Me if You Can" as the setting of a climactic encounter between Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.
Under the current recommendations, at least one original walkway would be preserved, with the other possibly modified or rebuilt to contain a moving walkway.
JetBlue operates 80 flights per day out of Terminal 6, but wants to triple that number by 2010, which the proposed 26-gate terminal would allow the airline to do, Mr. Smyth said. JetBlue hopes to finish it by mid-2007, and to pay for much of the cost through the sale of bonds, Mr. Smyth said.

HEADLINE: A British Import at the Shubert 

BYLINE:  By DAVID COTE

 BODY:
FOR its nearly 90-year history, the Shubert theater of New Haven has been reinventing itself.
 In 1914, when it opened, it was described by the local press as the jewel in the Shubert brothers' crown. In the 1940's and 1950's, it became famous as the out-of-town tryout theater for many hit Broadway plays and musicals, among them "A Streetcar Named Desire," and many Richard Rodgers-Oscar Hammerstein II productions, including "Oklahoma!" in 1943 and "The Sound of Music" in 1959. 
 In the 1960's and 1970's, the Shubert's fortunes went the way of the troubled economy, and in 1976, the theater was shuttered and threatened with demolition. 
But it survived, through the persistence and passion of city officials and citizens, and was reopened in 1983 as the Shubert Performing Arts Center, a nonprofit arts, education and community institution. Its decor was restored to the original design, understated alabaster walls with muted gold highlights. In 1997, further renovations upgraded the sound and lighting systems and made the space wheelchair-accessible.
Today, the programming is a multicultural, family-friendly mix of dance performances, pop concerts, and theatrical presentations and productions by local groups as well as touring Broadway productions.
Now the Shubert's management hopes another chapter may be opening as the theater welcomes the American premiere of "As You Like It," directed by the eminent Briton, Sir Peter Hall. The production, which has toured England, has a 11-day engagement at the Shubert beginning on Thursday, the first stop on a tour of the United States. It is the first major production from Europe to play at the Shubert since its 1983 reincarnation. So far at least, it has no other dates booked in the metropolitan area.
Bill Conner, the Shubert's president and chief executive officer, whose company took over the theater's management two years ago, would like it if New Yorkers trekked to New Haven to see the play. He also mentioned plans, but no specific details, for the Shubert to broaden its repertory by bringing in more shows from overseas.
"We're looking for shows next season that could come over from Europe," Mr. Conner said. "Ideally, we'd have an 'As You Like It' in our season every year." 
Sir Peter's shows have played the Shubert before; he worked at the theater in 1957, when he directed Morton Wishengrad's "The Rope Dancers" there before its Broadway run, in a production that starred Art Carney. 
"Back then, of course, you didn't need to be a huge hit to be successful on Broadway," Sir Peter said, in a telephone interview from London. "You could have a medium hit." 
At 73, Sir Peter is celebrating 50 years as a director this year. His illustrious career includes the leadership of England's Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1960's, and National Theater in the 1970's.
He has directed plays and operas in most major American cities. In 2000, he directed the world premiere of the epic "Tantalus" at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.
But although he has directed most of Shakespeare's plays, he never tackled "As You Like It." He explained that the reason was that he could not find an actress who could compete with Vanessa Redgrave's 1961 rendition of the heroine, Rosalind, a character who combines the verbal dexterity of Hamlet with the sexiness of Juliet. 
Forthis show, he found his Rosalind, close to home, in his daughter, Rebecca, 21, who earned strong reviews for her work in a London production of George Bernard Shaw's "Mrs. Warren's Profession." 
Sir Peter says his modern-dress approach to the play emphasizes the melancholy in the romantic comedy. When the production opened in August in Bath, The Guardian's Michael Billington hailed Ms. Hall's Rosalind as "groundbreaking." The London Times called the production "moving, funny, sexy and lyrical."
Meanwhile, the Shubert's days as a tryout house are not entirely over. In recent years, the composer Frank Wildhorn tested out "Jekyll & Hyde" and "The Civil War" there, and next March the Shubert will present a pre-Broadway run of a musical version of "Little Women," directed by Susan Stroman. 
Dani Davis, one of the producers of "Little Women," acknowledged that trying out a show so close to New York is risky.
"The pressure will be on," she said.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN; 
New Lures on Caribbean Shores

BYLINE:  By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS; FRANCES FRANK MARCUS writes frequently about travel.

 BODY:
EARLY on a September morning in Old San Juan, guests on a breeze-swept terrace at the elegant Hotel El Convento sipped coffee and ate freshly sliced mangoes, papayas and pineapple. A reception desk clerk stayed busy answering the phone, a honeymoon couple checked out and, behind a terrace door, guests admired the cozy library. September is the depths of the doldrums in the Caribbean, but on that day, El Convento was bustling, thanks in part to bargain room rates.
 Caribbean travel is showing signs of resurgence, though not on every island, with help from the bargain prices many tourists have enjoyed in the past couple of years, as hotels responded to post-Sept. 11 fears of flying, continuing economic worries in the United States, and war. 
Last winter was promising, said Alec Sanguinetti, director general and chief executive of the Caribbean Hotel Association, with increases in air arrivals over the previous year. When the Iraq war started, he said, "There was not a rash of cancellations, but advance bookings just fell off the radar completely." 
 Bookings this summer rose in response to off-season bargains -- like El Convento's $125-a-day rate in September for rooms that go for $345 in winter -- but the lower prices cut profits. "It's a tough market out there," said Mr. Sanguinetti. "Everyone is still watching the economy. It's the No. 1 problem right now."
 But for people craving a Caribbean getaway, there are new and newly redone rooms in hotels, inns, cottages and villas in many price ranges. Add to that a flurry of new amenities: increased air service; spas; lures for honeymooners, couples and families; activities; and luxury touches. 
 Puerto Rico, which has the region's busiest airport, actually saw a rise in its hotel occupancy of 3.7 percentage points over the previous year, to 78.2 percent. This season the island is welcoming its first all-inclusive hotel, the 490-room Paradisus Puerto Rico, part of a large Spanish hotel chain, scheduled to open Dec. 15. Puerto Rico's satellite island, Vieques, recently gained its first large luxury hotel, the 156-room Wyndham Martineau Bay Resort -- and lost a major sore point, maneuvers by the United States Navy. But a 506-unit hotel, Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach, sister to the more upscale Hyatt Dorado Beach, closed July 15. (The popular river pool, children's club and other attractions are still open along with the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar, a time-share property on the Cerromar's grounds.) A corporate announcement gave as reasons "the general business climate and the proliferation of newer and more modern competitors."
 In a new marketing plan, Puerto Rico is urging visitors to venture out from the island's North Coast and historic Old San Juan, bustling with stylish restaurants, shoppers and strollers, to the less-traveled western side, where surfers have ridden winter's waves for decades. The coast is now called the Porta del Sol for its spectacular sunsets.
 There are many lures in this part of Puerto Rico, diving, hiking and bird watching among them. At certain periods during the winter in Rincon, a west coast surfing town, people gather by the hundreds to watch whales swimming close to shore in the Mona Passage, between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. February is high season for whale-watching. The main vantage point is the Rincon Lighthouse Park. 
 Built on a secluded beach in Rincon, the elegant boutique hotel Horned Dorset Primavera recently grew to 53 units with the addition of 22 spacious villa suites with private plunge pools; the new suites start at $890 a night, rooms at $600, including breakfast and dinner but not the service charge on meals and the 9 percent government tax. The new Blue Room restaurant decorated with Italian tiles is an alternative to the imposing formal dining room. It is open for breakfast now and, starting Nov. 15, will also serve bistro fare for lunch and dinner. The new 70-foot lap pool overlooks the sea.
 "We've found all these rooms rent first," said Wilhelm Sack, general manager and co-owner, on a tour of the new suites. 
 A new 112-room hotel, Rincon of the Seas Grand Caribbean, opened this year and unlike the Horned Dorset welcomes children under 12. Decorated with blue and green print fabrics, guest rooms have off-white tile floors and balconies. Winter rates start at $225. Among the island's more affordable hotels, the charming beachfront Casa Islena has nine rooms brightened with Mexican furniture and winter rates starting at $115. 
 In other parts of the Caribbean, visitor numbers increased early this year in the Turks and Caicos, Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bonaire, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Dominica, Jamaica, Saba, St. Lucia and St. Maarten. Visitors to Aruba surged by 15 percent in August over August of last year because hotels there offered some attractive package deals.
 In the U.S. Virgin Islands visitors from January through June decreased very slightly from the previous year, but some resorts have been busy. At the palatial, newly expanded Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas with 200 rooms and suites, each with a private balcony or terrace, and a plush new spa with an inviting lounge on a scenic terrace, occupancy rates in July reached 90 percent. Some low-season guests have gotten rooms for $189. High-season rates, starting at $489, have not risen this year. "We're being conservative," said Jamie Holmes, the general manager, "because we feel the market is still a little bit fragile."
 In August, responding to dismal bookings, and competing with newer, spiffier hotels, the 65-room friendly Bolongo Bay Beach Club on St. Thomas, which has two popular restaurants and simple rooms facing a 1,000-foot crescent-shaped beach, dropped its $145 a night autumn rate to $79 until Nov. 23 for reservations made by Nov. 1. Bolongo Bay is also offering 20 percent discounts on all hotel packages and activities from Jan. 3 to 31, pricing rooms at $172 a night.
 On St. John -- more than a million people visited the popular National Park in 2002 -- snorkelers ply the blue-green waters along beautiful beaches, and hikers walk scenic trails. The Cinnamon Bay Campground and the resort Maho Bay Camps within the park have been thriving. From high season through April, occupancy rates at the 114-unit Maho Bay Camps were 85 to 90 percent, bolstered by family and yoga groups. The resort's "real gem," said Maggie Day, the general manager, has been the Art Center, where guests learn how to blow glass, make pottery and create other hand-crafted pieces. Winter double rates, $110 for a tent-cottage ($115 for February and Christmas and Easter weeks), will stay the same.
 The elegant Buccaneer Resort on St. Croix, on 340 acres with 138 rooms and suites, an 18-hole golf course, a spa and eight tennis courts, is offering a fourth night free for rooms with ocean views Jan. 4 through 24. Winter rates start at $295, including full breakfast and use of kayaks. 
 Tourism on the island has been down, said Joel Tutein, superintendent of the U.S. Virgin Islands Park Group in St. Croix. In 1988, the year before Hurricane Hugo permanently closed four large hotels, the coral-rich Buck Island Reef National Monument, he said, attracted 105,000 visitors, compared with 50,213 in 2002. Carnival Cruise Lines stopped coming in May of last year because of "crime against passengers and crew," said Jennifer de la Cruz, a spokeswoman for Carnival. Later, other cruise lines bypassed St. Croix, causing shops and the cruise ship terminal to close. Now, with surveillance cameras in place and more police, it is possible, according to industry representatives, that at least some ships will return. 
 A well-regarded dive shop, St. Croix Ultimate Bluewater Adventures, has been seeking new divers by giving free scuba demonstrations in hotel pools and last month staged a large underwater wedding. There is a new scuba shop and a new pier for dive boats at the 129-room Divi Carina Bay Resort and Casino, which is offering new nightly bargain rates as well: $174 for a standard room Jan. 4 to Feb. 7, and after that, $190 until April 9, compared with $225 last winter, when the occupancy rate was only 50 percent. Perched along a beach protected by a reef, the hotel expects to open 50 more rooms that can be turned into 25 suites by the end of March.
 The Bahamas, on the other hand, seem to be in a mild upswing. There are 700 Bahamian islands and 22,000 rooms in a variety of hotels, villas and timeshares; the major excitement is in the Outer Islands with the Nov. 15 opening of the 183-room Four Seasons Resort Great Exuma at Emerald Bay. The resort will have a spa and fitness club, Zen garden and 18-hole golf course; a casino will follow. Set on a crescent-shaped inlet, the hotel is British colonial in style with a cluster of three-story pastel stucco buildings with shutters and white tile roofs.
 Through the end of June, Bahamas air arrivals were up 1.2 percent, hotel occupancy rates were 63.9 percent and room rates were up 5.7 percent over 2002, according to the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. "Some resorts have done spectacularly well, like Atlantis," said Vincent Vanderpool-Wallace, director general of tourism, referring to the megaresort on Paradise Island, "and others not so well."
 "We know what the problem is: customers want properties spruced up a bit," he added. "Atlantis has shown us that sun, sand and sea are not enough. People don't buy rooms, they buy an anticipated experience." 
 The 2,300-room Atlantis is popular, said Howard Karawan, executive vice president of Kerzner International, which developed, owns and operates the resort, because of its many activities. The occupancy rate at Atlantis this year through mid-September was 85 percent with no rate decrease, though since 9/11 marketing has increased. Last month the company broke ground on the first phase of a $600 million expansion, luxury villas, at the intimate One & Only Ocean Club, where winter rates start at $695. "This has been by far its most successful year," Mr. Karawan said, referring to the Ocean Club's 80 percent occupancy rates this year. "High-end people are still traveling." 
 Jamaica had an increase in stayover visitors -- 7 percentage points in the first six months of this year over the same months last year, according to the director of tourism, Paul Pennicook. He said that more people were looking for soft adventure, such as swimming with dolphins, possible in Montego at Half Moon Bay Resort, which has a new Dolphin Lagoon. The price for an hour's swim is $155. Within the next year, Mr. Pennicook said, the island will have more than 1,000 new rooms, mostly in new all-inclusive hotels and lodgings. The all-inclusive Riu Club Negril with 450 to 500 rooms is scheduled to open in March near its sister resort, the Riu Club Tropical Bay. Prices for this winter, he predicted, "will inch up but will still not get back to pre-9/11 prices -- I don't think that will happen until 2005."
 On Grenada, a new hotel owner, Susan Fisher, a former fashion executive, recently opened Bel Air Plantation on the southeastern coast. The resort is made up of six villas and five cottages built on a hillside, along with an upscale restaurant, cafe, grocery, art gallery and small beach. Butterfly and bird aviaries will follow next year. With winter rates starting at $295 a night, Bel Air hopes to attract busy people who crave serenity, Ms. Fisher said. To that end, it does not admit guests under the age of 15. For bookings for 2004 made by Nov. 30, seven nights will be offered for the price of six.
 In the Dominican Republic, known for competitive pricing, 223 of 7,000 new hotel rooms this year can be found at the all-inclusive Viva Tangerine, scheduled to open Nov. 1 on a 361-foot beach in Cabarete, a North Coast wind-surfing town. From Jan. 3 through 31, double rates will start at $174, and from February through April 10, $190, including meals, drinks and wine, 24-hour snacks, aerobics, nonmotorized water sports, nightly entertainment, dance lessons, yoga and meditation classes, and programs for children from 4 to 18. Beginning Dec. 1, when the parent company, Viva Resorts, joins Wyndham International to become Viva Wyndham Resorts, the hotel will be called Viva Wyndham Tangerine. 
 Tiny, mountainous Saba in the Dutch West Indies is home to the Ecolodge Rendez-Vous, built to attract nature lovers, hikers and divers, with 12 simple cottages (with bathrooms), most of which sleep four, costing $85 a night in high season. Since it opened in August 2002, occupancy rates have been only about 25 percent, but the Rendez-Vous's Rainforest Restaurant has become popular.
 Near Saba, there are bargains on both sides of the island shared by Dutch St. Maarten and French St. Martin. Hotel packages on St. Maarten have been offering every fourth night free, every fourth day car rental free, and a $50 coupon per room redeemable at restaurants and other places, similar to a program last year when every third night was free. The promotion may go beyond Dec. 15, said Regina LaBega, St. Maarten's director of tourism. Hotel occupancy rates have been averaging 65 percent this year, she said, compared with 48 to 50 percent last year. St. Martin hotels are offering every seventh night free until Dec. 15 and will have other promotions for winter.
 New spas are springing up around the Caribbean like ferns in a rain forest, from St. Kitts in the Leeward Islands to tiny, exclusive Mustique, part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. "In the old days," said Mark Nooren, managing director of the Renaissance Aruba Beach Resort and Casino, recently upgraded with a $13 million redo, "a resort was all about restaurants, discos and casinos. Now it's about spas, tai chi and yoga." In addition to therapies at its Okeanos Spa, the resort offers massages in a cove on its private island, which is frequented by flamingoes.
 Hot rocks (massages with stones) are showing up at many places. One is Indulgence by the Sea on Aruba, a small new spa at the all-inclusive Divi Aruba, a sister resort to the Tamarijn Aruba. A massage might be needed after a visit to the new 3,000-square-foot activity center, set to open this winter with a 30-foot-high climbing wall and a health club with Cybex workout equipment. A nine-hole golf course is expected to be completed in March or April.
 And there are French-trained spa therapists at the stylish new Cap Est Lagoon Resort and Spa on the southeast coast of Martinique. Thirty-five of the hotel's 50 suites have pools. Winter rates start at $468 and include the breakfast buffet.
 At secluded Little Dix Bay in Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands, a new cliffside spa has a two-tier plunge pool, nine treatment rooms in separate cottages offering views and, among other treatments, a $125 Virgin Gorda goat milk and honey wrap. To the southwest at upscale Peter Island Resort, the old spa has been replaced with a larger one: 13,000 square feet and 10 treatment suites large enough for couples. 
 St. John's genteel Caneel Bay Resort will soon have new activities at its Self Center, which a brochure describes as "a mind body spirit center." Among the new sessions will be the Art of Divine Love for Couples, Planetary Cycles and World Trends, and the Healing Power of Music.
 Coco Kreole on St. Lucia has no spa, but starting at $80 a night ($75 in low season), it is cheap and cheerful. The 20-room yellow and blue boutique hotel, equipped with wireless Internet access, is scheduled to open this weekend in Rodney Bay, near local restaurants and bars. Allen Chastanet, its owner, has plans to build 90 more rooms nearby. 
 Among islands contemplating ways to fill vacant hotel rooms, Dominica, the island with relatively few good swimming beaches but pristine waterfalls, coral reefs, hiking trails, a boiling lake and magnificent rain forests, also shelters large, endangered turtles. By persuading its resident turtle hunters to become turtle guides, the local tourist authority is hoping to add a new activity for visitors -- watching the island's leatherback, hawksbill and green turtles.
 For bargain hunters dreaming of coconut rum punches on a tropical beach, summer's fire sales have vanished. But now that "just in time" bookings are pervasive, last-minute specials seem likely. As Mr. Pennicook of Jamaica said: "We have been our own worst enemy in this industry. We have trained customers to expect bargains."

HEADLINE: Mr. Washington Goes to Mississippi 

BYLINE:  By Nicholas Dawidoff; Nicholas Dawidoff is the author, most recently, of "The Fly Swatter," a finalist for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize in biography.

 BODY:
August afternoons in rural Mississippi are so oppressively hot that even the mule -- prized by local farmers for its ability to withstand the sun -- was traditionally taken out of harness and "shaded" during the warmest hours. For aspiring politicians, however, there is no such relief: they have to take the heat all day long. 
 Which explains why Haley Barbour, the 55-year-old Republican candidate for governor of Mississippi who will challenge the Democratic incumbent, Ronnie Musgrove, in what promises to be a closely contested Nov. 4 election, is walking across a dusty red-dirt parking lot in Leake County toward a livestock-auction barn on an August day when, says Parks McNabb, one of Barbour's many youthful campaign workers, "they've got the heat set on hell." Mississippi is a state that roils with poverty and pride, and gubernatorial candidates who don't at least try to "strike hands" with every voter in the state still risk the dread appellation "uppity." There are now 2.8 million citizens spread across Mississippi's sprawling expanse of 82 counties, and at mud derbies, catfish fries, county fairs and N.R.A. banquets, Barbour has extended his hand and said "How you doin', I'm Haley" to a lot of them. A portly fellow with a looming, affable face and a rigid discus of silvering hair, Barbour has already shed 20 pounds during his summer on the hustings. 
 Now he walks past a farmer selling watermelons off the back of a truck and enters a battered amphitheater where perhaps a hundred slouching men are studying a gangly calf while the auctioneer calls out bids in a fevered chant. Barbour begins slapping backs, introducing himself around. The auctioneer looks annoyed. "We get a lot of politicians in here," he barks at Barbour. And with that he kicks him out of his barn. 
Back in the parking lot, while his wife, Marsha, buys a watermelon, Barbour is unabashed. "Profit's got to be made," he says cheerfully. "Guy's gotta sell cows. It's his business."
Barbour himself has a business. Out on the stump, speaking in a drawl lately grown so sweet and sticky you could pour it on your griddle cakes, the candidate likes to refer to "our little lobbyin' firm up in Washington, D.C." There is, however, nothing down-home about Barbour Griffith & Rogers Inc. Situated in a luxe office building high above Pennsylvania Avenue, B.G.&R. is perhaps the most influential lobbying firm in the country. In a day when some lobbyists wield more power than many legislators, Barbour has been the best connected of them all, "the quintessential creature of Washington," according to The Washington Post. 
Befitting a man to whom some of the world's most powerful corporations have paid many millions of dollars to press their interests in Washington, the office Barbour has left behind is a spacious room with soft green leather furniture, a collection of fine whiskey and wines and walls covered with photographs of Barbour alongside the many Republican sachems he has served over the years: among them Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush, whom Barbour used to call Junior. When Barbour required a little air, he could step out onto his private balcony and gaze upon the Capitol, off to his left, and the White House, over to the right -- each of them mere blocks away and with doors that were very responsive to Barbour's knock. If he desired prandial refreshment, Barbour could stroll down to the Caucus Room, with feasting senators in the lunchtime crowd and a salad on the menu named after him. That's an insider joke. Barbour is prone to prime steaks with his bourbon, and at the Caucus Room there is always a tender cut waiting for him. There had better be: he founded the joint. 
Yet even more intriguing than Barbour's decision to forsake this gilded life for the more rustic pleasures of the Mississippi Statehouse is the mere fact of his candidacy. Lobbyists are by definition the champions of special interests, the landlords of the back room with scant interest in the little guy who cannot afford their costly rents. 
Their infamous reputation is the reason that, through most of this country's history, the mere idea of a man with such a professional background running for governor would have been risible. That Haley Barbour may become the first political lobbyist of his stature ever to win a high elective office, indeed, that he is a viable candidate at all, is a weather vane that points vividly to where we are now as a political nation. 
On a recent Friday morning, a gleaming succession of expensive sedans and S.U.V.'s began turning into the parking lot at the Mississippi Coliseum in downtown Jackson. Eleven hundred prosperous Republicans were arriving to have lunch with Barbour, for which they had paid $1,000 or, if they wanted their pictures to be taken with Barbour's guest of honor, $10,000. That guest was President George W. Bush, one of many Republicans who have traced a path to Mississippi, including Vice President Dick Cheney; Donald Evans and Rod Paige, members of the Bush cabinet; Jeb Bush, Florida's governor; Senator Elizabeth Dole; and Ari Fleisher. When Ed Gillespie, the Republican Party chairman, came to Jackson in August, he promised that the party would "do everything that we're legally allowed to do" for Barbour. As for the other Republican races this fall, Gillespie allowed that "they're all important to us, but Haley Barbour and I go way back."
One of Barbour's political skills is his ability to have things both ways. As a man of means running for office in a disadvantaged state, he has employed a folksy conversational insouciance to leaven his aura of privilege even as he is stressing his high-placed connections. The day before the Bush luncheon, he told The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson's paper, that he and the president were the sort of friends who "talk politics, prop up our feet, walk over somewhere and get lunch." Then, at the Mississippi Coliseum, Barbour listened as the president climaxed his remarks by describing Barbour as "a fellow that when he picks up the phone, the president might just go ahead and answer it." Afterward, Bush went to the airport; the BMW's and Mercedeses departed, too, leaving Barbour with a new campaign-fund infusion of $2.2 million. 
For any candidate that would be an exemplary midday's work, but in Mississippi, where the median household income is $30,161, it is a truly astonishing sum. Barbour is now moving at a fund-raising pace that is expected to more than double the combined $6 million that Musgrove and his Republican opponent spent in their 1999 governor's race. 
He seeks the cash because election politics in Mississippi are really no longer much different than they are everywhere else. Old-style retail handshaking and speechifying may still be necessary for cosmetic reasons, but as Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican, says, they are "not nearly as important as having a good television strategy." Importing prestigious national politicians is a time-tested means of getting free television coverage on the news and enables Barbour to raise the money to pay for the television advertisements with which he has been saturating state living rooms since February. It also helps buttress the impression that as a man with access to powerful people he will be a governor with the ability to extract favors for the state. What remains to be seen is whether Barbour can spend himself local. He has, as they say, been away for a while. 
The son of a lawyer, the grandson of a banker, Barbour comes from Yazoo City, a small town on the fringes of the Mississippi Delta, the vast flood plain that contains some of the richest soil and poorest people in the United States. Ignatius Semmes Luckett, who went to the University of Mississippi with Barbour, says that the Delta "was a wonderful place to grow up if you were a privileged white kid. If you had the sensitivity of an anvil, it helped you though."
Mississippians frequently describe their politics as "inbred," and the great incubators are the elite Ole Miss fraternities. Barbour enrolled at the university in 1965, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi recalls him as "one of the stars going through rush." He pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon, where the Tara-like columns in front of the house are guarded by gold lions, and soon earned a reputation as a man of access and influence. "He was a big dog," says Candy Barnes, a schoolmate. "Sort of a fixer. If you needed something, Haley could arrange it." 
In 1968, he ran for student-body president. Among the candidates was another Delta boy named Walter Thompson. Less than a week before the election, a Barbour campaign worker mimeographed a one-page anti-Thompson screed and, in the dead of night, distributed what became known as "the smut sheet." "First dirty trick I ever saw in campaign politics," says Ray Mabus, the former Mississippi governor, who is a University of Mississippi graduate and a Democrat. "He was clearly willing to do anything to win." On election day, both Barbour and Thompson were defeated.
That summer, Barbour presided over 30 counties for Richard Nixon's presidential campaign. Republican politics had begun to offer rare opportunities for a young, talented Mississippian. The South had voted Democrat since the party of Lincoln imposed Reconstruction right after the Civil War. Then, in 1964, the Johnson administration's passage of the Civil Rights Act led to the Republican challenger Barry Goldwater's Southern sweep in November. (Goldwater won 87 percent of the vote in Mississippi.) With the party only beginning to field candidates, Barbour became a regional power broker while still in his early 20's. Clarke Reed, a businessman who took on the revival of Republican politics as a personal mission and admired Barbour's efficiency and intensity, says he was "publicly invisible, doing the work, making the contacts." 
With Mississippi suddenly in play on a national political level, Reed and Barbour could get an appointment to see virtually any Republican they wanted, including senators, congressmen, President Nixon and members of his cabinet. "We'd entertain, throw swell parties," Reed says. "We worked the hell out of Washington." 
In the mid-1970's, Barbour joined the family law firm in Yazoo City. It was in those years, Reed says, that Barbour first "evolved into lobbying." Barbour describes that evolution during the one brief interview he granted for this article: "Having been a lawyer, I didn't think being a lobbyist was any worse than what I was used to. Lobbying is just another form of advocacy. It's like trying a lawsuit." 
Seated in his campaign R.V., Barbour says that he "never dreamed" of running for governor until he realized that "we're in the worst financial mess in the state's history." He bemoans the loss of manufacturing jobs, low school test scores, soaring drug-related crime, lawsuit abuses and the fissiparous relationship between the governor and the Legislature. He insists that he will be a persuasive advocate for the state. That "Mississippi's in crisis" is a fundament of Barbour's campaign. But Barbour's lobbying partner Lanny Griffith admits that part of the rationale is, "He's been successful, and it's a way to cap off a career." 
In his campaign office one recent morning looking eerily energized after he had, as usual, permitted himself four hours' sleep, Gov. Ronnie Musgrove regarded Barbour's revelations skeptically. For decades, Mississippi has rated near the bottom in nearly every quality-of-life index, including per capita income. The numbers remain bleak, with nearly 18 percent of all residents living below the federal poverty level. Yet, of late, there have also been some causes for optimism. Barbour is running and raising so hard because he has a formidable rival. 
Musgrove is a man without pedigree, an anti-abortion-rights, bird-hunting conservative Democrat who in many ways embodies the Republican ideal of the self-made man. The child of blue-collar workers, neither of whom completed 11th grade, Musgrove had jobs from the time he was 10, laboring in cotton and soybean fields, roughnecking on oil rigs and selling reference books door to door. With the money, he put himself first through community college, then Ole Miss -- where he was not invited to pledge a fraternity -- and finally the University of Mississippi law school. In 1987, he was elected to the Legislature and was voted lieutenant governor eight years later; he became governor four years ago.
Education, Musgrove's means of personal ascent, has been his political fixation, and he is always holding forth on why"our first priority as a state has to be our schools." Unfortunately for Musgrove, these discourses are delivered in a chirpy hill-country tremolo that genteel Mississippians -- and state legislators -- find oppressive. (For a time, the Barbour campaign considered using "A Strong Voice for Change" as its campaign slogan.) Nonetheless, Musgrove has been a reasonably effective agent of progress. Under his watch, Mississippi has financed substantial raises in teacher pay, has placed a computer in every classroom and has managed to attract a Nissan factory -- and more than 5,000 well-paying jobs -- to Canton. That the plant is the only automobile factory to open in the country this year, and during a time of national recession, when factories have been fleeing Mississippi, is an economic and a symbolic achievement for a state where employers have tended to doubt the capacities of the work force.
Musgrove contends that "this election is not about who can raise the most money, how many ads are put on television, who has the most political friends in Washington." But if Barbour has grasped anything during his life in politics, it's that the Mississippi governor's race may well be about exactly those things. Barbour has always demonstrated a penetrating understanding of the modern process of achieving political power. He put that savvy to such abundant use in the service of so many Republicans after leaving Yazoo City that he may be as responsible as anyone for the current national dominance of the party.
Barbour seems to have always been a student of politics, scrutinizing the men he served and extracting shrewd lessons from their careers about what it takes to be elected. That is to say, he does not seem like an organic politician so much as one sedulously self-formed in the experiences of other people. 
In 1980, he worked for John Connally, the former governor of Texas, a magnetic but flawed candidate who spent $13 million in a disastrous run for the Republican presidential nomination. Barbour says that one thing he learned from Connally was not to be too forthcoming: "I'd say, 'Gee, Governor, we got to get us a stock answer!"'
Two years later, John Stennis, a six-term Democratic senator, came up for re-election. Stennis was such a revered icon in Mississippi that even the 60 minutes a year he spoke to the press were celebrated as "the Hour of Accountability." "Running against John Stennis was like running against John the Baptist," Trent Lott says. Still, when no Republican stepped forward, Barbour announced his challenge. 
Competing against an octogenarian who had lost a leg and tended to ramble when he spoke, the 34-year-old Barbour employed the principle campaign strategy of implying that Stennis was too old for the job while always denying that he was implying any such thing. (Barbour's campaign slogan was "A Senator for the 80's.") Once, when Stennis arrived for a speech, he was greeted by a banner from the Barbour campaign wishing him a happy 81st birthday. A small girl gave him a cake with 82 candles on it. Later, after Stennis refused to debate him, Barbour broadcast an "empty chair" debate splicing in disjointed clips from the Hour of Accountability for Stennis's responses. Lanny Griffith, who managed Barbour's 1982 Senate campaign, explains: "You couldn't just run a positive campaign. Ultimately, we knew we wouldn't win unless people made a conscious decision that Senator Stennis was too old for the job. We had to do things to encourage that process of examination." 
Of the "debate," Mike Espy, a former Mississippi Democratic congressman, says that it made "Stennis seem incoherent and senile, which was clever but doomed Barbour." 
The undignified treatment of Stennis infuriated many voters. John Jameson, a Washington political consultant who was then a Stennis campaign worker, remembers one man telling him, "I'd vote for a yellow dog that had been lying dead in the hot August sun for two weeks before I'd vote for Haley Barbour." Stennis easily won re-election.
One of Barbour's lowest moments of the campaign was when President Ronald Reagan refused to come to Mississippi to campaign for him. Reagan and Stennis were friendly, and Stennis, it turned out, had asked the president to stay in Washington. "That hurt Haley personally," Griffith says. "But things have changed. Now he's pretty much got anybody in the country." 
'The oil of politics is personal relationships," says Alan Simpson, the retired Republican senator of Wyoming, and few men have been more gifted at such lubricating than Barbour. His melting grin and gregarious conversation strewn with local color are seductive enough that he is described by assorted Democrats as "amiable," "easygoing," "irresistible" and "friendly." But for all of his pigs in pokes, dogs that won't hunt and troubles lying in the weeds, Barbour never fell off any turkey truck. Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan government-watchdog organization in Washington, says: "He's a charming, likable, roguish character who represents despicable clients. Nobody knows who the real Haley Barbour is beneath all the schmooze." 
Barbour served as President Reagan's political director from 1985 to 1986. Ed Rogers, Barbour's other lobbying partner, who was his deputy in those days, remembers the glee with which Barbour networked. "He had the attitude, 'Let's ask for forgiveness not permission,"' Rogers says. In the years after leaving the Reagan White House in 1986, Barbour joined and left lobbying, law and consulting firms -- always, he says, retaining a financial interest -- sat on corporate boards, raised funds, advised campaigns and pursued political connections with a breathless appetite. "He's an entrepreneur," says former Senator Bob Dole. "He's this. He's that. He's everywhere. He's like fog. Get up in the morning, there's Haley, a cloud hanging over somewhere." 
Or at least hunkered in the parking lot. When Dole was Senate majority leader, according to Rogers, Barbour somehow cadged a parking pass so that he could sit in his car until Dole arrived for work. Then, Rogers says, Barbour "would ambush him, walk in with him." People hired him because he gave excellent advice, was, Senator Cochran says, "indefatigable" and made and maintained relationships with powerful people. And what kind of guy is he? His nephew Henry Barbour, who is managing Barbour's gubernatorial campaign, says that his uncle "is a voracious reader." Reader of what? "Memos," Henry says. His singular devotion to his work caused his wife to spend most of her time in Mississippi, saying, "I'd rather be by myself in Yazoo City than be by myself in Washington." 
Barbour, meanwhile, became chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1993. With a Democrat in the White House, Democratic majorities in both the Senate and the Congress and the Republican Party cleaved by conservative and moderate factions, it was another time of opportunity for Barbour. He spent many evenings with the Congressional minority whip, Newt Gingrich, "our coats off, sleeves rolled up," Gingrich says, plotting the Republican agenda. Barbour faxed daily missives exhorting Republicans to heed what were becoming their unifying tropes -- small government, low taxes, mild regulation and relentless outrage at Bill Clinton. Barbour became a catalyst for a more publicly disciplined party that would win historic majorities in both houses.
Barbour's fruitful insight was that electoral politics at the millennium was substantially about who had more money and that a small collection of wealthy contributors could bring the Republican Party control of a very large country. The 1994 and 1996 elections were his great preoccupations as chairman, and he took them on with a military aggressiveness. In particular, he was a cunning and determined fund-raiser, coaxing record-setting donations through all manner of enticements, including invitations to cocktail parties and meals with politicians like Gingrich and Dole. Barbour was reported to be happy to place telephone calls to state legislators on behalf of corporate contributors to the R.N.C. The party created policy institutes with high-minded names like the Coalition for Our Children's Future and then spent the bulk of their financing on campaign issue-ads. 
It was the coming of the Age of the Lobbyist. In 1968, there were 62 lobbyists in Washington; today there are 21,000. Barbour understood that beyond petitioning legislators, lobbyists were now, in effect, their fund-raisers. By soliciting campaign donations from their corporate clients in exchange for access to candidates, lobbyists asserted themselves as essential middlemen. Noting this, as party chairman Barbour was not above a little intimidation; according to The Washington Monthly, executives were warned that there would be consequences for hiring Democratic lobbyists -- a brazen technique now officially known as the K Street Project, after the area in Washington where many lobbyists have their offices.
Not that he was reluctant to make direct requests for donations. "The first rule of fund-raising is, You gotta ask, and Haley ain't afraid to ask," Henry Barbour says. "Second rule is, You've got to ask for a specific amount of money. He does. He asks for a lot. He likes to say: 'You got to flatter 'em. You want the guy to give you 5 grand, ask for 15. Let him give you 5 and make him think he got off easy."' Lanny Griffith says: "He really does enjoy it. He's so neat and orderly about raising money, it's almost like counting votes."
Before his candidacy, Barbour said that he viewed politics as "a game" and, according to Charles Lewis, that "if the terms and conditions are right, I don't have anything that isn't for sale except my wife and children." The jovial candor with which he sometimes discussed his tactics defused the toughness of his methods. Barbour appeared to be a sportsman fencing with his Democratic rivals. One of his contradictions is how such a congenial man can be so blithely capable of behavior that others consider unethical. When he began the job as party chairman, Barbour promised to divest himself of his lobbying concerns, but never did. As a gubernatorial candidate, he has again not severed his financial ties. "You can be sure that everyone in town knows it's still Haley's firm, and sitting lobbyists making millions of dollars influencing government should not be simultaneously running for office," Lewis says. 
Recent disclosures that Barbour's lobbying partners, Griffith and Rogers, are two of the principals in New Bridge Strategies, a company that somewhat impatiently describes itself as brokering "areas of opportunity" for American businessmen in postwar Iraq, has led Barbour to disclaim any real connection to the outfit. Yet, New Bridge Strategies shares an address with Barbour Griffith & Rogers, and Barbour previously served on the advisory boards of two New Bridges affiliate companies. 
In 1997, Barbour completed his term as party chairman and returned to the lobbying trade. Immediately, many of the R.N.C.'s biggest corporate donors signed on with his firm. Added to a client list that already included the Swiss government -- requiring counsel following news reports that its national bank had financed the Nazi government by securing the deposit of looted wartime gold -- were the five major tobacco companies (which gave the Republican Party a reported $22 million between 1996 and 2001), airlines, drug companies and defense contractors. Most lobbying firms in Washington have a bipartisan roster of employees, but B.G.&R. insists on a Republican staff, right down to the receptionists. The advice the firm often gives its corporate clients includes this: Open a Washington office and supply those in-house lobbyists with plump checks for the politicians you want something from.
Those checks can be handed off in person at B.G.&R. For years, night after night there have been elegant cocktail receptions at the firm, where clients stand amid orchids, objets and tables amply spread with food and liquor confiding their legislative desires. Barbour contends that lobbying is only "effective at the margins," but this is vintage self-deprecation. Barbour's friend, Democratic foil and restaurant partner, the colorful lobbyist Tommy Boggs, says that "in the Senate, where it's very difficult to get anything passed, a lobbyist can influence five to seven senators."
The Interpublic Group of Companies, a marketing-services company, made a similar estimation of Barbour's capacities. In 1999, Interpublic bought B.G.&R. for $20 million, retaining Barbour as C.E.O. The next year, B.G.&R. took in nearly $11 million from clients like Phillip Morris, Lockeed-Martin, GlaxoSmithKline and Microsoft. Those businesses were glad to honor Barbour's lavish invoices because they know he can see any Republican he likes and that lawmakers tend to respond to his wishes. 
In 1997, for instance, on behalf of his tobacco clients, Barbour rolled up his sleeves with Gingrich shortly before the balanced-budget agreement was to be passed by Congress. Together, the two former colleagues quietly infused the bill with a $50 million tobacco tax break. Only when it reached the Senate was Barbour's handiwork exposed and denounced by Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, as "midnight madness" that "shines and stinks like rotten mackerel in the moonlight."
Nobody can say how often such ploys succeed, but they do. One of Washington's truths is that legislators frequently don't read bills and that lobbyists often draft them. A most instructive primer as to how government now works is to stand in a senator's office with one of his aides and have him take you line by line through a bill, telling you which lobbyist wrote each sentence. Senators and congressmen spend so much of their time fund-raising that they rely on lobbyists for expertise, trusting that with each side presenting its case just solutions will prevail. 
In 2001, as the Bush administration was contemplating its energy policy, several major utilities contracted with Barbour to lobby against regulations for the industry. During the previous year's election campaign, Bush promised to set limits on power-plant emissions. But in March, Vice President Cheney receiveda pointed letter from Barbour wondering how Cheney intended to distinguish his administration's environmental policy from "Clinton-Gore." Two weeks later, Bush announced that the utilities would get what they wanted. 
Campaigning against "a multimillionaire Washington lobbyist" has proved irresistible to Musgrove. He has drenched radios and televisions with tales of Barbour "helping the big tobacco companies that peddle their products to our children and poison their future" and collecting lobbying fees from the Mexican government and lobbying for free trade, which "cost Mississippi 41,000 jobs." 
And what route does a man with a cartographer's knowledge of the Washington political geography take when he ventures outside the Beltway? During an appearance at a DeSoto County Catholic school, in a somewhat cryptic attempt to express his support for Head Start programs, which help poor children, Barbour said: "Head Start is a godsend for Mississippi. Some of those kids in it would be better off sitting up on a piano bench at a whorehouse than where they are now."
That was the rare unscripted moment. Barbour has conducted the coy campaign you might expect from a man about whom Barbour's brother Jeppie says, "My brother's a politician with more tact than nerve." Barbour offers rhetoric busy with conservative shibboleths -- "For people who choose not to work, those who do work shouldn't have to pick up the pail for you." But such welfare-bashing does little, it would seem, to advance the debate about how to solve Mississippi's chronic poverty.
Barbour's enormous campaign budget and speeches consisting of gestures to patriotism, moral values, low taxes, jobs creation, small government but big law enforcement make clear that it is Barbour who is Junior Bush; he has replicated himself from the presidential template. Barbour, in fact, makes frequent references to Bush's personal affection for him as a fellow C student and is given to denouncing "liberals" with a borrowed dose of bravado. "Bring 'em on!" he cries day after day. 
Barbour's campaign has experienced some unexpected obstacles. In August, his son Reeves was arrested for public drunkenness. There has also been the question of what many Mississippians consider Barbour's belated interest in the state's problems. While Barbour did join a successful Yazoo City effort to bring a penitentiary to his hometown, Gene Triggs, a retired vice president of Mississippi Chemical Corporation, complains that "he made few contributions to Yazoo City." According to Triggs, the once thriving town has never recovered from the period of school integration in the 1970's and 80's, when many whites, like Haley and Marsha Barbour, packed their children off to the private academies that were opening across the state. "Any parent has the right to send their kids where they can get the best education," Triggs says, but keeping your kids in public school "was one positive stand a person could take to make the community better. I felt he should have exerted some leadership, and he never did." 
During the years Barbour was based in Washington, he sought to keep his feet in two places, accumulating, Barbour says, millions of frequent-flier miles. Richard Scruggs, a prominent Mississippi lawyer, remembers Barbour having himself paged at an Ole Miss football game. "Name recognition, you know," Scruggs says. "He doesn't miss a trick." In his efforts to persuade voters that he is just folks, Barbour has been distancing himself from his previous life, including the Caucus Room, saying, "I got nothing to do with thatbut being a name stockholder." This is news to Tommy Boggs, who says that Barbour "conned" him into the venture. "It was really his idea, which is so Haley," Boggs says.
Musgrove has his own personal vulnerabilities. To exploit them, Barbour favors oblique messages, easily deciphered by his audience and potentially devastating to his opponent. "Haley is one of the best at throwing out a seemingly unrelated idea to create an association -- a kind of subliminal effect," says Marty Wiseman, a political scientist at Mississippi State University. In a religious state where issues of "family" are paramount to many voters, Barbour's penchant for beginning his public sentences with the phrase "Marsha and I" helps voters remember that, as governor, Musgrove was divorced two years ago. There has been more acrimony over what some consider Barbour's racial politics. His practice of wearing a Mississippi State flag pin on his lapel is a reminder to a voting constituency lately referred to as "Nascar whites" that in 2001 Musgrove supported removing the Confederate emblem from the Mississippi flag. But the removal was badly defeated, with only 35 percent of voters backing it, in a state that is 36 percent black. Another source of controversy has been the Web site of a white segregationist organization named the Council of Conservative Citizens, which features a photograph of Barbour attending this summer's C.C.C. fund-raiser for private academy schoolbuses. 
Back in 1967, when William Winter, a Democrat, was running for governor, his campaign was smeared by handbills equating a Winter election with "Negro domination." Recently, according to the Musgrove campaign, handbills have been mailed out that say "Some of Ronnie Musgrove's important appointments" and show photographs of his black appointees. Nobody has claimed responsibility, and the Barbour campaign says it knows nothing about the handbills and denies involvement in any divisive tactics. Barbour says that he hopes to win black votes -- he greets the rare black voter at his events warmly. But James Cobb, a Southern historian at the University of Georgia, says that Barbour is "the poster boy for polarization."
Then there is the matter of the lieutenant governor's election. In Mississippi, candidates for governor and lieutenant governor are obligated by the state Constitution to run separate campaigns and often have little politically in common except party affiliation. The incumbent, Amy Tuck, was elected as a Democrat but switched parties once in office. And when a black lawyer and legislator named Barbara Blackmon won the Democratic lieutenant governor's primary, Barbour introduced the novel notion of a "Musgrove-Blackmon ticket" into his speeches. He has since kept it up, warning his mostly all-white crowds that "Blackmon did a great job getting out her supporters." By supporters, he means blacks. Blackmon, if elected, will become the first African-American to hold statewide office in Mississippi history. A laborer's daughter who grew up in inner-city Jackson, Blackmon graduated from college at 19 and subsequently earned three graduate degrees. Her presence on the ballot is expected to energize Mississippi's heavily Democratic black electorate. When she encountered Barbour after a labor meeting at which he made references to her, she told him that he wasn't running against her and requested that he desist. "He told me I was right, and he wouldn't do it in the future," she says. That has turned out to be Barbour's first broken campaign promise. 
While Barbour denies race-baiting, Winter says that Barbour's mention of the ticket is "a nuanced racist message," and Hodding Carter, president of the Knight Foundation and former editor of The Delta Democrat Times, says that Barbour's reference to liberals and tickets "is simply code for nigger-lover, integrationist, supporter of all the changes they've hated since 1964." To Robert Haws, chairman of the history department at the University of Mississippi, the election has become a referendum on progress. "If the subtle way Haley Barbour's using race is rejected by a Musgrove victory, then we may be into a genuine new era of Mississippi politics. I don't know why a middle-class white Mississippian would vote for Haley Barbour when he doesn't represent their interests at all, but race is still deep here."
At the moment, the Mississippi governor's race is too close to call. Should Barbour win, his many connections could well be beneficial to a small, impoverished state. But would this be good for American politics? After all, it was Walt Whitman who described lobbyists as "crawling, serpentine men, the lousy combings and born freedom sellers of the earth." And just 11 years ago, Ross Perot received 19 percent of the popular presidential vote as an outsider inveighing against lobbyists and special interests. That now, Haley Barbour, the consummate Washington insider, merits reasonable electoral consideration for state office is surely an indication of how dominant the roles of money and influence have become in American politics. And Barbour may be only the beginning. If he prevails in November, Alan Simpson says that other lobbyists will soon follow. "They see he can win," Simpson says, "a lot of those guys will say, 'I'm gonna give it a try."' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Page 48 of The Times Magazine today about Haley Barbour, a lobbyist who is running for governor of Mississippi, misspells the name of a company that has been represented by his group. It is Lockheed Martin, not Lockeed-Martin.
An article on Oct. 19 about Haley Barbour, a lobbyist who is running for the governorship of Mississippi, referred incorrectly to Barbara Blackmon, who is running for lieutenant governor. If elected, she would not become the first African-American to hold statewide office there. The first was James Lynch, elected secretary of state in 1869.

HEADLINE: The Last Emperor 

BYLINE:  By Peter Maass; Peter Maass, a contributing writer, last reported for the magazine from Iraq.

 BODY:
The Dear Leader is a workaholic. Kim Jong Il sleeps four hours a night, or if he works through the night, as he sometimes does, he sleeps four hours a day. His office is a hive of activity; reports cross his desk at all hours. Dressed as always in his signature khaki jumpsuit, he reads them all, issuing instructions to aides, dashing off handwritten notes or picking up the phone at 3 a.m. and telling subordinates what should lead the news broadcasts or whom to dispatch to a prison camp. His micromanaging style is less Caligula, with whom he has often been compared, and more Jimmy Carter on an authoritarian tear.
 The Dear Leader, as the North Korean media refer to him, wishes to be viewed as a modern leader. He has boasted to visitors that he has three computers in his office, though it's not known if he operates them himself or has aides who do so. His eldest son is reputed to be a computer whiz and, like sons the world over, is credited with bringing his father into the digital age. When Madeleine K. Albright, then the secretary of state, visited North Korea in 2000, Kim asked her, as he said farewell, to give him the State Department's e-mail address. 
 Because of weakening eyesight, the Dear Leader rarely reads newspapers; for keeping abreast of world affairs, he relies on television. It is a safe bet that he is well aware of the uproar caused by his government's confirmation, earlier this month, that it has begun making nuclear bombs from reprocessed plutonium. In a meeting a few years ago with a group of South Korean media executives, Kim explained that he began watching South Korean television in 1979. A media junkie, he also watches NHK from Japan, as well as CCTV from China and CNN. Having led his nation into chronic poverty and famine, what does he make of the enormous wealth he sees in the broadcasts and commercials? 
Ordinary North Koreans would be sent to the gulag for watching Western TV, but the Dear Leader may do as he pleases, as all dictators may do as they please, and it pleases him to watch television. He especially enjoys watching tapes of the latest movies from Hollywood, some of which are believed to be sent to Pyongyang in diplomatic pouches from North Korean missions in New York and Beijing.
Kim is not known to speak Japanese or Chinese, so interpreters presumably assist him with foreign-language broadcasts; on any given evening, his interpreter might be his favorite mistress, Ko Young Hee, who was born in Japan and is assumed to speak Japanese. When Kim watches Russian television, as he says he does, he may not need an interpreter, because he spent his early years in the Soviet Union; when Russians visit, he sings them Soviet military songs. As for English, he knows at least a few words. A Japanese man who worked as Kim's personal chef wrote in a recent memoir that the Dear Leader always asked for extra helpings of toro, his favorite cut of sushi, by saying "one more" in English.
The Dear Leader has always been a master of details. Although it was not until 1994, upon the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, that Kim Jong Il became the official ruler of North Korea, he was all but running the country for years before that. Appointments to any senior post were made by him, whether in the Korean Workers Party (which controls all government institutions) or the Korean People's Army. Decisions on all manner of issues -- from the gifts of food and electronic goods that party officials and commoners received on national holidays to the direction and scope of the country's clandestine nuclear-weapons programs -- were made by "the party center," as Kim was called, in whispers, in the years before his father's death. The choicest reward that he doled out was a Mercedes-Benz with a license plate that begins "2-16," in reference to his birthday, Feb. 16.
The Dear Leader's political skills, underestimated by foreign observers until recently, are beginning to register now that he has begun meeting foreigners on a regular basis and now that his regime, along with Iran, is one of two surviving members of the "axis of evil" proclaimed by President Bush. Albright's delegation spent more than 12 hours with Kim over two days in October 2000, half of that time in negotiations and the other half at dinners and ceremonial functions. During one negotiating session, Kim was presented with a list of 14 technical questions related to his missile program; the Americans expected him to pass the list to advisers who would respond later. Instead, Kim went down the list, one question after another, and answered most of them himself.
Indeed, the Dear Leader, who turned 62 this year, knows quite a bit about the world around him. And after decades of being nearly clueless, the world around him is gradually getting to know the Dear Leader, too.
The Bush administration is trying to figure out how to end Kim's regime, or at least to neutralize it. This is proving to be an extraordinarily difficult task, since the regime is far more resilient than anyone expected and far more dangerous.
North Korea has possessed short-range missiles for years, but was never known to have long-range missile capability. Then in 1998 North Korea stunned the intelligence community by launching a three-stage rocket bearing a satellite. The C.I.A. says that it believes these Taepodong-1 rockets could be used as missiles to reach the United States. The rocket veered off course after launch, so the North Koreans obviously have some kinks to work out. Even so, Washington is worried, not only about North Korea being able to launch an intercontinental attack but also about the North Koreans selling their missile technology to other regimes. North Korea is believed to have provided missiles to Pakistan in exchange for nuclear technology. And according to a recently released report by David Kay, the C.I.A. adviser on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, North Korea agreed in 1999 to a missile deal with Baghdad that was aborted late last year. 
No one is sure of North Korea's own nuclear intentions. In 1994, facing the threat of a pre-emptive attack by the United States, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for a package of foreign aid and energy supplies. At the time, the C.I.A. publicly estimated that North Korea might already possess an atom bomb. The 1994 agreement fell apart in 2002 after North Korea kicked out U.N. nuclear inspectors who were keeping watch over 8,000 plutonium rods that could be reprocessed into weapons-grade material.
During the past year, North Korea strongly hinted that the rods were being reprocessed, and on Oct. 2 the regime announced, more directly than before, that the reprocessing was under way and that its "nuclear deterrent force" was being expanded. Experts say that if all 8,000 rods are reprocessed, North Korea could make perhaps 20 nuclear bombs, butit's not certain whether bombs have yet been made; bluffing is an integral element of Kim's nuclear poker game.
Along with South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, the United States began the first round of so-called six-party talks in Beijing with North Korea in late August, and a second round may be held in November. Whether those talks take place, and what happens if they do, depends greatly on whether the Bush administration decides to offer incentives for Kim to disarm or whether it decides to isolate him further. The underlying issues are quite stark: Can Kim be reformed? Can he be deposed? At the heart of the matter is this: Who is Kim Jong Il?
Dictators come in different strains, like poisons. Some are catastrophically toxic; others, less so. Quite often, the harm a dictator will cause is associated with an internal drive to violence or a paranoia that begets violence or a mixture of both. Saddam Hussein is a case in point; his personal viciousness is legendary. Dictators of this sort are easy to read and easy to despise because they are obvious killers.
But what is to be made of a dictator who is charming, as Kim can be, and has never been known personally to raise a weapon or even a hand against anyone? This can be a no-less-dangerous strain of dictator, and in the world today, Kim Jong Il is its most striking example. Though friendly with important visitors, Kim is vicious to his own people. An estimated two million of them died during a preventable famine in the 1990's, and several hundred thousand are in prison and labor camps; many have been executed. 
While I was a reporter in South Korea, from 1987 to 1990, it was common to view Kim as an erratic playboy; tales of his reclusiveness and tastes for women and wine were abundant. He was, it seemed, a nut job, incapable of holding North Korea together once his father died. While Kim Il Sung was alive, Kim Jong Il avoided the spotlight. North Koreans did not even hear his voice until a broadcast in 1992, when at a ceremony for the army's 60th anniversary, he said, "Glory to the people's heroic military!" Six words. It would be many years before he was heard from again.
Kim Jong Il has never granted an interview to a Western reporter, and visits to North Korea by Western journalists are exceedingly rare. (I visited Pyongyang in 1989 but was refused a visa this time around.) However, since 2000 a flood of information has emerged from South Koreans, Russians and Americans who have met the Dear Leader and from high-level defectors who have escaped his orbit. What emerges from these sources is a picture of a dictator who is not crazy like Idi Amin or bloodthirsty like Saddam Hussein. Kim can be courteous, he is very intelligent and he doesn't drink nearly as much as he is rumored to. Nor is he the playboy that the popular myth makes him out to be.
Instead, his dictatorship mixes high technology with Confucian traditions: a kind of cyberfeudalism. It is an ideology that has been catastrophic for the people of North Korea.
It was the summer of 2000, and Kim Jong Il was in a sunny mood. He had just held a summit meeting in Pyongyang with Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president at the time. The South Koreans, in order to make the meeting happen, had provided $100 million in under-the-table payments, which meant North Korea's usually bare treasury was temporarily not so bare. The cash had created a brief thaw in relations, and on Aug. 5 a delegation of South Korean media executives, including the heads of its television networks and newspapers, arrived at Pyongyang airport.
On their first night in North Korea's capital, the visitors from Seoul were treated to a feast at a banquet hall. Wine from Bordeaux was served, along with multiple courses of Korean food, including kalbi-kuk, a meat stew. The guests ate with copper chopsticks, and their dinner lasted for four hours, presided over at the head table by the Dear Leader. Seated to his right was Choe Hak Rae, then publisher of Hankyoreh Shinmun, a newspaper known for its friendly coverage of North Korea. 
As Choe recalls, Kim was ebullient, acting more like a Broadway producer with a smash hit on his hands than a dictator running a repressive and impoverished regime. Kim told jokes and casually conversed about everything from horses to missiles. When a fawning aide stopped by the head table and began praising his boss, Kim told him to skip the formalities -- his precise words, in Korean, were "Cut it out" -- and pour wine for their brothers from South Korea. He cried out "Straight!" when it came time for a toast, meaning that they should drain their glasses, but he only sipped his own wine. Kim told his guests that his doctors had suggested he cut down on liquor. Dictators can do many things, but they cannot keep their livers young forever.
The conversation turned to hobbies. Kim is an avid equestrian and told Choe that his best thoughts occur on horseback. He prefers Orlovs, a Russian breed, and likes to ride them as fast and as far as they can go.
The subject of war was raised, delicately. Why, Choe inquired, was North Korea's government spending its scarce resources on ballistic missiles instead of education or other social programs that would directly benefit its starving citizens? The Dear Leader did not hesitate to reply. "The missiles cannot reach the United States," he said, "and if I launch them, the U.S. would fire back thousands of missiles and we would not survive. I know that very well. But I have to let them know I have missiles. I am making them because only then will the United States talk to me."
The North Korean leader took a liking to Choe and invited him to return with his family, offering to show them around and ride horses with them. When Choe left Pyongyang a few days later, Kim shook his hand at a farewell luncheon and said, with great emotion: "Keep your promise. Come next spring with your family." 
Choe has not returned -- the North-South thaw has chilled a bit -- but North Korean officials have passed on to him a stream of entreaties from the Dear Leader. The gist of the messages, according to Choe, whom I met in Seoul in August, is quite simple: "Why haven't you come?" 
According to the official version of his life story, Kim was born on Feb. 16, 1942, in a log cabin on Mount Paektu, the highest mountain on the Korean Peninsula. When he was born, the official version goes, the sky was brightened by a star and a double rainbow. 
The truth is that Kim was born a year earlier in the Soviet Union, at an army base near Khabarovsk, in the Soviet far east, not far from the short border shared by the two countries. His father was stationed there as the commander of a Korean battalion in the Soviet Army 88th Brigade, which engaged in reconnaissance missions against Japanese troops. Because it would be inconvenient, for reasons of Korean nationalism, to have Kim born on foreign soil, his place and date of birth have been fabricated in official biographies.
The biographers also make no mention of Kim's childhood name -- Yura, which is Russian and was used through his high-school years. Kim had a younger brother who also had a Russian nickname, Shura. In 1945, after Japan was defeated and the northern half of Korea occupied by Soviet troops, Kim Il Sung was taken to Pyongyang by his Soviet benefactors and installed as the leader of North Korea. (The official version has Kim Il Sung heroically leading Korean guerrillas in a rout of the Japanese.) A few months later, the boys moved to Pyongyang, where their younger sister, Kim Kyung Hee, was born.
Shura died in 1948 in a drowning accident while swimming in a pond with Kim Jong Il. In 1949, Kim's mother, Kim Jong Sook, died while giving birth to a stillborn child. Though well cared for -- their father, after all, was North Korea's leader -- Kim Jong Il and his little sister became de facto orphans: their mother dead, their father busy laying the groundwork for his socialist paradise. In 1950, the Korean War broke out, and the children were sent to the safety of Manchuria, where they stayed until the war ended in 1953. Kim was learning to survive on his own, which meant using his wits.
Back in Pyongyang, he attended Namsan Senior High School, where the ruling elite's children were educated; he often rode a motorcycle to class. Even then, he was a student of power. According to Hwang Jang Yop, who was a top aide to Kim Il Sung, the younger Kim showed an early interest in politics. (Hwang defected from North Korea in 1997, so his memoir, published in South Korea, is hardly an official hagiography.) In 1959 Hwang accompanied Kim Il Sung to Moscow, and although Kim Jong Il was only a senior in high school, he went along, too.
"Kim Jong Il was intelligent and full of curiosity, asking me many questions," Hwang wrote. "Despite his young age, he already harbored political ambitions. He paid special attention to his father. . . . Every morning he would help his father to get up and put on his shoes." In the evening, Hwang wrote, when Kim Il Sung returned from a day of official meetings, Kim Jong Il assembled his father's staff "and had them report to him about the things that happened during the day. He then proceeded to give orders."
In 1964, Kim graduated with a degree in political economy from Kim Il Sung University, an elite institution where, according to a South Korean biographer, he was addressed as "the premier's son." He went to work in the central committee of the Korean Workers Party, first as a ministerial assistant, swiftly becoming a senior official in the propaganda and agitation department, which controlled much of the party's agenda.
Kim was working his way up the system, and working the system, but also looking over his shoulder. Nothing in his rise to power would be easy or preordained. Dynastic succession was far from inevitable, and even if there was to be a dynasty, it was not clear whether Kim would be its beneficiary. His uncle, Kim Young Ju, was a senior government official. More threatening, however, was Kim's new stepmother: Kim Song Ae, a typist whom Kim Il Sung married in the early 1960's.
According to accounts from defectors, as well as from Chinese and Soviet visitors to North Korea, Kim Jong Il did not get along with his stepmother. There are unconfirmed stories that he tore her face out of pictures. Kim Song Ae became a member of the central committee of the Korean Workers Party, giving her a position from which to influence succession. She had children with Kim Il Sung, and one of their sons, Kim Pyong Il, was viewed as a possible heir because of his intelligence and likeness to his father. (Famously, Kim Jong Il was several inches shorter than his father, an inconvenience that led him to wear platform shoes.)
As he moved to secure his position, Kim needed to remain in the good graces of his father while outmaneuvering his stepmother, half-brother, uncle and anyone else -- particularly the country's powerful generals -- who wished to lead North Korea.
Kim Il Sung's regime did not take long to veer from Communist orthodoxy and become a personality cult of the sort perfected by Stalin in the Soviet Union. In the early 1970's, North Koreans began wearing lapel pins bearing the likeness of the Great Leader, as the official media described Kim Il Sung; he was portrayed as, basically, infallible. The elite was purged of anyone with wavering loyalty or anyone who might develop wavering loyalties; Kim Il Sung placed close relatives at his side.
During this period, Kim Jong Il was working hard to smooth his way to power.
"I had an impression that he was implementing his plans to get rid of even those very close to Kim Il Sung, including his uncle," Hwang wrote. "In order to show his father that he was the most loyal, he singled out people near Kim Il Sung. Arguing that these people were not loyal and citing doubts about their ideology or competency, he would relentlessly attack and remove them."
Until recently, conventional wisdom held that through the 70's and 80's Kim Jong Il filled his nights with parties and days with terrorism. In 1987, two North Korean agents placed a bomb aboard a Korean Air Lines flight, killing all 115 people on board. One agent, a young woman, was caught and said after extradition to Seoul that her controllers told her the attack was ordered by Kim Jong Il. 
Whatever his role in terrorism, it has become clear that Kim Jong Il was running North Korea well before his ailing father died in 1994, at the age of 82, of an apparent heart attack. In the years before his death, according to Hwang, "Kim Il Sung was not the Kim Il Sung of years past. Most of his vitality had disappeared, and he was turning into an old man concerned only with successfully handing over power to Kim Jong Il."
Many North Korea experts believe Kim Jong Il stayed in the background for the sake of appearances: in a Confucian society, a son must defer, publicly, to his father. If Kim Jong Il moved too rashly, he might have engendered resentment from elderly members of the military whose backing or quiescence he needed.
One way he cemented his hold on power was to do as his father did: place close relatives in influential positions. Kim's sister, Kim Kyung Hee, became a powerful figure within the Korean Workers Party and has been referred to in the government media as "First Lady." Her husband, Chang Song Taek, heads the party's organizational department. His brother, Chang Song U, commands the army district that defends Pyongyang.
Kim's control over the military and his insinuation of loyalists into key command positions are a linchpin of his hold on power. He travels often within North Korea, particularly to military bases, because, as he told the South Korean media chiefs, "my power comes from the military." Though he has many posts, including general secretary of the Korean Workers Party, the one that truly counts is his chairmanship of the National Defense Commission, which controls the armed forces.
Kim's regime is best understood as an imperial court, clouded in intrigue, not unlike the royal households that ruled Japan, China and, throughout most of its existence, Korea itself. Until the 20th century, Korea was led by feudal kings, notably the Yi dynasty. By creating a personal and uncaring regime, Kim Il Sung wasn't stealing a page from only Stalin; he was also stealing it from Korean history, a fact that helps explain its durability.
"North Korea is a semifeudal society that is still based on traditional Korean values," says Alexandre Mansourov, a scholar at the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies who was a Soviet diplomat based in Pyongyang in the 1980's. "There are traces of modernity, but if you look at the structure of thinking, it is very traditional, in a medieval sense."
A hallmark of emperors is lavish court entertainment in the face of poverty or distress in their domains. Kim Jong Il appeared to be cut from this imperial cloth. Through the 70's and 80's, stories emerged from North Korea of wild parties Kim Jong Il held, attended by beautiful women and drunken men. One of the finest accounts of that era comes from Choi Eun Hee, a popular South Korean actress who was kidnapped from Hong Kong in 1978 and bundled off to North Korea. Kim was disappointed with the backward state of North Korea's film industry, so he tried to jump-start it by ordering the kidnapping of Choi and, shortly thereafter, her husband, Shin Sang Ok, a director in Seoul. 
After they were taken to Pyongyang, he explained to them, in a conversation that they surreptitiously recorded, "I just said, 'I need those two people, so bring them here,' so my comrades just carried out the operation." Eight years later, after making a number of films in North Korea, Choi and Shin escaped while visiting Vienna.
In a memoir she wrote with her husband, "Kidnapped to the North Korean Paradise," which has not been published in English, Choi recalls being woken one morning at 5 at the guarded villa where Kim had placed her. Her controller told her to get dressed quickly, but wouldn't say why. Within minutes, a Mercedes arrived at the villa and whisked her into central Pyongyang, to a building used for Kim Jong Il's parties.
"As I entered," Choi wrote, "I was assaulted with the pungent odor of alcohol. Farther inside, I saw quite a spectacle. Forty or 50 people apparently had partied all night. The men were drunk, and there were several women I had never seen before."
They perked up when the actress arrived. She was prevailed upon to have a drink, then another and another. The Dear Leader was not in mint condition; his eyes were bloodshot, and his speech was slurred. He had apparently been drinking all night long.
"A band was performing in the front of the room," Choi wrote. "All the girls were in their 20's. Kim Jong Il, drunk, gave a string of requests. Songs changed according to his request. The girls looked tired. He asked me to conduct the band. I declined, but then the others joined in on the request: 'Comrade Choi, our beloved leader doesn't let just anybody conduct the band. It's a great honor. Do it."'
So she did it. She soon felt ill from the alcohol, and Kim Jong Il ordered one of the women to take her to a room upstairs to rest. She fell asleep on a sofa, but was soon woken by a senior party official. "I felt lips on my cheek," she recalled. She slapped the official and told him to get lost.
Accounts of this sort gave the impression, outside North Korea, that Kim Jong Il was no more competent to take charge of his homeland than Hugh Hefner. Now, however, his bacchanalian ways are being viewed from a different, subtler perspective. As anyone who has spent time with South Korean or Japanese politicians knows, boozing and womanizing are an integral part of their political culture. Your drinking buddy is your political ally. It is the equivalent, in Tokyo and Seoul, of jogging with George W. Bush. Bonds are forged; loyalties, rewarded.
While at high school, Kim Jong Il had a close friend whose older brother was married to a particularly attractive young woman, Sung Hae Rim. At the time she was 19. Kim noticed her beauty, as teenage boys do, but nothing came of it until he graduated from college and, while working at the central committee, immersed himself in a passion that would remain with him for the rest of his life: movies. He often visited Pyongyang's main film studio to watch movies and visit sets. He would later receive credit for producing at least a half dozen films and musicals, and he wrote two books, "On the Art of Cinema" and "Kim Jong Il on the Art of Opera" (both works are sold at Amazon.com).
During one visit to the studio, he again noticed Sung Hae Rim, who had become an actress and was usually cast in the role of a heroine. One thing led to another, and Kim fell in love. Inconveniently, Sung Hae Rim was married and had a child, but according to her sister, Sung Hae Rang, who defected in 1996 and recently published a memoir in Korean, Kim forced Sung to leave her husband and live with him.
It was a strange and tragic situation. Kim could not marry Sung because of her previous marriage, her child and the fact that she was six years his senior; in a Confucian society, a match of that sort would be frowned upon, especially for a man who was to inherit a nation. Kim did not even feel safe telling his strait-laced father about his new love; the affair could bump him off the fast track to succession.
According to Sung Hae Rang's memoir, which is called "Wisteria House," her sister was moved to one of Kim's secluded villas and rarely traveled outside of it. In 1971, she became pregnant. This posed a logistical inconvenience, because Kim could not visit the hospital where she gave birth. To do so would reveal to prying eyes that he was the father of an illegitimate child.
Sung's sister wrote that Kim and Sung arranged a covert system to inform him of his child's birth and its sex. Kim parked his car outside the hospital every night she was there and flicked his lights on and off to signal that it was he. Once the baby was born, Sung signaled back the birth of the child and its sex by flicking the room's light on and off in a prearranged sequence.
The child was a boy, and he was named Kim Jong Nam. Within a few years of his birth, Sung Hae Rim began suffering insomnia and other nervous disorders. She was sent to Moscow for treatment at sanitariums and spent most of the remainder of her life there; she died in Russia in 2002. When her sister left for Moscow, Sung Hae Rang was put in charge of the boy's upbringing. Though it became known in Pyongyang that he was Kim Jong Il's son, Kim Jong Nam remained cloistered at different villas and was eventually sent with Song Hae Rang and her son, Lee Il Nam, to Geneva, where Kim Jong Nam was enrolled at a private school. Lee Il Nam disappeared from Geneva and emerged later in Seoul. He wrote a memoir about his life in the Dear Leader's household, and in 1997 he was killed in what South Korean officials say was an assassination by North Korean agents.
The palace intrigue had other chapters. Kim Il Sung became aware of Kim Jong Il's affair and disapproved of it. In the early 70's, he ordered his son to marry Kim Young Sook, the daughter of a senior military official. Although Kim Jong Il does not spend much time with his "official" wife, she has remained loyal to him. She is not considered a power broker. She bore a daughter by Kim; the daughterhas played no role in politics.
Kim soon fell for yet another woman, Ko Young Hee, a dancer who caught his eye when her troupe performed at one of his parties. A delicate beauty, she was from a family of Koreans who had lived in Japan and immigrated to North Korea in the 1960's. Kim could not wed her -- he was already married, after all -- so he housed her in still another of his villas. She soon bore him two sons, and last year she was spoken of publicly -- and favorably -- in the North Korean media, suggesting that her sons were rising in official esteem. Early this month, however, a Japanese newspaper reported that Ko Young Hee was seriously injured in a car crash.
In 2001, Kim Jong Nam was detained at Narita airport, outside Tokyo, as he was trying to enter the country with two women and a 4-year-old boy on a fraudulent passport from the Dominican Republic. He said he just wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He was expelled to China. Because, in part, of this embarrassment, Kim Jong Nam is no longer considered a front-runner for succession; two North Korea watchers in Seoul told me that he lives in China and is afraid to return to North Korea. It now appears that Kim Jong Chul, 22, the Dear Leader's son by his mistress Ko Young Hee, is first in line for succession.
At 8 in the morning on July 26, 2001, a five-car train rolled into Khasan, which is on the Russian side of the border between Russia and North Korea. A carpeted platform was brought to the main car, and when its door opened, Kim Jong Il emerged, waving and smiling to the officials assembled at the station. Kim was embarking on the longest foreign trip in his adult life, a 24-day rail odyssey across Russia.
Journalists scrambled to various cities on the itinerary -- Khabarovsk, Omsk, St. Petersburg and Moscow -- hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious North Korean. Few of them succeeded, because Kim was kept far apart from inquiring eyes. He traveled in an armored rail car, with a locomotive seven minutes ahead to make sure the track was safe and another locomotive several minutes behind to make sure nobody could commandeer a train and ram it into the rear of the Dear Leader's caravan.
For the Russians who escorted Kim, the trip offered the first prolonged encounter foreigners would have with him. The informal silence about the trip lasted for more than a year, until Konstantin Pulikovsky, a presidential envoy who headed the Russian delegation escorting Kim, published a memoir in Russian about the journey. This led other officials to discuss it, including Georgy Toloraya, a diplomat who had been based in North Korea and speaks fluent Korean.
The Dear Leader, it turns out, does not travel third class. His train was stocked with live lobster, French wine and fresh pastries, and his entourage included four young women who entertained him and his companions by singing songs in Korean and Russian. One car was a meeting room with two flat-panel screens, one for films (videos of military parades were among his favorites) and the other for a satellite-updated map of the train's progress, much like the ones in airplane cabins.
Kim visited an array of sites, including a pig farm, a brewery, a space firm and the Hermitage Museum. He even went to a department store in Khabarovsk, where he stopped at the perfume department and asked where the scents came from. He spent a few minutes in the beauty salon and also visited the sports department, where skis and sportswear were sold; he rubbed the fabrics to assess their quality. In the men's-wear department, he inquired why somepants had cuffs and some didn't, and he seemed surprised at the cost of Italian shoes -- about $400.
"Do people here really buy such expensive shoes?" he asked.
For the Russians, Kim's rail odyssey confirmed what they had been thinking of the Dear Leader -- that he is smart and wants to reform his country's failed economy, but does not wish to lose power. "When I read somewhere that he is a madman who doesn't understand what he is doing -- that is laughable stuff," said Toloraya, the Russian diplomat who was on the train and met Kim on several dozen occasions. Toloraya is now the Russian consul general in Sydney, and I interviewed him on the phone. "He is a professional in state governance. What he does is very well prepared. It would be a mistake to think of him as an impossible, unpredictable character. He is an emotional person, but he is a professional. He knows what he is doing. He plans several steps ahead."
The Russians weren't the only ones getting to know the charms and wishes of the Dear Leader. Kim's coming-out to the rest of the world included, in October 2000, an unprecedented visit to North Korea by an American delegation led by Secretary of State Albright. This was in the waning days of the Clinton administration, before the 1994 nuclear agreement fell apart, and Albright wanted to sound out Kim on a plan for ending his missile-production program; Kim, in return, wanted Clinton to visit Pyongyang.
The Americans were in for some surprises.
The North Koreans had promised that Albright would see Kim, but when she arrived in Pyongyang, her schedule did not include a meeting with him. Her delegation was whisked into the city in the early morning, to the guest house where they would stay, and shortly afterward they were taken on a tour that many foreign visitors go through in Pyongyang, highlighted -- that may not be the right word -- by a visit to the tomb of Kim Il Sung.
At lunch, Albright was abruptly told she would meet Kim in the afternoon. The delegation was driven to his guest house, and as Albright stood in front of a huge mural depicting a storm at sea, Kim walked in, greeting her with both hands extended forward. They were about the same height, Albright in her heels and Kim in his platform shoes. 
He poured on the charm. Kim asked Albright if she had seen any recent films, and when she replied "Gladiator," Kim said he had seen "Amistad," which he described as "very sad." He proudly told Wendy Sherman, who was in Pyongyang as special adviser to Clinton on North Korea: "I own all the Academy Award movies. I've watched them all."
Smart as he is, Kim lives in a different world and doesn't always realize it. One evening, the Albright delegation was shepherded into a stadium in Pyongyang, where they were seated next to Kim. For the next two hours the Americans were treated to a "mass game" -- a fantasia of synchronized gymnastics on the stadium floor and card-turning displays on the opposite side of the stadium. The exactitude of these "games" is terrifying. They are often staged on important national occasions; dignitaries from friendly countries were invited to a particularly spectacular display to mark Kim Jong Il's birthday last year. I attended a mass game display in Pyongyang in 1989, and the sensation a Westerner feels is not artistic appreciation but totalitarian horror.
One card montage performed for Albright showed a North Korean missile being launched into the sky. It was an odd display for Americans who were negotiating a cessation of missile production and research. But Kim, ever the showman, turned to Albright on his right and said, "That was our first missile launch and our last." To make sure his message got through, he turned to Sherman on his left and repeated his statement. The meaning was clear: the missile program can be stopped if you offer us a new relationship. "This was totally orchestrated, the cards and turning to us," Sherman said when I spoke with her at the Washington office of the Albright Group, a consulting firm. "For all I know, that was the purpose of taking us to the stadium."
Albright and Sherman returned to Washington convinced that Kim Jong Il's stated intentions should be put to the test: he should be offered a new relationship with the U.S. government, including a visit by Clinton to North Korea, if he was willing to submit to a verifiable agreement on halting missile research, production, deployment and exports. This was a position that critics would certainly attack as appeasement, but for Albright and Sherman, it was a price worth paying to end the North Korean missile threat.
"I have no illusions about Kim," Sherman said. "He's charming but totally controlling. He is a leader who has left his people with no freedom, no choices, no food, no future. People are executed. There are labor camps. But the decision we have to make is whether to try to deal with him to open the country so that the people of North Korea do have freedom, do have choices, do have food. Do I think it would be preferable to not deal with him? Yes, but the consequences are horrible, so you have to deal with him."
The clock ran out. There wasn't enough time before Clinton left office to negotiate the agreements that would need to be in place before Air Force One could take off for North Korea. The momentum halted with the advent of the Bush administration. But now, with the second round of six-party talks nearing, the Americans are trying to figure out once again whether and how to deal with Kim.
Choe Hak Rae, the former newspaper publisher, remains hopeful. The way he sees it, Kim Jong Il knows his economy has failed and wants to reform it. Signs of change in the north are already evident: some prices have been deregulated, farmers' markets have been established and North Korean officials have been dispatched to foreign countries to learn about business. The bear wants to get out of its cage, Choe says. "The more he is regarded as the worst person of the century, the more he will become a dangerous man," Choe told me. "But if safety and security are guaranteed for himself and North Korea, I don't think he will be a danger."
Wendy Sherman is more cautious, but she and other advocates of engagement say that Kim believes, erroneously, that he can control the tempo and impact of opening up to the rest of the world. It is not clear yet whether her point of view has much traction in the Bush administration, which veers from warlike hostility to occasional murmurs of peaceful coexistence if Kim disarms. 
The notion that a dictator like Kim can be coaxed to reform has no real historical precedent. The most notable totalitarian regimes of the modern era -- the ones developed by Stalin in the Soviet Union and by Mao Zedong in China -- were not reformed by the men who shaped them. Reform of such states requires a degree of repudiation that the authors of failure are loath to tolerate, mostly out of fear for their own survival. In essence, proponents of engagement hope Kim will begin a process that will lead to his downfall. It seems doubtful that he will be sufficiently selfless or stupid to do that.
The disarmament question is even stickier. The administration has waged two pre-emptive wars on countries it deemed to be enemies -- Afghanistan and Iraq. It does not require Kissingerian smarts to calculate that a member of the axis of evil would be death-wish foolish to relinquish the weapons of mass destruction that may be the only thing, by virtue of the horrible implications of their use, that stands in the way of an American attack. The real issue isn't whether Kim is crazy enough to amass a nuclear arsenal but whether he is crazy enough to dispossess himself of his one bargaining chip. 
What is the solution? I decided to seek out a man who knows Kim Jong Il better than anyone else outside North Korea: Hwang Jang Yop. Hwang was the Karl Rove of North Korea for more than three decades, creating the ideology of Juche, or self-sufficiency, that was the bedrock of Kim Il Sung's regime and remains in place today -- though in name only, since North Korea depends on foreign aid for its survival. Working at the center of the regime, Hwang learned what Kim Jong Il wants, what he can do and what he will not do.
On a Saturday morning in August, I went with my interpreter to a private club in Seoul, where I met Cho Gab Je, a prominent conservative journalist who edits a magazine, the Monthly Chosun, that is known for its hard-hitting coverage of North Korea. We got into a sedan and drove to an office building in a suburb of the city; Cho is friendly with Hwang and arranged for me to meet him. I agreed to not provide details of the building or its location, other than to say that the anteroom is guarded by a number of armed security agents and that you must pass through a metal detector before entering Hwang's office. Hwang's caution is understandable: North Korea is believed to have agents in the South who would be eager to silence their homeland's most famous traitor. 
Hwang is 80 and hard of hearing; I sat in an armchair to his immediate left. He is small and thin and was dressed in a dark blue suit and blue tie. He is not particularly warm with visitors or, it would seem, with anybody. Though he lived a privileged life in North Korea -- he had a phone at his home, ample food and a car, and he traveled extensively outside the country -- his defection has brought doom onto his family. His wife is rumored to have committed suicide after his defection, as did his daughter, who is said to have jumped out of a bus that was taking her to a prison camp. It is assumed that his other children and grandchildren are in prison camps, if they are still alive.
He does not talk about his personal life, but he does talk about the Dear Leader.
"If I were to go into details, it would take many days," he said. "As a politician or leader who can work for the development of the state and the happiness of the people, he is an F student, a dropout. But as a dictator he has an excellent ability. He can organize people so that they can't move, can't do anything, and he can keep them under his ideology. As far as I know, the present North Korean dictatorial system is the most precise and thorough in history."
Hwang says that he believes foreign aid has helped Kim by providing the resources he needs to retain the loyalty of his core constituencies -- the military and party elites. Hwang says he does not believe Kim would ever allow foreign aid and investment to benefit the people who need it; Kim has shown no interest in his people's material well-being, and given the choice between regime survival and national prosperity, it's pretty clear which he would prefer. A few years ago, Kim beganletting South Koreans visit the north, and this was seen as a relaxation of the isolation of his information-starved subjects. But the tourists, whose visits provide much-needed hard currency to the regime, are shepherded in quarantinelike conditions that make them virtual prisoners; contact with ordinary North Koreans is nil. Hwang says outsiders are naive to believe that Kim is ready to open up his country.
"South Korea is being fooled, and the Chinese, who should know best," he said. "A considerable number of people are being fooled, including the United States."
Hwang's synopsis of Kim's dictatorship reminded me of a passage from his memoir. He wrote about a 1992 banquet that Kim presided over in Pyongyang; a dance troupe provided lavishly choreographed entertainment.
The performance "was enough to elicit disgust when seen through the eyes of people with healthy minds," Hwang wrote, recalling that he nonetheless applauded vigorously for the entertainers. A professor who was next to him was flummoxed.
"Are you clapping because you really enjoy the performance?" the professor asked.
"It doesn't matter," Hwang replied. "Just clap like mad. It's an order."
Kim's hold on power depends not only on his willingness to impose misery upon his people but also on the willingness of the North Korean elite to accept their privileges and say nothing. Many North Koreans are well aware of the repressed and backward state of their homeland and wish it were otherwise; recent visitors say North Koreans quietly express a desire for greater contact with the outside world. The problem is that none of them are prepared to force or even nudge their wishes upon Kim Jong Il. The Dear Leader understands, as smart tyrants do, that perpetual clapping is generated by terror. That is why he works 20 hours a day to make sure the applause of fear does not stop.
When his regime is brought to an end, as one day it will be, the cause will not be his napping. Kim has had plenty of time, and he has worked hard, to insulate himself from the type of events that have led to the collapse of other tyrannies and dynasties. But the downfall of dictators is unpredictable. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the dissolution of its Eastern European brethren, the easing of Maoist discipline in China -- these happened in ways that were not foreseen. It is very likely, too, that the unimaginable will get Kim Jong Il in the end. 

In Lockstep
 In June 2002, the Japanese photographer Koichiro Otaki was given a rare opportunity to photograph the "mass games," choreographed performances that were held to celebrate the 60th birthday of Kim Jong Il. The games, held in the gigantic May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, involved more than 100,000 participants, mostly students; they took place six days a week for two months. Dancers on the field performed elaborate and precisely coordinated routines, while people in the stands held up intricate sequences of colored cards to create huge mosaiclike images.

The Market Crash of '87 -- Rare but Hardly Unique

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SIXTEEN years ago today, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.6 percent, its worst one-day percentage decline since its creation in 1896. 
 Many investors are now inclined to dismiss the drop as an aberration. But new research has found that one-day price swings as big as the one in 1987 are not extraordinary. While they are rare, their average frequency over long periods is predictable. 
 The authors of this research are Xavier Gabaix, an MIT economics professor; H. Eugene Stanley, a Boston University physics professor; Parameswaran Gopikrishnan, an associate at Goldman Sachs; and Vasiliki Plerou, a post-doctoral fellow in the physics department at Boston University. Reports of their findings have appeared in publications including the scientific journal Nature. A copy of their study is available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=442940.
 The frequency of huge daily gains and losses in the stock market has presented a perennial challenge to historians because these big moves are more frequent than would be expected if the market adhered to what is known as a normal, or Gaussian, distribution. In such a statistical pattern, sometimes also referred to as a bell curve, outliers -- percentage changes that deviate significantly from the average -- are extremely rare. For several years some researchers have suspected that the markets follow another pattern -- a power law distribution, which predicts more outliers than a normal distribution. Power law distributions are widely recognized outside the investment arena. Earthquakes follow them, for example. 
 In their study, the researchers not only confirm that the stock market adheres to a power law distribution but also derive a formula that predicts how often a particular percentage change is likely to occur. They contend that they have captured a universal trait of investment markets. They have tested the formula in global stock and currency markets of varying sizes. Their findings imply that crashes are an inherent feature of markets and that investors are fooling themselves if they believe that another crash of 1987's magnitude will never occur.
 Some people may believe that market changes instituted since 1987 have reduced the probability of another stock market crash. For example, the New York Stock Exchange has instituted circuit breakers that halt trading for several hours whenever the stock market declines by at least 10 percent. The rationale is that a cooling-off period will counteract the herd mentality that leads to mass selling.
 Professor Gabaix and his colleagues are skeptical about circuit breakers. They have found that the stock market's outsized daily price movements are caused by large institutional investors, who generally try to trade their unwanted stocks over several days to minimize the price impact. But sometimes big traders want to sell their entire positions at once, which can spur a market crash. The researchers say that trading curbs postpone the selling but do not prevent it. 
 NOTE that the researchers' findings apply equally to gains and losses. That means that days in which the market rises sharply also occur more often than they would if the market adhered to a normal distribution. Except for investors who are selling short, however, few will be troubled by that possibility.
 While the researchers' formula predicts how often a price move of a given magnitude will occur, it does not forecast when. According to the formula, on average a one-day gain or loss of 22.6 percent occurs once every 75 years. That could mean that another crash of 1987's magnitude will not happen in any of our lifetimes and, while it is not likely, it could also mean that there will be a crash in the next few years.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Spotted: Evidence That Tax Cut Worked

BYLINE:  By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IS it time for the skeptics to admit they were wrong about President Bush's tax cuts?
 To the surprise of many naysayers, economic data from the past several months suggests that the $350 billion tax-cut package may indeed have jolted the economy. 
 Congress approved the tax-cutting bill in late May, and consumer spending jumped at annualized rates of more than 12 percent in July and August. Business investment climbed modestly, and manufacturing activity is picking up as well. 
 Based largely on the unexpected strength in consumer spending, economists believe the economy grew at an annual rate of at least 6 percent in the quarter that ended Sept. 30.
 Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs who was extremely dubious about the Bush tax cuts, now says they played a central role in the new expansion. He estimates that consumers spent as much as three-quarters of the tax relief from the summer, which included reductions in federal withholding taxes and checks of $400 per child that were part of an expanded child tax credit for families.
 "They definitely had a stronger impact on spending than we anticipated," Mr. McKelvey said, referring to the tax cuts.
 The evidence is still circumstantial. There is little empirical information on whether people saved or spent their tax rebates, and it is possible that the summer spending spree stemmed more from low interest rates than lower taxes.
 Indeed, home mortgage rates dropped to their lowest levels of the year in mid-June, mainly because bond investors incorrectly assumed that the Federal Reserve was about to drive rates lower to minimize the risk of a broad-based deflation in prices.
 That drop in mortgage rates sparked another boom in mortgage refinancing, which usually feeds consumer spending because homeowners often take some cash out of the equity in their homes.
 Still, most analysts say the timing and strength of consumer spending cannot be explained without referring to the tax cuts. Mortgage refinancings, for example, take time to process and people often use the cash they extract from their homes for home improvements. What happened in July and August, by contrast, was sharp and sudden.
 Except for their tax cuts, moreover, Americans did not have extra money on their hands. Unemployment was above 6 percent and the economy actually lost 142,000 jobs in July and August, and gained 57,000 in September. With the labor market weak, hourly wages and salaries showed almost no improvement.
 That leaves tax cuts, which increased disposable income and, through the $400-per-child checks, put a tangible amount of money straight into people's pockets.
 What has surprised the skeptics is that people may have spent so much.
 Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan, said his surveys and other polls suggest that people spent only about a third of their tax relief after the 2001 tax cuts and wanted to save the rest, and this year's response appears to be similar. "The preliminary evidence suggests that the marginal propensity to consume is about the same this time," he said.
 Part of the discrepancy may simply be the difference between what people think they should do with their extra cash and what they actually do with it. It may also be the case that much of the upfront tax relief, the $400 checks, was concentrated on households that are most likely to be in urgent need of extra cash.
 WHATEVER the explanation, the question is whether strong economic growth can be sustained.
 The impact of the tax cuts is already fading, most economists believe. Even though the lower tax rates will continue, the economic jolt comes from the initial cut. After that, the economy simply grows in line with the overall rise in wealth.
 There are already signs that the kick from this year's tax cuts may be fading. The Commerce Department reported last week that retail sales in September were 0.2 percent lower than in August. Excluding automobiles, retail sales climbed 0.3 percent. That is still growth, but less than one-third the pace in July and August.
 Even optimistic forecasters predict that economic growth will slow in the months ahead. For President Bush, who is being pilloried by Democrats for an unemployment rate that remains above 6 percent, the question is whether business spending will pick up even if consumers feel winded.
 If businesses fail to take up the slack through spending and hiring, the mood among voters could easily be quite sour by next fall.

A Bright Economy? Only the Voters Know for Sure

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LUCKY is the president who gets his recession out of the way early. Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan presided over sharp economic downturns in their first terms, but could point to a year or two of declines in unemployment by the time they faced the voters again. Both coasted to re-election. Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H. W. Bush in 1992 were saddled with jobless rates that peaked only months before Election Day, and were tossed out of the White House, even though, in Mr. Bush's case, the overall economy was recovering nicely.
 For the current President Bush, a keen student of what happened to his father, the prospects for re-election may rest to a substantial degree on whether the economic woes of his first three years in office give way fairly quickly to a palpable sense that prosperity has returned, or soon will. 
 After a recession, a long period of sluggishness and growing concern about swelling budget and trade deficits, the economy is now getting back into high gear, a little more than a year before Election Day. Just last week, consumer confidence ticked up, new claims for unemployment insurance edged down, housing construction surged and industrial production increased. Stock prices hovered near 16-month highs. Analysts increased their estimates of economic growth over the summer and for the last three months of the year.
Statistics are one thing; voter perception is another. That perception is shaped more than anything by jobs, or the lack thereof. Defying traditional patterns, this recovery has yet to generate sustained improvement in employment, after two and a half years of steady losses -- 2.8 million jobs, as the Democrats point out at every opportunity, the worst record since Herbert Hoover. Among members of both parties, there is a strong sense that Mr. Bush's political fortunes could turn largely on whether the labor market finally begins showing marked gains over the next nine to 12 months, a question on which economists remain divided.
There are positive signs. The economy added 57,000 jobs in September, the first gain after nine months of losses. The unemployment rate has slowly declined from a peak of 6.4 percent in June, and while the current level of 6.1 percent is two percentage points above where it was when Mr. Bush took office, it is still relatively low by the standards of the 1970's and 80's.
"If jobs are coming back at a healthy clip, the president will be in relatively good shape," said Robert B. Reich, the labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. "But if job growth is anemic, he's in trouble."
If job gains don't continue, Mr. Bush could be stuck. By pushing three tax cuts through Congress in three years, he has already taken his best shot at stimulating job creation, and the deficit will make it hard for him to push through further reductions. 
Given how little he can affect employment between now and Election Day, Mr. Bush finds himself among those presidents who have been faced with the challenge of putting the best face on the economy without appearing detached from the angst and, in some cases, the suffering it has generated among workers. 
Some White Houses in the past have succumbed to the temptation to make unrealistically optimistic forecasts, as the Reagan administration did early in its first term. Others have allowed the opposing party to define the economy in simple, negative terms, as Mr. Bush's father allowed Mr. Clinton to do in 1992.
The Bush administration is determined not to fall into those traps. Almost every day, the president says progress is being made but that he will not be satisfied until every American who wants a job can get one. "You have to be realistic about present circumstances," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the first Bush administration. "You also ought to be optimistic about the future, about our strong economic system and its ability to adapt. And you've got to talk about what you've done to make things better. President Bush has done a pretty good job of that."
Assuming the economy remains in a gray area between strong employment growth and a renewed downturn, Mr. Bush's advisers say he intends to stick with the message he has been trying out on the stump for the last few months: by cutting taxes he took decisive action, in the face of an array of negative forces beyond his control, to counter a downturn that was getting under way before he even took office.
"Job growth is an issue, but there are two things President Bush will benefit from," said Representative Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican. "People have a more sophisticated understanding of the economy, and don't expect miracles from fiscal policy or monetary policy from here in Washington. Second, there's a realization that he has pushed hard to do something about it."
Mr. Bush's aides are confident the economy will break their way. If not, the results of the 2002 midterm elections, when Republicans picked up seats despite the weak economy, suggest that the political pain inflicted on Mr. Bush might not be as dire as that suffered by his father. But Republicans aren't taking any chances.
"It's still jobs, jobs, jobs," Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania wrote this month to his Republican colleagues in the Senate. Setting out the party's communications strategy, Mr. Santorum wrote: "We must talk about our commitment to create and protect jobs. Every one of us needs to drive the message that 57,000 new jobs were created last month as a result of the tax cuts we passed to stimulate the economy."
Intent on taking -- or at least being seen to take -- further action, Mr. Bush has repackaged his existing domestic proposals, many of which are stalled on Capitol Hill, as efforts to create jobs. At nearly every public appearance, he suggests that encouraging more oil and gas drilling in the United States, limiting lawsuit awards and providing tax incentives to businesses for providing health insurance will help spur more employment. 
None of those ideas, if enacted, would be likely to bring quick results, if they helped at all. But in this case, perception may be the thing that matters most.

HEADLINE: Canadian Envisions New Role For Nation 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Poised to take the reins of power as prime minister as early as January, former Finance Minister Paul Martin is beginning to articulate a bold foreign policy vision for Canada. He is outlining efforts to reduce American and European trade barriers, combat money laundering that finances international terrorism and pump up the Canadian military. 
 "Canada is now in the position to take on the world and win," he told guests at a Liberal Party fund-raising dinner this week in Edmonton, Alberta. "In the decade ahead I believe we Canadians will make history." 
 Mr. Martin's rhetoric is more lofty than detailed, but it suggests that he will not be satisfied to watch Canada wane in influence on the world stage as it has for the last 20 years. He is calling for more military spending, and he says Canada must lead in building multilateral institutions that can deal with international terrorism, future financial shocks and infectious diseases like SARS and West Nile virus that have been costly to Canada. 
"This is going to call for a very different perspective on the world, one we have not seen before and I believe that Canada can be the catalyst, because we have one of the most open economies in the world and one of the most diverse populations in the world," he said in a wide-ranging interview this week. "We can bridge the differences between the most powerful economies and the least powerful economies." 
In recent years, Prime Minister Jean Chretien has taken a leading role in increasing Western aid to Africa, banning land mines and establishing an international court of justice. But, Mr. Martin said, "you ain't seen nothing yet." 
He wants to improve the tone of the often strained relations with the United States even while disagreeing with the Bush administration on difficult trade issues and decriminalizing marijuana use in Canada. 
As soon as he takes over the government from Mr. Chretien early next year, he said, he will move to take an active role in pushing a hemispheric free-trade zone. 
"Agriculture is going to be on the table," he said between meetings with cattlemen and high-tech businessmen around the western province of Alberta. "I think the massive agricultural subsidies of the United States are totally distorting markets throughout the world." 
He added, "Between the American agricultural subsidies and the European agricultural subsidies we are not only making it impossible for poor countries to rise out of poverty, but they are totally distorting the entire trade structure." 
At 65, Mr. Martin is gliding toward an easy victory at a Liberal Party convention next month, having won 90 percent of the delegates. Mr. Chretien has said he will retire in February, but party leaders want him to step down sooner. Either way, national elections are expected in the spring. 
Canada's two conservative opposition parties announced this week that they would combine to contest the elections, but recent polls and provincial elections in Quebec and Ontario suggest that the Liberal Party should win an overwhelming victory against them under Mr. Martin's leadership. Mr. Martin has a conflictive relationship with Mr. Chretien, which oddly has helped buffer him from criticisms of the government and should help him make a fresh start with the United States after much verbal jousting over the Iraq war. 
"It's a political jujitsu," said David Taras, a University of Calgary political scientist. "He has managed to position himself as the opposition to the government even though he was the finance minister of this government."
Mr. Martin has been traveling across the country visiting areas that have been recently afflicted by stormy weather, forest fires and mad cow disease. He is trying to project himself as a leader who listens, and who will make Ottawa more accountable to Canadians in the western provinces who often feel that their interests take a back seat to those of Ontario and Quebec. 
His campaign is thoroughly orchestrated, and his advisers keep his contacts with the media at a minimum and in controlled settings to minimize the possibility of a gaffe. 
But in an interview on Thursday, Mr. Martin spoke freely of where he is likely to challenge the Bush administration in the coming months. He said Canada was right to oppose the invasion of Iraq, and he made it clear there would continue to be differences. 
"There is a free trade agreement between the two countries and I think the spirit of that trade agreement ought to be honored," said Mr. Martin, who represents a district in Montreal in the House of Commons. "And it is not honored when on things like softwood lumber you end up with constant, constant harassment." 
He said he fundamentally supported a bill proposed by the Chretien government to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana, despite strong opposition from Bush administration officials. But he favors amending the legislation to stiffen fines and do more to prosecute marijuana growers. 
"A young person who is caught with a very, very small amount shouldn't be crippled for the rest of their lives," he said. "That is not legalization. That simply says don't give them a criminal record just a stiff fine, stiffer than is in this bill."

Companies Get Few Days To Offer Bids On Iraq Work

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Hoping to speed up reconstruction work in Iraq, American officials in Baghdad are offering contracts totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, but giving companies as little as three days to submit competing bids.
 Procurement experts said the extremely short deadlines were legal, but some warned that they could stifle open competition, favor well-connected contractors at the expense of outsiders and lead to higher costs. 
 "Three days is absurd," said Steven Schooner, a professor of procurement policy at George Washington University's law school. "You can objectively conclude that in the United States we don't do this. It's highly unusual." 
Two weeks ago, the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq gave companies three days to bid on a contract to supply the Iraqi government as many as 850 personal computers as well as telephones, fax machines and other office equipment. 
A week before that, occupation officials gave contractors seven days to offer a price for up to 14 million boxes of ammunition for Russian-made AK-47 automatic rifles, which are widely used by the Iraqi police and security forces.
Scores of other jobs have been awarded or offered with similarly short bidding periods. They include contracts to provide private security guards, repair buildings, supply heavy electrical equipment and even to destroy gigantic sculptures of Saddam Hussein.
Occupation officials say they have made the process more open. They now post contracting opportunities on the occupation authority's Web site, along with a standard list of rules and conditions for bidding and carrying out work.
But they also say that speed is a top priority, and they make no apologies for giving companies a very short time to respond. "We're here to support the customer, and he has an urgent need," said Col. Anthony Bell, a spokesman for the occupation on contracting issues, explaining the rationale for the rapid granting of contracts. "All that we're doing is reacting to the urgent requirement that he has provided us." 
The current rush of contracts is being financed out of the new Development Fund of Iraq, which holds money received from Iraqi oil exports. Since the fund's inception in mid-July, coalition officials say they have awarded 143 projects worth more than $200 million.
But that is just the beginning. The Bush administration predicts that Iraqi oil revenues will reach $12 billion next year, and President Bush is pressing Congress to approve nearly $20 billion in American money for civilian work in Iraq next year.
Until now, most of the contracts for Iraqi reconstruction have been awarded by the United States Agency for International Development, A.I.D. But administration officials have been openly frustrated by the lack of progress and want to concentrate power at the occupation authority, headed by L. Paul Bremer III.
Mr. Bremer, in an apparent attempt to tighten control over contracting, is creating his own new office to coordinate procurement, headed by a retired admiral, David Nash.
Many contractors, including Iraqi companies, complain that the process for winning business remains opaque and inaccessible.
"These things are coming out with zero notice, and you get no feedback," said Frances Cook, a procurement expert in Washington who is advising several Iraqi companies. "People out there trying to get contracts are going nuts."
Lawmakers from both parties have complained that the procurement process has been too opaque and too favorable to well-connected companies.
"If we are going to have credibility with the American people, then they need to know that American companies and American workers will have a fair shot at securing contracts," said Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona and a key member of the House Appropriations Committee.
A.I.D., which managed most of the initial contracts for Iraqi reconstruction, remains a small agency that has only four contracting officers of its own on the ground in Baghdad.
To handle the supervision, A.I.D. is farming out most of the oversight. It is paying the Army Corps of Engineers $10 million to monitor Bechtel Corporation's $680 million contract. It has also hired a private company, Management Sciences Inc., to evaluate smaller contracts in social and economic development.
In one hint of the stress at the agency, A.I.D.'s inspector general sharply criticized it for a $168 million contract given to Research Triangle Institute of North Carolina. 
The contract, for work in building local government institutions, called for hiring about 265 professional advisers from outside Iraq. But the inspector general said the size of the contract had been set "to justify the available funding" rather than on an assessment of actual needs.
Under the current structure, American companies have a clear advantage, because A.I.D. is required to award contracts to American companies. But most of the money actually flows to subcontractors, and administration officials are pushing hard to make sure that Iraqi companies and workers get as much work as possible. 
Bechtel executives say they have handed out 102 of 140 subcontracts to Iraqi companies and thus employ about 40,000 Iraqi workers indirectly.

An article last Sunday about the process of awarding contracts for reconstruction in Iraq misstated part of the name of a company hired by the United States Agency for International Development to evaluate a number of contracts. It is Management Systems International, not Management Science.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S POPULARITY WITH OLDER VOTERS IS SEEN AS SLIPPING 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
President Bush's support among older voters has dropped substantially in recent months, eroding recent Republican gains and highlighting the importance of this critical electoral bloc in 2004, political strategists and analysts say.
 The trend underscores the stakes for Mr. Bush in the current Congressional negotiations aimed at creating a long-promised prescription drug benefit in Medicare, which covers 40 million elderly and disabled Americans. Negotiators passed a self-imposed deadline on Friday for reaching agreement, but vowed to complete their work before Congress adjourns, which is expected to be sometime next month. 
 Mr. Bush's popularity has declined over all since early summer, but some recent polls suggest that he lost significantly more ground among voters 65 and older than he did among younger Americans. Politicians in both parties consider older voters to be particularly important because they are much more likely to vote than younger people, and because they are heavily concentrated in states that are often presidential battlegrounds, like Florida and Pennsylvania.
Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, a longtime Republican campaign strategist, said, "It's still a very fluid vote that can swing on a dime." 
A poll conducted this month by The New York Times and CBS News showed that Mr. Bush had a 41 percent approval rating among the 65-and-older voters, his lowest among any age group. That was down from 44 percent in July and 63 percent in May.
Similar trends have been reported this fall by the Pew Research Center. The latest Gallup Poll, released this week, showed that even as Mr. Bush's overall approval rating had risen to 56 percent from 50 percent during the past month, voters older than 65 remained his weakest age group. Forty-nine percent of them approved of the job he was doing, compared with 60 percent of those 30 to 49.
Analysts in both parties cite the economy, the stock market and the situation in Iraq as major factors in the slippage, along with more traditional concerns for older Americans like Medicare and the cost of prescription drugs.
Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said: "With low interest rates and a sluggish economy, they're the group that's probably harmed the most. They're not getting the rate of return they would have expected with the savings they have." 
Mr. Matsui added that while low inflation is generally an advantage for those living on fixed incomes, "health care costs have gone up unabated, and that's the area they're most concerned about."
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that despite recent improvements in the stock market, which is closely followed by retirees, "there's a lot of ground to make up." That could be hurting Mr. Bush's standing among some older males, or contributing to what Mr. Goeas described as "grumpy old men."
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who works with Mr. Goeas on a bipartisan survey known as the Battleground Poll, said that the aftermath of the war in Iraq, including the cost of reconstruction, also helped explain the erosion of Mr. Bush's support among older voters. "Seniors had really moved toward Bush on the security issue during the war, and now they're moving back," she said. "They hate spending the $87 billion over in Iraq."
Ms. Lake added that "this is one group that doesn't like deficits, because they feel they jeopardize Social Security and Medicare.'
Democrats, who pride themselves on their advocacy of Social Security and Medicare, have long relied on the votes of older Americans. Butthat bloc has been increasingly up for grabs in recent years, in part because of the passing of the heavily Democratic generation that came of age with the New Deal, but also, strategists say, because Republicans have grown far more adept at cultivating older Americans.
In 2000, Mr. Bush lost the 60-and-older vote to Vice President Al Gore 51 to 47 percent, but Republicans carried it in last year's Congressional elections, as well as the Congressional elections of 1998, 1996 and 1994. The Republican victory margin was particularly wide in 1998, when President Bill Clinton was in the throes of the impeachment struggle; the margin was widely attributed to older voters' concerns over Mr. Clinton's values.
Mindful of the importance of this group, many Republicans consider it a top priority to deliver a Medicare drug benefit before next year's election. This could be, many Republican strategists have argued, a transformational event in American politics -- a Republican president and a Republican Congress producing the biggest expansion of Medicare, a signature Democratic program, since the program's creation.
But the effort to produce a popular benefit with $400 billion over 10 years has not been easy; the bills that emerged from the House and Senate fall far short of what many working people typically receive, with large co-payments and gaps in coverage. Many older Americans have also voiced concerns to their lawmakers that they could end up losing coverage they already get from their former employers, which is sometimes better than what the government would provide.
Jack Banister, a retiree in Hanover, Ind., and a strong supporter of Mr. Bush, who was interviewed for the recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, said: "I'd sure like them to leave the prescription drug thing alone. A lot of us have worked all our lives to prepare ourselves for retirement and put in position our drug care system. And the federal government coming in is likely to screw that all up."
Edward F. Coyle, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group aligned with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contended that "the more seniors know about the prescription drug benefit, the more they don't like it."
But Charles W. Jarvis, chairman of the United Seniors Association, a conservative group often aligned with the drug industry, said, "Seniors want personal health choices and tangible policy results, not endless policy critiques and unaffordable pie-in-the sky proposals." He said that Mr. Bush's popularity might be "leveling," but that it remained "extremely strong" because "he's maintained an aggressive role on these domestic issues."
Still, a new poll for Emily's List, a Democratic fund-raising group, identifies older voters as a prime area of vulnerability for Mr. Bush, asserting that many are driven by deep concerns about Social Security and the cost of health care. Geoff Garin, the pollster who conducted the survey, said that Mr. Bush's push for private accounts in Social Security would only exacerbate his problems by 2004.
Mr. Davis, the Republican Congressional strategist, countered, "It's way too early to figure out what will happen, except that they will continue to be a critical vote."

Two Groups Chart the Island's Economic Future

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
TWO organizations that between them represent most of Long Island's leading business executives, academics and scientists have released separate reports that seek to shape regional economic growth well into the first quarter of the century, positioning Long Island to benefit from increasing government spending on defense and security.
 The organizations -- the Long Island Association and a business and academic consortium led by the State University at Stony Brook -- worked separately on compiling their recommendations. The association's recommendations were the more far-reaching, extending into such areas as housing, transportation and work-force development, while the Stony Brook plan focused on specific technologies -- wireless telecommunications, for instance -- and on forging partnerships with investors. 
 There was some overlap. Both reports endorsed designating Long Island as a federal homeland security center, maintaining or expanding financing for research centers and encouraging more collaboration between businesses, schools and research institutions. 
 The Long Island Association, the region's largest business group, formulated its list of nearly 80 goals on Oct. 9, during a day of member caucuses at the State College at Farmingdale. Members, working from a template supplied by the association, recommended easing permit restrictions on power-plant construction, expanding local government purchasing quotas for businesses owned by women and minorities, and creating an emergency evacuation plan for the Island. They also called for development of publicly financed housing in downtown areas and for expanded mass transit.
 The results were publicly presented the next day at the association's monthly membership luncheon at the Uniondale Marriott attended by about 600 people.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the guest speaker, endorsed the group's goals. "There is tremendous opportunity for economic gain," Senator Clinton said, describing increased federal defense and anti-terrorism spending. "I've read your recommendations. They're very impressive and very sensible. They're exactly the way to go about it."
 Matthew T. Crosson, the association's president, said that support from politicians like Senator Clinton was necessary for the organization's goals to be realized. The association, which has historically emphasized political lobbying as the primary means of economic development, is shifting to a more grass-roots strategy, encouraging members to communicate directly to legislators and other politicians. 
 "It's a different way of doing business," Mr. Crosson said. "This is advocacy by numbers. If members want to pursue their recommendations, we'll pay for transportation for them to go up to Albany and see Joe Bruno and Shelly Silver," a reference to Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker. 
 Many of the association's recommendations involved government initiatives, public financing or tax relief. Proposals in this category included reformulating state school reimbursement rates, pegging them to regional cost of living differentials; financing for more local economic development programs; and enacting federal legislation to make government procurement accessible to small businesses.
 Michael DeLuise, an L.I.A. member who is a vice president at Dowling College and the chairman of the Long Island Convention & Visitors Bureau, said he thought the association's effort to widen member participation was successful.
 During the day when goals were formulated, "we had people participating with various degrees of experience in the industry," Mr. DeLuise said. On the education committee, he said, he deliberated alongside a college president and a retired classroom teacher.
 "Everybody was listened to," Mr. DeLuise said. "Anybody who wanted to be involved could get involved. There was really an open door."
 The Stony Brook group, called the Long Island Technology Agenda 2020, was headed by Yacov Shamash, the dean of the university's engineering and business schools. The region's major research centers -- Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System -- participated, along with representatives from the Long Island Life Sciences Initiative, the Long Island Software and Technology Network, the Long Island Forum for Technology, the Hauppauge Industrial Association and about 50 high-tech business executives, Dean Shamash said.
 The group was formed at the behest of the Nassau and Suffolk county executives after a regional economic summit was canceled last winter because of snow. 
 "Obviously we want to grow technology on Long Island, because it provides outstanding, high-paying jobs," Dean Shamash said. "We want to maintain our cutting edge. If this plan is implemented, it will keep us at the cutting edge."
 The Stony Brook report emphasized the potential economic benefits of creating and expanding research centers in areas like biotechnology, nanotechnology, sensors, software and wireless telecommunications and extending the research benefits to local manufacturing companies.
 The report called the current defense buildup and rising security spending "a timely opportunity," and drew parallels to the economic benefits that accrued to earlier generations when spending grew sharply -- in World War II and the cold and for space exploration. 
 "New opportunities should be vigorously pursued," the report said. "For example, a bicounty homeland security initiative" linked to New York City. This would "create both a secure region and opportunities for research development and economic growth within our region's universities and small businesses," it continued. 
 The report also pointed to anti-terrorism spending in fields like security and biohazard containment as growth potential areas. It also called for easing the permit process when constructing commercial buildings for biotechnology enterprises and recommended the establishment of a venture-capital forum specializing in biotech investment opportunities.
 Participants referred to the report as a "technology road map," and it made the case that businesses should be involved at every step. "The road map is about moving forward in an integrated way to create a more robust technology community," said Ken Morelly, the president of the Long Island Forum for Technology. Anyone looking for new ideas from either group will be disappointed, said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "There really was nothing new there," he said, adding that the L.I.A. proposals "repeat what the regional planning board has been advocating since the 1960's, and what the L.I.A. itself has said many, many times over the years."
 Dr. Koppelman, who participated in the Stony Brook deliberations, nevertheless complimented both groups for highlighting regional needs and for encouraging cooperation among disparate groups. 
 "The real significance is they're keeping the pot boiling," he said, "reminding people of the problems and keeping the focus on Long Island problems."

The Democrats' Fairy Godmother

BYLINE:  By ROBIN STEIN

 BODY:
TWENTY-EIGHT stories above Central Park South, Manhattan looks like a vast sweep of green fringed by jagged piles of skyscrapers. Inside the sunken living room, an appointed tray of teas and pastries waits.
 Agnes Varis offers coffee and a slice of baklava, explaining that the housekeeper is on vacation, and scurries excitedly to her favorite conversation piece, a fringed throw pillow, embroidered with the words, "Behind every great woman is herself." 
 "Hillary loved it," Ms. Varis says with a delighted chuckle, prompted more by her decorating find than the former first lady's visit. The occasion, she explained, was an intimate fund raiser she held in her penthouse apartment for a group of pharmaceutical executives during Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign. 
 Any evening that involves prescription drugs and Democrats - and especially a Clinton -- is going to be particularly memorable for Ms. Varis, the 73-year-old founder and president of Agvar Chemicals and Aegis Pharmaceuticals, suppliers of generic drugs and materials, in Little Falls.
 Round-featured with a lively tuft of brown curls, Ms. Varis seems more like a quirky great aunt than a political powerhouse. Everyone is addressed as "dear" and her cats, Kallee and Zeus, are among her favorite topics of conversation. But the little-known New Jersey businesswoman has quietly evolved into one of the nation's leading Democratic supporters. 
 "She's the greatest," Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, said in an interview. "She's like a Greek Jewish grandmother -- if I have a cold, she asks me about it 10 times."
 Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign financing, show that in the 2002 election cycle alone, Ms. Varis and her company made nearly a million dollars in political contributions -- 99 percent to Democrats. Even corporate giants like Merck and Dow were outspent by Agvar, a private company with a full-time staff of 12.
 The access she has gained to high-powered Democrats often helps Ms. Varis to promote the causes she advocates - whether it is support services for battered women of Bergen County, children's programs at Lincoln Center, or medicine for service workers who lost their jobs in the terrorism attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 -- and especially her fight to reform prescription drug policy.
 This one-woman lobby says she is committed to making medicine more affordable for Americans. Her battle to expand supplies of lower-priced generic drugs often pits her against the brand-name industry, which has spent $650 million and hired nearly 700 Washington lobbyists for its notoriously powerful political campaign. Ms. Varis is unarguably outgunned, but she is uncompromising -- and effective.
 Even coming from New Jersey, the brand-name drug epicenter, where the industry employs nearly 70,000 people, Ms. Varis said lawmakers have been "incredibly fair."
 "They call me and say, 'Agnes, there is pressure to pass this. Is this going to hurt?"' 
 This summer, despite intense opposition from the brand-name industry, Congress passed a generic drug bill, co-sponsored by Senator Schumer, who said Ms. Varis played an essential role in helping him and his staff draft the legislation, which is now pending in a Congressional conference as part of the Medicare package. 
 "Without her," he said, "I can unequivocally say there wouldn't be a generic drug bill."
 Her fierce political loyalties, tell-it-like-it-is style and willingness to put big money where her mouth is has earned Ms. Varis influence and respect, though sometimes it forces her to break with allies. And her roles as a drug executive, a Democrat and a gadfly are not always easy to reconcile.
 With a slight chuckle, Ms. Varis explained her penchant for controversy. "I'm a Greek American," she said, "So I gesticulate a lot." 
 "Put 10 Democrats in a room, and you end up with 15 political parties," added Ms. Varis, a lifelong Democrat. "That's why it's fun."
 Ms. Varis is often in rooms filled with leading Democrats -- like Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, or Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont or Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York. 
 When Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey got a new aide, Ms. Varis promptly got a call of introduction. 
 "She is one of my favorite people," said Senator Corzine, who rejected the idea that their friendship stemmed from her contributions.
 As he put it, "My acquaintance was struck because of my involvement in politics," but Ms. Varis stands apart from the "people involvedin political giving that you have a fairly business-like relationship with," he said. "She is very interesting and enjoyable to be with." 
 Even in times of scandal, Ms. Varis remains loyal to her party. She admitted being angry about Bill Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky, though she remains charmed by his charisma and commitment to social causes. 
 When Mrs. Clinton's health care initiative provoked an angry backlash, Ms. Varis gave 200 signed copies of her book, "It Takes a Village," to drug industry executives as a party favor. And amid the ethics questions, plummeting poll numbers and censorship by Senate peers that ultimately led Robert G. Torricelli to drop his re-election bid last year, Ms. Varis remains a stalwart supporter. 
 "Bob is so honest, I couldn't give him a $10 Bic pen," she said.
 At the same time, Ms. Varis voted for Ralph Nader for president in 2000, a candidacy that may well have cost Al Gore the presidency. 
 "Of course I live in New York, so I can afford to be a big shot," she said, explaining that Mr. Gore's sure win in the state was only one reason for her defection. "But I'm not happy about the Democrats right now. Who is? They are becoming mild Republicans, wannabes." 
 Even now - as she grumbles about the Bush administration and the new laws that require her to ration contributions to Democratic candidates -- she has a mouthful of tough love. 
 For instance, she complained that the Democratic Leadership Council -- which helped catapult Mr. Clinton, a former chairman, onto the national stage -- treats progressives like "dinosaurs" and regards the party's traditional mishmash of constituencies as a politically lethal disease. "People in Peoria have different interests and values than me, sure," she said. "But since when did we all have to be the same?"
 "Most Democrats have big mouths and small wallets." Ms. Varis said, explaining why she gives so much money to Democratic candidates.
 Despite millions of dollars in political spending and vocal lobbying, Ms. Varis is not widely known.
 It is not that Ms. Varis has demanded anonymity in exchange for her contributions -- her name graces a New York election institute that trains Democratic women to run for public office as well as an endowed professorship and a lecture hall at Tufts University. Nearly a thousand unemployed service workers who lost their health insurance in the aftermath of Sept. 11 have "Agvar Generic Drug Plan" cards in their wallets -- good for a year of free generic drug prescriptions at any Duane Reade pharmacy in New York City. 
 But Ms. Varis does not view her political giving as worthy of public notice.
 Last month, when she was the host of a benefit for the New York state Democratic committee, the guest list for the $5,000-a-plate dinner at Alain Ducasse included Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, yet she was stunned by calls from reporters. 
 "Why would you want my picture? I am not a celebrity; I am a hard-working businesswoman," she said. 
 With that, she paused and smiled. Bill Clinton's 50th birthday party at Radio City Music Hall was one she did not want to miss, she admitted. For that one, Ms. Varis and husband, Karl Leichtman, turned out, accompanied by the entire Agvar staff and Chrisetta Campbell, her housekeeper of almost 30 years. 
 To be sure, Ms. Varis works as hard as she plays. Every morning, she is up by 5, and has read The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal before a car arrives to take her to Little Falls.
 After nearly 50 years in New Jersey's pharmaceutical industry, Ms. Varis has no plans to retire. "My housekeeper says if I stopped, I'd die," she said.
 Hard work has been a lifelong habit. She and her husband, who owned a printing business before he retired, now live in a 5,000-square-foot duplex apartment in Manhattan. It is a world away from the two-family home in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn where Ms. Varis grew up, and even the townhouse in Englewood where they lived for 11 years. The youngest of eight children raised by Greek immigrants -- a garment worker and ice cream peddler -- Ms. Varis was the first in the family to attend college.
 In 1950, Ms. Varis graduated from Brooklyn College with a bachelor of arts in chemistry and English. Determined to avoid typing pools, she took a temporary position as a chemist at Fine Organics, a manufacturer in Lodi. Twenty years later she was still there, by then executive vice president and general manager of a plant with 300 employees.
 Ms. Varis was political as well as ambitious, founding "New Jersey Business Executives against the Vietnam War."
 "You should have seen my bosses face when he found out," she said. 
 In 1970, a major chemical company was negotiating to buy Fine Organics, hoping that Ms. Varis would stay on. But fearful that she would be plucked for her knowledge and then demoted, she rejected the promise of a lucrative contract. 
 Instead, at age 40, Ms. Varis, started Agvar Chemicals. 
 Years on the factory floor gave Ms. Varis an encyclopedic knowledge of day-to-day operations and the ability to anticipate the implications of coming federal rules for drug companies that were increasingly relying on offshore manufacturers. Agvar opened as a one-woman, "one-stop agent" for foreign-based manufacturers -- linking them to domestic generic companies, and ensuring that every aspect of production and supply complied with complex protocols established by the Food and Drug Administration. 
 Agvar's first contract, as she tells it, was a "bonanza." Ms. Varis helped a French company introduce a primitive version of Viagra, the sexual aid, which flew off the shelves for years until the government stopped reimbursing people for its use. 
 In the meantime, Ms. Varis had bought her first Mercedes-Benz.
 Next to the soft-focus photograph of a sick toddler tethered to an intravenous drip, a caption reads, "Pray for a Miracle because generic drugs will never cure him."
 When Ms. Varis saw the ad -- paid for by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the biggest association of brand-name drug companies -- she was furious. "It was obscene," she said. "How can you use children this way?"
 In the past three years Ms. Varis has run more than two dozen ads in such Washington publications as Roll Call and The Hill with fiery headlines like, "YOUR SILENCE IS DEAFENING!" and, "NO MORE HANKY PANKY!"
 A particularly accusatory series ran in 2001, when Bristol-Myers Squibb tried to extend its patent on a diabetes drug called Glucophage. In response, her ads began: "Have you no shame?" One railed: "Why don't you admit it? Your actions aren't about the safety of our children, they're all about big money. It's all about $2 million a day to feed your insatiable appetite for undeserved, unearned monopoly profits."
 Unlike several competitors, Agvar was not in the market to produce the generic version of Glucophage when Bristol's patent expired. And business colleagues warned that her tone might alienate politicians and brand-name firms, which are often clients of the generic companies.
 In a telephone interview, Jeffrey L. Trewhitt, a spokesman for PhRMA, said he "vaguely recalled" the ads, which he said were "very frustrating" because they "conveniently left out the crucial fact that without the research of the innovator companies, there would be no generic drugs." Bristol Myers declined to comment. 
 Ms. Varis is the first to concede that she is outspoken and does not mind offending people. "I'm an iconoclast," she said. "If I'm going to worry about losing business, I might as well stay home and take care of the cats."
 Yet while she might not be concerned about alienating Bristol Myers, others clearly do mind. Her approach has forced breaks with people who share the same agenda but prefer more measured tactics.
 "Sometimes, it's just me and PhRMA out there," she said. "I am the only one who will do it."
 Ms. Varis played a leading role in bringing together the fragmented generic drug industry to form the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) in 2000, and served as vice president for two years. But last year, in part to avoid pressure to reign in her outspoken partisanship and attack ads, she resigned from the group she helped found.
 But are her kamikaze tactics the act of a stubborn purest or a savvy business mind?
 A longtime colleague, William A. Fletcher, president and chief executive of Teva Pharmaceuticals, the world's biggest generic drug company, said that for Ms. Varis there is no difference. "She is very insistent that what is good for consumers is good for generics," he said. "Agnes is a conscience to many of us."
 As Senator Schumer said, "She is so effective because she is genuine." 
 Yet it is difficult to deny that Agvar would benefit from the "Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceutical Act," which Ms. Varis helped draft. The proposed measure would update the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act, which established rules for the competition between brand name and generic drug companies. If passed, the bill would limit the ability of brand-name companies to extend patents through infringement lawsuits.
 When asked about the conflict of interest, Ms. Varis scowled, reached for her reading glasses and opened a thick loose-leaf binder filled with pharmaceutical sales data.
 "O.K., let's take Lipitor," she began. "I know people who are supposed to take Lipitor every day who take it once a week," she said, pointing to a cell in the dense spreadsheet. Each $3 pill, she says, costs about 10 to 15 cents to manufacture. 
 Opponents of the bill contend that loosening patent protections would deter brand-name companies from making risky investments in expensive research and slow development of new medicines.
 Not surprisingly, Ms. Varis disagrees. "The only way to make drugs affordable," she said, "is to stop brand people from being greedy." 
 Once the patent expires, Ms. Varis estimates generic versions of Lipitor will cost less than $1.50 a pill. In the meantime, she said, it is the people who can not afford Lipitor who suffer, not her business.
 For all of her stubborn rants, Ms. Varis invariably seems to to be able to revert to the chuckling great aunt with the soft heart.
 One Sunday morning last May, she stood in a procession of women in caps and gowns at Tufts University. Ms. Varis had been selected by the trustees to receive an honorary doctorate in public service. As she followed throngs of students toward the ceremony, she realized that her escort was Peter R. Dolan, Tufts alumnus and chief executive of Bristol-Myers. 
 "He was a nice, tall young man, very good looking," she remembered, "very sweet." 
 She shuddered, but not because of her "Have you no shame?"attacks. That morning, news of a federal criminal investigation into Mr. Dolan's accounting practices had appeared in The New York Times.
 "I felt so bad for him," she said. "I didn't say a word. I was just thinking, 'I hope this guy didn't see the paper."'
 When it was their turn to walk down the aisle, she remembered Mr. Dolan turned to her and offered his arm. "Do you mind?" he asked.
 "Can you imagine, "Ms. Varis exclaimed. "A man like that asking me if I minded taking his arm -- I said, 'My God! Absolutely not."'

HEADLINE: Bush Cites Philippines as Model in Rebuilding Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: MANILA, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
President Bush told the Congress of this former American colony on Saturday that Iraq, like the Philippines, could be transformed into a vibrant democracy. He also pledged his help in remaking the troubled and sometimes mutinous Philippine military into a force for fighting terrorism.
 In an eight-hour visit, Mr. Bush for the first time drew explicit comparisons between the transition he is seeking in Iraq and the rough road to democracy that the Philippines traveled from the time the United States seized it from Spain in 1898 to the present day. 
 "Some say the culture of the Middle East will not sustain the institutions of democracy," Mr. Bush said, taking on the critics of his oft-stated goal to use Iraq as a laboratory for spreading democratic institutions in the Middle East. "The same doubts were once expressed about the culture of Asia. Those doubts were proven wrong nearly six decades ago." 
While the administration often speaks of the occupations of Japan and Germany after World War II as rough models for the effort to rebuild Iraq, Mr. Bush used the visit here to make a less explicit analogy to the American administration of the Philippines, which also led to the formation of a democracy. But the comparison has less power to reassure, given that the Philippine government did not gain full autonomy for five decades.
Aides traveling with Mr. Bush made it clear that he was worried about the stability of the Philippines. After meeting with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her cabinet shortly after he landed here, Mr. Bush announced that the two countries had formalized a five-year plan "to modernize and reform" the Philippine military, though his aides said it was unclear how much of the cost the United States would contribute.
"The numbers are still in flux," a senior administration official told reporters, adding that the administration was still looking for roughly $20 million to provide the Philippines with used American military helicopters that Mr. Bush promised a year ago to help root out Abu Sayyaf, the terror and kidnapping group that is strongly suspected of being linked to Al Qaeda. 
The announcement was part of a broad plan to provide help to the Philippine military, which Mr. Bush sees as the best hope of preventing the Philippines from becoming a terrorist haven. But it has been marked by a number of setbacks, especially because of a Philippine constitutional prohibition against allowing foreign troops to engage an enemy on Philippine soil. There was no indication that the ban was the subject of talks between the leaders.
Mr. Bush's brief visit here, on the way to the annual Asian economic summit meeting to be held this year in Bangkok, was clearly intended to bolster President Arroyo. Reversing her previous pledge to step down next year, she said this month that she now planned to run for election in May even while still facing down a divided military. Some junior officers tried to oust her from power three months ago. 
The White House and Philippine officials made much of the fact that Mr. Bush was the first president to address a joint session of the Philippine Congress since Dwight D. Eisenhower came here in 1960, at the very end of his presidency. But in a taste of the anger that Mr. Bush has generated around the world, several thousand protesters filled the streets near the Philippine Congress and forced an hourlong delay in the arrival of the president's motorcade while the Secret Service assessed whether it was safe to move him through the streets. In addition to the protesters, tens of thousands of others simply clogged the streets of this humid capital, including schoolchildren waving flags and eager to catch a glimpse of Mr. Bush's motorcade.
The extraordinary security around Mr. Bush's visit here underscored Washington's continuing concerns about the stability of the Philippines. Mr. Bush flew in with American F-15's off the wings of Air Force One. The Secret Service would not permit Mr. Bush to stay overnight. 
The result was a state visit run at the pace at which Mr. Bush plays high-speed golf, from wreath-laying to meetings to his speech. Mr. Bush, his wife, Laura, and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, attended a state dinner at Malacanang Palace. Mr. Bush used his toast there to salute the Philippines as "the oldest democracy in Asia," and to recall that 17,000 Americans are buried here, having fallen in bitter combat with the Japanese during World War II. 
In a rare departure from his aversion to local garb, Mr. Bush was wearing a cream open-collared barong, the traditional Philippine shirt. It bore a vague resemblance to clothes Mr. Bush prefers at his Texas ranch. After dinner he moved on to Bangkok, where he is scheduled for another more formal state visit on Sunday and a meeting with China's new president, Hu Jintao. 
While Mr. Bush made elliptical references to the Spanish-American War, some of his critics have argued that the justification for invading Iraq bore a resemblance to the rationale the United States used to begin that war in 1898, citing evidence, discounted as flimsy, that the battleship Maine had been deliberately blown up in Cuba by Spanish forces. That began the first war in which the United States seized territory beyond its continental shores, and the first in which other nations accused Washington of imperialist and colonial ambitions.
Now, Mr. Bush faces similar accusations from critics questioning whether Saddam Hussein possessed weapons that posed an urgent threat. He gave no ground today.
Mr. Bush said the United States had "liberated the Philippines from colonial rule," using the same verb he often uses to describe American action in Iraq, but he skipped past Washington's own 48-year-long occupation of this archipelago of 7,000 islands. Even the State Department's own briefing papers about the Philippines, distributed to Mr. Bush's traveling retinue, notes that "U.S. administration of the Philippines was always declared to be temporary and aimed to develop institutions that would permit and encourage the eventual establishment of a free and independent government." That is very close to Mr. Bush's description of his plan for Iraq.
He returned to the subject later in his speech, making comparisons between the American experience here in the first part of the 20th century and in Iraq in the 21st, and arguing that the greatest threat to Philippine democracy now was Abu Sayyaf, which operates in the southernmost islands of the Philippines. 
"Murder has no home in any religious faith," Mr. Bush said, "and these terrorists must find no home in the Philippines." He vowed to "bring Abu Sayyaf to justice," and "to dismantle the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist network" in neighboring Indonesia and nearby areas.
But he also alluded to the troubles with the Philippine military, and its dubious loyalties to the current government. "Members of the Philippine armed forces are commissioned to fight for freedom, not to contend for power," he said to applause.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: PLANNING; 
State Dept. Study Foresaw Trouble Now Plaguing Iraq

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT and JOEL BRINKLEY; Eric Schmitt reported for this article from Washington and Joel Brinkley from Baghdad.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
A yearlong State Department study predicted many of the problems that have plagued the American-led occupation of Iraq, according to internal State Department documents and interviews with administration and Congressional officials.
 Beginning in April 2002, the State Department project assembled more than 200 Iraqi lawyers, engineers, business people and other experts into 17 working groups to study topics ranging from creating a new justice system to reorganizing the military to revamping the economy. 
 Their findings included a much more dire assessment of Iraq's dilapidated electrical and water systems than many Pentagon officials assumed. They warned of a society so brutalized by Saddam Hussein's rule that many Iraqis might react coolly to Americans' notion of quickly rebuilding civil society.
Several officials said that many of the findings in the $5 million study were ignored by Pentagon officials until recently, although the Pentagon said they took the findings into account. The work is now being relied on heavily as occupation forces struggle to impose stability in Iraq. 
The working group studying transitional justice was eerily prescient in forecasting the widespread looting in the aftermath of the fall of Mr. Hussein's government, caused in part by thousands of criminals set free from prison, and it recommended force to prevent the chaos.
"The period immediately after regime change might offer these criminals the opportunity to engage in acts of killing, plunder and looting," the report warned, urging American officials to "organize military patrols by coalition forces in all major cities to prevent lawlessness, especially against vital utilities and key government facilities."
Despite the scope of the project, the military office initially charged with rebuilding Iraq did not learn of it until a major government drill for the postwar mission was held in Washington in late February, less than a month before the conflict began, said Ron Adams, the office's deputy director.
The man overseeing the planning, Tom Warrick, a State Department official, so impressed aides to Jay Garner, a retired Army lieutenant general heading the military's reconstruction office, that they recruited Mr. Warrick to join their team.
George Ward, an aide to General Garner, said the reconstruction office wanted to use Mr. Warrick's knowledge because "we had few experts on Iraq on the staff."
But top Pentagon officials blocked Mr. Warrick's appointment, and much of the project's work was shelved, State Department officials said. Mr. Warrick declined to be interviewed for this article.
The Defense Department, which had the lead role for planning postwar operations and reconstruction in Iraq, denied that it had shunned the State Department planning effort.
"It is flatly wrong to say this work was ignored," said the Pentagon spokesman Larry Di Rita. "It was good work. It was taken into account. It had some influence on people's thinking and it was a valuable contribution."
The broad outlines of the work, called the Future of Iraq Project, have been widely known, but new details emerged this week after the State Department sent Congress the project's 13 volumes of reports and supporting documents, which several House and Senate committees had requested weeks ago.
The documents are unclassified but labeled "official use only," and were not intended for public distribution, officials said. But Congressional officials from both parties allowed The New York Times to review the volumes, totaling more than 2,000 pages, revealing previously unknown details behind the planning.
Administration officials say there was postwar planning at several government agencies, but much of the work at any one agency was largely disconnected from that at others.
In the end, the American military and civilian officials who first entered Iraq prepared for several possible problems: numerous fires in the oil fields, a massive humanitarian crisis, widespread revenge attacks against former leaders of Mr. Hussein's government and threats from Iraq's neighbors. In fact, none of those problems occurred to any great degree.
Officials acknowledge that the United States was not well prepared for what did occur: chiefly widespread looting and related security threats, even though the State Department study predicted them.
Senior said the Pentagon squandered a chance to anticipate more of the postwar pitfalls by not fully incorporating the State Department information.
"Had we done more work and more of a commitment at the front end, there would be drastically different results now," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 11, Marc Grossman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said the working groups were "not to have an academic discussion but to consider thoughts and plans for what can be done immediately."
But some senior Pentagon officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that while some of the project's work was well done, much of it was superficial and too academic to be practical.
"It was mostly ignored," said one senior defense official. "State has good ideas and a feel for the political landscape, but they're bad at implementing anything. Defense, on the other hand, is excellent at logistical stuff, but has blinders when it comes to policy. We needed to blend these two together."
A review of the work shows a wide range of quality and industriousness. For example, the transitional justice working group, made up of Iraqi judges, law professors and legal experts, has met four times and drafted more than 600 pages of proposed reforms in the Iraqi criminal code, civil code, nationality laws and military procedure. Other working groups, however, met only once and produced slim reports or none at all.
"There was a wealth of information in the working group if someone had just collated and used it," said Nasreen Barwari, who served on the economy working group and is now the Iraqi minister of public works. "What they did seems to have been a one-sided opinion."
Many of the working groups offered long-term recommendations as well as short-term fixes to potential problems.
The group studying defense policy and institutions expected problems if the Iraqi Army was disbanded quickly -- a step L. Paul Bremer III, the chief American civil administrator in Iraq, took. The working group recommended that jobs be found for demobilized troops to avoid having them turn against allied forces as some are believed to have done.
After special security organizations that ensured Mr. Hussein's grip on power were abolished, the working group recommended halving the 400,000-member military over time and reorganizing Iraqi special forces to become peacekeeping troops, as well as counterdrug and counterterrorism forces. Under the plan, military intelligence units would help American troops root out terrorists infiltrating postwar Iraq.
"The Iraqi armed forces and the army should be rebuilt according to the tenets and programs of democratic life," one working group member recommended.
The democratic principles working group wrestled with myriad complicated issues from reinvigorating a dormant political system to forming special tribunals for trying war criminals to laying out principles of a new Iraqi bill of rights.
It declared the thorny question of the relationship between that secular state and Islamic religion one "only the people of Iraq can decide," and avoided a recommendation on it.
Members of this working group were divided over whether to back a provisional government made up of Iraqi exiles or adopt the model that ultimately was adopted, the Iraqi Governing Council, made up of members from a broad range of ethnic and religious backgrounds. The group presented both options.
The transparency and anticorruption working group warned that "actions regarding anticorruption must start immediately; it cannot wait until the legal, legislative and executive systems are reformed."
The economy and infrastructure working group warned of the deep investments needed to repair Iraq's water, electrical and sewage systems. The free media working group noted the potential to use Iraq's television and radio capabilities to promote the goals of a post-Hussein Iraq, an aim many critics say the occupation has fumbled so far.
Encouraging Iraqis to emerge from three decades of dictatorship and embrace a vibrant civil society including labor unions, artist guilds and professional associations, could be more difficult than anticipated, the civil society capacity buildup working group cautioned: "The people's main concern has become basic survival and not building their civil society."
The groups' ideas may not have been fully incorporated before the war, but they are getting a closer look now. Many of the Iraqi ministers are graduates of the working groups, and have brought that experience with them. Since last spring, new arrivals to Mr. Bremer's staff in Baghdad have received a CD-ROM version of the State Department's 13-volume work. "It's our bible coming out here," said one senior official in Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Softer Rents, but the Hunt Is Still Hard 

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
ASKING rents in Manhattan have stopped falling but remain at least 10 percent below the levels of two years ago, brokers and building owners say. Yet when Jodie Welkes, a financial planner, returned to New York this summer, she found the search for an apartment a daunting and expensive experience.
 Before she was downsized out of a job in Chicago, she was paying $1,900 a month for a 950-square-foot apartment in a brand new high-rise with a panoramic view of the Chicago skyline and two walk-in closets. 
 Now back in New York, after a day of apartment hunting with a broker, David Weiss of Douglas Elliman, she found herself priced out of her dream apartment in the new high-rises that soar above Avenue of the Americas in Chelsea, the strongest of the new building markets, brokers say, and began looking elsewhere.
Finally, she found a one-bedroom apartment on the eighth floor of the Westport, a new 27-story building opened on Memorial Day weekend by the Related Companies on 10th Avenue and West 56th Street, in a largely commercial area with a small Housing Authority building next door, but a quick drive to the Lincoln Tunnel and her new job in New Jersey. 
The Westport has a grand lobby and all the latest amenities: granite counters, marble in the bathroom, a health club and valet service. But, she said, her new apartment is only 730 square feet, or 25 percent smaller than her last one, and has almost no closet space -- she would gladly trade in the stylish pedestal sink for an old-fashioned vanity with storage space below. 
The posted rent is $2,525 a month. After receiving two months of free rent to close the deal, she is paying $2,164, plus $275 for parking. As she sat with her puppy in her living room, on an overstuffed couch facing a large wall unit she brought with her from Chicago, both a bit too big for her New York space, she observed that despite her well paying job, she is spending half of her take home pay on her apartment, her garage space and utilities. "I have mainly lived in New York since I was 18 and haven't been able to save enough to buy," said Ms. Welkes, who is 31. "Rents have gone up faster than my income. I got the most I could for the money." 
Still, a typical one-bedroom in her neighborhood would have cost more than $2,800 at the market's peak, according to data from Halstead/Feathered Nest leasing consultants.
As the busiest rental season draws to a close, Ms. Welkes's experience at the Westport illustrates some of the changes and unchanging facts, in the market-rate rental market in Manhattan and beyond.
Although rents began declining in 2000, when the economic boom of the 1990's began to unravel, and were hurt again after the World Trade Center attack a year later, rentals have reached a bottom and are now stable or increasing, albeit significantly below levels where they were only a few years ago, , brokers and owner say. 
The downturn has affected market rents through much of the region, especially high-rises across the river in New Jersey that compete with the Manhattan rental market. But at the same time, one large developer of rental developments said that rents have continued rising in its Long island projects. 
There is no official data on changes in apartment rents in the prime Manhattan market. One broker survey, the Halstead/Feathered Nest survey, found that through the end of 2002, rents had declined 16 percent for studios and somewhat more for one and two bedrooms. Another survey by Citi Habitats showed prices stabilizing last winter. 
But beginning in the spring, owners of so-called luxury buildings, large towers with doormen and extensive services, say rents have rebounded somewhat and are now 10 percent below the peak. It is unclear, however, what will happen during the coming winter, a slow season for the rental market, brokers say.
Vacancies are up from the incredibly tight market a few years ago, when apartments were rented almost at soon as they went on the market, but only slightly, with a 95 percent occupancy rate reported in Manhattan by Halstead/Feathered Nest. The owners of several large groups of market-rate high-rises report occupancy rates of more 97 or 98 percent at the end of the summer. 
LARGE groups of new buildings, like the Westport, with new higher standards of amenities and kitchen and bathroom details, are reported to be renting extremely well in both long-established communities and many newer residential neighborhoods, like the financial district. At the Westport, crews were at work last week finishing up penthouse floor apartments, trying to keep pace with the brisk rental pace. 
"Everyone is surprised at how strong the market is," said David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related. "We purposely were very aggressive in terms of our pricing strategy, and we have definitely seen the reaction in the marketplace."
Most large building owners now routinely offer one month's free rent and build it into their price, because renters have come to expect it, and some offer up to three months. Most are willing to pay brokers fees, typically from 12 to 15 percent of one year's rent, which were routinely paid by tenants a few years ago. 
In Ms. Welkes's case, she got the standard one month free, plus a second month because her former employer was paying her broker's fees as part of her relocation costs, for a net rent of $2,164 a month for a 14-month lease, plus $275 a month for garage space downstairs. 
Although Ms. Welkes feels she has no choice but to pay more for rent than she would have liked, many building owners say they feel a similar loss of control in this softer market. The concessions are part of a nimbleness on the part of owners as they have learned to adapt to a weaker market. 
Giving a concession or lowering an asking rent is less costly than carrying a vacant apartment for several months. And building owners who understand the current market are usually willing to reduce renewal rents to match the market levels, rather than risk losing an existing tenant.
"We don't make the market; the market makes us," said Jack Levy, a senior managing director at Rose Associates.
Weaker demand for apartments and increasing supply have combined to weaken the Manhattan market. The economic slowdown, especially in the financial industry, has sharply curtailed the numbers hired from the class of 2003, making for fewer new New Yorkers scurrying to find a first apartment. In addition, the decline in interest rates has made owning more affordable, and many renters have decided to buy.
At the same time thousands of new apartments or office conversions planned before the economic downturn were coming to market, while a substantial number -- there is no agreement on how many -- of other apartments were freed from rent regulations during the same period.
But even when the market cools and rents drift downward, Manhattan remains at the vortex of a larger regional market and can pull in people who would rather live in Manhattan but were driven away to nearby boroughs or suburbs. 
"There is no vacancy rate in Manhattan; it is a function of price," said Nancy Packes, president of Halstead/Feathered Nest Leasing. "If vacancies are up, it means that the landlord's learning curve is a bit longer."
Ms. Packes is representing the Solaire, a new 27-story rental building in Battery Park City built by the Albanese Organization, which began renting on May 1. By the fall the building, still under construction, was more than 80 percent rented, and rents have been creeping upward, according to Chris Albanese, executive vice president of the developer.
"There is a tremendous pool of people who want to live here," said Charles Singer, director of market research for Rockrose Development, a major New York City developer and landlord. "When rents do drop, we attract a lot of people from the outer boroughs, New Jersey and a little bit of Westchester and Long Island."
Rockrose owns rental buildings in Battery Park City and the financial district and experienced a surge in rentals in the spring, when incentives of up to $500 a month offered to tenants in lower Manhattan were about to expire at the end of May. 
"The market stabilized, and by June the vacancy rates were low and the landlords didn't have to give as much away," Mr. Singer said.
George Hunt, a former anthropology professor, had a dream job, living on an island in Gulf of Mexico, near Tampa, Fla., with his wife and telecommuting and traveling around the country for a computer company, until that job disappeared in the economic downturn.
Like Ms. Welkes, he came to New York on the rebound, and now finds himself living most of the time in a studio in a Rockrose building at 45 Wall Street, a 28-story former office building that was put back on the rental market in February, after the city had dropped plans to demolish it to build new quarters for the New York Stock Exchange.
He got a job marketing computer management services to Wall Street firms, and in May with the help of a friend rented the studio, just down the street from the New York Stock Exchange, for $2,000 a month, less a $250 a month Lower Manhattan rent subsidy. His wife remains at their home in Florida, and they travel back and forth when they can.
Although apartments at 45 Wall were marketed mostly to young people starting out, Mr. Hunt is 58 years old and has two grown children and four grandchildren. He seems bemused to live in a building where most of his fellow tenants are law students, medical students or beginning executives.
"I have everything I need in this neighborhood," he said. "I want to focus on my work, have no distractions whatsoever. I get everything I need delivered to my door."
Matthew Fox, 22, a neighbor at 45 Wall Street, is in his first year, and second job, out of school. In his first job in Ohio, he commuted an hour a day from Cleveland, and it wore him out. Now he lives at 45 Wall Street and works as a trader at a hedge fund a few doors from home and plays poker regularly with some other new arrivals in the building.
OUTSIDE Manhattan, especially in the forest of high-rises across the river in New Jersey, market rate rentals are down, but are also showing signs of stabilizing.
Randy Lyn Ketive, a broker in Fort Lee and a principal in the Classic Realty Group, said that the rental market in newer market rate buildings had "gone down the drain" during the last year, as renters chose to buy condos instead, but lately shows signs of strengthening. 
"Rentals are starting to come back," she said. "They have gone down as much as they can go and are much more competitive with purchasing."
Financial filings by AvalonBay Communities, a national real estate investment trust that owns and develops rental developments in the New York region, illustrates the sagging demand seen by Ms. Ketive in Fort Lee as well as Jersey City to the south. 
At the end of 2002, filings showed an 83 percent occupancy rate at the 383-apartment Avalon Crest in Fort Lee, down from 92 percent a year earlier and 97 percent in 2000; and average rents were off nearly 6 percent from the previous year.
In its projects in northern New Jersey, it showed rents in the second quarter of this year off 12 percent from a year earlier. In southern Connecticut rents were down 5 percent, and in Westchester average rents were down 2.3 percent. But on Long Island, occupancy was high and rents were up nearly 2 percent. Fred Harris, vice president for development in AvalonBay's New York City office, said that the strength of the Long Island economy had helped buffer its projects there. The company's first New York City project, the 372-apartment Avalon Riverview, in Long Island City, Queens, a short subway ride from Manhattan, opened last year and is now at more than 92 percent occupancy, he said.
If you ask David Ayers, a member of the cast and a lead understudy in "Mamma Mia," how to get to Broadway, he will tell you, take the No. 7 subway, to Manhattan in 15 minutes.
A few weeks ago Mr. Ayers moved into a one-bedroom on the 20th floor of the Avalon Riverview with his girlfriend, Jessica-Snow Wilson, who is an understudy in "Little Shop of Horrors," for $2,350 a month for 13 months, less two free months.
They moved there after a search for a condominium on the Upper West Side and a tour of a small one-bedroom near Times Square renting for $3,500 a month. "It is amazing how much 300 grand won't buy you in Manhattan," Mr. Ayers said.
He said they paid a little extra for an apartment with stainless steel appliances and fancier wood cabinets and a view that extends from the Empire State Building to the 59th Street Bridge and across 42nd Street and on to New Jersey.
But other developers say it is difficult to attract renters willing to pay those high Manhattan rents in other boroughs. 
Linda G. Fine, the renting director for Hudson Park, a new building on West 96th Street near Riverside Park, said she learned a lesson about the rental market outside Manhattan last year, when she was marketing Newswalk, a condominium development in a former Daily News Plant in Prospect Heights in Brooklyn.
The developer, Boymelgreen Developers, wanted to rent out one floor of a brand new building, with units priced at $2,000 a month for 1,100 square feet. In a month, she could not close a single deal, but all the condominium units on the same floor then sold for $349,000 in three months.
At Hudson Park, she said, she has smaller units available but a waiting list for penthouse apartments and ground floor town houses with yards that are still under construction and renting for $6,500 and up.
Andrew Heiberger, president and chief executive of Citi Habitats, a brokerage, said that the reduction of crime in the city and improvements in the quality of life have reduced the significance of neighborhood boundaries. To many renters, he said, "Manhattan is one big neighborhood now."
And the barriers have come down as middle class renters have begun to explore neighborhoods in Harlem and Washington Heights. 
BUT this has not yet had an impact on David Waxenberg, a senior vice president at Norwax Associates, which owns 30 buildings and manages several hundred more, primarily in the Bronx. There is steady demand for his rent-regulated apartments, but with the economy weak, he has been unable to collect rent increases of up to 7.5 percent that were adopted to offset an 18 1/2 percent tax increase.
"It is not a problem renting apartments," he said. "The problem becomes collecting the increases we are entitled to when people have limited incomes and are only able to afford a certain amount of rent." 
While major landlords are closely attuned to the marketplace, this is not always the case with condo and co-op owners leasing out individual apartments. Brokers say they lose money while they learn.
John T. Lawrence, executive vice president and a sales manager at Bellmarc Realty, said an individual owner called recently wanting to list an apartment for $7,000. "I went into the building and saw there were three similar properties renting for $4,500," he said. 
Grant Silver, who works in the marketing department of The Golfer magazine, sublet a one-bedroom apartment on Park Avenue near 38th Street to cut down on the time and expense of his commute to Manhattan from Stamford, after he said he had spent two weeks "getting a feel" for the market.
The owner, he said, wanted $2,150, and he was able to bring the price down by $100. Then the broker reduced his fee from 15 percent to 12 percent, and his landlady agreed to pay half. The deal was done.
For Scott Corman, an investment banker, the weaker market was the ticket to a better apartment. He had lived in a small apartment in the Lucerne, a 44-story tower at First Avenue and 79th Street built by Glenwood Management, and loved the elegant lobby and generous layouts and high ceilings, and the pool.
When he needed a larger apartment, however, nothing was available, so he moved into another Glenwood building, the Marlowe at 81st and Lexington. But this summer, when he and family needed to upgrade, he was able to move back into the Lucerne. "I got more space for less than I would have paid before," he said.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
The Nashers Keep It Close to Home

BYLINE:  By GRACE GLUECK

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
FOR years, Dallas culturati waited for the shoe to drop. Would the Nasher collection, a peerless holding of modern and contemporary sculpture, go to the Tate in London? The National Gallery in Washington? The Guggenheim Museum in New York? These and other institutions had undisguised designs on the treasury of more than 300 works -- Rodins, Matisses, Picassos, Giacomettis, Miros, Moores, di Suveros and such -- assembled by the Dallas real estate entrepreneur Raymond D. Nasher and his wife, Patsy.
 But to the relief of home fans, Mr. Nasher, having thoroughly enjoyed the wooing, rejected the suitors. The collection is now rooted here, robustly in control of -- ta da! -- Mr. Nasher and his family. Tomorrow, the $70 million Nasher Sculpture Center, a smashing combination of indoor museum and outdoor environment built and owned by the Nasher Foundation, opens to the public on a 2.4-acre downtown plot, making Dallas a premier destination for the viewing of modern and contemporary sculpture. 
 "Dallas is the community where I have spent most of my adult life and where my children and grandchildren were born," said Mr. Nasher, who was born in Boston. It is also where he made his pile, as a builder of low-cost housing, office complexes and a high-end shopping mall, NorthPark Center. 
Laura Miller, mayor of Dallas, is one of the many who view the Sculpture Center as cause for celebration. "When people come to Dallas, it's the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth that's usually on their radar screens," she said. "This will be our counterpart to the Kimbell."
The center is also seen as a giant step forward for the laggard Dallas Arts District, which was designated in 1983 but until now has had only two major components: the Dallas Museum of Art and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Hall. (Money is being raised, however, for a $250 million performing arts complex to be designed by Rem Koolhaas and Foster & Partners.)
In Dallas, there has been some grumbling about the Nashers wanting to turn the Sculpture Center into a family monument. The foundation's board, however, was recently expanded to include nonfamily members. And Mr. Nasher, a perfectionist who meticulously monitors every aspect of his projects, recently said that public organizations involve "too many committees." 
In the 1980's, the Dallas Museum of Art built a sculpture garden -- still largely empty -- in hopes of winning the Nasher collection. Though that didn't happen, John Lane, the museum's current director, seems pleased with how things have worked out. "What the Nashers are doing is so grand," he said, "that who cares who owns it?" The imposing Dallas Museum, now celebrating its centennial, is refurbishing a largely ceremonial entrance to create more rapport with the Sculpture Center, which sits directly across Flora Street.
Designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect, the Sculpture Center's 55,000-square-foot building opens on an even larger outdoor garden, planned by the landscape architect Peter Walker. 
Mr. Piano's building, between the symphony center and the art museum, is an essay in transparency: five subtly barrel-vaulted bays of travertine, with front and back exterior walls of clear glass, provide a continuous view from the street to the end of the garden. The effect is enhanced by the delicate glass curves of the roof, braced by steel struts. Above them, a graceful sunscreen device of sculptured aluminum blocks out direct sun, allowing in only a soft, even north light.
At the encouragement of the oldest of his three daughters, Andrea, Mr. Nasher had challenged Mr. Piano to develop a roof that let in more light than the flat, opaque one originally planned. "We wanted transparency above as well as below, so you could see the sky and the clouds," said Ms. Nasher, who has been closely involved with the center since its inception five years ago. 
Downstairs a large gallery is provided for light-sensitive works like drawings, as well as an indoor-outdoor auditorium, research and educational facilities and a conservation lab. A loading dock that is actually a giant elevator will carry trucks down from the street. 
The Walker garden was originally designed as a romantic setting of curves and hillocks, but it seemed to separate itself from the architecture. Again with the prompting of the Nashers, Mr. Piano took a hand in replanning to make it more flexible and contemporary. Now it functions as a continuum of the pavilion, with long allees of trees that extend the building lines. A folksy feature is the terrace garden, a flight of grass-covered steps where people can sit or sprawl, that leads to the downstairs auditorium. 
"It was a challenge to create a park that is luscious and green and yet has the spaciousness to absorb lots of sculpture," said Steven A. Nash, the center's director and a longtime adviser to Mr. Nasher. Cedar elms, crepe myrtles, live oaks, Afghan pine, weeping willows and bamboo create outdoor "rooms" for intimate viewing. Ms. Nasher selected some of them herself, working from a helicopter with the help of a professional tree spotter. 
Arrayed in the garden are some 25 larger works, among them "My Curves Are Not Mad," Richard Serra's 100,000-ton, walk-through of two 40-foot-long curved steel plates; Mark di Suvero's "Eviva Amore (Long Live Love)," a 35-foot three-legged tangle of I-beams bolted to a circular joint of welded steel plates; Jonathan Borofsky's 20-foot high motor-driven figure, "Hammering Man"; Jean Dubuffet's "Gossiper II"; Rodin's "Eve"; Joan Miro's playfully erotic "Moon Bird"; and Picasso's "Head of a Woman."
A dark, mysterious cube of black granite at the bottom of the garden was commissioned from the light artist James Turrell. Titled "Tending, (Blue)," it is open to the sky, and the subtly changing light in its cavelike interior influences what's seen above.
Inside the Piano pavilion are some 50 pieces, by Matisse, Picasso, Giacometti, Medardo Rosso and Max Ernst, among others. The center plans to mount shows from other sources, including a James Turrell exhibition with the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. Other works will be rotated among the Sculpture Center, NorthPark and the Nasher's elegant sculpture-filled home in Dallas's Preston Hollow enclave. Like the museum, the glass-and-brick house forms a continuum with its grounds, creating a flow between indoors and out.
A T the house, designed in 1949 by Howard Meyer, a Texas disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright, Mr. Nasher, an affable, laid-back guide, proudly showed visitors his Giacometti room, starring three rare painted bronze busts of Diego, the artist's brother. Mr. Nasher admires their combination of modeling and painting. "It helps that we knew Diego well," he said.
The room contains masterpieces like "Spoon Woman," influenced by African sculpture, and "No More Play," a Surrealist game board of marble pocked with circular depressions and three cryptlike trenches. As counterpoint, Mr. Nasher has included Rodin's life-size figure of a youth, "The Age of Bronze." 
"I like the idea of putting Rodin, coming from Michelangelo's theories, together with Giacometti," he said. "It makes a nice transition from the figurative, muscular tradition since the Renaissance to the modern quirkiness of Giacometti, with his skinny bodies, huge feet and small heads." 
Mr. Nasher, who graduated from Duke University in 1943 and holds a master's degree in economics from Boston University, and his wife, a graduate of Smith College who died in 1988, began collecting in the early 1950's. The stimulus was pre-Columbian artworks they saw at archaeological digs on their vacations in Mexico. A later collection of Guatemalan textiles, assembled by Mrs. Nasher, who contributed a formidable eye and a gift for scholarly investigation to the couple's pursuits, now reposes in the Dallas Museum. 
The Nashers bought paintings, too, beginning with a Ben Shahn oil of a tennis match that reflected Mr. Nasher's passion for the game. They soon got into artists of more gravitas, like Picasso, Leger, Hans Hofmann, de Kooning and Stuart Davis. Their first major sculptural acquisition was Arp's graceful"Torso With Buds" (1961), a birthday gift from Patsy to Ray. (It now stands in the vestibule of the house.)
"Paintings are great, but sculpture changes with every glance," said Mr. Nasher, who credits his feel for the three-dimensional qualities of sculpture partly to his experience as a developer and builder. "A great piece of sculpture is totally different from different angles. Walk around it and you get 360 separate views."
As Mr. Nasher's business bloomed and his shopping center -- designed by Eero Saarinen and Kevin Roche -- evolved, he looked for large works that could be placed around the mall. "More people will see art at the shopping center in a month than they will at the city's museums," he said. "Unfortunate but true."
There was also a practical side. "In real estate development the outdoor pieces had to be sculpture, weatherwise and sizewise," he said. "Also, almost into the 90's, sculpture cost about one-tenth or one-twentieth of the price of paintings by the same artist." 
He finds the stuff of sculpture intriguing and points out that 39 different materials are represented in his collection. He particularly likes plaster casts, the version made before a work is cast in bronze, "because you can see the hands of the sculptor in them."
Recently he acquired a number of heads by Medardo Rosso, the late-19th- and early-20th-century Italian sculptor whose impressionistic creations were often left in wax. The Sculpture Center will present a Rosso show, organized by the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, early next year.
"We always bought things that gave us butterflies in the stomach," Mr. Nasher said. And unlike many collectors who aim for one of everything, he said, "if we got to like an artist, we always looked for additional pieces." That translated into 13 works by Giacometti, 11 by Matisse ( among the largest such private holdings in the world), 8 by David Smith, 8 by Moore, 7 by Picasso, 7 by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and 4 by Miro. 
A "breakthrough" came in 1968 with the purchase of two Henry Moores. "We went to Much Haddam, Moore's home -- we used to go to Wimbledon every year for the matches; he loved tennis, too -- and watched him make 'Two Piece Reclining Figure No. 9.' He also showed us three stones that would become 'Three Piece No. 3: Vertebrae.' Patsy liked 'Reclining Figure' and I liked 'Vertebrae,' so we wound up with both."
Another "butterfly" acquisition was Matisse's "Large Seated Nude," owned by the dealer Heinz Berggruen. "He brought it to his suite at the Carlyle in New York and gave us one day to decide," Mr. Nasher said. "It was the first time we'd gone into seven figures." In 2001, Mr. Nasher purchased his 11th Matisse, "The Serf," one of only two male figures by the artist, at auction for $3.1 million.
Mrs. Nasher would undoubtedly approve of her husband's move in a more contemporary direction. Since her death he has acquired works by, among others, Carl Andre, Tony Cragg, Jeff Koons, Antony Gormley and Richard Long.
Mr. Nasher's role at NorthPark, opened in 1965 and still regarded as an art and architectural showplace, is as hands-on as it is at the Sculpture Center. The long, low flow of white buildings (Mr. Nasher points out that most of the world's great buildings have been white, like the Taj Mahal and the White House), set on a onetime cotton field, is about to expand. Attractively landscaped by the San Francisco designer Lawrence Halprin, it shelters more than 120 stores, from Neiman Marcus and Tiffany to Anthropology, a youth-oriented apparel shop. 
"What I tried to do was democratize retailing, so that every store, from high to lowest income, got the same exterior and interior materials," Mr. Nasher said. "We felt the art we put in would become a permanent type of happening that people would see, enjoy, learn from and maybe come back to."
Among the first works installed was a 200-foot-long site-specific piece in Cor-Ten steel by Beverly Pepper. Works by Moore, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Joel Shapiro followed. 
Mr. Nasher is also the prime patron of a new Nasher Museum of Art at Duke, to which he contributed $10 million of a projected $23 million construction cost. Designed by another hot architect, Rafael Vinoly, a runner-up in the competition to rebuild the World Trade Center site, it will open in 2005. Mr. Nasher, of course, is closely involved in this one, too, with the help of another daughter, Nancy, a lawyer who with her husband, David Haemisegger, now owns and runs NorthPark.
"Two museums is too much," Mr. Nasher sighed. But somehow you don't quite believe him.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS; 
German Olympic Bid Has Sour Note

BYLINE:  By DESMOND BUTLER

DATELINE: ROSTOCK, Germany, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
When Mayor Wolfgang Tiefensee of Leipzig picked up a cello and played "Dona Nobis Pacem" after the announcement earlier this year that Leipzig and Rostock would be candidates for Germany's 2012 Olympic bid, the meaning for eastern Germany was palpable.
 Tiefensee, 48, made his name in East Germany during the 1989 "peaceful revolution," when he and other dissidents against communism gathered at St. Nikolai Church in Leipzig for prayer vigils and "Dona Nobis Pacem" became their anthem for change. 
 By choosing Leipzig and Rostock, two cities of the former East Germany, the German Olympic Committee hoped to play on the potent imagery of German reunification and send the message that the east had long since left behind the legacy of its Communist-controlled sporting machine, which evokes memories of an extensive doping program if also great Olympic success. 
"It was a starting point in changing the political way of the world," Tiefensee said of the 1989 revolution in a radio interview last month. "And this is something we can link with the Olympic Games." 
But in recent days, Germany's pitch to beat out New York, Paris, Moscow, Istanbul, Havana, London, Madrid and Rio de Janeiro has been complicated by disclosures that top officials from Rostock and Leipzig had worked for the East German secret police, the Stasi, before the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Last week, the head of Leipzig's Olympic bid committee, Dirk Tharichen, and the chairman of Rostock's public run Olympic marketing committee, Harald Lochotzke, stepped down from their positions after the German news media published details about their Stasi connections. On Saturday, the committee's supervisory board officially dismissed Tharichen.
After reunification, Germany established a government authority to maintain and organize the Stasi files recovered after the collapse of the East German state. Under certain strict conditions, the files on individuals may be requested and released. Stasi connections are still a hot-button issue in Germany, and in many professions those who worked for the Stasi or as informers may be barred from employment.
The disclosures have soured an already uphill German bid, submitted to the International Olympic Committee, which is still sensitive to charges of corruption in the bid process after the scandal that emerged from the selection of Salt Lake City to play host to the 2002 Games.
"It was a moving moment when Leipzig and Rostock won," said a Rostock City Council member, Sybille Bachmann. "Tiefensee's message was 'We are the people that brought change to East Germany,' but then it turns out that some of the same old people they were fighting are involved in the application."
Tharichen resigned after the German daily Die Welt revealed that as a 19-year-old, he had served briefly for the Stasi's Feliks Dzerzhinsky guard unit, named after the founder of the K.G.B.
On Monday, the German weekly Der Spiegel detailed Lochotzke's more extensive period of collaboration with the Stasi and also reported on suggestions of questionable business dealings in Rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the wall.
Stasi files obtained by a journalist working for Der Spiegel who applied for them some months ago detail Lochotzke's collaboration from 1986 until 1989 under the code name Kay Birkhoff. They state that Lochotzke reported informally to a Stasi economic unit run by Alexander Schalk-Golodkowski, chief acquisitor of foreign currency for East Germany, and was working to find ways of evading Western sanctions in order to import computers.
The position helped earn him the right denied to most citizens to travel in the West. The files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the Stasi.
In defending himself, Lochotzke said he had never informed on others, but a number of the files indicate otherwise. One positive job evaluation noted that Birkhoff had "described and incriminated people with specific details, including close relatives," apparently his in-laws.
Only months after the collapse of East Germany, Lochotzke said he was the head of a company, Alpha Consulting, that was representing an international consortium that wished to invest 1 billion marks (about $500 million) in Rostock. According to city documents, his proposal included a letter detailing an advisory meeting with Karl Otto Pohl, then the central bank president, and others who had recommended the deal.
Some months later, when the new city government asked a lawyer, the former Hamburg mayor Peter Schulz, to review the deal, he shot it down. 
"It was immediately apparent that there was a swindle in the works," he said in an interview in Hamburg. According to Schulz, Lochotzke later admitted to him that he had not met with Pohl.
Schulz also noted that the telephone number listed for Alpha Consulting rang through to the Hotel Neptun, Lochotzke's former workplace, which also served as Schalk-Golodkowski's headquarters in Rostock. 
The disclosure led some in the German news media to ask whether Lochotzke was trying to launder Stasi money. Lochotzke, who is traveling abroad, has denied the suggestions and did not return calls made to his office.
In Rostock, which has been nominated to play host to the Olympic sailing events, the mayor's office responsible for the bid has distanced itself from Lochotzke, but local politicians and the German news media are asking why no one questioned Lochotzke before he took over the committee, especially given the marketing themes of the bid. 
"It is not a government position and I did not think it relevant to ask about Mr. Lochotzke's past," Mayor Arno Poker said.
Had the local authorities looked closer, they might have raised deeper questions about Lochotzke's political judgment. One of his last reports delivered to his handlers on Oct. 5, 1989, only days before the Berlin Wall was breached and neighbors were bolting for Czechoslovakia, was titled, "Information, Mood and Reaction of the Population," and began with the observation, "The politics of our party and government has been successful, but nonetheless needs some newer elements."

Misplay Serves as Rude Awakening for Yawning Yanks

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
David Wells twisted his face into a snarl, looked as if he were spiking an imaginary football while slamming his left fist toward the grass, then screamed an expletive. He was reacting to Aaron Boone's cutting off a throw when it appeared the Yankees could have nabbed the runner at home, but Wells's petulance was not as glaring as that mistake and the others they accumulated on a surprisingly subdued night at Yankee Stadium.
 Was this really Game 1 of the World Series? Have the Boston Red Sox left town yet? The Yankees did not play with the urgency required for a series that will decide their season during a listless 3-2 loss to the Florida Marlins. They looked disjointed and uninterested, dreadful attributes for a team that is four victories from a title. More important, the Yankees are three losses from extinction. 
 While the more seasoned, more savvy Yankees were sleepwalking though the evening, the younger, looser Marlins did things with more precision -- on the bases, with runners on base and on the mound. The Marlins were clearly not spooked by playing in Babe Ruth's famous house, which seemed more like a condominium with a stringent noise policy.
"Should we have been awed?" Florida Manager Jack McKeon said. "I mean, I don't know. I mean, we play them one night at a time whether we're playing in Woodbridge, N.J., or, you know, New York City or Chicago. It's one game at a time. They're not awed." 
The misplay that helped destroy the Yankees is the sort of play that is usually reserved for high school games, not World Series ones. After Juan Pierre lined a single past a drawn-in infield to deliver Jeff Conine from third, Juan Encarnacion tried to score from second. Left fielder Hideki Matsui relayed the ball to Boone, who cut it off about 50 feet from home and, inexplicably, fired it to first. Pierre was barely off the base.
If Boone had let the ball go or had caught it and thrown home, there is a chance he would have nailed Encarnacion for the second out in the fifth inning and kept the deficit at 2-1. Catcher Jorge Posada did not shout instructions to Boone, and he said that silence should have told Boone to let the ball go. Boone thought Matsui's throw was tailing to his left and might not reach home, but the television replays seemingly indicated that the Yankees could have gotten an out.
"In hindsight, I wish I had let it go," Boone said. "We might have had a chance."
Posada said he thought the Yankees would have had a "real good chance" to prevent the runner from scoring. Based on Wells's reaction and his postgame comments, he also thought that Encarnacion should have been challenged. "Boone went on instinct and made the play," Wells said. "I'm not going to second-guess him. It's not his fault."
That extra run wound up deciding the game. Bernie Williams bashed a homer off Brad Penny in the sixth to make it 3-2, but the Yankees wasted numerous opportunities while going a dismal 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position. Jason Giambi and Alfonso Soriano combined to strand nine runners. The Yankees had a runner on second and no outs in three of the first four innings and managed only one run. Besides Boone's mistake, Nick Johnson was picked off third by catcher Ivan Rodriguez to obliterate a second-and-third situation in the third. Why Johnson was far enough off third to be in jeopardy to be thrown out was a mystery. Johnson said he slipped, but Joe Torre said "those things shouldn't happen."
Every scouting report the Yankees had mentioned that Pierre was one of the best bunters in the game; he was second in the major leagues with 29 bunt hits. So what did Pierre do to the Yankees on Wells's second pitch of the game? He adeptly dragged a bunt past the plodding Wells and in front of Soriano, the second baseman, and easily beat it out for a hit.
"I know the next time up, Torre was yelling, 'Move up, move up,' " Pierre said. "It was already in their head with the bunt."
Huh? The bunt should not have surprised the Yankees. Every scouting report also stressed the importance of keeping Pierre and Luis Castillo off the bases, but Wells could not do that. With Johnson holding Pierre on first, Castillo's 120-foot pop-up to the part of the infield where the grass meets the dirt turned into an annoying single that pushed Pierre to third. Rodriguez's fly ball scored Pierre and the Marlins had manufactured their first run economically.
The Yankees did not do anything remotely as efficient. Soriano had an infield single and a stolen base in the first, but three Yankees could not budge him. Left fielder Miguel Cabrera's one-base error helped lead to a run in the third, but Johnson slipped to squelch that rally. Posada struck out with two men on in the eighth against Ugueth Urbina, then Urbina stranded two more during a tense ninth. "He is tired," Jorge Posada Sr. said of his son before the game. "He didn't tell me, but I can see it."
The Yankees all looked tired last night. Tired and detached. Perhaps they did not take the Marlins seriously enough. Maybe they were waiting for the fans to boo a pest named Pierre with the same verve they booed a scoreboard image of Pedro Martinez. Whatever it was, the Yankees were sluggish and wasteful at a time when they can be neither.

I Am Woman. Now Prepare to Die.

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND; Julie Dunn in Denver and Maureen Balleza in Houston contributed to this article.

 BODY:
THE weekend after Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California, the No. 1 movie in America was Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Vol. 1." Given the proximity of the two events, it is tempting to read them as a parable about women, violence and movies.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger built his popularity on larger-than-life violent screen characters, then parlayed this power in the real world to mount his campaign for governor. On the stump, he sometimes reprised poses or lines from his movies. Despite accusations from women that he groped or sexually humiliated them, he got 43 percent of the female vote. 
 In "Kill Bill," which opened three days after the election, women rise to a level of brutality previously reserved for men like Mr. Schwarzenegger. Where women go in this movie, limbs fly. Heads roll. Blood spurts in three shades of red. 
In one scene the actress Chiaki Kuriyama, wearing a plaid skirt and schoolgirl blazer, asks a man if he wants to have sex with her. When he says yes, she stabs him. 
"Do you still want to penetrate me?" she asks, pushing the knife through his torso. "Or is it I who has penetrated you?"
If political clout follows from on-screen body count, as it seemed to in California, you can only wonder what sort of political career Ms. Kuriyama has in store.
"Kill Bill," which presents its highly stylized violence as visual repartee, is just the latest in a growing body of movies and television shows featuring wild women wielding weapons. From the animated "Powerpuff Girls" to the ABC series "Alias," in which Jennifer Garner plays a deadly secret agent in stretch fabrics, women are wreaking damage in ways previously reserved for the hairier sex. 
Eight years after Lucy Lawless brought Xena the Warrior Princess to the untamed world of syndicated television, the message from Hollywood is clear: You've come a long way, baby. Now kill someone.
At theaters last week, where Mr. Tarantino's choreographed blood ballet drew $31 million in its first seven days, the connection between violence on-screen and power off-screen was not lost on the women in the audience. About 40 percent of the ticket buyers on opening weekend were female, according to Rick Sands, the chief operating officer of Miramax Films. 
For a movie in which characters literally lose their heads, "that's a very large female audience," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box office figures.
The carnage was part of the appeal. "It was empowering to women," said Carolyn Hrenko, 22, in downtown Denver on Wednesday, after watching Uma Thurman cut a bloody swath through "Kill Bill." Ms. Hrenko added: "For the most part, it showed women in a positive light, they were all so tough."
In Houston, a real estate agent named Rachel Watkins, 45, who took her husband to the movie, said she wanted to see it again, this time with her 15-year-old daughter. "I think the girls need to look at it instead of the silly movies," she said. "This is something they should look for." 
The aggression on the screen "reflects a trend in the broader culture," said Martha McCaughey, an editor of "Reel Knockouts: Violent Women in the Movies," who has also worked extensively with women's self-defense programs. The numbers of women who study martial arts, box, own guns and listen to Courtney Love and Foxy Brown records have been on the increase for decades. It is only natural for more women to be comfortable seeing characters like themselves mix it up, as aggressors rather than just victims. 
In the 1990's, Ms. McCaughey used to show film clips of actresses in violent roles to women's studies classes, including scenes of Linda Hamilton in "Terminator 2" or Rene Russo in "Lethal Weapon 3." Her more politicized students objected to the clips, she said. "They said, 'If women are going to celebrate violence, now we can't say that violence is a problem of a male-dominated society.' " 
But in recent years, younger women have been especially comfortable with physical aggression, both on-screen and off, said Patricia Pearson, author of "When She Was Bad: Violent Women and the Myth of Innocence." Ms. Pearson said that "for younger girls, it doesn't contravene their sense of gender identity." 
The mayhem in "Kill Bill," which fills most of the movie, is more clever pastiche than naturalistic gore. The audience knows that the movie does not take its violence seriously. Like Mr. Tarantino's other films, "Kill Bill" riffs copiously on other movies, and what other movies are about -- commercially successful ones -- is often violence. 
Similarly, in "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle," the violence is more like a video game or music video, with explosions right and left. In the television series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," which finished its seven-year run in May, or "Charmed," women have supernatural powers, including violent ones, to go with supercool wardrobes. 
These characters allow female viewers to vent their anger vicariously, said Joan Morgan, author of "When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip-Hop Feminist Breaks It Down." Ms. Morgan said she planned to see "Kill Bill" with her girlfriends. "Women get angry," she said. "Without socially accepted outlets for that anger, flicks like 'Kill Bill' are very cathartic."
Besides, she added, there's something especially engrossing about a fight between women. "I grew up in the South Bronx, and nothing stopped the flow of the neighborhood more than two women duking it out in the street," she said. "There was a code of honor when guys fought, but women were no-holds-barred. If you knew you were going to be in a fight, you came to school with your hair in braids, petroleum jelly on your face and clothing that couldn't be stripped. Because women will strip each other down and attempt to scar each other." 
For all their differences, these portrayals send a common message about power and society, said Henry Jenkins, director of the comparative media studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "In popular culture, power gets represented through violence," he said. "It tells us who has the ability to kick, slash or shoot an opponent." Characters who can blow things up on-screen can wield corporate power or run for governor of California. 
But even in these violent roles, screen heroines still cannot have it all. Unlike classic Homeric male action heroes, who level cities and slay suitors in order to win the girl, the protagonists of "Kill Bill" and the "Charlie's Angels" movies do not drop the armor for amour. They are, like the schoolgirl assassin played by Ms. Kuriyama, literally impenetrable, in love or in war. 
Audiences still maintain the Victorian prejudice that the sex act compromises women, Mr. Jenkins said. "There is the sense that for women to have sexuality is to give themselves over to the dominance of men," he said. 
"Kill Bill" is also a story about maternal loss. Though the movie jumps around in time, the first thing Uma Thurman does chronologically is grab her flat stomach and scream for the unborn baby she has lost. The movie is her grisly revenge for being denied the role of bride and mother. 
Ann Kearney-Cooke, who runs the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute and works with adolescent girls, said that these depictions of violently powerful women, often created by men, are actually debilitating to women in the real world. "What's going on is that as women have gained power economically and politically, the message has been that to be successful, you have to be like a man," she said. "That's carried through to roles like this. This acting hypermasculine is a way of glorifying men, not women."
At a Times Square theater last week, any sexual politics in "Kill Bill" washed over Justin Lowrie, 33, a graphic designer. "It didn't even dawn on me that it was women doing the violence," he said. 
As with Mr. Schwarzenegger's movies, the real star of "Kill Bill" is the violence, not the people who perpetrate it. They are more an extension of set design or special effects -- which raises a whole other set of gender questions, for another day.

HEADLINE: Trout Lake Journal; 
Natural Gas or Nature In Canada's Far North

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TROUT LAKE, Northwest Territories 

 BODY:
Walking along the sandy beach on a lake teeming with trout and pickerel, Chief Dennis Deneron recalled an offer from a Calgary businessman in 1995 that he said he could easily refuse.
 "The oil executive told me, 'We'll pay your way round-trip to Hawaii,' and I said, 'Why would I need a vacation when I have this beach every day,' " said a smiling Chief Deneron, who leads the 75 people who live in this village of log cabins. 
 Trout Lake is believed to have a huge pool of natural gas beneath it, one that Chief Deneron never wants exploited, believing that the site is too special to risk polluting it. Pointing to the seagull, raven and duck tracks on the sand, he added: "It's nice here. It's fresh. You can put your hand in the water and drink it." 
Some 4,000 Dene Native Canadians of the Deh Cho region inhabit a region the size of Utah. Of four Indian groups living in a 800-mile corridor winding from the Beaufort Sea to northwestern Alberta, they are the only holdouts in reaching agreements on a $3.5 billion pipeline.
Imperial Oil, ExxonMobil, Shell Canada and ConocoPhillips are promising the Dene riches and development. The federal and territorial governments are eager to see the Mackenzie River valley pipeline project get started, to increase exports to the United States. Once completed, the pipeline is expected to carry as much as a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily, or 10 percent of Canada's current gas exports.
Negotiations have been held on and off for three decades, and neighboring groups one by one have agreed in return for land rights and a bonanza of jobs and benefits. The Deh Cho Dene may now be beginning to bend. 
They signed an interim agreement with the federal and territorial governments in April. The government and companies consider it a breakthrough and hope that a pipeline can be up and running in a decade. Yet the Deh Cho Dene became the darlings of environmentalists.
Under the agreement, which allows things like surveying and exploration, about 38,000 square miles of territory extending from the Wood Buffalo National Park to the Nahanni National Park will be closed to mineral exploration for five years. That protects one of the largest habitats of grizzly bears, caribou and migratory birds in North America.
In exchange the Deh Cho Dene said they would be willing to allow studies of oil, gas and mineral development to go forward on about half of their 81,000 square miles of territory, as long as the local bands take part in environmental impact surveys. In parallel negotiations, the Deh Cho Dene and federal government and industry representatives are working out what royalties and jobs Trout Lake and the other nine communities would get from a pipeline and other mineral exploitation.
They are also negotiating an agreement with the national government that would establish a local government led by Dene and financed from gas and oil royalties and based on Dene laws and customs. Land management, health care and education would be under Dene control.
The efforts by the Deh Cho Dene to lift themselves economically and politically, at the same time protecting the lands that contain their ceremonial gravesites, medicinal plants and traditional trap lines, are part of a quiet revolution under way across the Northwest Territories.
Two hundred miles east of here, the Dogrib tribe signed a land settlement with the federal government in August giving them broad powers to govern themselves and to tax developers over 15,000 square miles.
Meanwhile, Native Canadian groups representing 100,000 people are setting up airlines and drilling and construction companies and other ventures to exploit opportunities arising from new diamond mines and the exploration of Arctic gas and oil fields. "It's no longer Ottawa running the entire show," said Stephen Kakfwi, premier of the Northwest Territories and a leader of the Sahtu band. "Political and economic power has shifted dramatically." 
Nevertheless, local Dene leaders say final agreements with the oil companies and territorial and federal governments to allow the pipeline to go through their territory is far from certain and a long way off.
"We are saying, 'This is our land, so back off,' " said Herb Norwegian, the grand chief of the Deh Cho Dene. "If they don't meet our demands, we have the ways, the means and the people to stop the pipeline."
He wants to preserve a way of life in which villagers dry catches of fish and moose meat over smoky fires, and keep food fresh by digging shelters under the permafrost. But change is indisputable, too, with snowmobiles replacing dog teams, Western clothes replacing animal skins and permanent towns replacing migratory camps.
Negotiation techniques in the Deh Cho region are hardly conventional. Before meeting federal officials, the Deh Cho Dene burn gobs of soft fat taken from behind the left eye of a hunted moose, in an offering to Yamoria, a mythical being sent to earth by the Creator in ancient times. Then they pull out maps drafted from digitalized computer grids that show their hunting and fishing patterns.
Hart Searle, spokesman for Imperial Oil and the Mackenzie Delta producers, said: "The grand chief and others have never said no to pipeline development. The message we take is, 'Don't stop talking to us.' We will keep the dialogue going."

HEADLINE: SIZZLING ECONOMY REVITALIZES INDIA 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: GURGAON, India 

 BODY:
Tarun Narula, a 25-year-old computer instructor, celebrated Mohandas K. Gandhi's birthday on Oct. 2 by going to the Metropolitan Mall. So did so many thousands of others that the parking lot was full, as were those of the other two malls across and down the street. Indian-made sport utility vehicles, cars and motorcycles fought for space, choking the roads of this satellite city south of Delhi.
 Inside the malls, young people sipped coffee at Barista Coffee, the Starbucks of India. They wandered through Indian department stores, Marks and Spencer, Lacoste and Reebok. Families took children to McDonald's, or the Subway sandwich shop. Moviegoers chose between "Boom," a Bollywood film with a decidedly Western touch of vulgarity, and "2 Fast 2 Furious." 
 This is no longer the India of Gandhi, among history's most famous ascetics. 
The change in values, habits and options in India -- not just from his day, but from a mere decade ago -- is undeniable, and so is the sense of optimism about India's economic prospects.
Much of India is still mired in poverty, but just over a decade after the Indian economy began shaking off its statist shackles and opening to the outside world, it is booming. The surge is based on strong industry and agriculture, rising Indian and foreign investment and American-style consumer spending by a growing middle class, including the people under age 25 who now make up half the country's population.
After growing just 4.3 percent last year, India's economy, the second fastest growing in the world, after China, is widely expected to grow close to 7 percent this year.
The growth of the past decade has put more money in the pockets of an expanding middle class, 250 million to 300 million strong, and more choices in front of them. Their appetites are helping to fuel demand-led growth for the first time in decades.
India is now the world's fastest growing telecom market, with more than one million new mobile phone subscriptions sold each month. Indians are buying about 10,000 motorcycles a day. Banks are now making $15 billion a year in home loans, with the lowest interest rates in decades helping to spur the spending, building and borrowing. Credit and debit cards are slowly gaining.
The potential for even more market growth is enormous, a fact recognized by multinationals and Indian companies alike. In 2001, according to census figures, only 31.6 percent of India's 192 million households had a television, and only 2.5 percent a car, jeep or van.
Foreign institutional investors have poured nearly $5 billion into the Indian market this year, already more than six times last year's total. The Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensitive Index has risen by more than 50 percent since April, hitting a three-year high. Foreign exchange reserves are at a record $90 billion.
After huffing and puffing in place for eight or nine years, "the train has left the station," C. K. Prahalad, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School, said of the Indian economy.
More than a decade after India began opening its economy by reducing protectionism and red tape, slowly lifting restrictions on foreign investment and reforming its financial sector, the changes are starting to show substantial results.
Companies that stumbled in the face of recession and new competitive pressures in the 1990's have increased productivity and are showing record profits. India is slowly making a name not just for software exports and service outsourcing, but also as an exporter of autos, auto parts and motorcycles.
Nature has played a part as well. The seasonal monsoon that ended recently was the best this agriculture-dependent economy has seen in at least five years, with normal or excess rainfall in 33 of 36 of the country's sub-regions. That, in turn, is putting income and credit in rural pockets, spurring a run on consumer goods that will only strengthen when the harvest comes in later this year.
In some places, the economic transformation is startling. Look at islands of prosperity like Gurgaon, or Bangalore, and you see an India that many Americans -- not to speak of Indians -- would not recognize.
It is a place where a young fashion designer like Swati Bhargava, 27, who works for a company that exports clothes to American and French chains, can buy stylish Indian clothes, eat at Pizza Hut, drink at Barista and contemplate the country mutating around her.
"The culture is changing," she said. "People are becoming more broad-minded."
One sign of change is the proliferation of malls. India's first opened only in 1999, and its second in 2000, according to Harminder Sahni, a principal in KSA Technopak, a management consulting firm in New Delhi. By the end of next year, it will have almost 150.
Of course, truisms about what holds India back have not disappeared. The shortfalls in infrastructure, particularly power and education, are staggering. Twenty-six percent of Indians still live in poverty, and data suggest inequality is widening even as the poverty rate falls. Overall employment is essentially stagnating.
The heavy dependence on agriculture, which still accounts for 25 percent of gross domestic product and 70 percent of employment, means that a bad monsoon, like the one last year, can hobble the economy.
The country remains politically dependent on subsidies that have helped swell fiscal deficits that limit growth and investment in education and health. A recent Supreme Court ruling suspending the sale of shares in significant state-owned industries prompted concerns about the slowing of economic reforms, as do continuing red tape and corruption.
Moreover, not everyone embraces change. Many bemoan the aping of Western culture at the expense of a much older and richer Indian one.
Still, an acceleration of the transformation seems inevitable, in part because the booming consumer culture is being driven by the young. The youth of India's population is a demographic trend of such economic and cultural significance that even the country's aging leadership recognizes its importance.
Yogesh Samat, the chief executive of Barista, which was founded four years ago and now has 125 coffee bars across the country, said that before economic liberalization began in 1991, "there was a great deal of guilt associated with spending of any kind; saving was the done thing." But today's youth -- those born in the 1980's -- never experienced either the shortages or the psychological constraints of the country's socialist, Soviet-oriented past, he said.
"Consumerism as a term is no longer seen as a bad word," Mr. Samat observed, "and the acquisition of material things is no longer seen as going against Indian traits."
The young people at the Gurgaon malls would agree. Most of those interviewed here work, a change itself from the past, when jobs for college-age students were few.
Most of them have jobs in service industries, like hotels or marketing, that now constitute about half the economy. They tend to live at home with their parents, following Indian tradition, meaning that almost all of their income is disposable.
Mr. Narula, the computer instructor, for example, earns $2,173 a year, more than four times India's per capita income of about $480. He lives at home, and has spent his money on a Nokia phone, a Maruti car and clothes. On Gandhi's birthday, he spent about five hours with his friends at the mall, eating at McDonald's and watching "Boom."
The lifestyle changes for this cohort have come at warp speed. Mr. Sahni of KSA Technopak is only 35, but marvels at the variety open to young Indians today. "When I was a young person, nothing was happening -- every day, life was the same," he said.
No longer. A year ago, India was in a national funk over China having surged ahead economically. Now, there is a cautious sense that over time, India could prove the turtle to China's hare, thanks to its entrepreneurial spirit, its strong higher education system and its democracy.
"There's a lot of confidence in India today, even in respect to China," said Jairam Ramesh, the senior economic adviser to the opposition Congress Party.
India now has a $500 million trade surplus with China, and Indian companies increasingly see China less as a threat than an opportunity. A delegation of Indian industrialists is now in China to market everything from steel to pharmaceuticals.
Indian companies say the advantages of the country's high-skilled, low-cost work force are outweighing the disadvantages imposed by its infrastructure and bureaucracy, and even there they see improvement. 
Ratul Puri, the executive director of Moser Baer India, which has become the world's third largest producer of recordable media like DVD's and CD's, said his company had recently built the world's largest production site for such devices -- 1.5 million square feet -- in Noida, another Delhi satellite city, in just six and a half months. 
"Pre-1991, it would have been impossible," Mr. Puri said. "We would have spent six and a half months trying to get the license for construction."

HEADLINE: Locked Out at a Young Age 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
With the nation at war, the wretched state of millions of young people in America's urban centers is getting even less attention than usual.
 While the U.S. is trying to figure out how to pay for its incursion into Iraq, millions of teenagers and young adults, especially in the inner cities, are drifting aimlessly from one day to the next. They're out of school, out of work and, as I've said before in this column, all but out of hope. 
 The latest data coming out of Chicago, which is roughly representative of conditions in other major urban areas, is depressing. The city's dropout rate is reportedly at an all-time high. And 22 percent of all Chicago residents between the ages of 16 and 24 are both out of school and out of work. 
The term being used to describe these youngsters who have nothing very constructive to do with their time is "disconnected youth." Many of them are leading the kinds of haunted lives that recall the Great Depression. They hustle, doing what they can -- much of it illegal -- to get along. Some are homeless.
Of Chicagoans who are 20 to 24 years old, more than 26 percent are out of work and out of school. When the statistics are refined to focus on young blacks and Hispanics, they only get worse.
An incredible 45 percent of black men in Chicago aged 20 to 24 are out of work and out of school. That is not a condition that should be ignored.
"Failure to complete high school is almost equivalent to economic suicide," said Dr. Neeta P. Fogg, a senior economist at Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies and the co-author of a study on education and the youth labor market in Illinois. During a presentation of her findings last week, she noted that the 16-to-24 age range is typically the time when young people "accumulate human capital in the form of formal education attainment or work experience in the labor market."
Youngsters who are left out of that experience entirely -- or almost entirely -- can face significant barriers to employment success for the rest of their lives. And the difficulties they face become, in one form or another, difficulties to be faced by the society as a whole.
Among the most obvious and immediate effects of this disconnect from both educational experience and the labor market are increased rates of crime, drug use and gang membership. Among the less obvious but most tragic effects is the failure of healthy young men and women to realize their potential to live satisfying, constructive lives.
On a previous visit to Chicago I talked with a teenager named Audrey Roberts, who told me: "The stuff you hear on the news, that's our everyday life. I've seen girls get raped, beaten up. I saw a boy get his head blown away. That happened right in front of me. I said, 'Oh my God!' "
There are nearly 100,000 people aged 16 to 24 who are out of school and out of work in Chicago, and about 5.5 million across the U.S. Instead of sending them a lifeline, we are making it ever more difficult for them to reconnect to the educational establishment and the job market.
The recent increased federal involvement in the nation's public schools is having the perverse effect of driving up dropout rates as school administrators try to pump up their high-stakes test results by getting rid of struggling students.
At the same time, the government's support for programs designed specifically to train youngsters and enhance their employment opportunities is vanishing.
Dr. Fogg's study was commissioned by the Chicago Alternative Schools Network, which is trying to focus national attention on the plight of young people who are out of school and out of work. The situation at the moment is so bad, it's almost like starting from scratch.
"Most people don't know how bad it is," said Jack Wuest, the network's executive director. He said he welcomed the increased support that is being given to prekindergarten programs and early childhood education, "but we need a broader picture of the entire lives of these kids. We can't just let them fall off a cliff when they get to be 15 or 16."
He added, in a wistful tone, "These kids are doing nothing at a point in their lives when they should be grabbing life by the scruff of the neck."

HEADLINE: An Optimist Aims to Revive Red Herring 

BYLINE:  By VICTORIA SHANNON, International Herald Tribune 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
It is a truism of markets that a good time to invest is at the bottom of the business cycle.
 Alex Vieux, a native of France, is taking that maxim to heart. 
 In these difficult times for technology companies, he plans to resuscitate Red Herring, a magazine that was an early messenger of the new economy. 
 Mr. Vieux, 46, is a longtime friend of the technology world -- a schmoozer who attracts big names to conferences put on around the world by his American company, Dasar. Last week in Berlin, for example, Bill Gates made his seventh return visit to Mr. Vieux's annual European Technology Roundtable Exhibition. 
 In April, Mr. Vieux bought the Red Herring brand after its investors, Broadview Holdings, decided not to continue financing the money-losing venture. Time Warner had purchased the Red Herring subscriber list, with an agreement that precluded a print version for 18 months.
 Mr. Vieux plans to publish the return issue next September. In the meantime, he is hiring, planning and reinvigorating the Red Herring Web site -- which went back online in September -- from his offices in Mountain View, Calif. 
 He thinks there is still room for aggressive reporting in the technology start-up business. "The market needs a voice, an opinionated voice," Mr. Vieux said. "It also needs a balanced voice."
 James Daly, former editor of Business 2.0, is heading the Red Herring editorial staff and is trying to attract writers for the magazine. 
 Mr. Vieux would not disclose the purchase price. Dasar, his company, is a 20 percent stakeholder. 
 As publisher, Mr. Vieux knows that he needs more than good connections to make the magazine succeed. He is counting on a comeback in technology advertising to return Red Herring to profitability. And he hopes to emphasize the global nature of the technology business.
 "Silicon Valley is not America," he said. "It is not a mirror of the country. It is a very international place."

HEADLINE: Bolivian Peasants' 'Ideology of Fury' Still Smolders 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: EL ALTO, Bolivia, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Down in the capital, a new president was settling into office and assembling a cabinet. Up here in the birthplace of the monthlong uprising that overthrew his predecessor, the residents, giddy with satisfaction at the change they had wrought, had but one message: don't get too comfortable in power.
 "If we did it once, we can do it again," said Elio Argullo, a former miner and 45-year-old father of four who now sells athletic shoes from a cart on the street here. "And if we have to, you can be sure that we will." 
 Mario Roque, editor of the local newspaper El Alteno, calls El Alto -- a ramshackle city of 700,000 perched on the Andean plateau overlooking the seat of government in La Paz -- "the capital of social protest in Bolivia." Little more than a speck on the map a generation ago, it has become Bolivia's fastest-growing city, its population swelled by migrating Aymara and Quechua-speaking miners and peasant farmers unable to make a living in the countryside.
In mid-September, the first demonstrations erupted here against President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and his proposal to export natural gas to the United States through a port in Chile. On Friday, after the protests had grown into a nationwide movement that included labor unions and opposition parties, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada resigned and flew to Miami, leaving the job of healing this sharply divided nation to his inexperienced vice president, 50-year-old Carlos Mesa.
Though it accounts for most of Bolivia's eight million people, the Indian majority has been trampled and ignored throughout this country's turbulent history. Racial, economic, social and political grievances have suddenly been combined into what Mr. Mesa on Saturday called "the eruption of deeply held positions, over many centuries, that have been accumulating."
But their success in toppling a wealthy and cosmopolitan president has clearly given the indigenous residents of El Alto a sense of power, as well as awakening a long-dormant sense of racial pride. "They may still say that we are only Indians, but now we can see what is happening and what the Aymara nation can do when it is united," said Ezequiel Vera, a 53-year-old unemployed carpenter.
Mr. Mesa, a journalist and historian, has much the same background as the rest of the Europeanized elite here, and on Sunday appointed an overwhelmingly white 14-member cabinet, which included a special coordinator for indigenous affairs.
Indian leaders say they will not hold the new president's origins against him, so long as he breaks with the failed policies associated with Mr. Sanchez de Lozada. "We indigenous people are willing to give them one more opportunity," said Augusto Mamani Pom, 30, a physician who operates a community health center here.
But should Mr. Mesa fail to make good on the reforms he promised in his inaugural address on Friday night, say "within three months," Dr. Mamani warned, then "we will return to our ideology of fury."
That prospect makes elites throughout Latin America uneasy. The Indian-led uprising here has reverberated strongly in countries that have similar racial and class tensions between whites and Indians, like Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay and even Mexico and nations in Central America.
In interviews on the streets and in shops here, residents made it clear that what they want most from the new government is jobs. "We came to El Alto to flee hunger, misery and unemployment, but it followed us here," said Maria Juturi, 33, a shop clerk who works on commission and earns about $2 a day.
Aware of the dangers he faces, Mr. Mesa chose El Alto for his first public appearance as president. Addressing a predominantly Indian group of residents on Saturday afternoon, he praised "the men and women, born of the Aymara blood of El Alto, who offered their blood in defense of a fundamental resource of our country, that of democracy."
At a news conference back in the capital on Saturday night, Mr. Mesa repeated his intention to govern for the benefit of the many, though he admitted the odds may be against him.
"The risk one may run is the risk of a total shipwreck," he said, if Bolivia loses "this last opportunity." But he added: "That's the only bet I can place. I have no option other than the one I am taking."

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes North Korea Security Plan to China 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Monday, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush presented President Hu Jintao of China with a new, if still vague, American plan here on Sunday that would provide a five-nation security guarantee to North Korea -- but not a formal nonaggression treaty -- if the North dismantles all of its nuclear weapons programs.
 Mr. Bush's decision to find a way to provide assurances to North Korea -- over the objections of those in his administration who have made it clear that they do not believe the United States should be negotiating with the North at all -- is a subtle but important shift in his approach to the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
 But in one of his longest public discussions of the issue with reporters here on Sunday, Mr. Bush ruled out the main North Korean demand, for a nonaggression treaty with the United States that receives the approval of the Senate, and which could legally bind the United States never to attempt an Iraq-like pre-emptive strike against the North's burgeoning number of nuclear facilities. 
"We will not have a treaty, if that's what you're asking," he said Sunday morning during a meeting with Thailand's prime minister, Taksin Shinawata. "That's off the table." 
But he added that "perhaps there are other ways we can look at" the issue, which administration officials said included a guarantee of North Korean security by the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. 
That is what Mr. Bush talked about on Sunday afternoon with China's new president, and on Monday morning at a breakfast with the South Korean president, Roh Moo Hyun. The administration's relationship with Mr. Roh has been strained as the two nations have differed on the strategy for persuading the North to give up its nuclear program.
The meetings are happening on the fringes of the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where economic development is the ostensible main subject of discussion, but where counterterrorism and North Korea are dominating the agenda. 
Mr. Bush tucked his dealings with North Korea into a busy day that included sightseeing and the designation of Thailand as a "major non-NATO ally" as a reward for its help in tracking down terror suspects.
On Sunday night, Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, were guests at a lavish state dinner, their second in two nights after a stopover in the Philippines on Saturday. Amid the golden throne rooms and elaborate carved Buddha images of the palace grounds, Mr. Bush and his entourage were each served by their own royal butlers, as golden candelabras flickered in one of the last ornate palaces to remind visitors of a long-past age in Southeast Asia. Mr. Bush, hiding his jet lag better than many of his aides, seemed to enjoy the treatment.
The president's decision to talk to China and other nations about a way to give North Korea a nonaggression agreement -- "agreement with a small 'a'," one of his senior aides told reporters Sunday night -- comes almost exactly a year after Mr. Bush's envoys confronted North Korea with evidence that it had been seeking to enrich uranium to make nuclear weapons. For much of the time since, Mr. Bush has refused to budge, saying North Korea created the nuclear tensions and so it must move first to end them. 
At a meeting in late August, representatives of the United States, Japan, Russia, China and South Korea met with North Koreans in Beijing in an attempt to persuade the North to dismantle its nuclear program. But both Washington and Pyongyang dug in, and the meeting ended without a commitment on when or if to meet again.
Not surprisingly, many administration officials insisted on Sunday that Mr. Bush was not changing strategies.
But time has not been on Mr. Bush's side. As the administration has argued internally about whether to negotiate with North Korea or seek to cut off its supplies, American intelligence agencies have warned that the North is strengthening its military nuclear capability. Besides two suspected nuclear weapons it built in 1991, there is evidence, but no proof, that it has recently produced enough plutonium fuel to make an additional one or two weapons. Some intelligence analysts believe that the number could be higher.
"You learn this stuff after the fact," said Gary Samore, an expert on nonproliferation in the Clinton administration who is now at the Institute for Strategic Studies in London. "It's enormously difficult to get real-time information that is reliable." 
But it is real-time information that the administration desperately needs now, so it can measure whether the North is just stallingin order to finish building its arsenal.
Until now, Mr. Bush had vowed repeatedly that he would not give in to what he has often called blackmail from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, by offering the North tangible benefits before it begins dismantling its two active nuclear programs in a way that can be verified.
Both his State Department and many of America's allies have urged a more flexible stance, at least specifying to the North what it might receive if it terminated those programs. 
The essence of Mr. Bush's message on Sunday was that he has now agreed, however reluctantly, that the North's security concerns have to be addressed more seriously. He made the decision at Camp David last weekend, a senior administration official said. If North Korea agreed to accept such a five-nation agreement, the president told Mr. Hu, then it would be under greater pressure not to break that vow, because it would be facing off against China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, in addition to the United States.
That is why Mr. Bush has refused to negotiate alone with the North, and he showed no signs on Sunday of backing away.
"We've seen this movie," one of his top foreign policy advisers told reporters on Sunday night. But two officials acknowledged, in separate interviews, that they believed that Mr. Bush's latest initiative could easily fail. They argued that Mr. Kim, the North's leader, might well decide that the price for an agreement -- scrapping not only its nuclear weapons programs, but also all the weapons it has already developed -- is simply too high. 
"There are a lot of people in the administration who think that the North is bound and determined to plow ahead with its nukes, no matter what," said a senior official in Washington who has joined the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney's office in opposing virtually any meaningful negotiation with North Korea.
But the official saw merit in the president's approach, he said, because if it failed, North Korea's intentions would be evident to all. 
"We could demonstrate to the world that it's time to take more decisive action, from cutting off their oil, to seizing their ships, to having unpleasant things happen to their suspected sites," the official said.

HEADLINE: U.S. SET TO CEDE PART OF CONTROL OVER AID FOR IRAQ 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Under pressure from potential donors, the Bush administration will allow a new agency to determine how to spend billions of dollars in reconstruction assistance for Iraq, administration and international aid officials say. 
 The new agency, to be independent of the American occupation, will be run by the World Bank and the United Nations. They are to announce the change at a donor conference in Madrid later this week. 
 The change effectively establishes some of the international control over Iraq that the United States opposed in the drafting of the United Nations Security Council resolution that passed on Thursday. That resolution referred to two previously established agencies devised to ensure that all aid would be monitored and audited. 
But diplomats say other countries were unwilling to make donations because they saw the United States as an occupying power controlling Iraq's reconstruction and self-rule.
The change, supported by L. Paul Bremer III, the chief occupation administrator in Baghdad, is meant to assure them as his team labors to reconstruct Iraq. The nation's instability continued over the weekend, with two more American soldiers killed in an ambush in Kirkuk. Page A7. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, arriving here on Friday for a conference of Asian leaders, said that after the vote on Thursday, he was "more encouraged and optimistic than I was a week or so ago" about the prospects of raising donations for Iraq at a conference in Madrid next Thursday and Friday. 
European countries are concerned that the Coalition Provisional Authority "is the decision-making authority in Iraq," a World Bank official said. "For political reasons, they don't want their funds to be perceived as being commingled with funds controlled by the C.P.A. They want their own say over how the money is spent."
American reconstruction aid, like the proposed $20 billion that President Bush is struggling to get through Congress, would go to the previously set up entity, the Development Fund for Iraq, which is run by the occupation administrators and the Iraqis. Other resources are to come from Iraqi oil revenues. This fund has given big contracts to American companies like Halliburton and Bechtel. 
But the new agency could open up that process and award contracts through bidding practices open to global companies. Donors could also give directly to Iraq, specifying that their own companies do the work. 
Leading up to Madrid, Japan has committed itself to $5 billion over several years, including $1.5 billion in 2004 and possibly a few more billion dollars in subsequent years. 
The European Union has committed $230 million and Canada about $200 million for 2004. The World Bank is contemplating loans of $500 million in each of the next two years. Rich Arab countries are also being wooed.
In June, when plans for Madrid got started, World Bank and United Nations officials said donors began pressing for an agency outside the control of the occupation. 
At first, the Defense Department, which runs the occupation, resisted handing over financial control of Iraq's rebuilding. Instead, the Pentagon set up the Development Fund for Iraq, which is recognized by a United Nations Security Council resolution in May.
The fund was to work in tandem with another agency, the United Nations' International Advisory and Monitoring Board, which was given auditing functions and no say in spending. That setup, reiterated in the United Nations resolution of Thursday, has proved inadequate to assuage donors.
The administration changed its mind in recent weeks, in part because of the support of Mr. Bremer. 
"We had to act because the international community was stonewalling us on aid," said an administration official. According to the official, Mr. Bremer said, " 'I need the money so bad we have to move off our principled opposition to the international community being in charge.' "
A senior State Department official said the United States would still be consulted in the spending of aid money, for example to avoid duplication of spending.
"The donors all want to have a little bit of distance from us," the official said. "That's fine. But you can't really do much of anything without some coordination with us."
World Bank and United Nations officials said the new reconstruction agency would work closely with the Iraqi ministries set up by the Iraqi Governing Council, the 25-member body picked by the American occupation.
As it is now envisioned, the agency would oversee two new funds, one managed by the World Bank and the other by various United Nations development agencies.
Those funds would oversee spending from international funds in 14 sectors that the World Bank and the United Nations assessed earlier this month as needing $36 billion in assistance over several years. Those sectors included electricity, sewage, water and health programs, from hospitals to smaller community health centers.
The United Nations has in the past set up trust funds for aiding war-ravaged countries that have not yet set up governments. Aid officials said the new fund would be the first that had so many controls to keep it separate from the military forces running the country.
"This is unique for postconflict situations," a United Nations official said. "It's been very complicated to set up a firewall separating the money given to us and the money spent by the C.P.A."
Separate from the $36 billion "needs assessment" for Iraq determined by international agencies, the United States has conducted its own assessment of areas where the American occupation would oversee spending, for example in reconstituting the oil industry and training police and security forces.
The American assessment was for spending $19 billion, bringing the total overall needs to $55 billion. The Bush administration is asking Congress for about $20 billion to contribute to this $55 billion package, and the rest would presumably come from oil revenues, international aid or future American aid packages.
A remaining problem, administration officials and many others said, is that the World Bank and other donors may be reluctant to make loans to Iraq before decisions are made on the $120 billion in outstanding debt it owes to other countries, not to mention the tens of billions of dollars in reparations it owes from its past wars.
In addition, aid could be held up because of the volatile conditions in parts of Iraq.
"Quite simply, we cannot do what we would want to do next year if security does not improve," a United Nations official said.

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer; 
What Alabama's Low-Tax Mania Can Teach the Rest of the Country

BYLINE:  By ADAM COHEN 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala. 

 BODY:
The budget ax is swinging in Alabama, and the carnage is piling up. A hundred and fifty fewer low-income AIDS patients will receive life-saving medicines from the state. Fifteen thousand low-income Alabamians may lose their hypertension drugs. 
 High Hopes, a program that offers after-school tutoring to students who fail the high school graduation exam, is being slashed. And up to 1,500 poor children and adults with Down syndrome, autism and other disabilities will not be able to attend a state-supported special-needs camp. 
 The cuts are reaching down to core government functions. The court system is laying off 500 of 1,600 workers, from clerk's office employees to probation officers. The health department is losing investigators who track tuberculosis, and sharply reducing restaurant inspections. 
Alabama's huge budget gap is a result of the voters' rejection, nearly six weeks ago, of Gov. Bob Riley's tax reform plan, which would have generated an additional $1.2 billion, much of it from undertaxed timberland. After the vote, Governor Riley was forced to cut most state agencies by 18 percent, and other recipients of state funds by 75 percent. Bad as things are, the impact is being blunted by a fortuitous one-time injection of federal funds. Next year agencies are bracing for a 56 percent hit. If the state cannot find more revenue -- and Governor Riley is searching -- it may be nearly impossible for basic services, including courts, prisons and police, to operate.
Alabama's disintegrating government is a problem, certainly, for anyone in the state. But it may also be a harbinger of where the nation is headed. There is a "starve the beast" ethic, currently fashionable among conservatives, holding that the best way to downsize government and end the social safety net is to get voters to demand lower taxes. But before we hurtle any further in that direction, we should think hard about whether we want the whole nation to look like Alabama does this year or, worse, next year.
Alabama is not a wealthy state, but its bigger problem is that it is not making an effort to raise the taxes it needs. It is 48th in the nation in state and local revenue as a percentage of personal income, according to Governing magazine. And it has the nation's least equitable tax system. Alabama's income tax kicks in for families of four earning just $4,600. Its property taxes are the lowest in the nation, Governing reports, and "heavily favor farming interests."
As a Republican congressman, Governor Riley strongly opposed tax increases. But when he took over the state government, he realized it could not run on the revenues coming in. He courageously offered up a tax package that raised the needed revenue while shifting the burden from overtaxed poor people to undertaxed business interests. But the package was defeated by a skeptical electorate, with many of the no votes coming from low-income Alabamians, whose taxes would have gone down.
The voters were not entirely wrong to be skeptical. No budget is free of waste, not even Alabama's meager one. There is a state tradition of legislative pork, patronage controlled by key legislators. And powerful lobbies, notably the teachers' union, have long gotten more than their share of state funds. But Governor Riley has already trimmed much of the pork. And next year, he will no doubt take aim at teacher benefit packages.
It is easy to sell voters on low taxes, and a well-financed campaign by Alabama's business community -- aided, shamefully, by the state Christian Coalition -- did just that. What is harder,but vital right now, is making the more challenging case for why taxes, and sometimes even tax increases, are necessary.
One message Alabama voters needed to hear more clearly was that rejecting higher taxes costs more in the long run. Saving $10,000 by denying medicine to a poor, H.I.V.-positive woman is no bargain if she ends up in a state hospital with full-blown AIDS needing $100,000 in care. Tutoring high school students in danger of failing is cheap compared with paying for welfare -- or prison.
Alabama voters also need to realize that by entrenching their state at the bottom of the national rankings in taxes and government services, they are putting themselves on the margins of the new, global economy, and sabotaging their future tax base. Businesses looking for low taxes and cheap government will pass right over Alabama and head for Mexico. And companies that want well-educated, skilled workers, the companies Alabama needs to attract, will not locate in a state where high school students do not graduate, TB cases are not tracked and the restaurants may be hazardous.
The nation is facing precisely the same issues as Alabama. The Bush administration has tried to delude the public into thinking we can fight a war, rebuild Iraq, fix our schools, get prescription drug benefits and still enjoy the largest tax cut in history. But the deficit cannot grow forever. Eventually, we will have to pay more or, as "starve the beast" proponents hope, do with much less.
Last month, Alabama voted for fewer social services, less education, and a shoddier legal system -- to become, that is, more like a third-world nation. But low as taxes are, the state will never be better at being an underdeveloped country than actual underdeveloped countries are. Alabama's best chance, and the nation's, is to invest in its people and civic institutions, the things that set America apart.
Governor Riley's setback last month is being hailed by national antitax forces as a great victory. But if Alabama heads into next year without additional revenues, students may have to learn without textbooks, prisoners may be released early, and people may start dying of preventable diseases. We should all pay attention, because if the "starve the beast" crowd continues to prevail in Washington, as goes Alabama so may go the nation.

HEADLINE: Chinese President to Consider Methods to Float Exchange Rate 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, under pressure from the United States to revalue his nation's currency, agreed on Sunday that Chinese and American experts would study how Beijing could move toward a floating exchange rate, Bush administration officials said. 
 The administration has maintained that China's currency is undervalued, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage. American manufacturers and members of Congress have blamed a weak Chinese currency for the loss of American jobs and the inability of the economy to create new ones. 
 The study group, which will involve visits by United States Treasury officials to Beijing, was announced after President Bush and Mr. Hu met here at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
The creation of the study group appeared to be a compromise, intended to calm the growing political squall in the United States over the currency issue. 
Earlier in the day, Mr. Hu spoke to a group of international business executives and told them that the virtually fixed exchange rate for the renimbi, the currency, was best for China and best for the world. 
Any move to revalue the currency would have destabilizing effects, and China would resist that course of action, just as it had during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, he said. 
"We will follow the same approach of responsibility to the renimbi exchange rate issue this time," he said. "Keeping the exchange rate of renimbi stable serves China's economic performance and conforms to the requirements of the economic development in the Asia Pacific region and the whole world."
But Mr. Hu did not rule out changes in exchange rate mechanisms as the economy matured.
"We will maintain the basic stability of the renimbi exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level, while further improving the rate-forming mechanism amid deeper financial reform," he said. 
Mr. Hu, who was introduced to the executives by the former United States treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, was warmly greeted by the audience. Many businessmen argue that the Chinese banks are so weak that floating the currency prematurely could lead to a financial crisis. 
"The idea of China revaluing its currency as a panacea to U.S. trade problems is about as loony as the tariffs on steel last year," said Kenneth S. Courtis, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, Asia, after listening to Mr. Hu.
Mr. Courtis said 60 percent of China's exports came from joint venture companies. Overseas investors, including big American companies, had not invested in China to make Chinese exports uncompetitive, he said.

HEADLINE: For Some Latino Music Stations, More Listeners, and More Critics 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
In the latest Arbitron ratings released this month, the Spanish-language radio station known as La Mega, WSKQ-FM (97.9), rose to No. 2 from No. 10 among New York's 40 top stations, reinforcing its reputation as a Latin music and morning talk powerhouse.
 So it figures, some of its listeners are picketing. 
 "Where else do the listeners have such passion for the music that they are willing to protest?" Carey Davis, La Mega's vice president and general manager, asked, almost with delight.
Latinos in the city are indeed not just any audience. At any given time they have only six or seven commercial Spanish-language radio stations to choose from, significantly fewer than English speakers or Latinos in cities like Los Angeles and Miami. Large numbers of them also come from different countries, or were raised bilingually in the United States, and are pining for different music styles that are not always compatible. 
And as the most recent protest against La Mega indicates, they are not shy about showing their displeasure. In pickets and news conferences over the last several weeks, a group of Dominican community leaders, concert producers and musicians have accused the radio station of neglecting merengue, the native rhythm of the Dominican Republic.
"It's not that the music is no good; it's that they don't want to support it," said David Vilma, a salsa and merengue singer who now leads a tropical music fusion group called Pentagrama. "People listen to what the programmer plays."
Officials at La Mega, which is owned by the Miami-based radio chain Spanish Broadcasting System, will concede this much as they begin to talk to the protesters: it is a juggling act to satisfy listeners with tastes that include not only merengue and salsa but rancheras and reggaeton, a relatively new concoction from Puerto Rico that mixes Spanish rap and reggae and that appeals to the growing bilingual youth market.
"Our job is to find the music mix that gives us the highest ratings," Mr. Davis said.
The Arbitron ratings for the summer confirm that La Mega is finding a winning formula in the ever-expanding Latino market. The station's share of the overall market jumped one percentage point to 4.5 percent from 3.5 last spring, positioning the station behind only WLTW-FM, 106.3 (Lite FM) and alongside WQHT-FM, 97.1 (Hot 97), which tied with La Mega for second place.
La Mega's main competitor, WCAA-FM, 105.9 (Latino Mix) ranked 20th, and La Mega's sister station, WPAT-FM, 93.1 (Amor), which plays Latin pop and ballads, ranked 15th.
But while La Mega has been consistently successful -- it was No. 1 overall for a time in 1998 and usually makes the top-five list -- it is also dealing with the vicissitudes of demographic change as the city's Latino population grows more diverse. The term Hispanic, once synonymous with Puerto Ricans, now encompasses larger numbers of Dominicans, Mexicans and American-born, bilingual generations.
La Mega focused on salsa and merengue in the early 1990's to cater to Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, who like both genres. Salsa music, much of it old hits, is still king at La Mega, taking up about 60 percent of the airtime, Mr. Davis said. But less merengue is played now than a few years ago, he said, to accommodate the rising popularity of other music like reggaeton and bachata, a softer Dominican rhythm.
The station's programming changes often because the popularity of genres ebbs and flows based on the music that is being released, Mr. Davis said. Three years ago, the most recent time when merengue was hot, he said, it accounted for 50 percent of the rotation; today it is as low as 30 percent.
"It's our audience that's speaking," he said. "There was no reggaeton three years ago. Now there are clubs all over the place. Bachata didn't have so much of a presence. Now we can do an entire festival."
Regional Mexican music may be next. While WPAT-FM, La Mega's sister station in New York, plays mostly pop and ballads from Mexico, it has been gingerly incorporating into itsprogramming some regional Mexican music, a catchall name for ranchera, norteno, banda and other country styles with roots on both sides of the border for which there is huge demand in Mexican-American areas of the country. Mr. Davis said the growing Mexican population in New York, now the third-largest Latino group after Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, has been noticed.
"Our research and our gut feeling are both saying this pot is boiling," he said. "This Mexican soup is big in New York."
Radio, in particular, faces high expectations because research has shown that Latinos listen to the radio more than their English-language counterparts.
Less than three years ago, another group of dissatisfied musicians, this time in the salsa genre, picketed La Mega's brownstone on West 56th Street, charging that its playlist left out local music, and that the station was denying current and future generations their musical legacy.
Media watchdogs and many listeners also decry the raunchy content of the morning show "El Vacilon de la Manana" ("The Morning Goof-Off"), which some critics call radio pornography, but which is New York's second most popular morning drive show, after Howard Stern on WXRK-FM, 92.3 (K-Rock).
The latest controversy was triggered by the cancellation of a major merengue concert at Madison Square Garden last month because of poor ticket sales. One of the producers, Felix Jerez, president of Globo Entertainment, accused La Mega of barely promoting the concert on the air even though it was one of its sponsors, a charge Mr. Davis rejects.
But Mr. Jerez found allies among community leaders like Nelson Pena, president of the Dominican Parade of New York, and musicians frustrated by the reduced merengue airplay. During a protest this month, some of them said the lack of support in commercial radio has contributed to the closings of nightclubs, the disbanding of music groups and the need for bandleaders who were once full-time to find other work.
Jimmy Bosch, a Puerto Rican trombonist and salsa bandleader from the Bronx who was among the artists who organized against La Mega a few years ago, said that while the station's format "opened up a little" after those protests, it remained closed to most New York-based groups. "What they failed to do was play the music of New York-based international artists," he said. "I have to believe that it's more than quality that they use as a barometer."
Mr. Davis said the station constantly tested new music and selected its playlist by what he called "a balance of art and science" -- the instinct of the programming director and the research that gauges listeners' reaction to a new song. Some merengue performers noted that the local product had suffered lately from vulgar lyrics that may have turned off fans.
"Instead of blaming one station we should analyze what the public wants," said Sandro Martinez, who said his group, Sandro y su Punto Fijo, had been heard on and off on both La Mega and Latino Mix.
Last week, however, there were signs of a willingness to negotiate rather than fight. A protest scheduled for last Tuesday was canceled as some of the protesters met with representatives from La Mega to talk things out.
"They're trying to look for a solution on two points -- to play more local musicians and to support community events," Mr. Jerez said, while not ruling out more pickets.
Mr. Davis, basking in the glow of the latest ratings, made light of the dispute. "It's the family having a little tiff," he said.

HEADLINE: Are Those Leaving Welfare Better Off Now? Yes and No 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
By many measures, the overhaul of welfare has been a success. Seven years after Congress rewrote the rules in an effort to end long-term dependency on benefits, hundreds of thousands of Americans have moved from welfare to work, many of them substantially raising their incomes. Some also credit the new law for a rise in marriage and cohabitation by single mothers and a decline in the teenage pregnancy rate.
 But several recent studies by state governments and urban-policy researchers point to a result that has been less obvious and slower to emerge: a significant number of those who have left the welfare rolls have no jobs, and are sinking deeper into poverty. 
 Since former welfare recipients are difficult to track, and the federal and state governments make only limited efforts to follow them, it is hard to say for sure how many of those who have lost federal cash supports are without other resources. Studies show that many have made up the difference in income with state benefits or help from relatives and friends. 
However, a report released in August by the left-leaning Urban Institute in Washington said that as many as one in seven families who left welfare from 2000 through 2002 had no work, no spousal support and no other government benefits. That is up from one in 10 in a 1999 study.
Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary for families and children in the federal Department of Health and Human Services, said he agreed with numerous estimates that 10 percent to 15 percent of all those who have left welfare since the overhaul legislation passed in 1996 had become significantly worse off financially. There are 2.4 million fewer American families on the federal welfare rolls than in 1996, when there were 4.4 million. 
More than half have left welfare for work, although many who left for jobs did not keep them. Others have gone off welfare voluntarily, possibly because they chafed under the new rules or turned to other sources of support. And roughly a third have been forced out because they failed to comply with stricter state requirements or reached the five-year lifetime limit on federal benefits, although some of these become employed eventually.
While there is broad agreement that some families are worse off as a result, there is extensive debate over exactly why, and what should be done about it. "We are concerned about these families," said Dr. Horn, who is spearheading the Bush administration's current effort to amend the 1996 welfare law in order to stiffen work requirements and encourage marriage.
But, he added, not enough is known about the families. "There is no hard evidence that I know of that such families are less able to work, and we know a small percentage simply choose not to engage in welfare-to-work," he said.
As part of its proposed amendments, the administration wants to require states to compile more complete data on families who join the welfare rolls in the future, in hopes of better understanding those who later drop out.
Dr. Horn said the evidence of poorer families was no reason to soften the federal rules, like the 60-month limit on aid, or penalties for those who do not comply with increased obligations to seek work or receive training. "I am firmly against wholesale loosening of requirements and moving us toward the old program," he said.
But many urban-policy researchers and advocates for the poor -- most of whom opposed the 1996 overhaul -- argue that the deepening poverty among former welfare recipients reflects flaws in the legislation that were entirely predictable and need to be corrected.
They say the people who are losing ground face all sorts of obstacles that keep them from work, many of them easy for welfare bureaucracies to overlook, like learning disabilities, depression, minor illnesses or a lack of transportation. Families with more obvious handicaps are frequently exempted from the work rules under the 1996 law.
"There is clear evidence that these are the most disadvantaged mothers and that they have been made to go through so many hoops they can no longer cope," said Wendell Primus, who was a deputy assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of welfare reform in the Clinton administration. "For this segment of mothers, welfare reform failed. We need to be more concerned about those children. We need to change welfare reform to provide them adequate assistance no matter what."
The extent of the deprivation faced by these families is hard to measure precisely. Some recent studies by states, includingNew Jersey, Utah and South Carolina, show that those who left welfare and had no jobs and no spousal support, the worst-off cases, had lost half of their incomes. They were living on as little as $500 a month, less than half the poverty rate.
Census Bureau figures for 2002 showed the number of people living in severe poverty -- with incomes less than half of the poverty rate -- had grown by 600,000 over the previous year, although the total number in severe poverty was less than in 1996. Researchers say they suspect many of the new severely poor are people who left welfare, because benefits automatically lift families out of this lowest category.
Douglas J. Besharov, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, contends that those lower incomes do not necessarily mean worse living conditions, because poor families often have means of support not detected in income surveys. "Are you better off earning $15,000 but paying rent and all your bills, or are you better off earning $7,000 but living in someone else's house and having them pay the rent, utilities and phone?" he said. "This is not a clear picture."
Whether or not they are actually doing worse, families with no welfare or work report that they feel they are. They are more likely than others who have left welfare to tell researchers that they have missed meals or cannot pay their rent.
Those already tightly pressed say that the loss of even a few hundred dollars a month is deeply felt. Tracy Lawrence, 34, a single mother in Hartford, was cut off from benefits two years ago after she reached her lifetime limit. Ms. Lawrence insists her chronic stomach problems make her too sick to work, but has not been able to provide adequate proof to state authorities to be exempted from the work rules. Welfare was not her only income. She also received and still receives food stamps, gifts from her mother and small child-support payments from the father of her 6-year-old daughter. Perhaps most important, she pays only $77 a month for rent in state housing.
Still, she says life is much harder without the federal check. "I can't buy shampoo or personal care items because they are not covered by food stamps," she said. Clothing is not covered, either, and she said she had been unable to find her daughter a winter coat or snow boots at local charities. She has received a notice of eviction because she is months behind on her rent, and fears her phone will be cut off as well.
The hardest question may be why these people are not working: whether they cannot or will not. There is growing evidence that they are more likely than others to have a long history of unemployment and to report troubles that are considered barriers to getting and keeping a job.
For example, a June 2002 study of families who left welfare and were unemployed in Illinois, done by Mathematica, a policy research firm, found that they reported greater rates of depression, sick children at home and poor health than those who had jobs after leaving welfare. And the study by the Urban Institute found that 44 percent of those without welfare or jobs had not been employed for three years or more. 
While such evidence does not prove that such people are not able to work, it is a fairly good predictor that they will have trouble getting or keeping work even when all other options have run out.
Cynthia Brown of New Haven is feeling that pinch. Ms. Brown, 31, who says she is healthy, has spent most of her life on welfare. "I just came from that," she said with a shrug.
In 2001, Connecticut denied her benefits, saying she had already hit her lifetime limit. Ms. Brown and her three children did not cope well. They lived with an aunt in public housing until she made them leave, fearing the overcrowding would cause her to lose her lease. They lived in a park for a week and then in a homeless shelter for three months, until Ms. Brown obtained subsidized housing and a year's extension on welfare, the last reprieve she will get under state law.
Two months before the extension will expire, Ms. Brown says she is earnestly looking for work but has not found any. She was briefly employed at Yale as a cook, but says she lost the job after her cutting skills were found wanting. Now, she says, her only chance is that something in her life will go so wrong that she will be exempted from the state's rules.
"I am hoping for a disaster," she said.

HEADLINE: Studios Are Killing (Bloodily but Carefully) for an R Rating 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
The color red is making a spectacular showing this fall, at least at the box office. Two violent and blood-soaked films, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," a remake of the 1974 slasher film, and Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Vol. 1," attracted the most moviegoers to theaters last weekend. Both are rated R, and both are illustrations of the lengths to which filmmakers will go to garner that more audience-friendly designation.
 "Chainsaw Massacre," a relentlessly gory tale replete with twitching limbs and splattered brain matter, earned an estimated $29 million in its first weekend, while "Kill Bill," in its second week of release, earned $12.5 million to tally about $43.3 million so far. And while both R-rated films pour on the violence, critics noted that "Chainsaw Massacre" plays it straight while "Kill Bill" takes a stylized approach. 
 Even Jack Valenti, the chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America, which rates movies, seemed blase about the "Kill Bill" deadly fare. Mr. Valenti said that at one point while watching the main character, the Bride, stab, decapitate or cut the limbs off of at least 100 gangsters in a 20-minute sword fight, he said he thought: "Why didn't one of those men take out a gun and just kill her? I think even an impressionable child would go in and say they've seen worse on Wile E. Coyote."
That stylized look was instrumental in making sure that what some critics have called the most violent movie ever made would earn an R rating from the movie industry's ratings board rather than NC-17, which could prove costly at the box office. 
Violence is not the main factor in whether a movie gets an R or an NC-17 rating. "It's bad language and graphic nudity," said Nick Browne, professor of critical studies at the University of California, who studies ratings. 
In fact, though few films get an NC-17 rating, those that do usually have a strong sexual theme. For example, "Kids," released unrated in 1995, was the story of New York teenagers, H.I.V. and sexuality. It was originally given an NC-17 rating. 
These days the reason most filmmakers depend on an R, no matter how violent, is that NC-17 movies are severely limited in how they can be marketed. "I don't think any film made by the American film industry can economically tolerate an NC-17," Mr. Browne said.
An R rating means a child cannot be admitted to a movie without an adult or guardian. An NC-17 rating means no children are admitted. With such a rating, most mainstream newspapers will not run ads. But more important, video stores like Blockbuster will not offer the DVD's on store shelves. And mass-market retail chains like Walmart, where studios can earn as much as 50 percent of a movie's revenue, will not sell them, either.
Russell Schwartz, president of domestic marketing at New Line Cinema, said the studio had to trim "Chainsaw Massacre" twice to get an R rating. In particular, the ratings board was concerned about one graphic scene in Leatherface's lair, where characters die on meat hooks at the hands of the chainsaw-wielding killer. "There was too much impaling," Mr. Schwartz said. Despite that, he said that the movie was equally attended by both men and women and that 75 percent of the audience was under 25. 
Mr. Tarantino said he used several film techniques to ensure that his movie was rated R and not NC-17, including tempering the bloody red with grainy black-and-white film and sequences hand-drawn in cartoonish Japanese anime.
"Black-and-white did make the movie go down easier" with the motion picture association, Mr. Tarantino, who was traveling, said through a spokeswoman when asked about the movie's rating. "Something I've noticed is that when it comes to Americans, it's not so much they have a problem with blood; they have a problem with the color red."
Mr. Tarantino said he intentionally gave each scene a different look to break up the long fight scenes, fearing audiences would grow weary of seeing too much violence.
In the movie's first scene, filmed in black-and-white, the Bride is shot in the head, her body left bloodied. In a later scene, hand-drawn in Japanese anime, a young girl witnesses her parent's execution, then stabs the killers. And when the Bride battles more than 100 gangsters, blood spurts fountainlike out of sliced necks and shoulder sockets.
"I could have taken out the geysers of blood, but that would make the scenes more brutal, make it more violent as opposed to stylized," Mr. Tarantino said.
Mr. Valenti, who spoke on behalf of the motion picture association's rating board, said the violence was cartoonish. "I think the whole thing was fantasy violence," he said. "I think the rating was correct. I didn't see anything to avert my eyes."
Mr. Tarantino, who fashioned "Kill Bill" on spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies, submitted the movie more than once for review by the rating board because the first cut was unacceptable.
"They said to me, 'Quentin, it's too much,' " Mr. Tarantino said. " 'Half of us think it's an R, the other half thinks it's too tough.' So I worked at it again and I brought it back again."
He was not specific about what cuts were made, but Harvey Weinstein, the co-founder of Miramax Films, which financed the film, said in an interview that Mr. Tarantino shaved seconds off certain scenes to get rid of violence deemed to be gratuitous. "As long as it was cartoonish and fun they were fine with it," Mr. Weinstein said.

HEADLINE: A Grim Arab Survey of Rights and Education 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Arab experts issued a report on Monday that finds the Arab world lacking in three areas they deem fundamental to development: freedom of expression, access to knowledge and empowerment of women.
 The group, which was criticized by Arab officials for a similar report last year, said the challenges caused by the deficiencies "may have become even graver." 
 One of the authors, Clovis Maksoud, said he hoped the document would generate debate among Arabs to seek "objective and constructive change from within." Arabs want to take part in decision-making, not "remain marginalized and frustrated," said Dr. Maksoud, a Lebanese professor of international relations at American University in Washington and a former Arab League diplomat. 
The report was commissioned by the United Nations Development Program in Amman. More than 40 Arab scholars contributed, advised by representatives of various United Nations agencies.
The report, covering 21 Arab countries and the Palestinian territories, called for more access to knowledge, focusing on family upbringing, education and the news media. Knowledge can help the region expand human freedoms and become a "powerful driver of economic growth through higher productivity," it said.
The report said illiteracy persisted among women, particularly in less developed nations, and many children lacked access to basic education. Arab media outlets operate "in an environment that sharply restricts freedom of the press and freedom of expression and opinion," while journalists "face illegal harassment, intimidation and even physical threats," the report said. 
The report noted that the Arab region had 18 computers for each 1,000 people, compared with the global average of 78. Fewer than 2 percent of Arabs have Internet access, compared with 79 percent of Americans.
Concerning women's rights, some progress has been achieved but much remains to be done, the report said, praising the representation of women in some Arab parliaments and appointment of others to senior public service posts.
The report also criticized the United States and other nations for making it harder for Arabs to study, live and travel to the West since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE BORDER; 
For G.I.'s in Isolated Town, Unknown Enemy Is Elusive

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: HUSAYBA, Iraq, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Almost six months after the official end of hostilities in Iraq, United States forces are fighting for control of this gritty industrial town of 40,000, a main crossing point into Syria. In the past three weeks, an unidentified enemy deploying ever more sophisticated military tactics and powerful weapons, including mortars and land mines, has been hitting American troops, day and night.
 Last week, dealing a severe setback to the American plan to turn over authority to Iraqis, the police chief was gunned down. On Friday, about 20 armed men took over the police station for more than seven hours and warned that anyone who collaborated with the Americans would be killed. 
 With that, on Saturday, the Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of the First Squadron of the Third Armored Cavalry rolled down the main street, past mostly ramshackle stalls selling eggplant and melons. Several hours later, at 8 p.m., five rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the American tanks and troops now guarding the police station, at the east end of the town, wounding three soldiers.
"There's clearly an organized group of resisters," Lt. Col. Greg Reilly, commander of the squadron, said in his mobile command center at the border crossing with Syria, on the west end of town. On the Syrian side, a life-size mural of President Bashar al-Assad stares across at what had been a similar life-size painting of Saddam Hussein, before it was whitewashed over.
"I cannot control the ground around the police station," Colonel Reilly, an intense, lanky Californian, told his superior over the radio. He said he would need an infantry company to provide more assistance.
"We are not trained to fight a war like this," Colonel Reilly said on Sunday. "We're trained to fight an army face to face, to engage in direct combat, an enemy we can see."
Colonel Reilly, 41, said he was deeply perplexed about the enemy's identity. "I just don't know," he said. But the attackers do not appear to include foreigners, he said.
Based on information the Americans have gleaned from more than 50 men who have been detained, Colonel Reilly said, he believed that many of those firing at the Americans were guns for hire, paid $500. The large phosphate factory outside town, which once employed 3,300 people, is idle, and unemployment is nearly 50 percent, so there are plenty of men desperate for money.
The more experienced anti-American fighters were sent here from other cities in Iraq, Colonel Reilly said. Why they were sent and who sent them remain unclear.
During recent raids, American soldiers have seized manuals on how to fight a protracted war, called the "Iraq Emergency Plan," Colonel Reilly said. He declined to discuss the contents of the manuals. 
Colonel Reilly's men and tanks also patrol 125 miles of the Iraq-Syria border. In three months, he said, they have not intercepted one foreign fighter trying to cross. The only border transgressors, he said, have been Bedouins tending their sheep. "They don't recognize borders," he said.
That is a different view from the one reporters get from American officials in Baghdad. Last week one of Colonel Reilly's helicopters was forced to land after it was hit by small-arms fire. At the regular briefing in Baghdad, a spokesman for the Coalition Authority said it had happened after American soldiers had caught a small group of men trying to cross the border illegally, setting off a firefight.
There was a firefight, Colonel Reilly said, but the men were not crossing the border. It was another attack on the American forces by men inside this town, he said.
"You've got to be on the ground to get the truth," he said.
On Sunday, Colonel Reilly met with the mayor, Raja Nawaf, and a tribal leader, Sheik Sabbam Satam, to tell them he needed their help to restore security. Sheik Satam, in a white robe and head scarf, said everyone was worried because officials and civil servants had been getting threatening messages not to work for the Americans.
It was a struggle for Colonel Reilly to talk with the Iraqis; he had borrowed an interpreter from another unit, and the young Iraqi had considerable difficulty with English.
Colonel Reilly does not have an interpreter. His entire squadron, more than 1,300 soldiers, has only three interpreters, civilians on contract to the Defense Department. Three soldiers in his unit have received Arabic language training, but they work in the intelligence section, not as interpreters. He has hired five local interpreters; two quit after getting threats. On Sunday, as Colonel Reilly's soldiers patrolled the streets, stopping men and searching houses, they had no one with them who could speak Arabic.
The sheik and the mayor, taking notes in spiral notebooks, complained about the policy, imposed by the Coalition Authority, that prohibits former Baath Party members to hold any positions in the new government. That added to unemployment, they said, and failed to recognize that many Iraqis had to join the Baath Party to get decent schooling or a decent job, and that there were degrees of membership.
Because of that policy, many families did not have any of the money they would need for Ramadan, which begins next week. Ramadan is a month of daytime fasting and the offering of alms to the poor.
Sheik Samat asked Colonel Reilly for $100 for each of 300 families.
"Is it doable?" Colonel Reilly asked, turning to his operations officer, Maj. Daniel Dwyer. "I don't want to make a commitment if it's not doable."
"It would be $30,000, sir," Major Dwyer answered.
"Is it legal?" Colonel Reilly asked.
"Yes, sir," the major answered.
Colonel Reilly told the sheik he would provide the money. He said later that he knew it would go to former Baathists, but that did not trouble him. 
The sheik and the mayor expressed appreciation to Colonel Reilly for all that he had done for them -- opened schools and the hospital, restored power -- but said the heavy presence of the American forces was counteracting all that. Sovereignty must be turned over to the Iraqis, Mayor Nawaf said -- not soon, immediately.
Colonel Reilly said that he understood, but that his troops would continue to conduct combat operations in the town.
"When the threat is gone, I will leave," the officer added.

The Iraqis said officials and civil servants had been threatened for working with Americans.; American soldiers search young Iraqis in Husayba, on the Syrian border, and examine stray containers during a sweep through town. The patrols are handicapped by a lack of translators, some of whom are scared away by threats from local militias against Iraqis who help G.I.'s. The U.S. forces face steady attacks; the identity of the attackers is a mystery, but the American commander believes no foreigners are involved.

HEADLINE: Rethinking the Town That Toyota Built; 
As Carmaker Moves Plants Overseas, Its Japanese Base Fears for Its Future

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOYOTA CITY, Japan 

 BODY:
Though the writing on the wall is still faint, to Nobuhiko Narita it is unmistakable: Toyota City and its 350,000 residents are on a collision course with industrial inevitability.
 As director of the city government's industrial and labor policy division, Mr. Narita knows that Japan's motor city has prospered for years because of its namesake, Toyota Motor, Japan's richest corporation. But he also knows that the Japanese auto market is in a long, slow decline and that Toyota Motor must rush overseas to keep growing. 
 Last year, the company earned more than America's Big Three automakers combined. Still, the job market in its hometown peaked a decade ago, and workers can no longer take raises and bonuses for granted. Every year, Toyota Motor builds more cars and buys more parts overseas, and its hundreds of domestic suppliers are having to compete ever harder with foreign rivals, sometimes by cutting prices so low that many cannot make ends meet. Many are quietly closing their doors because their outlook is bleak. 
With the seeds of decay in the city's signature industry now planted, Mr. Narita and local business leaders are doing something they never dreamed would be necessary: Looking to attract new commerce.
"Companies in this city have long been protected by their parent company, Toyota," said Mr. Narita, whose grandfather raised silkworms to supply the textile looms that the Toyota corporation got its start by building. "But they cannot remain under that umbrella in peace and quiet forever."
Toyota's success and its huge presence here have made it a benchmark for corporate Japan in many ways, including the cherished but eroding tradition of lifetime employment as well as efficient modern practices like just-in-time production.
Now, though, Toyota is a leading proponent of "localizing" its production to build cars closer to where they are sold. Last month, the company said it would spend 650 million Canadian dollars ($494 million) to open a production line for Lexus RX 330 sport-utility vehicles in Canada, the first time a model from its luxury Lexus line would be made outside Japan.
Toyota is also expanding rapidly in China, and is opening plants in Poland, in Mexico and in San Antonio. Over the last two decades, the company has spent more than $13 billion building factories in North America alone. But it has not opened an assembly plant in Japan since 1992.
Analysts applaud the strategy of shifting production overseas -- it cuts costs, reduces the company's exposure to shifting exchange rates and helps to ease trade frictions.
The company declined several requests to interview executives about its strategy and its role in Toyota City. Instead, Paul Nolasco, a company spokesman, repeated Toyota's basic stance: "We are a prominent part of the area, but we don't feel we are doing anything extraordinary," he said. "We just try to do what we can do best, which is make cars."
Few doubt Toyota's ability to build cars, or its financial health or long-term goals. But its expansion overseas has given business people here a lot to be nervous about. Toyota built 3.49 million cars and trucks in Japan in 2002, an increase of 3.9 percent from the year before, though still fewer than in 1994. Overseas, it built 2.16 million vehicles last year, twice as many as in 1994.
"They're doing what's natural for a company that needs to compete globally," said Christopher Richter, who covers Toyota for HSBC Securities in Japan. "There's nothing that shows they are going to expand in Japan. If anything, they will move more and more production overseas."
For the moment, Toyota City remains one of Japan's healthiest cities, with robust tax rolls and low unemployment. But uncanny parallels are beginning to emerge with the rusting old car towns of Michigan, which have seen factories flee to nonunion southern states or lower-wage countries.
And though Toyota City has not yet experienced the urban rot that has consumed Detroit -- or for that matter Osaka, where factories are closing and moving to China -- the lessons are not far from people's minds here.
Neither are the woes that befell the towns of Musashi Murayama and Zama, which were hit hard when Nissan Motor closed plants there over the last decade. Mazda, Isuzu and other automakers have also made deep cuts that have hurt nearby communities.
But the symbiosis of Toyota and Toyota City, known as Koromo before 1959, is in a class all its own. Toyota is by far Japan's dominant carmaker, with 43 percent of the domestic market last year, and it built the bulk of its Japanese cars and trucks in the area.
The company's dozen plants in and around Toyota City are expected to keep cranking out cars for years yet, but Mr. Narita and local business leaders are not waiting for them to slow down. They have drafted a 28-point blueprint for industrial survival called V-Plan 2010.
The aim is to attract to this orderly city an hour east of Nagoya new businesses in emerging fields like fuel cell technology and advanced materials that can contribute to Toyota's next generation of vehicles. The city also wants nearby universities and businesses to forge stronger alliances. And it plans to help small parts suppliers acquire new skills to keep up with Toyota's fast pace of innovation.
Of course, transforming a city where 83 percent of the workers are employed one way or another by the auto industry is a huge task, particularly when cities across Japan are trying to attract the same resources with little success. But Mr. Narita and others know that time is not on their side. 
"Right now, Japan's auto industry is doing well and Toyota is profitable," said Shoji Watanabe, chairman of the Toyota Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a former executive at major Toyota supplier. "But there are many layers of parts suppliers, and their condition gets more difficult the lower down the chain you go. The issue is whether they can keep up with the price cuts and technological advances."
Hirofumi Fukatsu is grappling with that question firsthand. His company, Fukatsu Metal Industries, makes mufflers for the Toyota Prado, a compact S.U.V., and the Toyota Harrier, similar to the Lexus RX 300. In good times, salestopped 1 billion yen ($9 million), and Mr. Fukatsu's only factory, a few minutes' drive from Toyota's main headquarters, employed 48 people.
But in the last decade, sales have been fallen by half as his main customer, a larger Toyota parts supplier, demanded that he keep lowering his prices.
Mr. Fukatsu, a burly man with puffy eyes and stooped shoulders, said he could stomach the price cuts if sales were growing. But Toyota has been buying more mufflers elsewhere, a shift that he fears will intensify as Toyota opens more factories overseas.
"I worry that the same nightmare will happen again, because Toyota is building new plants in China, Texas and Mexico," he said in his dusty office above the factory floor, where stamping and polishing machines were screeching one recent Saturday morning.
Unlike Toyota, which has 2.3 trillion yen ($21 billion) in cash and securities, companies like Fukatsu Metal have little margin for error. The company, started by Mr. Fukatsu's father, sells 95 percent of its output to Toyota affiliates. And unlike larger suppliers, Mr. Fukatsu cannot afford to open new factories near Toyota's overseas plants, or invest in new equipment that might make his company more efficient.
So, like many small companies, he has cut his work force in half and hired part-time workers to fill open full-time slots. Mr. Fukatsu also relies increasingly on foreign workers, especially from Brazil. In the rest area near a loading bay, instructions are posted in Japanese and Portuguese.
Though he does not put much stock in the city's grand plans, he has shared ideas with -- and received support from -- an auto parts supplier's association.
Yet these steps, he said, solve only part of the problem. Mr. Fukatsu, who is 55, wants to work another 20 years. But his son is unsure whether he will take over the business, and few outsiders would want to buy a business with shrinking sales. Like many small-business owners around him, Mr. Fukatsu may have to shut his company when he retires.
"Every factory has reached its limit of lowering prices," he said.
At a nearby food cooperative for Toyota employees and their families, shoppers echoed Mr. Fukatsu's concerns. Several customers refused to be quoted by name for fear of offending their employers, but all registered the same unease. Most admired Toyota's prowess and were proud of its success, but said the company would ultimately look out for itself, even if that meant investing less in Japan and more overseas.
"I doubt this calm can continue for another 10 years," said Fumeko Tanaka, 61, who retired after working for a supplier to Toyota for 30 years. "There is less overtime now, employees are unhappy and people who have home loans are in trouble."
While the thousands of workers outside Toyota's gates must ultimately fend for themselves, the 65,500 who are employed directly by Toyota in Japan face different pressures. Last year, for the first time, Toyota refused to raise the base salary of its rank-and-file workers. Though Toyota earned a record profit of 945 billion yen ($8.6 billion) in 2002, the company said falling prices and stiff competition made it difficult to raise wages.
In South Korea or some Western countries, that might have provoked protests. But Toyota's workers, who have not struck since 1953, say they still feel fortunate to have good jobs. Toyota did dole out big summer bonuses this year, but the company can trim the bonus at will, whereas base pay is considered uncuttable. 
The main labor union representing Toyota's workers is in no position to raise a fuss. Unions in Japan are organized by company, not by industry, and are less willing to confront management than Western unions are; and anyway, relative to some other industries, conditions for Toyota workers are still quite good.
But after much hand-wringing, even defenders of the company concede that its heyday in Toyota City has probably passed.
"I don't deny that the work force will shrink," said Shinya Kono, director of the planning division at the Toyota Motor Workers' Union. "Though the number of workers at Toyota has not declined much in the past 10 years, I don't think it will ever increase again."

HEADLINE: Pension Math Proves Elastic In Court Case Over Pilots 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
US Airways said its pilots' pension plan was terminally ill earlier this year, but now the airline is changing the prognosis, in hopes of saving money.
 In February, the airline argued in bankruptcy court that the plan was bleeding it dry and that the only way for the company to survive was to abandon it. The judge agreed, the government took over the plan, and some pilots had their benefits cut. 
 Now the airline is out of bankruptcy but back in court, arguing that the plan was not so very sick after all. If the airline wins this time, the government will receive a smaller equity stake in the airline. That, in turn, will reduce the amount available for the pilots' pensions, and some pilots will lose out again. 
The government says that the pension fund was $2.2 billion short of the amount needed to make good on its promises to the pilots when US Airways shed the plan on March 31. The airline now says that the shortfall then was less than half that amount, perhaps only $890 million or less. The difference in the two figures is primarily because of different interest rate assumptions.
The method that US Airways used to derive the new amount "is not in the mainstream for calculating the value of pension obligations," stated Jeremy Bulow, an economics professor at Stanford University's school of business, in court papers supporting the government's position.
The dispute shows the way pension funds can be made to look sick, healthy or anything in between, depending on how their value is being calculated and for what purpose. 
As pension funds have deteriorated recently, this variability has caused confusion and concern among investors, employees and policy makers about whether companies are reporting their obligations accurately or gaming the numbers to shrink their required contributions.
The US Airways dispute, which will be heard in court next week, may give guidance to Congress, which is debating how best to measure pensions and whether to give companies more latitude.
If US Airways is permitted to use the lower estimate for the plan, some experts say, the precedent could encourage other companies to abandon their pension plans. The outcome could then affect the health of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the struggling agency that insures pension plans in America. 
A decision in favor of US Airways essentially will reward the airline "for underfunding the plan, and will encourage others in similar circumstances to do the same," said Victor Modugno, an actuary, in testimony for the government.
The airline points out that some other companies have been able to reduce their pension obligations in bankruptcy court. 
"Previous court decisions support the company's position on the liability calculation," said David Castelveter, a spokesman for the airline. "Ultimately, the P.B.G.C. could have avoided this claim altogether, had they allowed for the restoration funding plan the company had proposed last fall." That proposal would have allowed the airline to stretch out contributions to its plan over many years.
The central issue in the case is how to measure, in today's dollars, the value of all the pensions that a company must pay its workers in the future. Neither US Airways nor the government is questioning the amount of money the airline had set aside in the pension fund, $1.2 billion.
Measuring the pensions themselves, though, is like walking on shifting sand. Because the pensions will be paid in the future, calculating their value today means making many assumptions about what will happen: what ages the workers will retire, how much their pay will increase and how long they will live, among others. Documents filed in court show that the airline and the government use different assumptions about retirement ages. 
More important, assumptions must also be made about interest rate movements. These rates -- called discount rates -- are factored into pension calculations to express the speed at which the pension fund must compound if workers are to receive all their money in the future. For certain calculations, the discount rate is set by law.
When the rate is low, a company's obligations to its workers look very large. Now that rates are very low, companies have been urging Congress to permit them to use higher rates, at least temporarily. If Congress agrees, their pension obligations will look smaller, and companies will not have to set aside as much money today.
The US Airways case shows the power of these assumptions. 
Last winter, when it became apparent that the airline could not emerge from bankruptcy without defaulting on the pilots' pensions, the government made calculations using the rate required by law when plans are terminated. That interest is based on a rate used by life insurance companies for obligations similar to pensions known as group annuities. Last March, the rate was 5.1 percent. 
The pension agency concluded that the total value of the pensions owed the pilots was $3.4 billion.
Because the pension fund held assets of $1.2 billion, that left a $2.2 billion shortfall, the agency said. It made a claim for that amount on US Airways' stock after reorganization. (The pension agency routinely asserts such claims as an unsecured creditor in bankruptcies.) The airline intends to set aside 10 percent of its new stock to settle the claims of unsecured creditors.
But US Airways is asking the court for permission to calculate the pensions without using a standard discount rate. Instead, it wants to adopt a rate linked to market performance, something it calls the "prudent investor rate." In its court documents, the airline defines this as "the rate of return achievable by a reasonable, prudent, long-term pension fund portfolio investor." 
The airline does not specify a number, but points to the 12 percent returns achieved by the pension agency's own investment portfolio from 1985 through 2002, a period that encompassed a tremendous bull market in stocks and bonds. The airline argues that the prudent investor rate should be closer to 12 percent than to the 5.1 percent used by the agency. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned companies that if they use a rate higher than 9 percent to estimate returns on pension assets, they will have to demonstrate that it is justified. Earlier this year, the commission challenged General Mills' assumption of 9.6 percent.
US Airways' actuarial firm, Towers Perrin, submitted several calculations showing what the obligations to the pilots would be in a range of rates. At 8 percent, for example, the total value of the pilots' pensions is just $2.1 billion -- significantly less than the $3.4 billion calculated by the government. With $1.2 billion in assets set aside, that would leave the pilots' pension plan with a shortfall of only about $900 million.
The airline argues that the government is trying to exaggerate the pension deficit to receive "a windfall."
The agency responds that it does not keep the money from companies that default on pension plans; most is used to increase payments to retirees. The agency's insurance has limits that are well below what the pilots were promised before the airline ran into trouble. The agency says it will use about 75 percent of what it recovers from the airline -- whether $2.2 billion or $900 million or something else -- to bring some pilots closer to the pensions they were originally promised. 
The agency uses complicated rules to settle which beneficiaries receive how much additional coverage. Each person's age is a factor, and in the US Airways case, pilots who were at least 53 years old when the plan failed may have their payments raised above the government's limits. Exactly how many pilots qualify for an increase is not clear, but hundreds are likely to be affected. 
The amount of the increase depends on how much the agency is able to collect from the airline. The agency's claim of $2.2 billion is about half of the total claimed by all unsecured creditors. So, if the unsecured creditors ultimately get stock worth $60 million, the agency will receive about half, or $30 million. 
The agency would then dedicate 75 percent of that amount, or $22.5 million, to restoring some of the older pilots' lost benefits. 
Under the airline's figures, the $900 million owed the government would represent a little less than one-fourth of the total unsecured claims. So if the creditors get $60 million, the agency would get less than a quarter of it, or $15 million. It would then use 75 percent of the money, or about $11 million, to raise benefits for qualifying pilots.

HEADLINE: Listening to Mahathir 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"The Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million. But today the Jews rule this world by proxy: They get others to fight and die for them." So said Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia, at an Islamic summit meeting last week. The White House promptly denounced his "hate-filled remarks."
 Indeed, those remarks were inexcusable. But they were also calculated -- for Mr. Mahathir is a cagey politician, who is neither ignorant nor foolish. And to understand why he made those remarks is to realize how badly things are going for U.S. foreign policy. 
 The fact is that Mr. Mahathir, though guilty of serious abuses of power, is in many ways about as forward-looking a Muslim leader as we're likely to find. And Malaysia is the kind of success story we wish we saw more of: an impressive record of economic growth, rising education levels and general modernization in a nation with a Muslim majority. 
It's worth reading the rest of last week's speech, beyond the offensive 28 words. Most of it is criticism directed at other Muslims, clerics in particular. Mr. Mahathir castigates "interpreters of Islam who taught that acquisition of knowledge by Muslims meant only the study of Islamic theology." Thanks to these interpreters, "the study of science, medicine, etc. was discouraged. Intellectually the Muslims began to regress." A lot of the speech sounds as if it had been written by Bernard Lewis, author of "What Went Wrong," the best-selling book about the Islamic decline.
So what's with the anti-Semitism? Almost surely it's part of Mr. Mahathir's domestic balancing act, something I learned about the last time he talked like this, during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. 
At that time, rather than accept the austerity programs recommended by the U.S. government and the I.M.F., he loudly blamed machinations by Western speculators, and imposed temporary controls on the outflow of capital -- a step denounced by all but a handful of Western economists. As it turned out, his economic strategy was right: Malaysia suffered a shallower slump and achieved a quicker recovery than its neighbors.
What became clear watching Mr. Mahathir back then was that his strident rhetoric was actually part of a delicate balancing act aimed at domestic politics. Malaysia has a Muslim, ethnically Malay, majority, but its business drive comes mainly from an ethnic Chinese minority. To keep the economy growing, Mr. Mahathir must allow the Chinese minority to prosper, but to ward off ethnic tensions he must throw favors, real and rhetorical, to the Malays. 
Part of that balancing act involves reserving good jobs for Malay workers and giving special business opportunities to Malay entrepreneurs. One reason Mr. Mahathir was so adamantly against I.M.F. austerity plans was that he feared that they would disrupt the carefully managed cronyism that holds his system together. When times are tough, Mr. Mahathir also throws the Muslim majority rhetorical red meat.
And that's what he was doing last week. Not long ago Washington was talking about Malaysia as an important partner in the war on terror. Now Mr. Mahathir thinks that to cover his domestic flank, he must insert hateful words into a speech mainly about Muslim reform. That tells you, more accurately than any poll, just how strong the rising tide of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism among Muslims in Southeast Asia has become. Thanks to its war in Iraq and its unconditional support for Ariel Sharon, Washington has squandered post-9/11 sympathy and brought relations with the Muslim world to a new low.
And bear in mind that Mr. Mahathir's remarks were written before the world learned about the views of Lt. Gen. William "My God Is Bigger Than Yours" Boykin. By making it clear that he sees nothing wrong with giving an important post in the war on terror to someone who believes, and says openly, that Allah is a false idol -- General Boykin denies that's what he meant, but his denial was implausible even by current standards -- Donald Rumsfeld has gone a long way toward confirming the Muslim world's worst fears.
Somewhere in Pakistan Osama bin Laden must be enjoying this. The war on terror didn't have to be perceived as a war on Islam, but we seem to be doing our best to make it look that way.

HEADLINE: Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Richard Sarkis and David Kinsley were juniors at Williams College, surfing the net for a cheap source for their economics textbook, when they discovered a little known economic fact: the very same college textbooks used in the United States sell for half price -- or less -- in England. 
 Just like prescription drugs, textbooks cost far less overseas than they do in the United States. The publishing industry defends its pricing policies, saying that foreign sales would be impossible if book prices were not pegged to local market conditions. 
 But many Americans do not see it that way. The National Association of College Stores has written to all the leading publishers asking them to end a practice they see as an unfair to American students. 
"We think it's frightening, and it's wrong, that the same American textbooks our stores buy here for $100 can be shipped in from some other country for $50," said Laura Nakoneczny, a spokeswoman for the association. "It represents price-gouging of the American public generally and college students in particular." 
But thanks to the Internet, more and more individual students and college bookstores are starting to order textbooks from abroad -- and a few entrepreneurs, including Mr. Sarkis and his friends, have begun what are essentially arbitrage businesses to exploit the price differentials. 
"We couldn't understand why what costs $120 here should cost $50-something there," said Mr. Sarkis, who, with Mr. Kinsley and another classmate, has spent three years building a Web-based company, BookCentral.com, selling textbooks from abroad to students in the United States. "It seemed so sleazy of the publishers. We were sure that college students would be shocked and outraged if they knew about the foreign prices. But it's been this big secret." 
That is changing, though. To the despair of the textbook publishers who are still trying to block such sales, the reimporting of American texts from overseas has become far easier in recent years, thanks both to Internet sites that offer instant access to foreign book prices, and to a 1998 Supreme Court ruling that federal copyright law does not protect American manufacturers from having the products they arranged to sell overseas at a discount shipped back for sale in the United States. 
Before the Supreme Court decision, Americans could not take advantage of the discounts abroad without violating the copyright law.
Now, however, "gray market" sales are taking off on campuses. 
At one prestigious university, a sophomore imported 30 biology books from England this fall and sold them outside his classroom for less than the campus-bookstore price, netting a $1,200 profit. Next semester, if all goes well, he plans to expand the operation. 
"The only difference is that they say 'international edition' in little print on the cover," said the student, who added that he was not certain whether his project raised any legal issues, and therefore asked that neither he nor his college be identified. 
At other colleges, Asian students have banded together to take advantage of textbook prices in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, which are even lower than those in Europe. 
Many students, individually, have begun to compare the textbook prices posted on American sites like Amazon.com, with the lower prices for the same books on foreign sites like Amazon.co.uk. 
The differences are often significant: "Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Third Edition," for example, lists for $146.15 on the American Amazon site, but can be had for $63.48, plus $8.05 shipping, from the British one. And "Linear System Theory and Design, Third Edition" is $110 in the United States, but $41.76, or $49.81 with shipping, in Britain. 
Many college bookstores, meanwhile, have taken matters into their own hands, arranging their own overseas purchases. 
"I buy from Amazon.co.uk and from sources in the Far East, and I knew more and more students were doing the same thing, individually," said Tom Frey, owner of the University Bookstore at Purdue University, who sells the new books from overseas at the same price as a used American book. "Then this fall, for the first time, the Fed Ex man told me that the students at the Indian Association here at Purdue had just gotten a delivery of 14 skids of books, about 50 books each, from India. I think I'm losing about 10 percent of my sales to overseas books." 
Relations between textbook publishers and college booksellers have been seriously roiled by the issue.
"This has become a very hot issue since last year, when it just seemed to explode all of a sudden," said Ms. Nakoneczny, of the college store association. The association's letter to the publishers warned that the pricing structure might be an antitrust violation. "The sale of identical books to foreign buyers at prices significantly lower than to domestic buyers, while publicly stating that domestic prices are due to high costs, could constitute an unfair or deceptive act," the letter said. While there is no longer protection in the federal copyright law for the pricing differentials, the major publishers are still trying to stop the reimporting of texts priced for foreign markets, mostly through contract language forbidding foreign wholesalers to sell to American distributors. Some have placed stickers on covers, saying "International Edition RESTRICTED Not for Sale in North America" or added the cover line "International Student Edition." 
None of the three major textbook publishers -- Pearson, McGraw Hill, and Thomson -- would discuss why overseas prices are so much lower than domestic ones, referring all questions to Allen Adler, the lawyer for the American Association of Publishers. 
"This is a season when textbook publishers get kicked around a lot, and they're feeling vulnerable," Mr. Adler said. "The practice of selling U.S. products abroad at prices keyed to the local market is longstanding. It's not unusual, it doesn't violate public policy and it's certainly not illegal. But publishers are still coming to terms with the dramatic change in the law."
Mr. Adler contends that foreign textbook prices are pegged to the per capita income and economic conditions of the destination countries -- and that foreign sales are a boon to America's standing in the world, to foreign students seeking an American-quality education, and even to American consumers, since each extra copy sold overseas, even at a low price, helps to spread the high costs of putting out a new textbook.
As more and more customers turn to reimporting books, it is an open question how long the overseas price differentials will last. 
"We buy from the U.K., France, Israel and the Far East," said Bob Crabb of the University of Minnesota Bookstores. "As long as the publishers are offering books at less than half the price that's available here, we'll take advantage of it. It's great for students. For publishers, the marginal costs of printing a few extra books and selling them overseas are very, very low. But I would guess that shortly, the sales here will begin eating into their U.S. sales in a serious way." 
Disgruntlement over textbook costs has been growing in the United States as prices have risen. Last month, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, announced that the average New York college freshman and sophomore spends more than $900 a year on texts -- 41 percent more than in 1998 -- and proposed a plan to make $1,000 of textbook costs tax deductible. The same week, University of Wisconsin students demonstrated against high textbook prices and in favor of creating a textbook rental system. 
To be sure, textbook costs, however high, are only the final straw for American college students, whose tuition costs and fees have been rising rapidly. At Williams and other elite universities, for example, tuition, room and board now tops $35,000 a year. In Britain, though, the cost of tuition is largely borne by the government and students pay much less.
For example, tuition alone for undergraduates at Harvard is currently $26,066 a year as compared with $1,840 at Oxford University.
In the United States, one in five students does not buy all the required texts. And more and more, like Mr. Sarkis and Mr. Kinsley, are willing to go to great lengths for a cheaper alternative. "I got mad when I found out that our labor economics book was something like $90," said Mr. Kinsley, who, like Mr. Sarkis, graduated in 2001. "I didn't think I would read $90 worth in it, so I was determined to find something cheaper, and I spent five hours searching on the Web."
Mr. Sarkis said Williams's campus bookstore made the high costs all too visible. "They really rubbed it in," he said. "If you were the highest spender of the day, they'd ring this little bell and say they had a new winner, and give you a lollipop. I got the lollipop twice."

HEADLINE: In Mongolia, a Tilt Toward a Free Market 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE and JARGAL BYAMBASUREN 

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia 

 BODY:
Mongolia, once a remote Soviet satellite, is rapidly becoming a country hailed by investors for its openness to foreign capital and ideas -- not to mention its proximity to Asia's big play, China.
 Perhaps nothing better symbolizes the new free-market tilt of this economy than the snappy white baseball caps with the bold green logo of the XAAN Bank. Once a stodgy government-run institution known as the Ag Bank, it has been rebranded and privatized, and now uses its initials, which sound like the Khan in Genghis Khan. 
 The bank's managers are Americans; the Japanese owner works out of his skyscraper in Tokyo; and most of the Mongolian employees live in gers, the traditional circular felt homes of the steppes. 
 In addition to dreaming up Mongolia-friendly marketing campaigns, the American managers in three years have doubled the bank's deposits, to $40 million; doubled the employees, to 1,650; increased the branch network by 40 percent, to 371; and turned a money loser into a moneymaker.
 "Ag Bank went bankrupt twice during the 1990's," the chief operating officer, Ben Turnbull, said in the downtown headquarters. Nearby, in the office of the chief executive, J. Peter Morrow, a wall was adorned with a framed copy of a World Bank review that called the bank "irreparably damaged."
 The turnaround and privatization of what was once Mongolia's largest government-run bank is part of a larger picture.
 "In three to five years, I plan to open Ag Bank branches in China and Japan," the bank's new owner, Hideo Sawada, said in an interview in his 12th-floor office in the chic Shibuya district of Tokyo. Mr. Sawada also owns Japan's second-largest travel business, the H.I.S. Company, and is chairman of Japan's fourth-largest airline, the Skymark Airlines Company. 
 He said that he expected Japanese tourists to flock soon to Mongolia, a nation nearly four times the size of California with only 2.5 million people.
 He is confident that Mongolian officials will agree to his suggestion that visa requirements be dropped for Japanese tourists, and he said he planned to push package tours next spring through his 200 travel agencies around Japan. In May, direct flights started from Tokyo, four hours by jet.
 "Mongolia is in the process of moving from socialism to capitalism, there are many opportunities, there are many companies being privatized," Mr. Sawada said. In April, he beat a Japanese group and a Russian group, paying $6.9 million for the Mongolian bank. Mr. Sawada has agreed to inject an additional $13 million into the bank. In December, a consortium from Connecticut and Switzerland won a bidding war to buy the Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia, then the country's largest government-owned bank. The consortium, Gerald Metals of Stamford, Conn., and Banca Commerciale Lugano of Switzerland, paid $12.23 million to the Mongolian government for its 76 percent ownership in the bank. They also agreed to invest an additional $28 million over the next two years. An ING Bank unit is providing management and technical aid.
 "There are a lot of opportunities in Mongolia these days," said Jim Dwyer, an investment banker who moved from New York to help Mongolia's government with the bank privatizations.
 Over the next two years, the government would like to privatize the national airline, MIAT; the nation's largest insurance company, Mongol Daatgal; the largest cashmere producer, Gobi JSC; the largest petroleum importer, NIC; and the last government bank, the Savings Bank, which has the most branches here in the capital, home to 40 percent of the population.
 One potential buyer, Mohammed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods department store, explored investment possibilities on a three-day visit in mid-October. The owner of Harrods Minerals Mongolia, a major prospecting company, Mr. Al-Fayed told officials that he is considering expanding into cashmere and manufacturing.
 In a measure of Mongolia's trust in foreign expertise, the government three years ago handed management of Ag Bank to the United States Agency for International Development, which contracted the turnaround work to Development Alternatives Inc., a Washington consulting firm.
 When the Americans arrived three years ago, most of Ag Bank's rural branches did not have electricity. Today many still do not have power, but branch managers follow a modern strategy for making money: denying loans demanded for political reasons and establishing credit responsibility among borrowers. Loans are tied to cash flows, often cashmere shearing or slaughter of livestock. Failure to pay means seizure of collateral, generally livestock in a country where nomadic herders make up a third of the population.
 After losing money for four years, Ag Bank turned a profit in 2001. Last year, pretax profits more than doubled, hitting $2.9 million. The number of customers recently reached 500,000. The delinquency rate has fallen below 1 percent.
 With a high level of education and an openness to outside ideas, Mongolians are snapping up financial products.
 "In financial services, we are unburdened by checks and plastic, and will go straight to cellphone- and Internet-based banking," Mr. Morrow predicted at an investor conference here.
 With the percentage of Mongolians with bank accounts jumping to about 33 percent from 5 percent five years ago, the deposits have been used to help fuel the economy. Total bank deposits increased by nearly 50 percent a year in 2001 and 2002.
 Today, building cranes dot the skyline of this sprawling low-slung city. After growing by 3.9 percent last year, Mongolia's economy is expected to grow 5 percent this year.
 "When you go around Ulan Bator you see how much construction activity there is here, and you wonder where the money is coming from," Mr. Turnbull said, looking out his office window at the construction, which started with his block on Peace Avenue. 
 Speaking of an economy where banks now overwhelmingly play a capitalist role, he said, "There is a lot of unofficial savings from outside the country that is coming back in, and there is a lot of investment from around the country coming into" the city.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Resume Their Climb, Though Caution Is Heard

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as solid results from companies like Lexmark International spurred expectations for strong third-quarter earnings this week, the busiest of the reporting season.
 Stocks were nearly unchanged most of the session as investors sifted through the day's earnings reports and awaited more reports on the outlook for next year. Late in the session, stock prices moved higher. 
 Share indexes have risen notably in the last few months and last week, except for a pullback on Friday, the three principal stock market indexes reached levels not seen since early 2002 on the back of generally strong corporate earnings and optimistic expectations. Some investors, though, are growing concerned that much of the positive news has already been priced in. 
 Yesterday, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.15 points, or 0.58 percent, to 9,777.94. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.36 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,044.68. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index advanced 12.78 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,925.14.
 Volume was moderate with 1.18 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, down from 1.35 billion on Friday. Advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbered those declining by a margin of almost 4 to 3.
 The calendar of economic data reports this week is light, leaving the focus on corporate earnings. Roughly one-third of the S.& P. 500 companies are to issue financial results by Friday.
 In trading yesterday, Lexmark surged $6.75, or 10 percent, to $74. The company said third-quarter earnings rose as revenue climbed 11 percent, impelled by strong sales of inkjet and laser printers and refills of ink. Lexmark forecast a larger profit this quarter than analysts' estimates.
 Citigroup declined 24 cents, to $48.14. The company, a Dow component and parent of the largest American bank, said its third-quarter profit rose 20 percent to a record high, helped by higher investment banking, retail banking and credit card revenue, and fewer loan defaults. But analysts said Citigroup's revenue growth had been disappointing compared with the second quarter's.
 Another Dow component, 3M, advanced $1.43, or 1.9 percent, to $75.48, after it posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings as a result of the weaker dollar and strong sales in the Asia-Pacific region.
 Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings tumbled $4.78, or nearly 24 percent, to $15.19. It said the Food and Drug Administration was requiring more clinical trials before any approval of two painkiller medicines.
 The shares of another drug maker, Pozen, plunged $5.83, or 32.8 percent, to $11.94. Pozen and Xcel Pharmaceuticals said regulators rejected their request to market an experimental drug for migraines because it failed to relieve certain symptoms.
 In currency trading, the dollar edged down against the euro, was also lower in relation to the British pound, but rose against the yen.
 On the bond market, United States Treasury prices were mixed yesterday. 
 Government officials played down comments by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow regarding higher interest rates, substantially neutralizing the effect of his words on debt markets overnight.
 Earlier, hedge funds sold shares on Mr. Snow's remarks, which were reported yesterday in The Times of London: "Higher interest rates are an indicator of a strengthening economy. I'd be frustrated and concerned if there were not some upward movement in rates."
 Investors seemed to welcome an observation by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., that the recovery still faced significant weaknesses. Mr. Broaddus also said the sluggish job market posed the main risk to consumer spending. 
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained 2/32, to 98 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.38 percent from 4.39 percent on Friday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.767	99.487	High Rate	0.920	1.015	Investment Rate	0.939	1.037	Low Rate	0.890	0.980	Median Rate	0.910	1.005	Total applied for	$42,127,183	$42,051,488	Accepted	$22,941,007	$23,071,664	Noncompetitive	$1,353,206	$1,029,532	

Both issues are dated Oct. 23, 2003. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 22, 2004, and the six-month bills mature on April 22, 2004.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Improvement in Bottom Lines Pumping Up Investors' Hopes

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
After a long nightmare on Wall Street, the latest profit figures from corporate America have been the stuff of investors' dreams. 
 Corporate earnings are set to have their best quarter since the spring of 2000, with initial estimates of a 21 percent jump over last year's third quarter. Strong consumer spending, a weakening dollar and further cost- cutting all helped to improve the bottom line for companies that have already reported for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30. 
 Intel's earnings more than doubled for the period. Merrill Lynch's profit rose 50 percent. Citigroup reported a 20 percent rise in third-quarter earnings, while 3M posted a 22 percent increase. Apple Computer recorded a profit of $44 million after a loss of $45 million a year earlier. Delta Air Lines cut its quarterly loss nearly in half. 
Whether this earnings performance can push the stock market much higher after its eight-month rally is open to question, in part because analysts expect earnings growth to be only about half as strong in the first three quarters of next year. That uncertainty, however, is not stopping investors, with many of them seeming to be responding to earnings forecasts by buying stocks in the same speculative way they did at the end of the 1990's.
Shares of the chip maker National Semiconductor, for example, are up 157 percent so far this year, based on investors' expectations of a turnaround. The company did report a spectacular percentage increase in earnings for the quarter -- but mainly because its profit, 18 cents a share, looked so good compared with the mere penny a share it had made a year earlier. 
"There are some pretty heroic assumptions in some of those stock prices," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, a money manager in New York. 
The strong corporate profits are being reported as the economy appears to have had its strongest quarter of growth in almost three years, spurred in part by the tax cuts earlier this year. When government data are released later this month, economists are expecting to see growth in the gross domestic product near 6 percent for the third quarter, and they are forecasting strong, if slightly slower, growth for the remaining three months of the year. 
Among corporations, the pleasant earnings surprises are outstripping disappointments by a big margin. According to data compiled by the research firm Thomson First Call, the total profit for the 163 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that have reported so far is 7.4 percent above analysts' forecasts. 
That is two and a half times the average gap in the last eight years, according to First Call, which tracks earnings results and Wall Street forecasts. Standard & Poor's is predicting that almost 70 percent of the 500 companies in its index will show earnings increases this quarter.
And the earnings growth is expected to continue, although the growth rate is expected to slow next year. The consensus earnings forecast for the fourth quarter is for growth of 22.5 percent over last year's comparable period, followed by 12 to 13 percent growth during the first three quarters of 2004, according to First Call.
"You have a lot of reasons to believe that earnings can continue to grow," said William E. Rhodes, the chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston. A sign that the trend is moving in the right direction, he said, is that as of Oct. 17 revenues for the companies in the S.& P. 500 were up 1 percent in the last year, while profit margins grew by one percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
Some analysts caution that investor exuberance may be racing too far ahead of the earnings fundamentals, noting that the profit surge is unbalanced. About two-thirds of the increase so far comes from the financial services and energy industries. The utilities and telecommunications sectors are actually showing small declines. 
And there are potentially misleading anomalies, like the numbers for Lucent Technologies, the big telecommunications equipment maker, which has not reported a profit in years. Thomson's forecast of 21 percent corporate earnings growth, when all the quarter's reports are in, is distorted somewhat by many analysts' decision this year to begin assessing Lucent by using generally accepted accounting practices, rather than the so-called pro forma basis employed by some companies to make their financial performance look better. 
The change has the effect of making Lucent's third-quarter 2002 loss $3 billion, instead of the $2 billion that analysts calculated at the time. And so, if Lucent meets the forecast for this year's third quarter by reporting a loss of only $150 million, the year-over-year improvement will look substantially better than under the old accounting method.
Without Lucent's accounting-adjusted comeback, the corporate earnings growth for the S.& P. 500 companies in the third quarter would be 17.6 percent, instead of 21 percent, according to Chuck Hill, the research director at First Call.
Even at companies reporting actual profit growth, some executives are still wary about the outlook. "We are not looking at the U.S. and saying, 'The good times are here,' " said Andy D. Bryant, the chief financial officer at Intel. "There are signs, but there is certainly no overwhelming rush" to increase corporate spending on technology, he said.
In many cases, investors seem to be buying stocks more on earnings expectations than earnings performance. "If they do not come through, the stocks are going to go nowhere or get pummeled," said Ms. Clayman of New Amsterdam Partners. 
Caterpillar's earnings rose nicely in the first and second quarters, for example, with jumps of 61 percent and 98 percent, respectively, and the stock was up 72 percent through Oct. 15. But when Caterpillar reported on Oct. 16 that its profit growth for 2004 would be less than many analysts had forecast, the stock fell 5.6 percent that day and has since slipped further. 
Companies with poor earnings but robust forecasts for the future, in contrast, have done quite well. "Nobody really cares about what happened to earnings before," Mr. Rhodes said. "They care about what is going to happen to earnings."
That seems to apply to many technology stocks, which in addition to suffering from weak earnings in recent years were also among the biggest losers in the market sell-off. So a lot of investors snapped them up at very low prices.
Apple fits this category. The longstanding forecast of an earnings turnaround in the third quarter had helped the stock rally all year, despite losses in the first and second quarters. As a result, the stock was up 73.2 percent for the year just before Apple reported its earnings last week. It has fallen 6.4 percent since its report, in which the company said it expected its earnings for the current quarter to increase only slightly.
"The market buys the companies positioned for the highest earnings growth and for accelerating earnings," said John P. Waterman, the chief investment officer of Rittenhouse Asset Management in Radnor, Pa. But he warned that "unless you believe there is a lot more upside, they have probably seen their best quarters" in terms of stock performance.
And investors have tended to yawn over companies that have had solid earnings during the three-year market downturn. One is Johnson & Johnson, which reported earnings increases of 17 percent in the first and second quarters and is expected to show 19 percent growth for the third quarter; its stock is down 5.7 percent so far this year. 
Investors have done better with Procter & Gamble, which has had steady earnings over the last five years. It reported profit growth in the first two quarters this year and is expected to have a 12 percent rise for the third quarter. But Procter's stock is up just 11.7 percent while the S.& P. 500 index is up 18.7 percent for the year.
The earnings surge, when Lucent is not included, is being led by financial and energy companies, followed by technology businesses. First Call is forecasting a rise of 26 percent this quarter for the entire financial industry when all the numbers are in. The earnings spurt in the energy sector is slowing -- but only relatively -- after a surge of 180 percent in the first quarter. Second-quarter earnings growth was 41 percent, and First Call is projecting a 46 percent rise in energy sector earnings this quarter.
In the technology companies among the S.& P. 500, again not counting Lucent, First Call is forecasting a 24 percent rise in earnings for the last three months. On the down side, earnings at utilities are expected to fall 6 percent, while the profits of telecommunications companies are forecast to drop 2 percent.
Mr. Hill of First Call estimates that the decline of the dollar, which fell 1.2 percent against the euro in the third quarter, is adding about two percentage points to overall earnings growth for S.& P. 500 companies, as it makes the products of United States companies more marketable overseas. In this year's first two quarters, the weakening dollar added about three percentage points to earnings growth.
Although the dollar has been relatively steady in these first weeks of the fourth quarter, it could help spur profits yet again if its decline resumes, as some analysts are predicting. 
But Mr. Hill said he did not think that the consumer, without the benefit of more tax cuts, can continue spending at the pace of the third quarter. That is why he and others expect earnings growth to slow next year. 
Mr. Hill warns that investors could be setting themselves up for a fall. "People are going to look at the third- and fourth-quarter results and boost their earnings expectations," he said, "and set us up for a market correction."

HEADLINE: Grumbling Trickles Down From Reagan Biopic; 
Some See Peril to Presidential Legacy From TV Movie Coming Next Month

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
When it comes to their entertainment shows, the major broadcast networks tend to shy away from political controversy, lest they offend viewers, sponsors or congressmen with sway over federal regulators.
 Next month, however, CBS will buck that convention with "The Reagans," a two-part mini-series that steps squarely into the spirited -- and often partisan -- debate over President Ronald Reagan's legacy. 
 As snippets about the television movie circulate in Washington and Los Angeles, friends and relatives of the ailing Mr. Reagan are expressing growing concern that this deconstruction of his presidency is shot through a liberal lens, exaggerating his foibles and giving short shrift to his accomplishments. 
That the part of Mr. Reagan is played by James Brolin, who is married to the conservative bete noire Barbra Streisand and who makes no secret of his own liberal politics, only intensifies their fears. 
"I fully expect this mini-series will be largely unfavorable to my dad," Michael Reagan, a radio talk-show host who reaches two million people each week, wrote recently in a column posted on various Web sites. He added, "Hollywood has been hijacked by the liberal left."
Marlin Fitzwater, who was the White House press secretary for two of Mr. Reagan's eight years in office, asked rhetorically in an interview: "Does it show he had the longest and strongest recovery in postwar history? That the economy, stimulated by the tax cuts, was creating something like 200,000 jobs a month, for years?"
In many ways the film follows the standard television biopic formula, sensationalizing the more controversial moments of the subject's life. But given that the main subject is a Republican hero, one who is now suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the events chosen for depiction -- and those left out -- are sure to come under harsh scrutiny from Mr. Reagan's supporters, who are increasingly protective of his reputation and already suspicious of Hollywood.
"The Reagans," according to the final version of the script obtained by The New York Times, does give Mr. Reagan most of the credit for ending the cold war and paints him as an exceptionally gifted politician and a moral man who stuck to his beliefs, often against his advisers' urgings.
But there is no mention of the economic recovery or the creation of wealth during his administration, key accomplishments to his supporters. Nor does it show him delivering the nation from the malaise of the Jimmy Carter years, as his supporters say he did. 
The details the producers do choose to stress -- like Mr. Reagan's moments of forgetfulness, his supposed opinions on AIDS and gays, his laissez-faire handling of his staff members -- often carry a disapproving tone.
Nancy Reagan, who is played by Judy Davis, does not get light treatment either. While the script portrays Mrs. Reagan as a loyal and protective wife, it also shows her as a control addict, who set the president's schedule based on her astrologer's advice and who had significant influence over White House personnel and policy decisions.
CBS officials and the filmmakers said the mini-series would ultimately be judged as fair when it is shown on Nov. 16 and 18. They said they were simply trying to tell a historically accurate story that included the good along with the ugly, all from respected biographies and other source material. "This was very important for me, to document everything and give a very fair point of view," said Leslie Moonves, the CBS chairman.
The film's producers, Neil Meron and Craig Zadan -- who have done a number of successful made-for-television movies including those about Judy Garland and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis -- said no major event was depicted without at least two confirming sources, though they said they took dramatic liberty in some spots. the film was approved by lawyers at CBS and the main production studio, Sony Pictures Television.
"It's not painted in black and white," Mr. Zadan said, "but in blacks, whites and grays, many variations of gray."
The plot begins tamely enough. A dashing Ronald Reagan, recently divorced from Jane Wyman and the president of the Screen Actor's Guild, is introduced to a young Nancy Davis by the director Mervyn LeRoy and quickly falls in love. There are a number of admiring scenes, including those showing Mr. Reagan rebuffing his advisers to push ahead with negotiations with the Soviets and others depicting him as a devoted husband. And the movie accepts his assertion that he knew nothing of the illegal diversion of funds to the contras fighting in Nicaragua.
"The Reagans" takes sides on plenty of issues and incidents that are vigorously contested by biographers, and some that are historically questionable. In one early scene Mr. Reagan's talent agent, Lew Wasserman, tells him that his anti-Communist activism is hurting his career. "People know you're an informer for the blacklist," Mr. Wasserman says. Mr. Reagan replies, "I've never called anybody a Commie who wasn't a Commie."
Mr. Reagan was long suspected of supplying names to the Hollywood blacklist but denied it. F.B.I. records show he cooperated with agents investigating communism in Hollywood, but historians disagree about whether his assistance was of any real significance.
The script also accuses Mr. Reagan not only of showing no interest in addressing the AIDS crisis, but of asserting that the patients of AIDS essentially deserved their disease. During a scene in which his wife pleads with him to help people battling AIDS, Mr. Reagan says resolutely, "They that live in sin shall die in sin" and refuses to discuss the issue further.
Lou Cannon, who has written several biographies about Mr. Reagan, said such a portrayal was unfair. "Reagan is not intolerant," he said. "He was a bit asleep at the switch, but that's not fair to have him say something that Patrick Buchanan would say." 
Elizabeth Egloff, a playwright who wrote the final version of the script, acknowledged there was no evidence such a conversation took place. But, she said, "we know he ducked the issue over and over again, and we know she was the one who got him to deal with it." She added that other biographies noted that Mr. Reagan had trouble squaring homosexuality with the Bible. In "Dutch," Mr. Reagan's authorized biography, the author, Edmund Morris, writes that Mr. Reagan once said of AIDS, "Maybe the Lord brought down this plague," because "illicit sex is against the Ten Commandments."
Another likely controversial moment in the television movie comes in a scene that implies strongly that President Reagan's inspiration for the Star Wars space-based system was a 1940 movie in which he starred, "Murder in the Air." Some experts have said that the film may have influenced Mr. Reagan's decision to sign off on the program. Others have dismissed such claims as overemphasized by liberals.
Mrs. Reagan, meanwhile, comes across in the script as her husband's protector, constantly fending off ambitious and amoral political operatives. But in depicting the control she exerted, not only over his schedule but over more substantive decisions, the television movie makes some controversial claims.
The final shooting script heavily implies that Mrs. Reagan, in agitating for the resignation of Alexander M. Haig Jr., President Reagan's first secretary of state, went so far as to write his resignation letter. But no account holds that Mrs. Reagan wrote such a letter. After a consultation in response to a reporter's question, the filmmakers decided last week to remove that scene from the film, saying they would have deleted it in any case.
Mrs. Reagan's associates said she was most likely to be upset about scenes in which she is shown keeping her children at arm's length and those in which she takes prescription pills, as detailed in "The Way I See It," the memoir of the Reagans' daughter, Patti Davis.
Mrs. Reagan had no comment for this article. John Barletta, a former Secret Service agent who served the Reagans and maintains contact with Mrs. Reagan, said he had spoken with her about the film. "She kind of said, 'Well, hopefully it won't be that bad,' " he said.
He said he had his own concerns about the film because "when it comes to the Hollywood people, they're all very liberal against him."
Mr. Zadan and Mr. Meron, acknowledge their liberal politics, as do the stars of the television movie, Mr. Brolin and Ms. Davis. But Mr. Meron, said: "This is not a vendetta, this is not revenge. It is about telling a good story in our honest sort of way. We all believe it's a story that should be told."
Nonetheless some involved in the making of "The Reagans" said in interviews that they were girding for a considerable outcry from some of Mr. Reagan's more die-hard supporters.
"With the climate that has been in America since Sept. 11, it appears, from the outside anyway, to not be quite as open a society as it used to be," Ms. Davis said during an interview at her hotel in Montreal. "By open, I mean as free in terms of a critical atmosphere, and that sort of ugly specter of patriotism."
She added, "If this film can help create a bit more questioning in the public about the direction America has been going in since the 1970's, I guess then I think it will be doing a service."
Mr. Brolin said he, too, hoped that the film would prompt Americans to be more suspect of their leaders. "We're in such a pickle right now in our nation," he said, "that maybe if learn something from this."
Mr. Morris, Mr. Reagan's biographer, said he had some misgivings about the mini-series, given the political leanings of the producers and actors.
"The provenance of the movie makes me suspect it will not be fair," he said. But he added that it could also work as a reality check on Mr. Reagan's record.
"The best thing one can say about a movie of this kind," he said, "is it does redress or counteract the sentimentalities that are being perpetrated all of the time in his name by his fanatical followers."

HEADLINE: Shop of Horrors 

BYLINE:  By Elizabeth A. Cole; Elizabeth A. Cole is a senior program officer at the Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs.

 BODY:
Anyone looking closely at the $20.3 billion Iraqi reconstruction package that the Bush administration sent to Congress may have been surprised by an item near the end with a comparatively modest price tag: a museum of Baathist crimes, $1 million. What was this doing on a list that included police training and the rebuilding of infrastructure? 
 The proposed museum is the brainchild of Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi dissident who fled in 1968 and was prominent in calling for the recent American-led invasion. Mr. Makiya has received permission from the occupation authorities to construct a museum that will house, among other items, a collection of state documents on the torture and executions ordered during the three decades of the Baathist regime. The $1 million that the administration asked for is only seed money; Mr. Makiya has said he will need to raise $9 million more to get the project under way and much more to see it to completion. 
 On the face of it, Mr. Makiya's vision of a site for truth and commemoration -- modeled on the Holocaust Museum in Washington and similar efforts in South Africa and Cambodia -- seems commendable. But in a fragmented society like postwar Iraq, deciding on the "truth" about the old regime will not be easy. Not everyone in Iraq, for instance, agrees that all the country's woes were the product of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule; instead some point to the damage done by 13 years of economic sanctions. Nor does it seem likely that everyone would agree that Mr. Makiya, an exile backed by an occupying power, is the right person to spearhead the nation's truth-seeking effort.
Numerous studies have shown that reconciliation -- the repairing of deeply damaged relations between nations, peoples or faiths -- can begin only when peace and stability have been achieved. Once the right conditions are in place, a nation can begin to debate its past. Countries acquainted with difficult transitions can provide expertise on the traditional tools of reconciliation, from the establishment of truth commissions (South Africa and Guatemala) to the creation of documentation centers (Cambodia) on the years of violence. 
But in the end, only one group -- in this case, the Iraqis who suffered -- can decide, through public deliberation, which narratives of the past to emphasize, whose voices get to be heard, how responsibility should be assigned, and how much time is needed to gain perspective on the old regime's crimes. 
In the early days of reconstruction, might Iraq in fact be better off focusing on its distant rather than recent past? An effort to restore the looted Iraq National Museum, with its wealth of ancient treasures attesting to the region's glory days, might do more to create a sense of national pride and belonging than an atrocity museum, with all of its potential to divide rather than unify.

HEADLINE: Deficit Doubles but Falls Short of Forecast 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
The federal budget deficit more than doubled to $374 billion in the fiscal year that just ended, but the Bush administration took heart that the shortfall was less than it had predicted a few months ago.
 The latest numbers were not a surprise, because administration officials and the Congressional Budget Office had both noted an unexpected rise in corporate tax revenues in September, the final month of the 2003 fiscal year. 
 The deficit is $81 billion lower than the $455 billion gap that White House budget officials predicted in July. In a statement with the new results, Joshua B. Bolten, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, called the improvement "an encouraging sign that our economy is gaining momentum." 
The deficit was equal to about 3.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Though high, that is still a much lower ratio than under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, when the figure hit 6 percent.
But Mr. Bolten cautioned that the deficit was still likely to exceed $500 billion in the 2004 fiscal year. Meanwhile, critics of the Bush administration said the government was on track to run up trillions of dollars in new debt over the next 10 years.
"This is not a cyclical problem we have," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan policy group that campaigns for stricter fiscal discipline. "What Congress needs to focus on is the series of spending and tax policies we're putting in place for the long term."
Mr. Bixby noted that analysts at the Congressional Budget Office and outside the federal government all assumed that the economic growth would recover and remain fairly strong over the next decade.
Federal tax revenues have fallen three years in a row, coming in far worse than expected even after government forecasters tried to anticipate the impact of a weak economy.
That was true in the 2003 fiscal year as well, when tax revenues were nearly $100 billion lower than in 2002 and government spending climbed by $156 billion, largely as a result of costs of the war in Iraq.
But for the first time in about three years, the Treasury Department said tax revenues in the past several months came in $26 billion higher than expected in July.

 BODY:
 Senator John Kerry, who bills himself as the strongest champion of the environment in the Democratic presidential field, issued a six-point plan today calling for "environmental empowerment zones" and a "toxics task force" to ensure that federal money is spent on the highest-priority cleanup projects. 
 Speaking at the University of New Hampshire, Mr. Kerry also said he would enter into a "conservation covenant" by using royalties from drilling and mining on public lands for preservation, and require that the long-term economic and environmental effects be studied before new deals to extract resources from public lands were made.

HEADLINE: Trying Diplomacy on North Korea 

 BODY:
President Bush is now taking a wiser and more sophisticated approach to the crisis caused by North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons. In a proposal whose details are still being refined, Washington and four other nations would guarantee not to attack the North in exchange for its commitment to dismantle its nuclear weapons programs. 
 This proposal makes an eventual peaceful, diplomatic solution to this extremely dangerous problem somewhat more likely. Just how likely is impossible to tell because there is no assurance that North Korea's highly unpredictable leaders will agree to disarm. If the North does spurn this reasonable offer, Washington will find it easier to persuade Asian nations to support more coercive steps, like international economic sanctions. 
 North Korea's nuclear programs are particularly alarming because the nation has a long history of selling advanced weapons to all who will pay for them, including other rogue states and perhaps terrorists. Yet in the past year, as the North has raced ahead with reprocessing plutonium into bomb fuel, Washington has handicapped its own efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution by refusing to specify what America would be willing to do if the North firmly committed to giving up its nuclear weapons ambitions in ways outsiders could reliably verify. 
The White House had insisted that specifying any such quid pro quo would be giving in to North Korean nuclear blackmail. Blackmail is a fair description of North Korea's behavior. But in a situation in which everyone agrees that military action against the North would have catastrophic consequences for hundreds of thousands of innocent South Koreans and Japanese, Washington's principled stand poorly served American interests.
With this proposal, Mr. Bush is now making a serious effort to revive negotiations and is personally seeking the support of his fellow leaders at the Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Bangkok. All four of the nations that would join Washington in the proposed security guarantee -- China, Japan, Russia and South Korea -- are represented there. Washington's new approach deserves strong support from each of them. 
In offering security guarantees to the North, Mr. Bush wisely overruled hawkish administration officials who preferred moving directly toward coercive economic and military steps. This initiative comes less than a week after the administration's skilled diplomacy won unanimous backing for a United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq that broadly endorsed Washington's policies there. Diplomacy is an important tool for advancing America's national security. It is good to see it coming back into fashion in the Bush White House.

HEADLINE: Farmers and Labor Press Global Trade as a Campaign Issue 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: CHURDAN, Iowa 

 BODY:
When unions go on strike here, local farmers usually show up at picket lines with hogs and fresh produce to make sure the workers' families have food on their tables.
 And when farmers were suffering through the 1980 agricultural crisis, union members rolled up their sleeves to help raise pressure for higher crop prices. 
 But it has taken a shared fury about international trade rules to bring together farmers and unions in a rare coalition over a single issue, one they are elevating to the top of the agendas of both the Republican president and his Democratic challengers as they court voters in the runup to the Jan. 19 caucuses here.
Unions and farmers who are members of the new Iowa Fair Trade Coalition object to rules that they say are weighted to favor large corporations. They criticize changes in the trade rules for going beyond merely lowering tariffs to include protections for corporations that threaten national laws covering the environment, access to inexpensive medicine and labor standards. 
George Naylor, the president of the National Family Farm Coalition, said the new trade rules made it difficult to maintain a family. Mr. Naylor's ancestors came here to Greene County in 1880 and he continues to farm the family's 470 acres, nearly finished with a harvest of feed corn and emerald-green soybeans. 
"Trade is a much bigger issue now that we've seen how corporations are benefiting from these trade laws, not family farmers," he said. "We don't want to give up all we've worked for simply to help big agribusinesses be more competitive."
One indication of how sensitive trade has become as a political issue was a decision by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, a strong proponent of global trade, to bypass Iowa's caucus vote.
And to the dismay of Democratic centrists, the leading candidates here so far -- Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor -- have made the fairness of international trade rules a central theme of their stump speeches. 
Mr. Dean criticizes what he calls "one-sided pro-business free trade agreements" for failing to include labor and environmental standards.
"If it is O.K. for General Motors to move to Mexico and open a plant, it is O.K. for the United Auto Workers to organize that plant," he said. 
Those positions are also held by Mr. Gephardt, who has long opposed free trade. In his speech, he has included Iowa's farmers in a list of victims of free trade. 
This worries Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative during the Clinton administration. Democratic candidates, she said, should not confuse President Bush's handling of the economy with complaints about trade. Democrats since President Franklin D. Roosevelt, she said, have been committed to global trade.
"We Americans talk a good game about wanting to alleviate poverty in the world but when we have to ante up and open our borders to trade, Americans flip out," she said. "What they don't realize is that no country has benefited more from free trade than the United States."
Opponents of free trade say it is not correct to characterize them as ignorant of the facts. Mark Smith, president of the Iowa Federation of Labor, said, "it's the terms of trade that are devastating, not trade itself."
"But we're called Luddites and protectionists if we bring up that unfairness," he said.
How trade plays out in Iowa could determine the debate in other crucial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
Unions, farmers and a growing number of politicians charge that unfair international trade rules have caused the elimination of thousands of manufacturing jobs, the erosion of small towns and the consolidation of big agribusinesses that are wiping out the nation's smaller farms. 
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said that, with the loss of 2.7 million jobs over the last three years, people were understandably anxious that further trade openings would affect their jobs and their salaries.
"We pay short shrift to their concerns," he said. "We lecture and say they have to make adjustments and everyone will be better off in the long run, but that's not true in the United States or in developing nations. Not everyone is better off. And in many developing nations no one is better off." 
Brother David Andrews, director of the National Catholic Rural Life Conference, which is based in Des Moines, said that the effect of trade -- especially the North America Free Trade Agreement -- had so unsettled rural America that the country's Roman Catholic bishops planned to issue a call for action on trade next month.
The bishops, he said, will discuss not only the effect on American farmers but also on Mexicans who have lost their farms since the passage of Nafta and fled to the United States, often as illegal immigrants. In Iowa, they have dangerous, lower-paid jobs in packing plants as well as seasonal field work.
"The effect of opening up agricultural trade has been huge and devastating in the countryside here and in Mexico," Brother Andrews said.

HEADLINE: Rescuing The Democrats 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BROOKS; E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEWTON, Iowa 

 BODY:
In the current issue of The Weekly Standard, Fred Barnes argues that we have seen the birth of a Republican majority. In 1992, Barnes points out, Republicans held 176 House seats. Today, they hold 229. In 1992, the G.O.P. controlled 8 state legislatures; now it controls 21. In 1992, there were 18 Republican governors; now there are 27.
 But the really eye-popping change is in party identification. In Franklin Roosevelt's administration, 49 percent of voters said they were Democrats. But that number has been dropping ever since, and now roughly 32 percent of voters say they are. As Mark Penn, a former Clinton pollster, has observed, "In terms of the percentage of voters who identify themselves as Democrats, the Democratic Party is currently in its weakest position since the dawn of the New Deal." 
 The Democratic presidential candidates wending their way through Iowa, New Hampshire and the other primary states are offering theories about the party's decline, and what can be done about it. 
Howard Dean argues that the Democratic Party has lost its soul. If it returns to its true fighting self, instead of compromising with Republicans, it will energize new and otherwise disenchanted voters. 
Dick Gephardt argues that the party has lost touch with the economic interests of working men and women. Instead of offering bread-and-butter benefits to lower-middle-class workers, it endorses free trade policies that destroy job security.
Joe Lieberman argues that the party has become too liberal and too secular. It has lost touch with the values of the great American middle. 
John Edwards has the most persuasive theory. He argues that most voters do not place candidates on a neat left-right continuum. But they are really good at sensing who shares their values. They are really good at knowing who respects them and who doesn't. Edwards's theory is that the Democrats' besetting sin over the past few decades has been snobbery.
Edwards came by this outlook autobiographically. On the campaign trail, Edwards will mention -- every five minutes or so -- that his father worked in a textile mill and his mother retired from the post office. He didn't grow up poor. But he does say that his parents were not treated with the respect and dignity they deserved.
Edwards's father rose to become a mill supervisor, but with only a high school degree, he was perpetually underestimated by the college grads around him. Edwards seems to have been raised by folks who know what it feels like to be condescended to.
His campaign is based on the argument that the Democrats need to nominate a person from Middle America, not from the coastal educated class. "My campaign is a different Democratic campaign," Edwards said in his announcement speech. "Not only will I run for the real America, I will run in the real America. . . . Democrats too often act like rural America is just someplace to fly over between a fund-raiser in Manhattan and a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills." 
Edwards draws an implicit contrast between himself and Howard Dean and John Kerry by pointing out that he worked for everything he has. He loaded trucks to pay for college. "It didn't hurt me at all," he says.
He draws an explicit contrast with George Bush, arguing that the Bush administration rewards wealth and punishes work. This is not about economics, he says; it's about values. The Bush administration disrespects working Americans. It lowers taxes for people who sit around the pool and collect capital gains, while shifting the burden to people who wake up early, work hard and hope to get rich. 
Obviously Edwards's campaign has not caught fire. (Although it is far too early to count him out. One thing I learned last week in Iowa is that voters are far more interested in Gephardt, Kerry and Edwards than we in the national media.) But that doesn't mean Edwards's theory is wrong, or that Democratic primary voters accurately understand their plight. When I interviewed people during the 2000 campaign I found many voters preferred Democratic policies to Republican ones. But they didn't trust Al Gore because they thought he looked down on them. They felt Bush could come to their barbershop and fit right in.
Except for Bill Clinton, Democrats have nominated presidential candidates who try to figure out Middle American values by reading the polls, instead of feeling them in their gut. If they do it again, the long, slow slide will continue.

HEADLINE: A New Auditorium With Larger Goals 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Los Angeles, a city of suburbs in search of a center, on Monday came one step closer to finding one. 
 The shimmering stainless steel Walt Disney Concert Hall opened Monday morning, a 16-year project designed not only to transform the cultural landscape of the city but also to be the cornerstone for the creation of a downtown area that already shows signs of reinventing itself. 
 "We never had a downtown," Richard J. Riordan, the former mayor who played an important role in reviving the once near-dead Disney Hall, said before the ceremony. "We finally have one now. And Disney Hall is a symbol of that." 
Gloria Molina, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents a swath of the city that includes downtown, said: "We're not like New York or Boston or Chicago. We've never had a downtown night life like most cities; we've never had a 24-hour city. This Disney Hall will finally make it happen."
Whether a single building, however grandiose, can transform downtown Los Angeles is an open question.
But Monday, as a harsh sun glowed on the swooping curves of the building, designed by Frank Gehry to look faintly like a ship with its sail at full mast, speakers like Gray Davis, the departing governor, and Eli Broad, the billionaire businessman and philanthropist who played a significant role in the creation of Disney Hall, made it plain that they viewed it not merely as another dazzling building but as a symbol of Los Angeles itself.
"This is one of the great days in Los Angeles history," said Zev Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor. "Generations will benefit from this hall for years to come."
Mr. Broad said the hall, coupled with a planned $1.25 billion downtown development, which includes residences, movie theaters, parks and shops, would finally give Los Angeles a city center.
People from the west side do not go to the east side and people from the San Fernando Valley do not go downtown, Mr. Broad said. "Now we can all unite in the center." 
The opening of the hall, an undulating expanse on a 3.6 acre arts complex at Grand Avenue and First Street, came at the start of a week of gala performances by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in honor of its new home, a $274 million project that almost fell apart in the 1990's and was salvaged at the last moment by city and county officials, wealthy donors, the Disney family and Mr. Gehry, who lives in Santa Monica.
Mr. Gehry, speaking to a crowd of several hundred in front of the hall, said the building was "kind of a flower" to Lillian Disney, Walt Disney's widow, who gave $50 million in 1987 for its creation. Mrs. Disney, who died in 1997 at the age of 98, adored gardens and flowers. With a laugh, Mr. Gehry said that when Mrs. Disney first saw his modernistic design for the building, "She nearly went into cardiac arrest." But the Disney family remained advocates for Mr. Gehry even when the project almost dissolved.
The hall itself, unfurling at the top of Bunker Hill, has already slowed and stopped traffic. Like no other building in Los Angeles, it is seen, perhaps quixotically, as a symbol of the city's new downtown, now drab by day and somewhat lifeless at night. But downtown has shown signs in the last year of vibrancy that has never been seen before, with new residences proliferating.
At this point, the concert hall is the centerpiece of a neighborhood that is the closest thing to a cultural enclave that Los Angeles has. It is only yards away from the Ahmanson Theater, the Mark Taper Forum and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Nearby is another new landmark, the modernist Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, designed by the Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo. Steps away is the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Colburn School of Performing Arts.
"We have more theaters, more museums and more universities and colleges than New York City," Mr. Broad said. "And we now have great architecture." He said the hall would "join the Eiffel Tower, the Parliament in London and the Sydney Opera House as one of the most photographed buildings in the world."
The building, opening to a crescendo of publicity, encases 293,000 square feet of interior space. Sunlight plays on the building, altering its shades of color. Mr. Gehry, a weekend sailor, who has said he loves "the movement of sails in the wind," once compared Disney Hall to "a strange kind of sailing ship sitting in a box," and likened the auditorium to a dazzling ceremonial barge. 
The 2,265-seat main auditorium, which was designed with the acousticians Yasuhisa Toyota and Minoru Nagata, is surprisingly informal with boldly covered upholstery and carpets with flowery designs, a tribute to Mrs. Disney.
Her daughter, Diane Disney Miller, said before the ribbon-cutting ceremony: "The more I look at the hall, the more I realize it's not a lofty structure at all. It's sort of hunkered down there." Ms. Miller said that with her father's name on the building the hall would be a welcoming place. "The hope in our minds, and Frank's mind, was to take away any sense of elitism. We want it to be a populist hall for the people. We want to demystify the reputation, the perception of symphonic music."
The hall will be the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which since 1964 has played across the street at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, an auditorium with poor acoustics. 
Today, speakers alluded to the long years of waiting before Disney Hall was completed.
Lillian Disney donated the $50 million at the urging of her daughters. The Disneys had long attended classical music concerts at the Chandler Pavilion, and the acoustics led Mrs. Disney to make the contribution to build the hall on what was empty land. Mr. Gehry was selected from a field of 72 international competitors. 
The project was initially set to cost $110 million and open in 1997. But by the mid-1990's, construction was halted by the county of Los Angeles, which threatened to declare the project in default. As costs skyrocketed, as the city was beset by an earthquake, a race riot, a recession as well as bureaucratic bungling of the project and mismanagement, the project seemed doomed to turn into a grandiose failure. 
At that point, Ms. Molina and Mr. Yaroslavsky went to Mayor Riordan and asked him to help raise money. Mr. Yaroslavsky said that he and Ms. Molina had sought out Mr. Riordan not so much because he was mayor but because, as a wealthy businessman, he had numerous contacts in what Mr. Yaroslavsky termed "the billionaire world."
Mr. Riordan went to his friend Mr. Broad, the city's top power broker. Allowing the Disney Hall project to fall apart, Mr. Broad said later, "would mean a black eye for the city" and display to the nation that Los Angeles was unable to create a first-rate concert hall. Mr. Broad began a fund-raising effort with Andrea Van de Kamp, the chairwoman of the Music Center at the time.
The Disney Foundation donated $25 million. Roy E. Disney, a nephew of Walt Disney and a top Disney executive, donated $5 million. Until then, longstanding tensions in the Disney family had kept Mr. Disney from contributing to the hall, said people involved in the negotiations. At that point, the Walt Disney Company also contributed $25 million.
Money from the wealthy Hollywood community was largely missing from the Disney Hall's donors, partly because studios were loath to contribute to a concert hall with the name of a prime competitor. 
Deborah Borda, executive director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said that the mood was nothing less than exuberant as the opening neared. The other night, one of the first free concerts was held for hundreds of construction workers and their families. As the music director of the Philharmonic, Esa-Pekka Salonen, a boyish figure at 45, stepped onto the podium, he put on a hard hat and bowed to the crowd. "They just went crazy," Ms. Borda said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the opening of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles mistakenly attributed a comment in some copies about the hall's symbolism. It was Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, not former Mayor Richard Riordan, who said, "It's about possibility, it's about dynamism, it's about movement, it's about optimism, it's about upward mobility."

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Sees a Jobs Boom, But Most Don't 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Expressing a confidence that goes well beyond the projections of many economists, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has predicted that the American economy will add two million new jobs before next year's elections.
 In an interview with The Times of London on Monday, Mr. Snow predicted that the economy would grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent over the next year and add about 200,000 jobs a month. 
 "I would stake my reputation on employment growth happening before Christmas," Mr. Snow said in the interview, which a spokesman confirmed as accurate. 
"Everything we know about economics indicates that the sort of economic growth expected for the next year, 3.8 to 4 percent, will translate into two million new jobs from the third quarter of this year to the third quarter of next year," Mr. Snow elaborated. "That's an average of about 200,000 new jobs a month."
In offering such confident and explicit predictions about job growth, Mr. Snow went well beyond the general cheerfulness that President Bush and administration officials have repeated for some time.
But Mr. Snow's could come back to haunt him if job growth continues to be lackluster for much of the next year. Most economists, from those at the Federal Reserve to those on Wall Street, agree that economic growth has already accelerated sharply, but many are skeptical that the job picture will improve much by the time Mr. Bush faces re-election next November.
"We are surprised that Snow would choose to hand the Democratic presidential candidates this optimistic prediction, instead of managing expectations more conservatively," Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on Monday.
 Mr. Snow also provoked surprise in the financial markets by asserting, in the same interview, that he expected interest rates to rise. "Higher interest rates are an indicia of a strengthening economy," Mr. Snow said. "I'd be frustrated and concerned if there was not some upward movement in rates."
 To some, that sounded like a pronouncement about how the Federal Reserve should conduct monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has said it plans to keep short-term rates at the current low levels for "a considerable period of time."
 But Rob Nichols, Mr. Snow's spokesman, said the Treasury secretary was not commenting about Fed policy. Rather, he said, Mr. Snow was merely observing that long-term interest rates tend to rise as economic growth accelerates.
 Mr. Snow's boast about job growth could cause heartburn for him and for President Bush if it does not materialize, because Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates would almost certainly accuse Mr. Bush of failing to make good.
 Since Mr. Bush took office, the economy has shed about 2.7 million jobs -- most of them in manufacturing and many in politically important swing states like Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 Acutely aware that his father was defeated for re-election in large part because of the country's economic woes in 1992, Mr. Bush pressed Congress to pass a $350 billion tax-cut package this year and promoted it as a "jobs and growth" plan. 
 Faced with a choice between cutting taxes and letting the budget deficit climb to record highs -- $374 billion in 2003 and probably above $500 billion in 2004 -- Mr. Bush sided firmly with cutting taxes.
 Though the tax cuts do appear to have fired up the economy over the last few months, with some economists estimating that the gross domestic product roared ahead at an annual rate of 6 percent to 7 percent in the third quarter, job growth remains anemic at best.
 Last month, for the first time in a long time, the government reported that the nation had added about 57,000 jobs. 
 But most economists, including those at the Fed and many in the private sector, predict that job growth will remain modest and that unemployment will remain near 6 percent.
 The reason for such caution is that companies have been increasing productivity at an annual rate of well above 4 percent for much of this year. If the economy really were to start generating 200,000 jobs a month, it would have to grow by at least 4 percent throughout the next year and productivity growth would have to slow.
 "The risk of being wrong on at least one of these counts seems dangerously high from a political perspective," wrote Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs.
 White House officials take a different view. N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a recent interview that both the economy and the labor market were capable of growing more rapidly than conventional wisdom would suggest.

HEADLINE: Argentina and Brazil Align To Fight U.S. Trade Policy 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
A left-leaning statement of intent signed in Buenos Aires last week by the presidents of Argentina and Brazil might have been short on economic specifics, but it did send a clear message: the South American neighbors will resist efforts by the United States to undermine their unity in regional and global trade talks.
 The joint message will not go unnoticed in Washington, particularly with negotiators at the World Trade Organization in Geneva scrambling to salvage what they can from the wreckage of the recent Cancun summit and the United States hoping that a meeting next month in Miami will edge the Western Hemisphere closer to agreement on a free-trade zone stretching from Alaska to Antarctica that is supposed to be in place by January 2005. 
 Using increasingly stern language, diplomats from the United States have blamed Brazil for the collapse at Cancun, saying it was too obdurate in championing the demands of developing countries for an end to farm subsidies in developed countries.
 After the Cancun talks, the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, called Brazil the leader of the "won't do" countries and warned that America could opt to strike bilateral deals with "can do" nations. 
 Since then, the group of 22 developing countries, which was known as G-22 and which include Brazil, China, India and South Africa, has shrunk to 12. The defectors, which included Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru, apparently gave in to American pressure. 
 Even probusiness lobbies and some government officials in Argentina and Brazil wavered, suggesting their negotiators should adopt a more conciliatory stance in Miami.
 Instead, the two presidents, Nestor Kirchner of Argentina and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, signed the sweeping statement, dubbed the Buenos Aires Consensus, as a rejoinder to the Washington Consensus -- a policy mix of free-market economics and fiscal austerity often held up in the 1990's as the best path to growth for developing nations.
 Heavier on ideology than policy, the statement promised action to generate jobs, not just profit, and fight for fair, not just free, global trade. On the latter point, the statement was clear. Argentina and Brazil were determined to maintain the G-22 alliance and to continue pressing for more equitable trade for farmers in developing countries.
 At the signing, Mr. da Silva's aides brushed off American criticism, saying the president is merely doing what President Bush always does -- defending his country's national interests.
 "A country of 176 million people cannot be isolated," said Marco Aurelio Garcia, the foreign policy adviser to Mr. da Silva, "and if a country has a solid alliance with Argentina, South Africa and India, even less so."
 He described the American efforts to chip away at the G-22 as "political blackmail" but insisted that, "With us, it won't work."
 In Mr. Kirchner, who has already taken a pugnacious stance against big business, in particular utilities and banks, foreign creditors and the International Monetary Fund since he took office in May, Mr. da Silva has found a staunch ally.
 Despite the odd hitch, like a recent squabble over Brazil's perceived failure to root loudly enough for Argentina in its negotiations with the I.M.F., analysts say relations between two countries have never been better.
 Not only are both governed by left-leaning governments, but both are potential agricultural superpowers -- together they produced more soybeans this year than the United States -- and have an increasing number of common interests.
 They are also less dependent on the United States and the European Union than in years past, now that China is opening its economy and needs to buy food.
 "Before, Brazil and Argentina had to dance to the tune of the G-7 because they were the only markets for their products, but all that is changing," said Walter Molano, chief Latin American economist at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. Now, he said, "South America is realizing that the future lies not in the United States, but on the other side of the Pacific, where there is demand for food."
 Yet some observers worry the South Americans should tread more softly when dealing with the United States.
 "Brazil is fighting for equal market access and that's a fair fight," said Eliana Cardoso, a visiting professor at Georgetown University in Washington. "But outright confrontation will not help Brazil."
 While they jointly chair the free-trade talks for the Americas, Brazil and the United States have differing views of what the free-trade zone should look like. Faced with Washington's repeated refusal to include agriculture, Brazil says it will not admit American-proposed investment rules.
 Perhaps unsurprisingly, the negotiations have fallen behind schedule. Yet Mr. Garcia predicts there will -- ultimately -- be a mutually acceptable outcome.
 "Yes, there are real points of conflict," he said. "But who really wants a policy of confrontation with the United States in Brazil or with Brazil in the United States? Nobody."

HEADLINE: Malaysia Talk Attacking Jews Draws Bush Ire 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Tuesday, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
President Bush told Malaysia's pugnacious prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, on Monday that he was "wrong and divisive" when he declared last week that Jews ran the world by proxy.
 Mr. Bush, who rarely recounts his private conversations with other world leaders, sent his press secretary out to report the encounter at the opening of the Asian summit meeting here. The president said the Malaysian leader's comment "stands squarely against what I believe in." 
 It was a strange and choreographed encounter, another twist in an up-and-down relationship. For four days after Mr. Mahathir spun out his theory of how Jews survived efforts to destroy them -- and then went on to succeed at the expense of Muslims -- Mr. Bush was silent on the speech, even as Italy, Australia and other countries condemned it as offensive and anti-Semitic. Excerpts from the speech, Page A13. 
Mr. Mahathir is retiring in a few months, and it seemed that the White House had decided not to pick an open fight with a prickly leader whom Mr. Bush praised in the Oval Office last year as a strong ally in the campaign against terrorism.
In fact, Malaysia has often been cited by administration officials as an exemplary moderate Islamic nation, even if it was run by a man who once blamed the Asian financial crisis in 1997 on the Jews and often said Western-style democracy would be a disaster in the developing world.
Mr. Bush began to sour on Mr. Mahathir this year, though, when he declared that invading Iraq would be a racist attack on a Muslim state.
But by the time Mr. Bush landed in this jammed capital for a state visit and the two-day annual summit meeting, it became clear, White House officials said, that the president could no longer be silent.
So Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, told reporters on Monday that "everyone thinks the comments were hateful, they are outrageous," and that Mr. Bush regarded them as "reprehensible."
"I don't think they are emblematic of the Muslim world," she said. 
But as Mr. Bush prepares to drop in, for three hours on Wednesday, on the most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, some White House officials are clearly concerned that Mr. Mahathir's speech on Thursday may have had considerable resonance.
It received a standing ovation from Muslim leaders of many nations, including Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, at the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, the world's largest Muslim group.
"Clearly, we had to respond," one White House official said Monday. "But the president wanted to do it in a quiet way, without further public embarrassment for Mahathir."
In the past, Mr. Bush has bitten his tongue when asked about Mr. Mahathir. When the two men took questions from reporters in the Oval Office in May 2002, the president was asked whether the United States had changed its view that Mr. Mahathir's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was a political prisoner. 
Mr. Ibrahim, the former finance minister and a potential rival to Mr. Mahathir, was convicted of sodomy and jailed in 1998. But the president, intent that day on emphasizing Malaysia's cooperation in fighting terrorism, made no public reference to Mr. Ibrahim's fate, and said, quietly, "Our position has not changed." 
Mr. Mahathir clearly knew that his comments last week would gain considerable circulation: there were cameras in the room, recording his farewell speech to the group. It included these words: "The Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million, but today the Jews rule the world by proxy: They get others to fight and die for them." 
He seemed, in some of his remarks, to be saying that Muslims should study the success of Jews. Later, he defended his remarks by citing that point. But he added that "1.3 billion Muslims cannot be defeated by a few million Jews."
Mr. Mahathir told Mr. Bush on Monday that he was quoted out of context. His foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that the speech was more critical of Muslims than of Jews, and that only "one or two portions" had been problematic. 
Mr. Mahathir expanded on his views in an interview with The Bangkok Post published on Tuesday. He said, "In my speech I condemned all violence, even the suicide bombings," adding later, "but those things were blacked out in the Western media." Then he said, referring to Jews, "The reaction of the world shows that they do control the world."
"Israel is a small country," he said. "There are not many Jews in the world. But they are so arrogant, they defy the whole world. Even if the United Nations says no, they go ahead. Why? Because they have the backing of all these people."
While the president confronted Mr. Mahathir, he was once again confronted by the belligerence of North Korea, which is not a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group and has never been invited to attend. Still, it has a way of making its presence known.
Mr. Bush has made clear here that he is trying to persuade Asian nations to sign on to a new plan to offer some loose security guarantees to the North in return for dismantling its nuclear weapons program. On Monday, North Korea tested a Silkworm ship-to-ship missile.
As a threat, it was not much. The missile cannot reach Japanese or American forces in Asia. 
Asked to compare the threat posed by North Korea to that posed by Saddam Hussein, the president ducked. Instead, he compared approaches, and on North Korea he said: "We're making progress on the diplomatic front. I'd like to resolve all issues in a peaceful way, without using our military, and I think we have an opportunity to do so."
One of his top advisers put it this way: "In Iraq, we had lots of military options, and we chose one." But in Korea, the aide said: "There are bad options and really bad options."
Between meetings, Mr. Bush sped through Bangkok, a city of grit and neon that is now glistening.
Before the leaders arrived here, a neighborhood of slums was artfully screened from view. Taxi drivers and hotel workers were trained on how to be on their best behavior -- and how to spot shoulder-launched missiles. Even the city's famed red-light districts reportedly had regular visits from the police.
In the middle of the river that runs through the most picturesque part of the city, near the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, giant fountains sprayed a sheet of water that became a movie screen with images from Thai history. A barge procession, a rare event, represented the descent of the gods to earth.
It would have been a great show for Bangkok's citizens, but they were given a holiday and told that the best contribution they could make to a good summit meeting was to leave, and take their street-clogging cars with them. Millions did just that.

HEADLINE: Rise in Income Improves Children's Behavior 

BYLINE:  By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
The notion that poverty and mental illness are intertwined is nothing new, as past research has demonstrated time and time again. But finding evidence that one begets the other has often proved difficult. 
 Now new research that coincided with the opening of an Indian casino may have come a step closer to identifying a link by suggesting that lifting children out of poverty can diminish some psychiatric symptoms, though others seem unaffected. 
 A study published in last week's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at children before and after their families rose above the poverty level. Rates of deviant and aggressive behaviors, the study noted, declined as incomes rose. 
"This comes closer to pointing to a causal relationship than we can usually get," said Dr. E. Jane Costello, a psychiatric epidemiologist at Duke who was the lead author. "Moving families out of poverty led to a reduction in children's behavioral symptoms."
The study took place over eight years in rural North Carolina and tracked 1,420 children ages 9 to 13, 25 percent of them from a Cherokee reservation. Tests for psychiatric symptoms were given at the start of the study and repeated each year.
When the study began, 68 percent of the children were from families living below the federally defined poverty line. On average, the poorer children exhibited more behaviors associated with psychiatric problems than those who did not live in poverty. But midway through the study, the opening of a local casino offered researchers a chance to analyze the effects of quick rises in income. 
Just over 14 percent of the American Indian children rose above the poverty level when the casino started distributing a percentage of its profits to tribal families. The payment, given to people over age 18 and put into a trust fund for those younger, has increased slightly each year, reaching about $6,000 per person by 2001.
"This is unique because it's a situation where everybody got the extra money," Dr. Costello said. "You can't take a bunch of babies and randomly assign them to grow up in comfort or poverty. So this is about as close to a natural experiment as you can get."
When the researchers conducted their tests soon after, they noticed that the rate of psychiatric symptoms among the children who had risen from poverty was dropping. As time went on, the children were less inclined to stubbornness, temper tantrums, stealing, bullying and vandalism -- all symptoms of conduct and oppositional defiant disorders. 
After four years, the rate of such behaviors had dropped to the same levels found among children whose families had never been poor. Children whose families broke the poverty threshold had a 40 percent decrease in behavioral symptoms. But the payments had no effect on children whose families had been unable to rise from poverty or on the children whose families had not been poor to begin with. 
The researchers also found that symptoms of anxiety and depression, although more common in poor children, remained the same despite moving out of poverty.
The deciding factor appeared to be the amount of time parents had to supervise their children. Parents who moved out of poverty reported having more time to spend with their children. In the other groups, the amount of time the parents had on their hands was not much different.
"What this shows very nicely is that an economic shift can allow for more time and better parenting," said Dr. Nancy Adler, professor of medical psychology at the University of California at San Francisco.
In children, acting out is often a result of frustration that can stem from feeling ignored or not getting enough validation from the parents, said Dr. Arline Geronimus, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan.
As a result, behaviors associated with frustration would be the first to change when parents had more attention to devote to their children. "Anxiety and depression, on the other hand, are a little more extreme and might not be as susceptible to change," Dr. Geronimus added.
Recent research suggests that anxiety disorders and depression run in families and probably reflect a mix of genetic and environmental causes.
The study highlights the role that adult supervision may have on mental health in children, but another factor, Dr. Geronimus said, may be the psychological benefits that the casino payments produce. 
The Indian families were much more likely to be poor than their non-Indian neighbors at the start of the study. After the payments, though, a higher proportion of Indian families moved out of poverty.
"There's the possibility that this improved the general outlook of the families -- that the whole community has more than before," Dr. Geronimus said. "In addition to the material resources, there might have been some psychological benefits."
Those psychological benefits may also be a byproduct of the jobs that the casino has generated, said James Sanders, director of an adolescent drug and alcohol treatment center on the reservation.
"The jobs give people the chance to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and get out of poverty," said Mr. Sanders, whose son took part in the study. "That carries over into less juvenile crime, less domestic violence and an overall better living experience for the families."
But one question that lingers is why the economic change had a significant effect on only a small proportion of the children. All of the families that received the payment were given the same amount of money, but only 14 percent moved out of poverty while 53 percent remained poor. 
The answer could be related to the number of siblings in each family. A $6,000 payment could be a huge help to a poor family with one child, for example, "but that money might not go as far for a family with multiple children," Dr. Adler said.
In 2002, the average poverty threshold for a family of three was $14,348.
Though some questions remain, the study ultimately suggests that poverty puts stress on families, which can increase the likelihood that children will develop behavioral problems. That, said Dr. Geronimus, speaks to the notion that welfare policy is heading in the wrong direction.
"Parents on welfare are increasingly required to work more and more hours while spending less time with their families," she said. "These findings suggest the opposite: parents value having more time to spend with their kids, not less, and their kids respond favorably to that."

HEADLINE: It Swallowed a Civilization 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
For decades, scholars have debated whether the eruption of the Thera volcano in the Aegean more than 3,000 years ago brought about the mysterious collapse of Minoan civilization at the peak of its glory. The volcanic isle (whose remnants are known as Santorini) lay just 70 miles from Minoan Crete, so it seemed quite reasonable that its fury could have accounted for the fall of that celebrated people.
 This idea suffered a blow in 1987 when Danish scientists studying cores from the Greenland icecap reported evidence that Thera exploded in 1645 B.C., some 150 years before the usual date. That put so much time between the natural disaster and the Minoan decline that the linkage came to be widely doubted, seeming far-fetched at best. 
 Now, scientists at Columbia University, the University of Hawaii and other institutions are renewing the proposed connection. 
New findings, they say, show that Thera's upheaval was far more violent than previously calculated -- many times larger than the 1883 Krakatoa eruption, which killed more than 36,000 people. They say the Thera blast's cultural repercussions were equally large, rippling across the eastern Mediterranean for decades, even centuries.
"It had to have had a huge impact," said Dr. Floyd W. McCoy, a University of Hawaii geologist who has studied the eruption for decades and recently proposed that it was much more violent than previously thought.
The scientists say Thera's outburst produced deadly waves and dense clouds of volcanic ash over a vast region, crippling ancient cities and fleets, setting off climate changes, ruining crops and sowing wide political unrest.
For Minoan Crete, the scientists see direct and indirect consequences. Dr. McCoy discovered that towering waves from the eruption that hit Crete were up to 50 feet high, smashing ports and fleets and severely damaging the maritime economy.
Other scientists found indirect, long-term damage. Ash and global cooling from the volcanic pall caused wide crop failures in the eastern Mediterranean, they said, and the agricultural woes in turn set off political upheavals that undid Minoan friends and trade.
"Imagine island states without links to the outside world," Dr. William B. F. Ryan, a geologist at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
Scientists who link Thera to the Minoan decline say the evidence is still emerging and in some cases sketchy. Even so, they say it is already compelling enough to have convinced many archaeologists, geologists and historians that the repercussions probably amounted to a death blow for Minoan Crete.
Rich and sensual, sophisticated and artistic, Minoan culture flourished in the Bronze Age between roughly 3000 and 1400 B.C., the first high civilization of Europe. It developed an early form of writing and used maritime skill to found colonies and a trade empire.
The British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans called the civilization Minoan, after Minos, the legendary king. His unearthed palace was huge and intricate, and had clearly been weakened by many upheavals, including fire and earthquakes.
Nearby on the volcanic island of Thera, or Santorini, archaeologists dug up Minoan buildings, artifacts and a whole city, Akrotiri, buried under volcanic ash like Pompeii. Some of its beautifully preserved frescoes depicted Egyptian motifs and animals, suggesting significant contact between the two peoples.
In 1939, Spyridon Marinatos, a Greek archaeologist, proposed that the eruption wrecked Minoan culture on Thera and Crete. He envisioned the damage as done by associated earthquakes and tsunamis. While geologists found tsunamis credible, they doubted the destructive power of Thera's earthquakes, saying volcanic ones tend to be relatively mild. The debate simmered for decades.
In the mid-1960's, scientists dredging up ooze from the bottom of the Mediterranean began to notice a thick layer of ash that they linked to Thera's eruption. They tracked it over thousands of square miles.
Dr. McCoy of the University of Hawaii, then at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod, took part in these discoveries, starting a lifelong interest in Thera. By the early 1980's, he was publishing papers on the ash distribution.
Such clues helped geologists estimate the amount of material Thera spewed into the sky and the height of its eruption cloud -- main factors in the Volcanic Explosivity Index. Its scale goes from zero to eight and is logarithmic, so each unit represents a tenfold increase in explosive power. Thera was given a V.E.I. of 6.0, on a par with Krakatoa in 1883.
The similarity to Krakatoa, which lies between Sumatra and Java, helped experts better envision Thera's wrath. Krakatoa hurled rock and ash more than 20 miles high and its blasts could be heard 3,000 miles away. Its giant waves killed thousands of people.
Despite the power of Thera, the Danish scientists' evidence raised doubts about its links to the Minoan decline. Their date for Thera's explosion, 1645 B.C., based on frozen ash in Greenland, is some 150 years earlier than the usual date. Given that the Minoan fall was usually dated to 1450 B.C., the gap between cause and effect seemed too large.
Another blow landed in 1989 when scholars on Crete found, above a Thera ash layer, a house that had been substantially rebuilt in the Minoan style. It suggested at least partial cultural survival.
By 1996, experts like Prof. Jeremy B. Rutter, head of classics at Dartmouth, judged the chronological gap too extreme for any linkage. "No direct correlation can be established" between the volcano and the Minoan decline, he concluded.
As doubts rose about this linkage, scientists found more evidence suggesting that Thera's eruption had been unusually violent and disruptive over wide areas. Scientific maps drawn in the 1960's and 1970's showed its ash as falling mostly over nearby waters and Aegean islands.
By the 1990's, however, the affected areas had been found to include lands of the eastern Mediterranean from Anatolia to Egypt. Scientists found ash from Thera at the bottom of the Black Sea and Nile delta.
Dr. Peter I. Kuniholm, an expert at Cornell on using tree rings to establish dates, found ancient trees in a burial mound in Anatolia, what now is in the Asian part of Turkey. For half a decade those trees had grown three times as fast as normal -- apparently because Thera's volcanic pall turned hot, dry summers into seasons that were unusually cool and wet.
"We've got an anomaly, the biggest in the past 9,000 years," Dr. Kuniholm said in an interview.
More intrigued than ever, Dr. McCoy of the University of Hawaii two years ago stumbled on more evidence suggesting that Thera'sash fall had been unusually wide and heavy. During a field trip to Anafi, an island some 20 miles east of Thera, he found to his delight that the authorities had just cut fresh roads that exposed layers of Thera ash up to 10 feet thick -- a surprising amount that distance from the eruption.
And Greek colleagues showed him new seabed samples taken off the Greek mainland, suggesting that more ash blew westward than scientists had realized.
Factoring in such evidence, Dr. McCoy calculated that Thera had a V.E.I. of 7.0 -- what geologists call colossal and exceedingly rare. In the past 10,000 years only one other volcano has exploded with that kind of gargantuan violence: Tambora, in Indonesia, in 1816, It produced an ash cloud in the upper atmosphere that reflected sunlight back into space and produced the year without a summer. The cold led to ruinous harvests, hunger and even famine in the United States, Europe and Russia.
"I presented this evidence last summer at a meeting," Dr. McCoy recalled, "and the comment from the other volcanologists was, 'Hey, it was probably larger than Tambora.' "
Dr. Ryan of Columbia has woven such clues into a tantalizing but provisional theory on how distant effects might have slowly undone Crete. First, he noted that winds at low and high altitudes seem to have blown Thera's ash into distinct plumes -- one to the southeast, toward Egypt and another heavier one to the northeast, toward Anatolia. Even if the changes wrought by Thera helped trees there, they apparently played havoc with delicate wheat fields.
Mursilis, a king of the Hittites, set out from Anatolia on a rampage, traveling between the plumes to strike Syria and Babylon and seize their stored grains and cereals. The subsequent collapse of Babylon into a dark age, Dr. Ryan said, also undid one of its puppets, the Hyksos, foreigners who ruled Egypt and traded with the Minoans.
He theorized that the new Egyptian dynasty had no love of Hyksos allies. So Minoan Crete, already reeling from Thera's fury, suffered new blows to its maritime trade.
In an interview, Dr. Ryan said he and other scholars were still refining dates on some of the ancient events, promising to better fix their relation to the eruption. The outcome of that work, he said, could either strengthen or undermine his thesis.
Even without such distant upsets, some prominent archaeologists have concluded that the volcano's long-term repercussions meant the end of Minoan Crete. For instance, they argue that the revolt of nature over the predictable certainties of Minoan religion probably crippled the authority of the priestly ruling class, weakening its hold on society.
In scholarly articles, Dr. Jan Driessen, an archaeologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and Dr. Colin F. MacDonald, an archaeologist at the British School in Athens, have argued that changes to Cretan architecture, storage, food production, artistic output and the distribution of riches imply major social dislocations, and perhaps civil war.
By 1450 B.C., Mycenaean invaders from mainland Greece seized control of Crete, ending the Minoan era.
Thera's destructiveness was probably the catalyst, Dr. Driessen and Dr. MacDonald wrote, "that culminated in Crete being absorbed to a greater or lesser extent into the Mycenaean, and therefore, the Greek world."

CALIFORNIANS feel differently about cars than the rest of America. "In other states," said Lonnie Miller, the director of analytical solutions at R. L. Polk & Company, an auto consultancy, "you do not see or hear, 'I want it to say something about me.' "
 Yet Californians are probably the most influential auto consumers in the world. 
 Their sway is partly related to the fact that the state is the biggest market in the United States. With about 35 million people, the numbers are bound to be daunting. As of Dec. 31, 2002, there were 22,605,810 licensed drivers in the state and 20,665,415 registered autos. Just about every licensed driver owns a car. Throw in commercial trucks, trailers and motorcycles, and you get 30,875,086 registered vehicles. 
Last year, California auto dealers reaped $83.4 billion in total sales, easily the highest nationwide and more than the annual government expenditures for most countries, as well as almost 14 times the annual gross domestic product of Afghanistan. 
With such economic clout, automakers must cater to Californians. But that is not easy given that the second reason California is so influential is that it is unpredictable.
What, for example, is an auto executive to make of the fact that Californians bought more Hummer H2's from January to July -- 3,048 according to Polk's numbers -- than any other state, yet drivers have also bought so many gas-electric hybrids that Detroit has been forced to play catch-up with the Japanese? 
On one hand, the Hummer sales say Californians are rich and therefore entitled to two parking spaces, but the new hybrids say the state is full of environmental advocates. 
Both pictures are true. California is a big, diverse state, and carmakers can count on one truism: that it is made up of free thinkers who chafe at dictates from the outside world, including Detroit.
Even in the age of the Duesenbergs, California body shops replaced the bodies with ones of their own. In the postwar hot rod era, California design ideas from the likes of Edward Roth, better known as Big Daddy, turned Detroit's cars upside down. 
So in 1958, when Datsun (now Nissan) began exporting cars to the United States, Californians fell in love with them because the Japanese understood the state and its iconoclastic culture. "They picked up the California market the quickest," said Art Spinella, the director of CNW Marketing Research, in Bandon, Ore. At the time, Detroit was dictating fins. The first thing California hot rod designers did was slice off the fins.
The Japanese, Mr. Spinella said, "designed simple, almost elegant small cars."
"They got rid of the geegaws," he said. "The original Corolla, for example, was a clean design because they were paying attention to California." 
Japanese cars are now part of the national landscape, but California hugged them first and still loves them more than the rest of the country. According to the research firm J. D. Power & Associates, the three most popular models in the state are the Honda Accord, the Toyota Camry and the Honda Civic. The three most popular models for the rest of the country are the Ford F-150 pickup truck, the Honda Accord and the Ford Explorer.
Power's numbers also show that the state has adopted European models. BMW and Mercedes-Benz both appear in the Top 10, but not on the 10 favorite nameplates of the other 49 states. 
But just when you think it is possible to make more generalizations about Californians and cars, consider that the state's industries include farming and ranching, thus the need to buy many trucks. The fourth best-selling model in Northern California is the enormous Chevy Silverado 1500. The fourth favorite in the southern half is the Ford F-150. 
The state is also fickle. "Californians are not patient," Mr. Spinella said. "We find in our surveys that there's a lot more complaining about satisfaction scores in the Northeast, but they'll go back and buy again. Californians for the most part don't complain; they simply won't go back. They will not be loyal." 
Because of that contrariness, California is an ideal proving ground for new models. Last June, Toyota introduced the Scion at 105 California dealerships. The model looks something like a shoe box on roller skates, and is meant to be customized. If it takes off, it will be distributed everywhere. 
Indeed, the Scion "was created to suit the demands of an emerging culture of new-car buyers known as Gen Y," according to a statement on the Toyota Web site. Sociological labels aside, Toyota is once again tapping into California's individualist culture.
Every carmaker that exports to the United States has caught on to the idea that a design democracy, or making one's own rules and filtering ideas from the bottom rather than from the top, is here to stay. Miami is often cited as another trend-setting spot, but the design democracy mind-set has reached full power on the West Coast. 
That is why car design studios are staffed with video-game veterans and designers from the movies, the technology world and, of course, cars. Alfonso E. Albaisa, the interim director for design at Nissan Design America in San Diego, has the task of making sense of California's chaotic milieu. He does it by paying attention to cues that seem to have little to do with cars: radical Japanese motorcycles, fashion, sports and architecture. "We have 70 people working here and 40 motorcycles in the parking lot," Mr. Albaisa said. "There are so many hobbies. And we have designers from all over the planet."
Such scavenging for inspiration has fostered the California car culture over the last 50 years. Today, though, that culture may be more aspiration than realization. 
Californians do not cruise much anymore, nor do they hang out at drive-ins, and parking is generally not allowed on the beaches. Still, the car culture persists because drivers continue to spend a lot of time sitting on freeway on-ramps, imagining they could be doing these things instead of waiting for the two-cars-per-green-light-meter light to join the herd on Interstate 5.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA/MOTOR CITY; 
Pollution Fight Turns From Smog to Global Warming

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
THE next big regulatory battle between California and the auto industry will be over global warming. 
 For years, the Golden State has been aggressive on something quite different -- the smog-forming pollutants emanating from tailpipes -- because of the gray haze that settles over its cities. This year, the industry and California's powerful Air Resources Board called a truce on the issue after General Motors and Chrysler dropped a suit against the state's Zero Emission Vehicle mandate. Overall, considerable progress has been made in curbing smog since the 1970's, though this year the state suffered some of its worst pollution problems in more than a half-decade. 
 But as one struggle ends for now, another is beginning over a different tailpipe emission, carbon dioxide and other gases, like methane, that many scientists think are contributing to global climate change trends. The issue remains debatable in the scientific community and in Detroit, where global warming is often viewed skeptically. 
The opening salvo came last year, when Gov. Gray Davis of California signed into law the nation's first piece of legislation aimed at curbing automotive emissions of greenhouse gases. The legislation itself is vague and leaves it to the Air Resources Board, a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, to work out the details over the next year.
Automakers are widely expected to sue the state over the measure, but until the specifics of the plan are laid out there is little basis for a court challenge. Battle lines are already coalescing, though, with state regulators and environmentalists on one side and automakers from Detroit to Tokyo, as well as the White House, on the other. 
The Bush administration prefers voluntary action by industries over regulation and withdrew the United States from an international treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, to curb greenhouse emissions.
"When it comes to climate change, California is aligning itself with the rest of the world," Alan C. Lloyd, the chairman of the state air board, said in an interview in late September, adding, "Somewhere along the line, we would expect a lawsuit."
"My hope is that somehow we could work with the industry and say: 'Look, it's only a matter of time before these things are addressed. Voluntary agreements will work for a while maybe but you have an opportunity here to help us craft the regulation.' "
But he said all the major automakers had indicated resistance to the measure, including Honda, which has not taken part in industry lobbying campaigns against environmental legislation in the past. 
"Many of them are talking to us on a technical basis," Dr. Lloyd said, "but they draw the line there, typically, and say, 'We don't think having a state set tailpipe standards for greenhouse gases is the way to go.' "
Since Dr. Lloyd was appointed by Mr. Davis, who has been recalled from office, he could be out of a job when Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes governor. The new administration will mostly draft the regulation. That has aroused concern among environmentalists. Mr. Schwarzenegger has long been a booster of the gas-guzzling Hummer, the S.U.V. that groups like the Sierra Club love to hate. On one campaign stop, he made an offhand remark suggesting that the state should abolish its E.P.A.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's advisers later clarified the remark and said he supported the E.P.A. He has also tried to create a green image; among the positions laid out on his campaign Web site, at www. joinarnold.com, he said he supported the greenhouse gas legislation and would "work to implement it and to win the expected challenges in court along the way." He said he also wanted to make one of his Hummers more environmentally friendly. 
But the new Republican governor also inherits a battle with the Bush administration because of the state's greenhouse gas plan.
In August, the federal Environmental Protection Agency said it lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, reversing the stance of the Clinton administration. 
Earlier this month, Governor Davis's administration said it would sue the E.P.A. over the issue before he leaves office. 
"It's apparent that California is reading the Clean Air Act one way, and the E.P.A. is reading it another way," said Mark Merchant, an E.P.A. spokesman. "There's a difference of opinion there, and California has decided to ask the court to make a decision."
While the suit is partly aimed at prodding federal action on global warming, it is also viewed in California as an effort to counter what could be a potent legal argument against the state's plan to curb auto emissions: if the E.P.A. says it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases, why does California have the authority on air issues granted by the same legislation?
Many legal experts on both sides believe that winning the suit against the E. P. A. will be crucial for the greenhouse gas law to stand up to a legal challenge and actually take effect, though California regulators do not concede the point. 
"Whatever California does on CO2 emissions would face a double-pronged challenge," said Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group that receives industry financing. 
The first prong, he said, would be an argument based on the Clean Air Act authority. The second, he said, would be similar to one that automakers have used against the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate -- that emissions rules are superseded by federal authority to set fuel economy regulations. The argument could be stronger in this case because global warming is tied directly to fuel consumption. While smog-forming pollutants can be filtered by devices like catalytic converters, no such filter exists for carbon dioxide.
Dr. Lloyd believes the state's law will hold up, but added that "we think very strongly if we lose in the legal arena we're going to win in the court of public opinion," thus pressuring automakers to take action nonetheless. 
Certainly, the Air Resources Board is watched closely in automaking capitals from Stuttgart to Tokyo to Detroit -- because California is the world's eighth-largest auto market and because other states are allowed to choose its tougher air regulations over Washington's. 
In an interview last year, Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, described the moment his staff told him the company would have to start producing expensive low- and zero-emission vehicles if an earlier and more demanding version of the state's final Zero Emission Mandate took effect. 
"I remember I had a meeting in Tokyo where they showed me all the cost of this stuff," Mr. Ghosn said. "I said, 'Oh my God, the others have to do this too?' Nobody believes in it, but you have to do it. It's a huge cost, but it's part of the cost of doing business."

HEADLINE: BUYING AND SELLING; 
In the Land of Never-Ending Rebates, a Guide to Value

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS

 BODY:
IF it seems as if there is a sale on cars and trucks every day, there is. Cash rebates and low-interest financing that used to be occasional treats for consumers or panic moves by manufacturers to rid themselves of slow sellers have become more or less permanent features of the marketing landscape. The cash rebates are climbing higher and higher, and the interest-rate offers are dropping to nothing.
 Buyers, however, need to be aware (if not exactly beware) that once a bargain becomes permanent, there is often a hitch. Manufacturers have raised prices for new models to compensate for rebates and other incentives. Another pricing strategy is to take features that used to be standard -- for example, antilock brakes -- and convert them to pay-extra options. 
 But even with such gimmicks, there are bargains. In fact, in the clearance sales of this summer, incentives set a record. In August, the average incentive hit $2,630 a vehicle, according to Edmunds.com, the online car-shopping site based in Santa Monica, Calif.
And incentives picked right up again with the new-car season this fall. General Motors announced on Oct. 1 a choice of cash rebates, ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 on 2004 models, or zero-interest financing. Ford Motor rolled out its Freestar minivan in late September with a choice of a $1,000 rebate or low-interest financing in tow.
Zero-interest financing, unheard of until two years ago when G.M. and other carmakers offered it to start car sales rolling after 9/11, is now routinely offered on five-year financing. Interest rates as low as 1.9 percent are showing up on six- and seven-year loans, almost unheard of at any interest rate until recently. In fact, eight-year loans are cropping up as well.
Detroit is the place to look for whopping cash rebates and no-interest financing for new cars and trucks. Chrysler, Ford and G.M. offered late-summer incentives averaging $3,687 a vehicle, an industry record, according to Edmunds. By contrast, the Europeans averaged late summer incentives of $1,752 a vehicle; the Koreans, $1,484; and the Japanese, $1,032. Jesse Toprak, Edmunds's director of pricing and market analysis, predicted that new incentives records would be set in November and December, with Detroit again leading the charge.
The biggest incentives are on large sport utility vehicles, vans and large cars, according to Edmunds. Sports cars, luxury S.U.V.'s and compact S.U.V.'s have the lowest.
A less obvious way to hold a sale is for the manufacturers to pay incentives to dealers, instead of to consumers. The dealer then uses the incentive to market the car. A smart consumer can negotiate a better deal by knowing about a dealer's incentive, which is listed by online car-buying services like Edmunds. Dealer incentives of up to $10,500 a car helped to push Jaguar, owned by Ford, to the top of the incentive charts in late summer among brands. The Swedish automaker Saab, owned by G.M., was second with an average incentive of $4,038.
"In most cases, incentives are required to reduce the price of a vehicle to a level consumers think is more appropriate," said Daniel Gorrell, vice president of Strategic Vision, a San Diego consulting firm. "Manufacturers have to resort to incentives when the brand and product are not strong."
Mr. Gorrell points to the contrast in Ford's Freestar minivan, introduced to the market with an incentive, and the 2004 Toyota Sienna, a redesigned minivan that went on sale last spring. The Toyota sells at close to list price with no incentives and has a waiting list of buyers, Mr. Gorrell said, adding that many consumers see value as not just a cheap price but also as reliability, durability and resale value.
Resale value should be an important consideration for the consumer who intends to sell or trade in a car every few years, and heavy incentives hurt resale values. So the big incentive may not be worth it. (Resale values can be found at online buying services like Edmunds or in used-car pricing guides like Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com).
Automotive Lease Guide, a Santa Barbara, Calif., company that establishes the value of a vehicle at the end of a lease, which also applies to used cars, reported that three-year-old cars from Chrysler, Ford and G.M. declined sharply in value the last year. In 2003, a three-year-old vehicle from those manufacturers is worth only 39 percent of its original sales price, compared with 45 percent a year ago. Three-year-old foreign cars are worth 47 percent of their sticker prices after three years, a number that has held steady in recent years. The Japanese automaker Honda and its luxury Acura division have the highest resale value at 52 percent after three years. 
Resale value is also critical for a consumer who wants to buy a new car before paying off the existing one. He may find himself in an increasingly common situation known in the industry as "upside down." In such cases, the car owner owes more on the loan for the vehicle than what the vehicle is worth. He then must pay off the loan before buying another car or roll the balance of the loan into a new loan for a new vehicle. 
Buying a car from the previous model year in the fall, when the new model year starts, is generally a solid strategy. Manufacturers pay dealers cash incentives and often offer consumer rebates or low-interest loans to clear the old models from dealer lots to make room for the new ones. As autumn passes into winter, the incentives on the previous year's models can grow bigger. For instance, in the recent round of incentives announced by G.M., rebates on 2003 models ranged from $2,000 to $4,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 on newer models; the list of eligible 2003 vehicles was far longer than the list of 2004 models. 
As time passes, however, the selection dwindles. That may not matter if a consumer does not care about a car's color or options. And buying at the end of any month can be a good bet. Incentives often come in the form of contests that pay dealers for meeting certain sales targets. Those incentives usually expire at the end of a month.
Consumers should also consider how long they intend to keep a vehicle when they are trying to decide on the better deal -- a cash rebate or low- or no-interest financing. The cash rebate is probably the best bet if the buyer intends to sell or trade in within two to three years. The low- to no-interest financing might be a better option if the buyer wants to keep the vehicle for a long time.
Indeed, consumers are taking on loans with increasingly longer terms. Mr. Toprak of Edmunds says that two years ago, the average loan was 53 months; today it is 59 months.
In the end, the incentive game is a reminder of the axiom that there is no free lunch. There is far more to consider in buying a car than a big fat incentive or long-term low-interest financing. "Value," said Mr. Gorrell of Strategic Vision, "is more than just a cheap price."

HEADLINE: WHAT THEY DRIVE; 
Guys Mod Up to Solve Their Midlife Minivan Minicrisis

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY

 BODY:
JIM NYE was not what you would call a minivan kind of guy. Mr. Nye, a 47-year-old special education teacher from Ventura, Calif., spent his free time tinkering with cars like Porsches or the Mini Cooper. With his first two children, he chose a sedan over a van.
 But when he and his wife, Cathi, adopted a child with cerebral palsy last year, they needed room for a wheelchair, and he became the reluctant driver of a Honda Odyssey. "It wasn't something I initially desired," Mr. Nye said. "I used to be one of the people who made fun of them." 
 So he did what came naturally to him -- decked it out with features like a high-end radio, a PlayStation game console, an oversize front grille and a red-flame paint job. 
The teenagers in his town feel that he has broken the rules of tuning, or modifying cars for performance and style. "That's not fair," one told him. "You're not supposed to look twice at a minivan."
Minivans, which were introduced by Chrysler in 1984, are more often decorated with spilled Cheerios than spoilers. But scattered around are a few proud individuals like Mr. Nye, who look upon these loaf-shaped kiddie movers as things of beauty. Or at least good candidates for a makeover.
These redoers are not proverbial soccer moms, said Jerry Tagliano, a manager at the Erebuni Corporation, an aftermarket parts company in Brooklyn. They are mostly men who have reached the minivan stage of life but still hear the refrain from "Born to Be Wild."
"The husbands are the ones who had the muscle cars in the 70's and 80's, and now they are dads," said Mr. Tagliano, whose company is one of the few that sells stylish accessories in the United States for minivans. "Maybe they have a Corvette, they have a Mustang. Now, they have the minivan."
Fitz Eusebio, 27, a student and enhanced Odyssey owner from Southern California, agreed. "Modifying stays in your blood until you grow out of it, I guess," he said, "which I don't think will happen to me."
If you browse Web sites like cardomain .com, an online forum where car owners brag about their modifications, you will see a surprising number of people posting photos of their spruced-up minivans, particularly Caravans, Odysseys and Mazda MPV's, which Mr. Tagliano said were dressed and pampered most often. Some owners go for subtle upgrades like clear taillights, carbon- fiber dashes and alloy wheels, while others give their vans new silhouettes, lowering their suspensions and bulking up with ground effects. Some younger owners, who got their minivans as hand-me-downs from parents or grandparents, quickly add details like neon lights under the seats that flash in time with the stereo. But they admit that they leave themselves open to jeers.
Eric Sebalos, 33, a stay-at-home father of two in Jersey City and a longtime modifier, saw great potential in the minivan. He willingly switched last year from a fully modified Ford Expedition, with an air-bagged suspension and a supercharger, to a silver 2001 Odyssey.
"When I first got it, my friends and family were like, 'What are you doing with a minivan?' " Mr. Sebalos said.
But he had a plan, and so far, he has added a body kit, lip spoilers, two 13.3-inch flip-down TV monitors and a PlayStation. The audio system is constantly changing; the car is on its third suspension system; Mr. Sebalos also plans to add a computer to control his systems through a touch screen.
"Reactions are mixed, but 90 percent think it's hot looking and didn't think a minivan could look so nice," he said in an e-mail interview. "Even the younger kids are into the van, being that it's modded up."
Granted, you would be hard pressed to find a Ford Windstar making a cameo in "The Fast and the Furious." But some car companies are trying other ways of fighting the Mommymobile connotation. For 2005, General Motors has redesigned its Venture and Montana minivans to look more like sport utility vehicles and is even backing away from the "M" word, introducing them as "crossover sport vans."
Nissan calls its 2004 Quest a minivan ("We don't skirt around the issue," a spokesman, John Schilling, said) but has given it one of the most sports-car-like styling the genre has ever seen, hoping that it will attract parents who care what their ride looks like. In one Quest television commercial, a group of wives take the van out for a night on the town while their husbands stay home and watch the children.
The ultimate goal is to duplicate the emotional bond that forms between buyers and less utilitarian models. Buying a minivan has never been an emotional purchase, Mr. Schilling said: "It was 'I need a minivan because I have kids.' People just didn't want to be seen in them."
The makers of minivans could benefit from a spokeswoman like Charlotte de Vera. Also known as Momma C or Turbo Mom, Ms. de Vera, 55, is a minor celebrity at racetracks, where she races her turbo-charged, nitrous-fed Odyssey.
Why a minivan? "I've always been a wagon-and-minivan lady," she said. "I'm such a people person; I like to pile in a lot of people."
She also has a son, R .J., who modifies cars and is willing to do all the work, including a gold paint job for her 50th birthday. The novelty earns him a lot of "props."
"I get a lot of twentysomethings and thirtysomethings who say, 'I saw your mom's van and it totally inspired me to do ours,' " he said. 
But modifying a minivan is more difficult than changing a sports car, he said, because aftermarket parts are harder to find and many pieces have to be custom made.
In Japan, however, the story is different. There, minivans are respected for their practicality and, yes, suave looks. Aftermarket manufacturers offer a range of add-on aerodynamic parts to accentuate the cars' clean lines, and auto competitions commonly include a category for vans.
On his trips to Japan, Mr. Tagliano has seen gatherings where hundreds of families take their well-appointed boxes, popping their hatches to show off the interiors.
"We started introducing minivan products with the hope that there would be a transition of the market from Japan to here," he said. "It didn't happen."
Dempsey Bowling, 33, a car salesman in Provo, Utah, has seen many men buy S.U.V.'s when they actually need minivans because they fear looking foolish.
"The funny thing is, that fear is unfounded," Mr. Bowling said. "When you drive a van, people don't even notice you at all."
Which increases what Mr. Bowling calls "the whole surprise factor" -- the dropped jaws when his blue '89 Dodge Caravan does the quarter mile in 14.4 seconds on the track in Salt Lake City. He got the idea for racing minivans while he was tweaking other Chryslers, surprising his competitors with his souped-up econoboxes.
"I thought, if it's fun to beat a Mustang in an Omni," he said, "it must be hilarious in a minivan."
Minivans make good racing "sleepers," Mr. Bowling said. His 1989 Caravan dates to a two-year period when the cars came equipped with turbo-charged engines. They generally weigh less and handle better than S.U.V.'s. To further reduce the weight, Mr. Bowling, a bachelor, took out the air-conditioning, insulation, spare tire and rear seats.
"I like to joke with my friends it's a two-seat sports car with a huge trunk," he said.
He has beaten Camaros and other muscle cars; now, he even sometimes has trouble finding people to race.
"They don't want to be seen losing to a minivan," he said "and I can understand that."

Some Green Machines Swim in the Mainstream

 BODY:
LAWRENCE ANG never intended to be environmentally correct. He wanted a new car with an economical price tag, good gas mileage and looks he liked. By choosing a Ford Focus, he also got a car with tailpipe emissions so low they are often cleaner than the ambient air in smoggy urban areas.
 "To be honest, I never considered the low emissions, and didn't really find out about it until after I bought it," said Mr. Ang, 36, a computer technician who lives here. "But it never hurts. I'm hoping it means I will have years of no trouble with smog tests." 
 Mr. Ang is not the only person who bought a Focus this year, thinking it was no different from other cars. Most of them are no different, but the ones sold in California and some other states are partial zero emission vehicles, or P.Z.E.V.'s (as are 11 additional brands made by seven other manufacturers). Though these vehicles burn gasoline, more than 90 percent of their smog-producing emissions are removed, compared with the average new car. 
This is the first year that automakers have mass-produced the P.Z.E.V., and the car is not well known among consumers. Compared with the hoopla surrounding hybrids (cars powered by gas and electric motor), which are currently on the market, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (a combination of hydrogen and water that creates electricity), which are a decade from assembly lines, its arrival on the market has been muted. (A third alternative to fossil fuel, the battery-powered engine, is regarded as too impractical for most everyday use.)
"The more advanced technologies, the ones getting away from gasoline, are the sexier technologies," said Alan C. Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, the regulatory agency that in 1990 required automakers to mass-produce zero-emission vehicles, or Z.E.V.'s, setting off the search for nonpolluting cars. 
"But in terms of breathing cleaner air," Dr. Lloyd added, "it is easier for companies to come out with hundreds of thousands of P.Z.E.V.'s than the more revolutionary technologies."
Evaporative emissions from the engine and fuel tank of a P.Z.E.V. are almost nonexistent.
And the price of these cars is either the same as regular models or slightly higher (about $200 at most), depending on the manufacturer. P.Z.E.V.'s range from $13,000 for a Ford Focus compact to $28,000 for a BMW 325i sedan. Horsepower is roughly the same, as is fuel efficiency. Moreover, all P.Z.E.V.'s have a 15-year or 150,000-mile warranty on the smog controls.
"The beauty of the technology is that manufacturers are applying it to cars that everyday people can buy," said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California air board. "And with the warranty, second or third owners, who are frequently lower-income, will have a car running like new."
Automakers sell P.Z.E.V.'s only where they are mandated, in California and those states that have adopted its tough air-quality standards, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont. The cars are therefore not nationally advertised, making it difficult for them to shed their obscurity. Maine, which adopted a less stringent version of the California mandate, will also get P.Z.E.V.'s from some manufacturers. About 135,000 P.Z.E.V.'s will be sold nationwide this year, 100,000 of which will go to the California market, according to the air board. By 2012, the agency estimates that the state will have 3.4 million such cars on the roads. 
To convert regular models, automakers have spent an average of several hundred dollars on each car. 
With uncertain market demand, higher production costs make manufacturers hesitant to produce more P.Z.E.V.'s, especially when their profits are being squeezed by the current competitive market. The other concern to manufacturers is the warranty, which would be harder to meet in states outside California, where gasoline formulations are not as clean. 
The marketing approach to these vehicles is typified by Nissan, which came out with the first P.Z.E.V., in 2000, the Sentra CA. (The company produced only a small number, limited to the California market.)
"Some of the research we've done shows consumers think there is a trade-off between environmental friendliness and other attributes," said Ken Zapp, a Nissan executive. "We don't downplay it, but it's not the primary selling point." Carmakers worry that consumers will think that P.Z.E.V.'s performances will suffer at the expense of their environmental virtues. 
Only Ford is breaking from the pack, having recently completed its first television advertisement highlighting the Focus's virtues. The ad, titled "Cleaner and Meaner," will be broadcast in California and the Northeast.
"We've got nothing to be ashamed of," said Rich Stoddart, the Ford Division marketing communications manager. "We're terrificallyproud of a power train that delivers environmental friendliness and more performance than you might expect."
Foreign manufacturers, especially Honda, Toyota and Nissan, led the way toward developing P.Z.E.V. technology, selling such versions of the Accord, Camry and Sentra, respectively. The other P.Z.E.V.'s are the Volvo S60 and S70, the Volkswagen Jetta, the Subaru Legacy L and Outback and versions of the BMW 325 series. Ford is currently the only American automaker producing P.Z.E.V.'s. Several foreign companies and Ford are coming out with additional models in 2004.
Ron Cogan, the editor and publisher of the Green Car Journal, a magazine based in San Luis Obispo, Calif., that covers cars and the environment, thinks that Ford will spur the competition to do likewise.
"Automakers haven't had the best crystal ball when it comes to environmental regulation and marketing green cars," Mr. Cogan said. "But environmental benefits are going to become a competitive issue and another buying criteria."
The California air board and the other states that have adopted its standards consider the P.Z.E.V. clean enough to earn manufacturers a partial credit toward the zero emission vehicle mandate, which takes effect in 2005. But how manufacturers meet that mandate varies with the number of credits they have earned, and which technologies they have chosen to develop. Ford, for example, is putting most of its stock in its P.Z.E.V. engine, and plans to offer it as an option on all Focus cars in 2004, expecting to sell 69,000 by next year. A total of 240,000 Focuses were sold for the 2003 model year. 
General Motors has not committed to a P.Z.E.V. as part of its strategy to comply with California's mandate.
"If we come to market with P.Z.E.V.'s, it won't be until 2005 to 2010," said Dave Barthmuss, a G.M. spokesman. "Our goal is to establish the commercial viability of hydrogen fuel cells. We see that as the ultimate endgame."
The greening of the gasoline engine is a result of many small improvements and not any one significant change.
Partial zero emission vehicles have better fuel combustion, extremely precise valve-control and fuel-injection systems and exhaust control that instantly eliminate cold-start emissions. Evaporative emissions are cut by tighter gaskets, hoses and fuel tanks.
The next challenge for automakers is for them to adapt P.Z.E.V. technology to pickups and sport utility vehicles, a more difficult task because these engines use much larger volumes of gas and oxygen. Still, automotive engineers think that P.Z.E.V. technology will make it onto S.U.V.'s before hydrogen fuel cell cars hit the mass market. (Toyota and Ford will produce hybrid S.U.V.'s next year.)
Environmentalists hail the P.Z.E.V. and California's lead in improving air quality. But they also point out that though two of the pollutants that contribute to global warming, nitrous oxide and methane, are reduced by P.Z.E.V.'s, the main culprit, carbon dioxide, is not. 
"The next frontier in California is tackling global warming, especially carbon dioxide emissions," said Roland Hwang, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "We've been doing well on smog, but with global warming we've been going backwards over the past 15 years."

HEADLINE: MARKETING; 
Appealing to Youth, Selling to the Not-So-Young

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
THE vehicle rumbles down a traffic-free city street, a trail of fast-flying papers in its wake. It is a Cadillac Escalade, turning the heads of 30-somethings, as rock music -- not too loud, mind you -- plays in the background.
 This television commercial ends before you see anyone driving the Escalade. If you did, chances are he or she would look a bit grayer than the gape-mouthed bystanders on the street in the advertisement. The buyers of this youth-oriented Cadillac are, on average, a not-so-youthful 46 years old -- precisely the age of the average buyer of a new car in the United States. 
 As the American population grows older and as new car prices rise (even with incentives), the average buyer of new vehicles has ventured far into middle age. Among the major automakers, the average buyer's age ranges from 41 years old for the Volkswagen and Mitsubishi to 64 for the Buick. 
"Yet you are never going to see those cars driven by old people in a commercial," said Karl Brauer, the editor in chief of www.edmunds.com, the car-buying advisory Web site. "There is one general rule that people in the auto industry swear by: you can sell a young person's car to an old man, but you can't sell an old man's car to anyone."
Still, there are apparently many older men and women buying new cars these days, even some models many might consider "young."
According to figures from J. D. Power & Associates, for instance, the average buyer of a new Thunderbird is 53 years old. For the PT Cruiser, it's 50; the Corvette, 48; and the MX-5 Miata, 50.
While General Motors will be discontinuing "not your father's" Oldsmobile in 2004, it should become clear to people in their 40's and 50's that they, at least in their car buying, have become their fathers.
"I made a lot of buying decisions about automobiles when I was 18 that have absolutely no relevance today," said Bob Garfield, 48, who reviews advertisements for Advertising Age and is a co-host of "On the Media," a programshow on National Public Radio. "As recently as 10 years ago, my buying habits would have been different."
"But advertisers are obsessed with marketing to the 18-to-34-year-old demographic, so that is what their campaigns even for older car buyers are geared to," he continued. "Of course, that makes no sense whatsoever demographically because the largest pool of discretionary dollars in the history of humanity resides in the baby boom."
Yet the ruse is to make older car buyers think they are buying a "younger" car. For the last two years, for example, Cadillac has used excerpts from Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" in its commercials.
"They are trying to bring about a young feeling," Mr. Brauer said, adding that the song itself is 32 years old. "The hope is that the music, which baby boomers may have listened to when they were young, will make them think young and buy a hip Cadillac."
Cadillac thinks the campaign has worked in attracting younger buyers. Company figures show that the average age of a new Cadillac buyer is 59 today, compared with 65.5 two years ago. 
"The Escalade, especially, has been a huge success in that regard," said Kelly Cusinato, a Cadillac spokeswoman. "It has been the vehicle of choice among some Hollywood folks and athletes, even though we've never particularly marketed it that way."
In contrast to the Escalade, the average buyer's age of the Cadillac Seville is 62 and the DeVille is 66.
Art Spinella of CNW Marketing Research, an automative research company in Bandon, Ore., said that the average age of the new car buyer had risen faster than the population at large for many reasons: a slower economy for young job-seekers; the availability of certified used cars; and the trend of older buyers to buy new cars more often. 
But Mr. Spinella said that marketing "young" has advantages even if the young person is not buying immediately. He has developed a Stodgy Index, a rating based on a long questionnaire given to people 24 years old or younger to find out how "old" they think certain cars are. 
"Cadillac and Mercedes are prime examples," Mr. Spinella said. "If you are 18, you might want to one day own one, but just not right now." 
The top five "stodgy" cars on the company's list are Buick, Oldsmobile, Lincoln, Mercury and, surprisingly, Audi. The first four all have average new-car buying ages of more than 50 years old, but Audi's is only 43. Volkswagens, Porsches and Kias, all of which have average buying ages in the 40's, are the least stodgy on the list.
Mercedes-Benz, like Cadillac, seems to be trying to appeal to the youthful yearnings of its presumably older buyer.
A recent advertising supplement in The New Yorker featured Nicole Kidman with a Mercedes key in her hand and a come-hither look.
Other photos showed stylish people seemingly in their mid-20's lounging on and about Mercedes sedans. But while there are certainly not many in that age group buying the Mercedes (the average buyer's age is 48), it is obviously the image of youth that counts.
Honda, which does relatively well at attracting younger buyers (the average age is 44), but lands in the midrange of the Stodgy Index, has been particularly aggressive in seeking young buyers.
"Honda sent us for training on how to sell younger people on the Element," said Peter Perrotta, a former Honda salesman who now sells Jaguars for Cherry Hill Classic Cars in New Jersey. The Element is a four-wheel drive short S.U.V., whose polyurethane floors are specifically designed to carry snowboards, skis and the like. 
"They told us to let young buyers control the sales process, which goes against everything everyone says about older buyers," Mr. Perrotta said. "Older people are less independent, so the salesman controls things, which is maybe why they buy more new cars."
Not every automaker that rates high on the Stodgy Index appears to be trying to appeal to younger drivers. Last year, Buick ran an ad that featured an actor impersonating Harley Earl, the premier car designer at General Motors in the 40's and 50's.
Even though Earl's image was paired with Tiger Woods as a pitchman, more than a few young watchers were probably left scratching their heads.
Ads aside, automakers are not completely unaware of the real demographics of their customers. The minivan, for instance, would naturally seem to be a vehicle for younger people; it is family-oriented and utilitarian. But the average age of buyers for Ford's Windstar is 48, while its more expensive S.U.V., the Expedition, is 42. "Technically, the commercials market to 30-somethings with kids," Mr. Brauer said. "But the automakers know that the market for minivans is expanding to grandparents."
" The sliding doors make it easy to get in. They travel a lot and carry stuff with them. And when they get to the grandkids' house, they have the van to take them around in. My in-laws own an Olds Silhouette. You won't see them in a commercial, but they know when they see the ad they can cart the grandkids around in a minivan."
Just as soccer moms do not buy only minivans, not every Lincoln Town Car is driven by old folks. The average age of new buyers of Town Cars, which is 67, does not reflect the many bought by fleet operators. But the sales to older people are important enough to Lincoln that it at times gives a discount to AARP members.
Even so, Lincoln does want to ensure that its buyers remember their youth, or something closer to it. 
Its new spokesman is a basketball star, smooth, successful -- and 44-year-old -- Magic Johnson.

Fathers and Sons
WHAT's stodgy and what's not?
These figures from 2002 show the average age of new-car buyers, for the five oldest models and the five youngest ones: 

OLDEST

Buick LeSabre 68
Buick Park Avenue 68
Lincoln Town Car 67
Mercury Grand Marquis 67

YOUNGEST

HEADLINE: CUSTOM-MADE; 
Mixing Rough Roads With Home Comforts

BYLINE:  By ALICIA AULT

 BODY:
WHEN most people dream about rumbling down back roads, cutting through canyons and climbing mountains, they usually fantasize about doing it in a Hummer or a Land Rover -- something big and brawny, tested on the Serengeti Plain or in a Middle Eastern desert. For a small, dedicated group of outdoor enthusiasts, though, the preferred way to go off-road is in a four-wheel-drive Sportsmobile van camper.
 At first, it looks like a conventional cargo van. But then you notice the oversize knobby tires, the nerf bars (custom bumpers), the fog lights and the high ground clearance. It says rough and tough, but in a friendly package. The Sportsmobile has a galley kitchen, sleeping space for four, a hot-water heater and a chemical toilet. 
 The first Sportsmobile was a do-it-yourself Volkswagen van customized in the late 1950's by Curtis Borsky, a tinkerer from Indiana. After his buddies saw it, he began to make more. Realizing he was onto something, Mr. Borsky approached VW, which gave him an exclusive license to modify its popular van in 1961.
The pop-topped VW van was an icon in that decade, a symbol of freedom, peace, love and understanding. It was so successful, a German company called Westfalia got in on the act, driving Mr. Borsky out of business with VW. The last VW customized by Sportsmobile rolled off the line in 1967.
But the company was also converting Ford, Chevrolet and Dodge vans, adding galleys, pop-tops and other touches. Sportsmobile sells only 350 four-wheel-drive campers a year but draws the same free-spirited buyer that it did in the 60's, said Alan Feld, the president of Sportsmobile West, the West Coast division of the company.
"We view ourselves as the Harley-Davidson of the RV world," Mr. Feld said, adding that a custom Sportsmobile takes four to six months to complete and costs $40,000 to $80,000. The company also sells a clothing line and brings owners together for adventure trips. (For more information, see the Web site at www.sportsmobile.co.) 
For four-wheel-drive models, Sportsmobile orders a bare cargo-van chassis -- the Ford E-350 Econoline Super Duty -- and adds off-road and interior components. Until June, the 4-by-4 component was added by Quigley Motor Company, in Manchester, Pa. Customers can now choose between Quigley or Sportsmobile, which is doing its own 4-by-4 conversions at its 60,000-square-foot plant in Fresno, Calif. The van comes with a 5.4-liter V-8 Triton, 6.8-liter V-10 Triton or 7.3-liter turbo diesel engine. According to Mr. Feld, 90 percent of buyers choose the diesel, which has better fuel economy at about 18 miles a gallon. Interiors are finished in Fresno or at Sportsmobile's Austin, Tex., or Huntington, Ind., plants. 
Mr. Feld, a former semiconductor salesman, bought a Sportsmobile in 1989, inspired by the first one he saw. After a year of being chased through parking lots, flagged down on highways and finding notes on his windshield asking about his van, he persuaded Sportsmobile to let him open a West Coast division, and he quit his job. 
A Sportsmobile draws the curious in droves. "I call it a 'man magnet,' " said Janine Petersen, 39, who has witnessed the phenomenon over the last nine summers while on the road with her husband, Craig, 55, in their 4-by-4 Sportsmobile.
Mrs. Petersen is a naturalist with the Orange County Department of Education in Newport Beach, Calif., and Mr. Petersen teaches biology and environmental science at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif. Their Sportsmobile, an extended version of the Ford E-350 with a turbo-diesel V-8, also tows a Sportsmobile-designed off-road trailer, loaded with mountain bikes, kayaks and coolers. The Petersens bought their first Sportsmobile for $50,000 in 1994, eight years after seeing one at an RV show. As former tent campers who did not care for supersize motor homes, they still wanted to get away from it all with luxuries. (Sportsmobiles are eligible for 15-year motor-home financing.)
The Petersens sold that van eight years later, and on New Year's Day, toasted their newest one at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. This summer, they covered 8,500 miles in 13 states.
Gary Smith, 48, of Parker, Colo., saw his first Sportsmobile at the Outdoor Retailer show in Salt Lake City, an annual convention of outdoor gear makers and retail buyers. Since buying his Sportsmobile in November 2002, he has logged 48,000 miles, cruising Colorado and Utah ski resorts selling Volkl snowboards in the winter and MBS mountain boards in the summer. 
Like the Petersens, he has found the Sportsmobile to be a big draw, especially when parked near the bottom of a ski lift with music booming from the $4,000 Pioneer DVD-CD surround-sound system.
Mr. Smith's fire-engine-red van is like a billboard, plastered with Volkl and other sports-gear logos. The ads have helped cover his monthly Sportsmobile payment. And because he sleeps in his van, he estimates that he saves about $5,000 a month in hotel bills. (A room in Aspen at the height of ski season can cost $300 a night.) 
Driving last winter in white-out conditions over Vail Pass, Mr. Smith realized he might not make it home. So he pulled into a state park and hunkered down. Thanks to an inverter (a device that converts DC power to AC power), he ran his heater off batteries all night. Total silence descended with the accumulating snow. In the morning, as he warmed up a mug of hot chocolate, Mr. Smith watched as a herd of elk surrounded him. "It was the most therapeutic night I ever spent in my life," he said. 
The Sportsmobile owners' group Web site on Yahoo (autos.groups.yahoo.com/group /sportsmobile--owners/) is full of similar stories, as well as tips on maintenance, destinations, power sources and add-ons. When owners spot one another on streets, in parking lots or in the back country, they tend to become fast friends.
Owners have also influenced the vans' interiors. Windsurfers, for instance, are core buyers because the Sportsmobile is well suited for maneuvering to a choice spot like the Columbia River Gorge, where the winds are too strong for tent camping. So the company makes an interior suited for windsurfers, with Neoprene-covered seats, a marine-grade rubber floor liner, storage racks for boards and a storage compartment with a drain for wet gear.
Sportsmobile has also built vehicles for mountain bikes, including one for Brian Lopes, the sport's world champion. Kennan Ward, a well-known wildlife photographer, has helped design a signature model with lockable cabinets throughout the vehicle for storing tripods and Lowepro camera backpacks. Mr. Ward, who photographs animals in their natural settings, also came up with the idea of zip-off screens for the pop-top, making it easier to capture elusive subjects like grizzly bears. 
No matter how it is customized, the Sportsmobile seems to sell itself. "It's the kind of vehicle that when people see one, they've just got to have one," Mr. Feld said.

HEADLINE: THE INTERNET; 
Online, Used Car Lots That Cover the Nation

BYLINE:  By GREGORY JORDAN

 BODY:
STEFAN ROSEN of Huntington, N.Y., had given the chassis and transmission of his 1993 Dodge Dakota a thorough going-over long before he saw it. He spotted his $4,000 pickup among more than two million car listings on AutoTrader.com and flew to Detroit, where a representative of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich., picked him up at the airport. Mr. Rosen test-drove the truck he had studied in high-resolution photographs online, bought it and drove it all the way home.
 In seeking buyers like Mr. Rosen, automakers and dealers invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Internet commerce ventures in the late 90's. Start-up companies promised that buying cars on the Internet would send auto dealers down the path of encyclopedia salesmen. And major newspapers, fearing competition for their lucrative classified car advertisements, even formed their own Web-based business, cars.com. 
 But the bursting of the dot-com bubble, coupled with car buyers' perpetual urge to kick the tires, has led to a rare harmony between computer clicks and test drives. For new cars, the Internet has changed the nature of haggling, as buyers compare Internet price quotes on vehicles in their region and either pick the lowest one or show up at the local dealership and demand that it be matched. 
For used cars, however, the change has been far more profound. The Internet has transformed a $376 billion market in which, according to CNW Marketing Research, almost 30 percent of the 42.6 million used cars sold in 2002 were bought using the Internet.
Used cars have always provided auto dealers with thousands of dollars more in profit per car than new ones. Last year, according to CNW, 12 million used cars were sold by individuals, 14 million by independent used-car dealers and 16 million by franchised dealers. Car experts say that the battle among cars.com, eBay, AutoTrader .com, autobytel.com, carmax.com and others for listings hinges on whose business model best suits dealers' advertising needs, as well as the buyers' ability to balance price with confidence in the transaction.
"The Internet has become an integral part of the used-car business," said Scott Weitzman, a senior director at J. D. Power & Associates. "Dealers have to be aggressive on the Internet to compete. Buyers do vast research by going to Kelley Blue Book and edmunds.com first, and then they go over to the transaction sites like AutoTrader and eBay. So both the buyer and the dealer save time and transaction costs, and these Web sites are fighting for the business of a very educated market."
Ebay, the Wall Street darling and dot-com survivor that has positioned itself as a middleman between sellers and buyers of items ranging from Lamborghinis to golf balls, started eBay Motors in 2000 and auctioned nearly $3 billion in cars last year. Half of eBay's listings come from dealers and half from individuals, and the company projects that its auctions will rise from 300,000 in 2002 to more than 500,000 in 2003, according to Simon Rothman, the global vice president of Ebay Motors.
"We have 10 million visitors and only tens of thousands of cars at any given time because we want more buyers than sellers," Mr. Rothman said of his efforts to keep eBay attracting car dealers nationwide. "We engender trust in the transaction by providing money-back guarantees and by giving the buyers an option to send their money to an escrow agent to delay payment until they test drive the vehicle." 
Ebay also concentrates on individually owned vehicles as well as inventory that dealers are having difficulty moving off the lot. It has also won a large portion of the specialty car market, which includes car collectors and people who want that rare Mustang.
The famed eBay business model, built on sight-unseen buying and good faith, meets a steep test when it comes to a business that has long been a byword for chicanery.
But many bidders have been happy with the results. Jan Small, of Sarasota, Fla., bought a 1997 Red BMW for $15,901 after a tense bidding battle. She says she will not hesitate to buy a car through eBay again.
"I printed out 15 pages of vehicle information and 24 photographs of the car before I bought it," Ms. Small said. "When I saw it, I felt like I knew it completely, little dings and all."
Ebay charges $40 for a car listing, and takes $40 when a car is sold. These fees are too steep for dealers like Wes Lutz, the Extreme Dodge owner in Michigan who sold Mr. Rosen his pickup.
"I prefer to pay a flat monthly fee with a company like AutoTrader," said Mr. Lutz, who managed the information technology committee for the National Auto Dealers Association for two years. "Ebay has that huge marketplace for all items, but cars are just a different commodity. The so-called kick of the tires is a necessity for our customer."
Mr. Rosen says he will never buy a used car without the test drive that brought him to Mr. Lutz's dealership. He said his $200 flight to Michigan saved him more than $2,000 on the truck.
"With cars, Internet buying just doesn't work," Mr. Rosen said. "To get under the hood, smell the interior -- sight-unseen buying is too tricky."
Instead, the dominant figure in the used-car market has become AutoTrader, which has captured 30 percent of the Internet transaction market, according to J. D. Power. (Among others, it says, eBay has 7 percent, cars.com 6 percent and carmax 11 percent, based on vehicles that are six years old or less.) Rather than carving out a direct path between buyers and sellers, AutoTrader has forged links with the traditional methods of selling cars: classified ads and used-car dealerships. 
AutoTrader's president and chief executive, Chip Perry, who was working on Internet ventures for The Los Angeles Times when he was hired by AutoTrader in 1997, said he thought that AutoTrader's online renovation of the old classifieds model accounted for the willingness of more than 40,000 dealers to list their inventories on AutoTrader's Web site. 
"We chose to focus on used cars from the very beginning," Mr. Perry said. "We thought the Internet offered dramatic potential to improve classified advertising, if we were willing to let go of the traditional newspaper business model of charging for every listing. Dealers could only afford to put 3 to 5 percent of their inventory in the paper, whereas now they can get everything up with photos for a monthly fee."
According to Mr. Perry, 10,000 dealers pay a $800 premium monthly fee to get higher placement on the site and to include extensive photographs. The site also sells ads to 250,000 private sellers who pay $45 to $75 for spaces with photographs and vehicle history. Buyers pay no fee. Experts say that this model allows dealers to lower their prices because of savings in advertising and transaction costs. 
One dealer who buys into the AutoTrader model is Mr. Lutz. He says his franchise sells approximately 25 used cars a month from the Internet and that AutoTrader generates the bulk of his online business.
"One of the strong points of AutoTrader for us is the weekly report they give us that tells me how many unique hits we are getting," Mr. Lutz said. "I know from this data that if I'm not selling cars, I'm not pricing or describing them correctly."
Dealers never heeded the prophecies that the Internet would render the business of middlemen irrelevant. Now they view sites like AutoTrader and eBay as tools that have helped refine their business and bolster their bottom lines.
"This is a much cheaper form of advertising than newspapers, with a much wider reach," said Jerry Murray, the Internet sales manager at Heritage Honda in Parkville, Md. "Though you will never be able to sell a car to a reasonable buyer sight unseen, the Internet helps buyers and dealers focus the transaction so much more quickly."

Buying or Selling
More people each year are buying or selling used cars over the Internet. In interviews, car experts, dealers and buyers offered this advice: 

Buyers
* Do not buy without taking a test-drive and having the vehicle checked by an independent mechanic.
* Print out quotes and pictures of similar cars from different dealers and use them as negotiating tools. 
* Before you fly to buy, ask the dealer for more photographs and information by e-mail.

Sellers
* Scan and post all records of the car's maintenance history. 
* Post only high-quality photographs: buyers will be suspicious of blurry images.
* More buyers are willing to fly long distances for the right car, so do not rule out faraway bids.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA/MOTOR CITY; 
The Motor City And California: Is It Splitsville?

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
CALIFORNIA and the Motor City used to be the perfect couple. 
 With its freeways and easygoing, put-the-top-down mentality, the Golden State was the car state of the nation -- and the car was most definitely made in America. Can you imagine the Beach Boys singing about imports? ("And she'll have fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the Honda Civic away.") Or try to envision Hollywood icons of days gone by -- McQueen and the Rat Pack -- in anything but the likes of Fords, Lincolns or Chevys? Of course not. But the freeways got clogged, American cars lost their ring-a-ding-ding and the romance soured. California remains the car state, but about the only new domestic sedans you see on the roads now are from the rental car lots of Avis, Hertz and Budget. 
 For three decades, Detroit and the Golden State have been accumulating irreconcilable differences. And lately, like all failing marriages, the lawyers have become involved. 
Trouble comes on two fronts. First, the state's regulators and environmental groups have been fighting the automobile industry on air quality for years and have become a far more aggressive regulatory forum than Washington. The industry is expected to sue California over its plan to become the first state to regulate tailpipe emissions of gases that are linked to climate change.
Second, and even worse for Detroit, is apathy from California consumers, who buy more than one out of every nine vehicles sold in the United States. The traditional Big Three domestic automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group, a division of DaimlerChrysler of Germany -- still sell plenty of sport utility vehicles and pickups here. But the sales challenges that the Big Three face nationwide are far worse in California, the nation's largest auto market and an important trendsetter. 
"In California, people used to write songs about T-Birds and Corvettes," said William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Ford, at an industry conference last year. "Today they write regulations." 
Actually, the Big Three no longer exist as such in California, which trails only Connecticut and Washington D.C. in the percentage of import sales. Nationally, G.M., Ford and Chrysler still rank as the top three automakers by volume, even though their market share fell to a record low in August. 
But not here. 
In California, Toyota is the top-selling brand, though nationwide it is third, behind Ford and Chevrolet, according to R. L. Polk & Company, a consumer marketing group in Southfield, Mich. Honda is the state's third- most popular retail brand, behind Ford. 
Among automakers, the Chrysler Group, which includes the Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands, ranks fifth in California, but it is third nationwide. In the state, G.M. has 18 percent of the retail market, a far cry from its 27 percent national share in 2002.
And if the Big Three command roughly 60 percent of the nation's auto market, more Asian vehicles than domestics are sold in California, according to Polk.
"The domestics think of California as another country, almost," said Lonnie Miller, the director for analytical services at Polk.
Indeed, said Gary Dilts, Chrysler's senior vice president for sales, "It's a long way from Detroit and it's certainly a different culture," adding that the company recently put a new marketing team in place in the state to try to revise its strategy.
"Vehicle trends develop and start in California, and those of us who live here like to think they move east," said Mike Jackson, G.M.'s regional general manager who oversees 15 states in the West. 
G.M., which is still the world's largest automaker by volume, has embarked on an aggressive strategy of its own. 
The company has held several auto shows throughout the state that let residents test G.M.'s vehicles against the competition, partly to get a second chance with customers who do not consider buying domestics. 
"I like to say the road to greater share for G.M. nationally goes through California," Mr. Jackson said. "If we can find a way to get greater share here, we could get greater share nationally."
There are some ingrained disadvantages for Detroit in California, like the residents' affinity for companies from the Pacific rim. Not only is Southern California the base of North American operations for the Japanese Big Three -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- but the state also has large Asian and Hispanic populations that make for a high degree of diversity.
"You've got a very cosmopolitan audience, people coming from all walks of life and many other countries," Mr. Miller said. "People in L.A. have been around the block more times than people in Dubuque."
The state has a car-loving culture that craves new products, and in the last few years, Ford and Chrysler have been bleeding red ink, cutting costs and slow to put newly designed vehicles on the market.
Why is there so little interest in modern American cars? "All the cars look the same," said Janet Massey, a 54-year-old part-time bookkeeper who lives outside Fresno. With her husband, Brian, she has a 1965 Mustang and a 1967 Pontiac Firebird that she has owned since 1969. She sits on the board of a local classic car show, and her husband belongs to a car club called Pontiacs of Central California. 
"It's hard to put your finger on what was so special about those cars in the 60's," Ms. Massey said, adding that today's cars have "no personality."
Chris Cedergren, an analyst at Iceology, a market research company based in Los Angeles, said, "Our offices are on the west side of L.A., and the only domestics you see are trucks -- Tahoes, Chevy Suburbans. Other than that, they don't exist." 
Light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans -- remain an area of strength for the Big Three, but they still face increasing competition from overseas. Three out of 10 Hummers are sold in California -- and the state's new governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has been Hummer's biggest celebrity enthusiast. As for cars, the strength of domestics has been in the marginally profitable fleet business. Ford, Chevy and Dodge command more than half the state's fleet sales, a presence that can reinforce an image of blandness.
Midwestern auto executives are also vexed by their perpetual feuds with California's smog-battling regulators and environmental groups. Last year, the state passed the nation's first legislation aimed at curbing automotive emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which are linked by many, but not all, scientists to global warming trends.
And this month, California planned to sue the Environmental Protection Agency over the Bush administration's decision saying that the agency did not have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. 
The state's plan to regulate automotive emissions of greenhouse gases has not been well received by Detroit, and a legal challenge -- only the latest from the industry -- is most likely. 
An editorial cartoon in The Detroit News captured some of the industry's sentiment. It showed a Californian driving a car with a muffler bolted over his mouth. The caption read, "California's Regulating Carbon Dioxide From Automobiles." Two conservatively dressed Midwestern types watch from the sidewalk, with looks that seem to say "what will those crazy tree-huggers think of next?" (For the record, the state intends to regulate carbon dioxide coming from tailpipes, not from the mouths of its drivers.)
Detroit cannot afford to take the state's actions lightly. Because its clean air regulations predate the federal Clean Air Act of 1970, California was allowed to maintain its own tougher regulations. Since the state is the nation's largest auto market, this fact alone would make it formidable, but other states also have the option to follow California's air regulations instead of Washington's.
Northeastern states like Massachusetts, New York and Vermont do just that, giving the state effective regulatory control over one-fifth of the auto market. 
In Washington, Midwestern Democrats frequently align with Republicans on regulatory issues, effectively blocking significant increases in fuel economy or emission regulations. But California has no Midwestern Democrats in its legislature, as well as a history of smog and a minuscule domestic auto manufacturing base, so it has become a much more solicitous regulatory battleground for environmental groups, many of which are based in the state. 
One protracted battle recently ended when G.M. and Chrysler dropped a lawsuit over the state's Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate, which requires automakers to make millions of vehicles with low or zero emissions over the next couple of decades. 
For 13 years, the state and the industry fought over the measure. But because auto production cycles take years, the Z.E.V. mandate, as it is known, forced the industry to produce a multitude of green car prototypes. 
Last month, the French tire company Michelin sponsored a green car competition in Sonoma, Calif., and many of the vehicles on display could have partly attributed their existence to the Z.E.V. mandate. 
As part of the event, dozens of cars of unusual shapes and sizes paraded across the Golden Gate Bridge, with the technologies depending on their origin. The Germans brought relatively clean versions of diesel cars, which are popular in Europe, and the Japanese brought hybrids -- their preferred solution to reducing emissions and improving fuel economy. G.M. brought its fuel cell prototypes, including Hy-wire, a car that has no dashboard and has its entire drive system under the floor. 
The state has "squeezed a lot out of that in terms of forcing the industry to invest in innovation," said Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club in San Francisco, referring to the mandate. "The sad thing is that everybody invested in it because they had to, but the only ones getting anything out of it are Toyota and Honda."
Mr. Pope was talking about the two companies' hybrids, cars that supplement their gas-fed internal combustion with electric power. So far, only Toyota and Honda have put hybrids on the road. The 2004 version of the Toyota Prius hybrid, which gets about 50 miles a gallon and qualifies as what California regulators call an advanced technology partial zero emission vehicle, or A.T.-P.Z.E.V., was one of the top performers in the competition.
California, though, could hardly be simplified as a tree-hugging state. In fact, the recent growth of light truck sales there has been slightly higher than the already voracious pace of the nation. 
Nationally, light trucks account for more than half of all new vehicle sales, up from about a fifth in 1980. 
"You could say California is talking out of both sides of its mouth," Mr. Miller of Polk said. "You have such a large pool of vehicle buyers that you can find a place for just about anything there."
Mr. Cedergren of Iceology thinks that environmental concerns have "not an ounce" of correlation to the Big Three's troubles in the state, and certainly not in Southern California. 
"In L.A., it's all about image and fashion," he said. And that has not been a resonating feature of the modern American car. 
Jim Jordan, 33, a T-shirt printer in San Diego, loves cars. He has a 1950 blue Mercury, a 1957 Chevy truck and a 1964 T-Bird. He belongs to a local car club, called the Spares, whose bylaws require that "all cars must be pre-'Summer of Love' " because "hippies killed the automobile." 
So why do he and his wife also have a 1991 Mazda -- for everyday driving?
"They last longer," Mr. Jordan said, adding that he felt that since modern cars were drained of style, he looked for dependability instead. 
"You can have a 10-year-old foreign car and you know you're going to get 200,000 miles out of it. If you've got a domestic car with over 100,000 miles on it, you know you have to do stuff to it," he said. "You don't want to have your chin under the hood with the car your wife drives to pick up the kids."

HEADLINE: Asian Journey; 
In South India, No End of Spice, No End of Flavor

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: KOCHI, India 

 BODY:
KERALA is a mere frond of a state, long and narrow, green and fertile -- 15,000 palm-sheltered square miles in southwest India, rimmed by mountains called the Western Ghats, washed by the Arabian Sea and laced by an idyllic tangle of lakes and streams known as the Backwaters.
 Its people, known as Malayalees, call it "God's own country" or "the blessed land," not least because of its irresistible food. 
 For centuries, long before the steamship, long before the jet plane, venturesome traders rode the trade winds to Kerala. Romans, Phoenicians, Chinese, Arabs, Portuguese, Frenchmen, Dutchmen and Britons all came here, and so did Jewish merchants from Venice. St. Thomas the Apostle is said to have landed along this coast in A.D. 52, and Christopher Columbus was headed west in search of Kerala's fabled spices when he stumbled upon America. 
Each group of outsiders brought along their own culinary traditions, and each adapted to their new circumstances. The Arabs contributed fennel and fenugreek. On their quest for black pepper, the Portuguese carried the cashews and chilies they had discovered in the New World, changing forever the way the subcontinent eats. The Jews clung to kosher dietary restrictions, but they added green chilies and coriander to their meals.
Blending all these influences with the abundant native spices and coconut has yielded a light, bright and vividly varied cuisine, little known to the rest of the world and totally different from the hearty tandooris and creamy curries of arid northern India.
Happily, the culinary pleasure here lasts from daybreak through dinner. Sit down at breakfast, and you may be served luscious mango preserves or the most delectable fresh pineapple juice imaginable, together with the savory rice-and-lentil sourdough dumplings known as idlis and a bracing tomato chutney or perhaps some lime pickle.
In modern Kerala, Hindus, Christians, Muslims and the few remaining Jews (most having left for Israel or other countries after World War II) all speak the same language, Malayalam, which has given the world the words teak and atoll. Their profound commitment to religious tolerance is symbolized by a venerable custom, known as pakarcha, of sharing the celebratory dishes of one's own faith with friends of different religions. My wife, Betsey, and I began to absorb some of this rich cultural history early on the first morning of an extended stay in Kerala. 
We were picked up at our hotel, the Brunton Boatyard in Fort Cochin, which faces a channel plied day and night by an endless parade of ferries, rice barges, fishing boats and oil tankers, for an eye-opening trip across the water to Ernakulam.
(Kochi, the hub of Kerala, used to be called Cochin. It has three parts. If the vast harbor here were San Francisco Bay, which it rather resembles, evocative old Fort Cochin would be where San Francisco is, with the hotel at the Presidio, and raucous, fast-growing Ernakulam would be in Berkeley's place. Between the two is Willingdon Island, a landfill dating from colonial days.)
With one hand on the wheel of his little Hyundai van, the other on the horn, our driver, V. J. Paul, managed to safely negotiate streets clogged with trucks, buses, trishaws, bicycles, discarded refrigerators and goats -- especially goats. 
We passed hibiscus tumbling out of walled gardens, countless signs advertising computer classes and women carrying water jugs on their heads, then crossed a brand-new harbor bridge. Eventually, Mr. Paul stopped at a trim little house, an island of calm in a maelstrom, and hopped out.
His wife, Nimmy, a cooking teacher, greeted Betsey by twining jasmine flowers in her hair and placing a dot of sandalwood paste on her forehead.
Small and slim, dressed in a traditional white Keralan sari with yellow and navy bands at the edges of the fabric, she began with a chicken kuruma, a Mappila (Keralan Muslim) adaptation of the classic Kashmiri korma, flavored with onions, green chili and a staggering quantity of coriander. It was thickened not with cream or yogurt but with coconut milk and cashew paste.
"My grinding stones have gone into the garden," Mrs. Paul told me as she made the paste. "We use food processors now."
PARTLY because so many Keralites have lived abroad (1.5 million of them are now in the Persian Gulf), where they have been exposed to the temptations of steaks, chops, sausages and kebabs, vegetarianism is on the wane here. The Hindu, a national newspaper, reported recently that people in Kochi "are on a meaty binge," and some of the local vegetarian restaurants have closed.
But Mrs. Paul continues to turn out Hindu-influenced vegetarian dishes for her family as well as her students. One of her classics is avial, a ragout of vegetables, in which she uses matchstick-size pieces of carrot, cucumber, green beans, drumstick (long, ridged pods from the moringa oleifera tree, rich in vitamin C, with a delicate flavor resembling that of asparagus), kovakka or little melon (a kind of gherkin) and brinjal, a longish eggplant.
First she boils the vegetables with green chilies. Then she adds a mixture with the texture of oatmeal, including turmeric, coconut, garlic and cumin, along with home-made cow's-milk curd and kari leaves (highly aromatic and widely used in Kerala, these are often confusingly called curry leaves in the West; they look like basil leaves and taste of citrus and bell peppers).
Sambar, a lentil and vegetable stew, makes use of two unusual spices. Asafetida, a resin taken from the rhizomes of giant fennel, is admired in Kerala for its earthy scent when fried in oil, and fenugreek seeds are liked for their bitter caramel flavor. Together with tamarind, a souring agent, chilies and coriander leaves, they give the stew intricate layers of flavor.
Stir-fries called thorens are noted regional specialties. Usually made with a single ingredient, like beets or spinach (or a fish), their appearance is heralded by the sound of mustard seeds popping in a skillet or wok and releasing their pungent aroma. Grated unsweetened coconut, a masala or spice mixture, chilies and the ubiquitous kari leaves complete the dish.
"Thorens are a daily item," Mrs. Paul commented as she glided around her clutterless kitchen, which has a red cement floor and a big overhead fan but no air-conditioning. "You must have a thoren."
Unlike many Indians, Malayalees eat beef, but they eat a lot more seafood -- shrimp and crab and all sorts of ocean fish, notably seer, a mackerel with mild, firm flesh that looks like a miniature tuna.
Mrs. Paul showed us two fish preparations, the first of which, called molee, is a great favorite of the local Syrian Christians, as the descendants of early settlers from Baghdad and Nineveh call themselves. It is a must for wedding feasts and Christmas.
Molee is made by frying a brown masala in coconut oil with other ingredients, combining the resulting paste with the fish and simmering it all in thinned coconut milk.
Our second fishy treat was made from an heirloom Jewish recipe given to Mrs. Paul by an elderly woman in Kochi. Red and green chilies gave a jolt of heat to seared fillets, which had been fried until dark and crunchy, and coconut vinegar added a stab of acidity. That much we figured out for ourselves. But there was something else in there, something sweet, musky, mysterious. After we made several stabs in the dark, Mrs. Paul told us. It was cardamom.
THE coconut palm, I quickly came to realize, is the mainstay of Malayalee life. Its leaves are used for thatch, its fiber for rope, its roots for firewood, its trunk for furniture. And in the Keralite kitchen, coconut flesh, oil, milk and vinegar are indispensable sources of both flavor and texture.
Kochi markets offer a limited choice. Some kinds of vegetables, especially gourds and squashes, are plentiful, and 27 varieties of bananas grow here, large and small, red and yellow. So do the succulent Alphonso mangoes. But the kaleidoscopic variety of Southeast Asian markets is lacking.
Kerala is a poor place, with an annual gross domestic product per person of about $1,000, poor even by Indian standards, as poor as Cambodia and the Sudan. But it is also a striking example, as Akash Kapur argued in The Atlantic in 1998, of poor people living well. The Malayalees' houses and clothing may be simple, but their life expectancy is 72 years, close to the American average; the infant mortality rate is low; and population is under control.
Most impressively, the school system is extensive, reaching into every village, and the literacy rate is a startling 90 percent, in the same high echelon as Singapore.
"Everybody reads," said Thomas Phillip, the urbane managing director of Cochin Spices Ltd. "Even the guy who digs ditches, who can't afford his own newspaper, goes to a tea shop every day and reads theirs."
Syrian Christians -- instantly recognizable by their biblical surnames, like Phillip, Thomas, Andrew, Peter and Paul -- have shaped much that is distinctive about life in Kerala. "Christianity," wrote Arundhati Roy in her whirling, dreamlike novel, "The God of Small Things" (Random House, 1997), "arrived in a boat and seeped into Kerala like tea from a teabag."
Accounting for only a quarter of Kerala's 33 million people, the Syrian Christians are an energetic and ambitious group, entrepreneurial, philanthropic and devoted to higher education. They have had a large impact as well on the world of cuisine. Mrs. K. M. Mathew, who died last summer, was Kerala's leading cookbook author, with 24 titles to her credit.
AS I said, our Kochi base was the charming and cozy Brunton Boat-yard, part of the remarkable Casino Group. We later stayed at two of its other hotels, Spice Village, in the mountains, and Coconut Lagoon, in the Backwaters. The group, owned by the six Dominic brothers, builds its hotels in vernacular styles, emphasizes environmental sensitivity and serves superb regional cooking.
"We're not in the marble palace business," Jose Dominic, the managing director, told me one day. "We think luxury lies in the quality of the client's experience instead of the quality of the decor. Kerala is a late entrant in the tourism sweepstakes, and if we do it right we have a chance to avoid the excess of Bali and Phuket."
At the Coconut Lagoon, the chef, Raju Pik, sets out a spectacular dinner buffet that includes, in addition to meat and fish curries and grills, a dozen or so vegetarian dishes, including a banana-flower thoren, each with its own taste, aroma, color and texture. Monochromatic mush won't do in Kerala, where I saw on a single block of a single street a cascade of magenta flowers, a purple umbrella, a baby-blue church, a yellow house next to a pink one and two red saris.
The Boatyard's main restaurant, called the History, tells Kerala's tale in a 20-page menu devised by Sunitha Divakaran, the first woman Malayalee executive chef. Among the many dishes that excited my admiration were crisply fried, subtly spiced bites of okra; Vinha d'Alio, a vinegary, chili-laden pork dish of Portuguese origin, the granddaddy of vindaloo curries; chutullimeen, a flattened fish marinated in green spices and pearl onions "from the Jewish recipe books of Fort Cochin"; juicy king prawns in the Arab style, marinated in yogurt and spices, pan-fried and served atop saffron rice; and amaranth kootu, a vegetarian curry made with spinachlike leaves.
We soaked up as much tradition eating at the History as we did on our sightseeing rounds of Fort Cochin the next day, featuring visits to the huge, cantilevered Chinese fishing nets along the foreshore, whose design dates from the time of Kublai Khan, and the Dutch-gabled St. Francis Church, where Vasco da Gama was buried in 1524. The church is filled with plaques paying wistful tribute to English clerics, teachers, doctors and lawyers who died while serving here, so far from home.
The chandelier-lit 16th-century synagogue in Jew Town, where only four families now worship, is even more poignant.
Yosef Hallegua, one of the last "white Jews of Cochin," talked sadly early this year about his dwindling little community. "It's a great pity the younger generation left," he told a writer for The Financial Times. "I went to Israel for one month, but it was not home. This is home, and naturally I am an Indian. Soon it will all end."
Another evening, we indulged ourselves in another local culinary tradition: the fish barbecue in the shady Fort Cochin garden restaurant of the Casino Hotel, yet another Dominic property, this one on Willingdon Island, halfway across the harbor.
We ate some prawns fried with chili and coriander seeds to start with, dipping them in a soothing mint sauce. It wasn't strictly Keralite, but it was strictly delicious, and it perfectly tamed the boisterous prawns.
Then a waiter wheeled over a cart laden with scrupulously fresh local fish and asked which we would like to taste. On offer were halibut, gray mullet, red snapper, gray snapper and black pomfret, all ocean fish, all caught by day boats, and pearl spot, a dainty, bony fish caught in the brackish Backwaters. Because I had eaten frozen and not-fresh-enough pomfret in Indian restaurants in Europe and the United States, I was eager to taste the real thing.
The rich, oily, deep-bodied black pomfret belongs to the same family as Florida's pompanos and amberjacks. Perfectly grilled over an open fire, with just enough spice added to make things interesting, but not so much as to obscure the sweet, fresh taste of the flesh, with a simple sauce of melted butter on the side, my fish was remarkable. Suddenly, I understood why Indians go to great lengths to get their hands on even an inferior specimen.
In her authoritative book, "Savoring the Spice Coast of India" (HarperCollins, 2000), Maya Kamail, the daughter of a Keralite father and an American mother, writes: "some of the best food in Kerala is eaten for breakfast or as a snack. Pancakes, dumplings or noodles provide the starchy element for the lighter meals of the day."
What an understatement that proved to be! There are the breads eaten all across India, like flaky paratha and puffy pooris, plus a Mappila yeast bread called kameer. There are those spongy breakfast idlis, whose fermented batter gives them a slightly sour taste; a noodle dish called upuma and a whole range of yeasty rice pancakes called appams, some of which Mrs. Paul made for us. As the Indian food writer Madhur Jaffrey says, "if a French crepe were to marry an English muffin, they would probably become the proud parents of appams." Most are used to scoop up the stews and curries that Keralites love.
But to taste Kerala's quintessential fast food, you must visit a dosa shop, preferably the Pai Brothers' open-air, pink-walled bare-bones stand in a garish alley off M. G. (for Mahatma Gandhi) Road in Ernakulam. Thirty-six types of sourdough crepes are listed on the blackboard. No. 21, say, has tomato, onion and masala (in this context, a spicy potato mixture), or No. 13, roasted onions. Watch the dosa-master spread the rice flour and lentil batter on a griddle with the back of his ladle, add the fillings and sprinkle it all lavishly with pepper.
While the dosas cook, take your place on a plastic chair at a plastic table, and after a while the dosas arrive on big, round tin trays called thalis, folded over like Spanish tortillas. We loved their eggy, slightly fermented, boldly spiced taste; we loved the jolly, talkative brothers who made them; and we loved the price, too: 50 rupees (about $1.10) for two big dosas and a Coke.

HEADLINE: Ban on Videos for Oscar Voters May Be Lifted 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Jack Valenti, the chief lobbyist for the movie industry, is expected this week to reverse an edict barring studios from sending videos of their films to Academy Award voters, two industry executives involved in the discussions said on Tuesday. The ban, instituted three weeks ago as an anti-piracy measure, touched off a revolt in Hollywood.
 In allowing videotapes to be given to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Mr. Valenti, chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America, will have struck a compromise between major studios worried about piracy and independent studios that feared their movies would not be seen by Oscar voters if the ban remained. 
 But before any announcement is made, several issues must still be resolved. The studios have yet to decide what technology will be used to encode the screening tapes so that their owners can be easily identified if the tapes end up online or are sold illegally. And studios are still haggling over who, beyond academy voters, will receive them.
The ban on screening tapes has been widely seen as a public relations disaster for Mr. Valenti, who was criticized throughout the industry; many in Hollywood said he had not considered the consequences of the association's decision. While he has been a longtime advocate for the industry, the recent edict has cast a pall over his expected retirement.
Art-house studios were the first to complain, fearing they would be deprived of the needed exposure that comes with award nominations. Days later more than 300 film actors and directors, including Robert Redford and Martin Scorsese, also condemned the action. In the most recent salvo, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association said last weekend that it would not give out any awards unless the ban was dropped.
Several studios were adamantly opposed to sending out screening tapes, including 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers Pictures, whose chief executive, Barry Meyer, had the idea for the ban. Other studios, including Universal Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment, took a more conciliatory approach.
Any deal is days away and could still fall apart, said the executives involved in the discussions, who insisted on anonymity. The biggest obstacle, they said, is persuading all the studio heads to reach a consensus. They also said that the agreement was a stopgap and would most likely be changed next year. 
One of the executives said that Mr. Valenti had assured the studios that the academy, which gives out the Oscars, would play a larger role in policing its 5,600 members. He added that the academy had said that it would warn members not to give screening tapes away and to destroy them once they had been watched. If a tape given to a member turned up for sale online or on the black market, the member would risk expulsion from the academy.
Academy members are already barred from distributing screening tapes. But in the last few years many have refused to follow their own rules, giving them to family members and friends. Last year tapes for several Oscar-nominated films were pirated and found online or on the black market.
"I can't see any academy member saying this is outrageous," an executive said of the revised edict. "It removes the blind spot on personal responsibility."
A spokesman for the academy said he would not comment on the proposal. Mr. Valenti has also declined to comment on the discussions.
The two executives involved said that other groups giving out awards -- among them industry guilds, critics' associations and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which distributes the Golden Globes -- would be approached to see if they would agree to similar terms. If not, the studios would be expected to hold more theater screenings, particularly in New York and Los Angeles, to accommodate those groups.
Representatives of several studios first talked last week about a compromise. Several solutions were discussed, including allowing DVD's or videotapes of movies released in fewer than 800 theaters to be sent to academy members. That proposal was rejected as unfair and too restrictive.
Some members also suggested distributing movies on video compact discs, used widely abroad. While VCD's can be copied, the resulting quality is not nearly as good as that of DVD's. Under the current discussions, only encoded videotapes would be distributed for screening purposes.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Some Wholly New Work For Old Washington Hand

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
All last week, a stocky white-haired man could be seen prowling the corridors of the Capitol, a can of Diet Coke stuffed in his coat pocket, an American flag made of safety pins on his lapel. As he lumbered about, mingling with senators and reporters, he evoked an air of familiarity, as if he had been there a long, long time.
 The man is Tom C. Korologos, confidant of senators and presidents and, for decades, one of Washington's most influential Republican lobbyists. Yet Mr. Korologos, who is such a fixture on Capitol Hill that he is often called the 101st senator, was not representing the usual corporate clients. 
 Rather, he was doing the bidding of the White House on Iraq.
In May, the 70-year-old Mr. Korologos (pronounced kor-oh-LOH-gohs) retired from Timmons & Company, the firm he co-founded in 1976, to become senior adviser to L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq. He spent four months in Baghdad, tutoring Mr. Bremer on the ways of Congress and escorting lawmakers on fact-finding trips. Then he returned to Washington to help wage an intense lobbying effort to persuade Congress to approve President Bush's $87 billion emergency spending request for Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Yet Mr. Korologos's transformation from high-priced corporate advocate to Pentagon employee -- he has the identification tags to prove it -- has created some suspicion in Washington, where lobbyists do not ordinarily take pay cuts out of the goodness of their hearts. Some wonder if he or former Timmons clients like Boeing, Unocal and AT&T might benefit later from his new Iraq connections.
"It seems to me there are a lot of potential clients that he has worked for in the past who certainly would have a stake in the Iraq economy right now," said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch. "He now has the inside track. He knows Bremer, he knows what's going on on the ground. Maybe he's going to set up a little boutique operation."
Mr. Korologos says he has severed all financial ties with Timmons and has no intention of profiting from his Iraq experience.
"I'm not going to start a company," he said. "I'm 70 years old. I'm not going to run a marathon when this is over."
He said this last Thursday, over a Diet Coke and a tuna fish sandwich that he had bought at a Senate snack shop. The shop had not been serving, but Mr. Korologos knew all the counter clerks, so he had no trouble getting something to eat. Then, lacking an office, he ushered a reporter to a bench in a sunny corner of the Capitol.
He said he was giving a speech at the University of Utah in May when he remarked that he "would serve this country whenever called." When he got back to his hotel, he said, the office of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld telephoned, asking him to go to Baghdad. Then Mr. Bremer called. "I said, 'Did you guys hear my speech?' " Mr. Korologos recalled.
"He is the point man," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, "and it is clear that the White House trusts him."
Many White Houses have trusted Mr. Korologos. A Utah native who came to Washington in 1963 to work for a home-state senator, Wallace F. Bennett, father of Senator Robert F. Bennett, Mr. Korologos has been advising Republican administrations since Richard M. Nixon was president. As a lobbyist representing baseball owners, he had as a client George W. Bush, then an owner of the Texas Rangers.
Controversial White House nominations are his specialty; he estimates that he has shepherded hundreds of nominees, including Mr. Rumsfeld, through the Senate confirmation process. Some say sending him to Baghdad was a stroke of brilliance by Mr. Rumsfeld, because Mr. Korologos is now uniquely positioned to sell the administration's Iraq policy to lawmakers. 
Senator Trent Lott, former majority leader, speaks Mr. Korologos's name in the same breath as those of Mr. Bremer and Gen. John P. Abizaid, the American commander in the Persian Gulf region.
"Other than Bremer and Abizaid," Mr. Lott said, "he's the most important guy over there."
But Mr. Korologos does not intend to spendmuch more time "over there." He agreed to stay on with Mr. Bremer for six months, which is just about up. He is not certain if he will return to Baghdad.
"I'm tired," he said. "As soon as the bill passes and they sign it, I'm going to fade away."

HEADLINE: Public College Tuition Rose 14% in '03, Survey Finds 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
The nation's public universities raised tuitions by 14 percent this year, the steepest increase in at least a quarter century, if not significantly longer, according to the latest annual survey by the College Board. 
 Tuition at community colleges across the country also rose 14 percent, the second largest increase since 1976, the earliest year for which the College Board reports data. 
 In both cases, the increases, which come out to 13 percent when adjusted for inflation, were largely driven by cuts in state spending on education, the College Board said.
Private universities raised tuitions by 6 percent, itself not an unusual increase in recent years. But after adjusting for inflation, 2003 was the third consecutive year that private universities raised tuitions by at least 5 percent, more than twice the rate of inflation. 
The last time a series of comparable increases occurred was in the mid-1980's, when families were enjoying a much healthier economy than they are now. 
As a result of the increases, tuitions reached an average of $19,710 at private colleges, $4,694 at public universities and $1,905 at community colleges, more than twice what these institutions cost 20 years ago, even after adjusting for inflation.
"There is no denying the bad news," said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, which represents colleges. He added, "But percentage increases in tuition do not tell the entire story." 
Indeed, financial aid in the form of grants and loans surpassed $105 billion this year, also a record, helping to defray much of the increases in tuition, the College Board said.
Grants did not keep pace with tuition increases at either public or private universities, but they did soften the impact, according to the survey. After taking scholarships into account, students ended up paying only $343 more at public universities last year than they did in 1992, with adjustments for inflation, although tuition officially went up by more than $1,100 in that period. 
The mitigating role of scholarships also meant that students at private universities wound up paying $2,799 more in adjusted dollars last year than they did a decade earlier, despite a sticker price for private colleges that rose by nearly $5,300 during that time.
And because of the growth in grants, students at community colleges actually paid $591 less in adjusted dollars last year than they did in 1992, the survey found.
For the most part, tuition at public colleges rose so fast this year to compensate for the declining government support of state campuses, the College Board said. Although its report did not track state appropriations in the current fiscal year, a separate survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures this summer found that total state spending on higher education dropped 2.2 percent this year, with some states trimming their expenditures by 9 percent or more. 
Even so, Republicans in the House took issue with the College Board report, saying it let universities "off the hook" by focusing on factors colleges could not control, rather than on their own mismanagement and unwillingness to cut costs. 
"Hyperinflation in college costs has been pummeling parents and students for more than a decade, and the problem has not been a lack of spending by states or the federal government," said Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. "Even when states were increasing their investment in higher education, college tuition was skyrocketing." 
The College Board defended its methodology and conclusions, however, pointing to historical trends illustrating that public institutions tend to raise tuition when states scale back financial support.
"The facts speak for themselves," said Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board. "We don't change them whatsoever. No way are we going to fudge anything, or the report has no value."
Colleges have been particularly anxious over the release of the report this year, worried that it would be used to justify federal legislation to curb tuition increases. Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, proposed such a bill last week.
While the increases in tuition were expected, other aspects of the report were not. One of its most surprising findings was the degree to which scholarships from universities themselves have shifted from low-income students to wealthier ones. 
Among financial aid recipients, for example, students from families earning $83,000 or more typically received larger scholarships from both public and private universities than their counterparts from families earning less than $31,000. 
Some of that disparity can be explained by the fact that higher-income students tend to go to more expensive universities, so their scholarships are often larger to cover the higher price.
But the discrepancy also illustrates an increased effort by universities to spend their financial aid money luring top prospects, the College Board said, regardless of their incomes.

HEADLINE: Rights Group Exposes Conditions in North Korean Prison Camps 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
A new report on human rights in North Korea says hundreds of thousands of prisoners work in often life-threatening conditions in at least 36 camps hidden in isolated valleys and mountains of the closed Stalinist country.
 Torture, meager rations and the imprisonment of entire families are routine, according to the report, which draws on the accounts of 30 former prisoners and prison guards, including several North Koreans who were later among the tens of thousands who have fled to China to escape famine and repression. 
 In a new step, satellite photographs are matched with information from recent prisoners in the 125-page report, to be released on Wednesday by a private, nonpartisan group based in Washington.
"All the prison facilities are characterized by very large numbers of deaths in detention from forced, hard labor accompanied by deliberate starvation-level food rations," charged the report, "The Hidden Gulag: Exposing North Korea's Prison Camps." 
It was written by David Hawk, an American human rights investigator who spent a decade chronicling Cambodia's genocide, and was commissioned by the private U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.
The report comes as the Bush administration seeks to devise a policy toward North Korea, which claims to be processing material for nuclear weapons and is thought by American intelligence services to possess at least two atomic bombs.
The administration is pressing China to stop repatriating escapees from North Korea, and next week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to hear testimony from Hwang Jang Yop, North Korea's highest-ranking defector. Next month, Amnesty International is to release a report focusing in part on what it says is North Korea's use of international food aid as a political weapon.
Many of Mr. Hawk's informants have been interviewed by The New York Times and other American newspapers. The camps they describe range from closed labor camps where prisoners serve life sentences to detention centers that the report says were created to punish migrants repatriated from China. 
Eight survivors of the repatriation camps said mortality rates there were very high.
Seven of the labor camps were identified in satellite photos provided by two Denver-based companies, DigitalGlobe and Space Imaging.
American officials have declined to release photos of labor camps in North Korea, saying they do not want to reveal precisely what spy satellite are able to detect.
North Korean labor camps, the report says, are designed along Soviet lines, relying on forced labor for economic production. Emulating their Soviet mentors, the North Koreans maintain strict secrecy over the camps, apparently trying to minimize foreign condemnation and internal unrest.
"The North Korean camps were built according to a Stalinist model, and they continue to be run that way," Anne Applebaum, author of "Gulag: a History" (Doubleday), writes in an introduction to the report. "As in Stalin's time, North Korea's leadership doesn't want anyone to know any of these details, since such revelations not only will damage their foreign reputations but put their own regimes at risk."
The report quotes former prison guards, including Ahn Myong Chol, who worked at four camps, as saying that inmates were unusually thin, short and aged-looking, and that "large numbers" were amputees or disabled by work accidents.
Lee Young Kuk, a former guard for the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, reported that during his five years in labors camps in the late 1990's his weight dropped from 207 pounds to 128. Other former prisoners reported similar weight loss, Mr. Hawk said.
An Hyuk, a North Korean student who said he was forcibly repatriated from China in 1987, worked at Yodok Camp No. 15, where he said his first job was to wade waist deep into an icy river to gather stones and build a water diversion channel, Mr. Hawk reported. Scores of people died from exposure, or lost toes and fingers to frostbite, the report says.
Kim Tae Jin was also a prisoner at Yodok in the late 1980's and saw deaths from malnutrition and related diseases every week, the report says.
Work with livestock was considered a plum job, because "the prisoners had the opportunity to steal animal food and even pick through animal droppings for undigested grains," the report says, citing the experience of Kim Yong, a trading company executive imprisoned in the mid-1990's in penal colony No. 14. Mr. Kim, now 53, is to speak of his experiences on Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington.
The report says that as in the Soviet Union, many inmates were common criminals but others were members of the elite deemed to have opposed Kim Jong Il's rise to power.
Still other inmates were ethnic Koreans from Japan, or North Koreans who had done something as simple as singing a South Korean song, the report says.
Forced labor in the camps includes mining coal, iron and gold, quarrying stones, cutting logs, building hydroelectric dams, growing corn and making cement and bricks, the report says.
The report says torture, including use of tiny isolation cells, and beatings are common. But food deprivation appears to be the main technique to control inmates.
"Prisoners are provided only enough food to be kept perpetually on the verge of starvation," the report says.
In the late 1990's, camp administrators gave out too little food for prisoners to survive, and annual death rates soared to as high as 33 percent at one camp, Kyo-Hwa-So Hoeryong, the report says.
To lower mortality rates, prisoners on the verge of dying were increasingly sent home "on medical leave." Some of the former prisoners cited in the report recovered after such medical releases and then escaped to China, Mr. Hawk wrote.
In statements before the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, North Korean officials have repeatedly denied that there are human rights violations in their prison system.
In April the commission approved a resolution on North Korea for the first time, expressing "deep concern about reports of systemic, widespread and grave violations of human rights" and citing "the existence of a large number of prison camps and the extensive use of forced labor." South Korea, which is following a policy of easing tensions with the North, abstained.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Theabsence of television viewers has network executives scratching their heads.

BYLINE:  By Bill Carter

 BODY:
AS the ratings have rolled in for the first three weeks of the new television season, one question has dominated the conversations inside the industry's executive suites: what the heck is going on?
 Network executives are baffled by a season unlike any seen before. Returning hit shows like "Friends" and "E.R." are losing significant numbers of viewers from previous years. New shows have performed far worse than almost anyone expected, a result capped off Monday night when the Fox network started two shows that had received huge promotional pushes during the baseball playoffs, "The Next Joe Millionaire" and "Skin," and they posted crushingly disappointing numbers. And men between 18 and 24 are apparently deserting television in droves. So far this year nearly 20 percent fewer men in that advertiser-friendly demographic are watching television during prime time than during the same period last year. 
 The drop-off in these viewing figures tabulated by Nielsen Media Research is inexplicable to industry executives. "Frankly what we're seeing strains credulity," said Alan Wurtzel, the president of research for NBC.
Executives are demanding an explanation from Nielsen for these discrepancies, which, if they continue, could leave the networks on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in so-called make-goods, free commercials to make up for falling short of guarantees to advertisers. A permanent decline in television viewership could jeopardize the broadcast and cable networks' advertising bonanza, which reached a record $15 billion in national advertising commitments for this season.
Jack Loftus, the corporate spokesman for Nielsen, said the ratings company had assiduously checked its data and was confident the numbers were accurate. He said that while the drop in young men watching television was highly unusual, it was real. Mr. Loftus said Nielsen was examining several possibilities to explain the decline, including some unexpectedly high use of video games and DVD players by the young men now absent from television, and even the possibility that a certain number of the young men who are supposed to be in the sample may have been called to duty in Iraq by the National Guard.
Mr. Loftus said another factor might be the improvement in Nielsen's techniques for selecting viewers, so that some people who signed up might not necessarily be heavy television viewers, where earlier the Nielsen sample was dominated by those who watched a lot of television.
Steve Sternberg, a research executive in the advertising industry as senior vice president for Magna Global USA, said the situation "is certainly a mystery." But he said that the make-good issue would probably not become acute for a while. "Everybody at this point is saying let's see what happens when baseball gets finished," Mr. Sternberg said. 
Network executives said none of Nielsen's explanations so far could explain the suddenness of the viewing drop-off and its concentration in just one demographic group.
"You can't explain a 12 percent decline in men 18 to 34 or close to 20 percent in men 18 to 24 by saying they're playing a lot more video games," said David F. Poltrack, the executive vice president for research at CBS. 
He added, "The fact that it's concentrated in one small age group makes it worse, and even more likely that it's an aberration."
Mr. Wurtzel had another suspicion, having to do with who is chosen for the Nielsen sample. He said that Nielsen tends to skip homes where the equipment may be extremely complicated to wire, and that with more homes now adding digital boxes and satellite dishes, those homes might be skipped more often, meaning heavy viewers of television are being systematically excluded. 
A Nielsen executive said the skipping over of such homes was rare.
One possible factor is more basic, Mr. Sternberg said -- the quality of the new shows. "I've always noticed that we never hear anybody talking about the programming." He noted that the networks, which still tend to drive the overall viewing figures, have suffered though a grim start to their new prime-time season. "What has anybody put on that's going to appealto young men?" Mr. Sternberg asked.
The answer was not much, even before the Fox network's belly-flop Monday night. Fox has been on the programming sidelines most of the fall because of its coverage of postseason baseball.
Until Fox really started to compete, several executives said last week, the question of a fall-off in young male viewers could not be fairly assessed because Fox is the network that most appeals to that group.
But that group did not show up on Monday for Fox -- and neither did most anyone else. The poor performance of "Joe Millionaire" could not be attributed to the shortfall in young men because all categories of viewers that once liked it seem to have stayed away.
"Joe Millionaire," whose finale was the most-watched entertainment show last season, came back using a group of foreign women as the butt of the joke that the man they are trying to land is not a millionaire.
The show's ratings were the fraud this time. "Joe Millionaire" attracted only 6.8 million viewers Monday night. The debut episode last year drew 18.6 million viewers. Its finale reached 40 million viewers.
That performance hurt the drama that followed it, "Skin," a Romeo-and-Juliet story set against the backdrop of the adult entertainment industry. It drew only 6.3 million viewers, far behind all its network competition. Fox's performance Monday night prompted a pep talk to the staff from Sandy Grushow, the chairman of Fox Entertainment.
Gail Berman, the president of Fox Entertainment, acknowledged that the network was disappointed, though she said "Joe Millionaire" might grow as it goes along. She also pledged to run "Skin" in other time periods to build an audience for it.
But the numbers were sobering, she conceded. "We've now experienced a taste of what our competitors have been through this fall," Ms. Berman said. 
Mr. Sternberg summed up the state of television at the moment: "No one knows what's going on."

PERSON: Luis A. Ferre 

HEADLINE: Luis A. Ferre Dies at 99; Pushed Puerto Rican Statehood 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Luis A. Ferre, a dominant force in the politics, economy and culture of Puerto Rico for much of the last century and a tireless proponent of statehood, died yesterday in San Juan. He was 99.
 Mr. Ferre (pronounced fay-RAY) served one term as governor of Puerto Rico from 1969 through 1972, but his influence extended much further. It included ownership of one of Puerto Rico's largest businesses; extensive philanthropy, including a major art museum he founded in Ponce; and political savvy that made him a friend of presidents and a frequent Congressional witness well into his 90's. 
 He never abandoned his dream of seeing Puerto Rico become the 51st state, even as voters in nonbinding referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998 favored keeping its current status as a commonwealth. 
Mr. Ferre forcefully argued that Puerto Rico was culturally and economically hamstrung by what he called its "colonial status." He fought those who contended that the island needed special tax advantages that would be lost if it became a state by arguing that the economy of a Puerto Rican state would quickly improve.
But Mr. Ferre rejected independence, in part because Puerto Ricans are so embedded in American life and American life in them.
"Not only are Puerto Ricans citizens by birth, but one would be hard-pressed to find a Puerto Rican without a sister in New York or a son in Chicago, a cousin in Orlando or a daughter in Honolulu or Oklahoma City," he told a United States Senate committee in 1998.
Venerated as Don Luis and honored by having the freeway that crosses Puerto Rico from north to south named for him, Mr. Ferre showed a finely tuned political agility as well as an adherence to basic principles. He described himself as "revolutionary in my ideas, liberal in my objectives and conservative in my methods."
As a businessman, he and his brothers built a conglomerate that included the plant that supplied cement to build the hotels of Miami Beach. His buying of pre-Raphaelite art in the 1950's for his museum, Museo de Arte de Ponce, turned out to be inspired, Forbes magazine said in 1993.
"The scholars and critics all called it kitsch," Mr. Ferre recalled in the Forbes interview. "Everyone thought I was crazy to buy them."
He carried an aura of culture and erudition; as an accomplished pianist educated at the New England Conservatory of Music, he made commercial classical recordings. 
Luis Alberto Ferre was born in Ponce on Feb. 17, 1904, the second of four sons of Antonio Ferre y Bacallao and Mary Aguayo Casals. His mother was a cousin of the cellist Pablo Casals.
He was born just six years after the United States seized Puerto Rico from Spain. He did not recall any childhood conversations about that, but he remembered with pride when Puerto Ricans were granted citizenship in 1917, The Puerto Rican Herald said in 2000.
His father, an engineer of French descent, began building Ferre Industries in 1918 by opening a small foundry. After graduating from public elementary school in Ponce and high school in Morristown, N.J., Luis went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in electrical engineering. He returned to supervise organization and labor relations in the company. 
In World War II, the company used a loan from the United States to found a cement plant to supply cement for building an American naval base. They got in the Miami Beach cement market by buying a Florida company.
Puerto Rico's governors were appointed by the United States president until the early 1940's, when the Roosevelt administration began to back the reforms of Luis Munoz Marin and his Popular Democratic Party. In 1947, Congress authorized the election of the governor, and the next year Mr. Munoz Marin won the first of his four elections to the office.
In 1952, under Mr. Munoz Marin, Puerto Rico became a commonwealth. His main opposition came from the Republican Statehood Party, on whose ticket Mr. Ferre was elected a representative at large in the island legislature in 1952. Mr. Ferre twice ran unsuccessfully for governor on this party's ticket.
In 1967, Mr. Ferre formed his own party, the New Progressive Party, and won the governorship in 1968 with a plurality because of a split in the opposition.
One of Mr. Ferre's first acts as governor was to name the first woman to serve in a governor's cabinet. He also started a number of regional economic reforms, but labor unrest damaged his efforts to consolidate electoral success. He was defeated by a pro-commonwealth candidate in the 1972 elections.
Mr. Ferre went on to serve as president of the Puerto Rico Senate from 1977 to 1980. But his greater legacy was making the New Progressive Party a powerful political force. He paved the way for statehood advocates like Carlos Romero Barcelo, Hernan Padilla and Pedro Rossello.
Mr. Ferre's first wife, Lorencita Ramirez de Arellano, died in 1970. He is survived by his wife, Tiody de Jesus; his son, Antonio; and his daughter, the novelist Rosario Ferre, author of "The House on the Lagoon," in which a character is modeled on Mr. Ferre.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Wednesday about Luis A. Ferre, former governor of Puerto Rico and a leading advocate of statehood, misidentified the novel by his daughter, Rosario Ferre, in which a character is modeled on him. It is "Eccentric Neighborhoods" (1998), not "House on the Lagoon" (1995).

HEADLINE: China's Boom Adds to Global Warming Problem 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: ZHANJIANG, China 

 BODY:
China's rapid economic growth is producing a surge in emissions of greenhouse gases that threatens international efforts to curb global warming, as Chinese power plants burn ever more coal while car sales soar.
 Until the last few months, many energy experts and environmentalists said, they had hoped that China's contribution to global warming would be limited. Its state-owned enterprises have become more efficient in their energy use as they compete in an increasingly capitalist economy, and until recently official Chinese statistics had been showing a steep drop in coal production and consumption. 
 But new figures from Chinese government agencies confirm what energy industry executives had suspected: that coal use has actually been climbing faster in China than practically anywhere else in the world.
To the extent that global warming is caused by humanity, as many scientists believe, this is a serious problem because burning coal at a power plant releases more greenhouse gases than using oil or natural gas to generate the same amount of electricity. 
China's rising energy consumption complicates diplomatic efforts to limit emissions of global warming gases. The International Energy Agency in Paris predicts that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2030 in China alone will nearly equal the increase from the entire industrialized world. 
China is the world's second largest emitter of such gases, after the UnitedStates. But China's per-person energy use and greenhouse gas emissions remain far below levels found in richer countries. The emissions are, for example, roughly one-eighth of those per capita in the United States. 
As a developing country, China is exempt from the Kyoto Protocol, the pending international agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. When President Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol two years ago, he portrayed China's exemption as a serious flaw. The protocol has been embraced by most other big nations, however, and only requires ratification by Russia to take effect.
Another developing country exempt from the protocol, India, is also showing strong growth in emissions as its economy prospers. General Motors predicts that China will account for 18 percent of the world's growth in new car sales from 2002 through 2012; the United States will be responsible for 11 percent, and India 9 percent.
Official Chinese statistics had shown a decline in coal production and consumption in the late 1990's, even as the economy was growing 8 percent a year. But many Western and Chinese researchers have become suspicious of that drop over the last several years.
They point out that the decline assumed that local governments had followed Beijing's instructions to close 47,000 small, unsafe mines producing low-grade coal and many heavily polluting small power plants. Yet researchers who visited mines and power plants found that they often remained open, with the output not being reported to Beijing because local administrators feared an outcry if they shut down important employers.
China's National Bureau of Statistics has not revised its coal figures for the late 1990's, but its latest data show that coal consumption jumped 7.6 percent last year. A Chinese official said the bureau was likely to report a similar increase for this year. Even those figures may be low: Chinese coal industry officials have estimated that coal consumption may be rising more than 10 percent a year.
China is now the world's largest coal consumer, and its power plants are burning coal faster than its aging railroads can deliver it from domestic mines, most of which are in the north. So the country is importing coal from Australia. This steamy city of 640,000, with its deep-water port, is the main receiving point in southern China.
As fishermen in wooden boats brought conical wicker baskets full of silvery, sardine-size fish ashore at dawn on a recent morning, the sun began illuminating an enormous, coal-fired power plant with a big freighter from Australia tied up next to it.
The plant is only nine years old. Zhanjiang drew its electricity over high-tension lines from other cities to the north before then. But the power plant is already inadequate for the area's needs, even though it is twice the size of a standard coal-fired plant. With blackouts frequent here for lack of power, construction has just begun on another, adjacent power plant, that one oil-fired. 
Other figures from the Bureau of Statistics have also shown very large increases in energy consumption lately. China's electrical power generation, the main use of coal in China, jumped 16 percent in the first eight months of this year, nearly four times as much as Western experts expected. Power generation is poised to grow swiftly in the years to come, with China's output of equipment for new power plants rising by two-thirds in a single year.
China has also become the world's fastest-growing importer of oil, with foreign purchases surging nearly a third this year, although some of those imports went into stockpiles in January and February as a precaution in case the war in Iraq disrupted shipments from the Middle East.
The Chinese are using more energy in their homes, too, as China has turned into the world's largest market for television sets and one of the largest for many other electrical appliances.
A 53-year-old retired saleswoman here said that for more than half her life, her only electrical appliance at home was a light bulb.
She and her husband bought a black-and-white television set in 1984, then a refrigerator in 1988. Now she has an air-conditioner, which she acquired in 1998, along with two color televisions, an electric rice cooker, a radio, the refrigerator and many lights.
"Only the old people do not have air-conditioning now," said the woman, Ms. Long, who, like others interviewed in this militarily important city, insisted on giving only her family name.
Environmental groups that once promoted China as a good example are now increasingly worried. "If they're seeing 6 and 7 percent growth, that is obviously a concern," said Dan Lashof, a climate change expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has done several studies of Chinese energy use.
But environmentalists are also loath to criticize China too strongly, partly because Chinese emissions per person are still so much lower than those in the developed world, and partly because China has been trying with some success to improve the energy efficiency of its industries. Programs like requiring electrical appliances and building designs to waste less energy show considerable promise, said Barbara Finamore, the director of the Clean China Program at the council.
The central government in Beijing has had repeated difficulties in forcing provincial governments to pursue recent efficiency programs. China no longer has the central planning mandates to order improvements, but has not yet developed market-based incentives, like higher prices, to encourage people to curb their consumption of fossil fuels, Ms. Finamore said.
China's central bank is nervous that some sectors of the economy, especially luxury housing construction, are growing too fast, and it is trying to restrain them. If it succeeds, that could temper somewhat the increase in energy use. 
China is not alone in consuming a lot more energy, although its enormous population of roughly one and a quarter billion, and rapid economic growth mean that its increases dwarf those of any other country in the developing world. India, for example, is also showing rapid growth in energy use. In populous countries from Indonesia to Brazil, power plants are burning more and more coal and oil to meet ever growing demand for electricity from industry and households.
Even some climate experts in developing countries are conceding that their emissions need to be addressed when international talks begin in 2005 on what will follow the Kyoto agreement, which calls for industrialized nations to reduce their emissions by 2012. Considerable reluctance persists among developing countries, however, to accept the kind of specific limits prescribed for wealthy countries by the Kyoto Protocol. "There's going to be a fairly heated debate about what developing countries should do in the next round," said Rajendra K. Pachauri, an Indian engineer who is the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that assesses the causes and consequences of rising temperatures.
The Chinese government is drafting a series of new economic policies, some of which will concern energy, and is expected to release them soon. Senior Chinese officials did not respond to requests for interviews over the last two months.
Two fairly senior Chinese officials said in earlier, separate interviews, after President Hu Jintao succeeded Jiang Zemin in March, that an active debate was under way over the extent to which conservation should be balanced against economic growth. 
Growth in Chinese coal consumption should slow somewhat in the next four years. Completion of the Three Gorges dam and five nuclear power plants will provide considerable additional electricity for China's national grid by 2007, although posing different environmental risks from coal. But Larry Metzroth, a coal and electricity specialist at the International Energy Agency, warned that with no further large hydroelectric or nuclear power projects planned in China, coal consumption "is going to pick up again after 2007." 
Beijing's official New China News Agency recently predicted that China's capacity to generate electricity from coal would be almost three times as high in 2020 as it was in 2000.
If China can continue to sustain 8 percent annual economic growth, then the next big growth area in greenhouse gas emissions is likely to be cars. China is already the world's fastest-growing car market, with sales up 73 percent this year.
China has just one-twentieth as many cars now as the United States, because car sales were tiny until the last three years. But a swift expansion of auto factories in China, together with rising household incomes and the growing availability of auto loans, has led to the surge.
Here in Zhanjiang, downtown streets are already clogged with cars. One of the best businesses in town seems to be a corner store in the city's old quarter, an area of tightly packed three-story homes with traditional tile roofs. The corner store sells every possible kind of fuse, tubing and wiring for electricians, and it was so busy that the store's owners barely had time to speak.
"People are rewiring a lot," said Mr. Pong, the patriarch of the family that runs the store. "Or they just demolish the old and build new."

HEADLINE: Workers Feel Pinch of Rising Health Costs 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
As health care costs head into a fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases, employers are shifting a growing share of the burden onto people who make the heaviest use of medical services.
 The trend -- evident as companies begin informing workers of their benefit choices for the coming year -- takes the form of fast-rising co-payments and deductibles, higher payroll deductions to cover spouses and children and new kinds of health plans that give workers a fixed sum to spend. 
 On average, the annual out-of-pocket costs for employees of large companies have more than doubled since 1998, to $2,126 this year, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. Hewitt is expecting a 22 percent jump next year, to $2,595.
Costs are up sharply, too, for workers who pay a monthly insurance premium but rarely see a doctor. However, employers have sought to temper those increases, so healthy workers are not tempted to drop their coverage, experts say. 
"Employers didn't want to discourage the take-up of insurance," said Paul B. Ginsburg, an economist who is president of Health System Change, a Washington-based research center. "They have made a very conscious decision to increase the patient's cost-sharing rather than increase the employees' share in the premium." 
Employers still pay the bulk of their workers' health care bills, but their contribution has slipped over the last five years, to 70 percent of total health care costs from 75 percent, according to Hewitt's latest survey of 300 employers with 5,000 or more workers, released last week.
And more workers are going without insurance, even at large companies. According to a report issued yesterday by the Commonwealth Fund, which studies health policy issues, 9.6 million workers and family members at companies with more than 500 employees did not have employer-provided health coverage in 2001.
At the nation's largest private employer, Wal-Mart Stores, only about half the roughly one million domestic employees are in a company health plan, said Mona Williams, a Wal-Mart vice president. Of the 500,000 others, half are ineligible because they were hired too recently; many depend on parents, a spouse or a government program for coverage, Ms. Williams said. 
The figures for big companies reflect a broader shift in the American economy away from mechanisms that for decades have spread the burden of health care costs onto more shoulders. 
Largely because of the booming cost of prescription drugs, for example, Medicare covers less of its beneficiaries' health care expenses than at any time since the program was established in 1965, according to Robert M. Hayes, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a patient advocacy group. 
As a result, the elderly paid 22 percent of their average median income, or $3,757, for health care last year -- a larger proportion than the 20 percent of income they spent before the advent of Medicare. 
The number of Americans without insurance has, meanwhile, grown to 43.6 million at last count, the highest since 1998, according to the Census Bureau. Billions of dollars of their health costs are absorbed by hospitals or federal programs, and experts say that the uninsured skimp on care, compared with people who have workplace coverage. Still, uninsured families this year are averaging $772 in out-of-pocket spending, said Jack Hadley, a health care researcher at the Urban Institute, a policy research group in Washington.
All these trends fall most heavily on people who are sick or who otherwise are heavy consumers of medical services. They are also fueling national policy debates, like the push for a Medicare drug benefit, the campaign for loosened restrictions on imported drugs and calls for expanded public programs by most of the Democratic presidential candidates.
"Shifting costs to patients, particularly in the form of higher deductibles for hospital care, disproportionately affects the sickest Americans," said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. "It is not an acceptable response to rising health care costs to make care so expensive that those who need it fail to get it." 
Some health care economists -- and many insurance companies -- argue that costs will never come under control until the users of medical services feel the financial sting. Generous coverage, they contend, long gave Americans and their doctors a perverse incentive to indulge in wasteful consumption of expensive drugs and diagnostic tests. In its more restrictive forms, managed care made patients jump through bureaucratic hoops to obtain treatment, but experts say it, too, did little to expose consumers to the true costs of health care.
"Employees who were paying $20 for a doctor visit had no idea that the average cost was really $93," said Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears, Roebuck & Company. In the current sign-up period, Sears is hoping that many employees will select new plans that require themto pay 20 percent of the full cost of doctor visits, hospitals and brand-name drugs, or 25 percent for going outside the Sears network.
Hewitt said that a few large employers were offering a new type of health plan, sometimes called consumer directed, that gives workers an unfiltered view of health bills -- and often increases their costs. Employees get an allowance to spend on medical expenses. If they exhaust it, they use their own money until they reach a limit, typically $3,000 to $5,000, when the plan starts paying. 
"The whole point is to change their purchasing behavior," said Kenneth Sperling, a consultant with Hewitt.
More commonly, some employers have shifted costs by offering limited basic coverage that employees can enhance by paying more in premiums. 
But cutbacks in coverage can be brutal for some patients.
"I'm having to beg for my insulin," said Cathy Barkovich, 33, a diabetes patient in Harmony, Pa. 
She said her husband's health plan stopped paying for her brand-name prescriptions in July; the American Diabetes Association says that no generic equivalent exists. When she applied to a manufacturer's free insulin program, she was told that only uninsured patients were eligible. Her husband, a $40,000-a-year interstate bus driver, is considering dropping their coverage so she can get the drug, Ms. Barkovich said. 
Last year, shifting costs to patients -- mainly in drug coverage -- "probably took a percentage point off" the increase in the use of medical services, which has been rising at about 9 to 10 percent a year, said Mr. Ginsburg, the health economist. Almost two in three employers now require patients to pay higher co-payments for drugs not on a preferred list: flat rates as high as $30 per prescription, or sums as high as 29 percent of the actual cost. 
"People view that as a success in discouraging the use of the most expensive drugs," said Gary Claxton, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, whose survey of employer health benefits was published last month. Whether recent increases in deductibles and co-payments for hospitals will also reduce the use of services is not yet clear, he added.
One in 20 self-employed workers dropped their coverage last year, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research center in Washington. But almost all employers held onto their insurance, by shifting more costs to workers. 
Precision Pattern, an aerospace industry supplier in Tacoma, Wash., with 135 employees was facing a 16 percent increase in premiums, said Bonnie Olson, the company's human resources director. Precision switched to a new provider, BENU, which offers small and medium-size employers a range of six health plans from Cigna Healthcare and Group Health of Puget Sound, a Seattle health maintenance organization. 
The company's premiums rose less than 10 percent, she said, but now employees must either accept the restrictions of a basic H.M.O. at Group Health or pay more to maintain or exceed their former benefits.
The company pays the entire premium for about 50 employees who chose the basic plan; these workers then pay $15 for office visits, 20 percent of other costs and $263 a month to cover a spouse.
Most Precision workers chose a Cigna plan offering a broader choice of doctors through a preferred-provider network, at $359 a month for an individual and either a spouse or children. This option includes an $800 family deductible for services obtained outside the network, up from a $200 deductible in the old plan that applied only to visits to specialists. 
"The huge rise in health care costs has to be paid by somebody," said Alain C. Enthoven, a health economist at Stanford University. "If some employers had to pay it all, it might push them into losing money."

HEADLINE: Wide Range of Tax Shelters Draws SenateInquiry 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Major companies have leased parts of the subway systems in Washington, Boston and Chicago, to be joined soon by water mains in New York City, in deals intended to cut the companies' tax bills and to get around rules prohibiting abusive tax shelters, said a witness at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday. 
 Big American corporations are also receiving tax breaks for leasing public assets in Canada and much of Europe in similarly circumspect deals, said the witness, a leasing industry executive who testified behind a screen to conceal his identity. 
 Using the pseudonym Mr. Janet, the witness said the deals were a sham and bad for the economy because they reduced federal and state corporate tax revenues by far more than the money they generated for local governments. 
Although the new deals were described as improper, no current law or Treasury rule specifically prohibits them. In return for a sizable payment to what is often a cash-pinched local government, the company usually can depreciate the asset sharply, generating a big tax break. By including a service component in the contract, for maintaining the subway lines or the water system, the deal falls outside rules adopted several years ago by the Treasury Department to prevent abusive tax shelters. 
The leasing executive was especially critical of recent deals across borders, in which an American company is supposed to operate a subway, water or other municipal service paid for by taxpayers in another country. 
"I fail to see how the U.S. economy is stimulated by giving U.S. tax deductions for assets built by the French, funded by the French and used by the French," Mr. Janet said, his voice electronically altered to reduce the risk he would be identified and then sued by former co-workers.
He cited a deal in which Bank of America paid $25 million to be able to deduct much of the value of Canada's air traffic control system on its tax return. A spokeswoman for the bank, Eloise Hale, confirmed that such a deal existed, though she declined to discuss its terms. "We believe this transaction was appropriate under the Internal Revenue Code," she said.
The wide-ranging hearing was called to consider new curbs on tax shelters, an effort that has been stalled in Congress for two years. For three hours, witnesses described tax avoidance plans sold by the major accounting firms and bought by the biggest companies with no fear that the I.R.S. would uncover the deals or impose a meaningful penalty.
The former tax officials of Levi Strauss, the jeans company, and the accounting firm KPMG said they were fired or disciplined for objecting to what they considered illegal conduct. The former employee of KPMG, Michael Hamersley, said his superiors openly expressed disregard for the law.
After the testimony, a spokesman for KPMG, George Ledwith, said that Mr. Hamersley was in no position to make the observations.
In a statement, he said that Mr. Hamersley, who worked in mergers and acquisitions, was "simply not qualified to reach the purely personal opinions he espouses about alleged improper or so-called 'abusive' activity. His conclusions are simply wrong."
Another person cited problems at Ernst & Young. Henry Camferdam, an Indianapolis executive whose company was a client of Ernst & Young, said he paid $7 million in fees for what turned out to be a fraudulent tax shelter. He said he bought it only because Ernst & Young described it as not just legal, but conservative. "Ernst & Young had always been to us the people who said no, so we had complete trust and faith in them," he said.
Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the committee, characterized tax abuses as widespread. A report by the General Accounting Office, released at the hearing, said that as of Sept. 30 abusive tax shelters had cost the government $85 billion, roughly $2 billion less than the amount that President Bush persuaded Congress to appropriate for the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq.
The G.A.O. report criticized the I.R.S. for lacking goals and a plan to measure its success in combating abusive tax shelters. 
The major accounting firms have suffered a complete ethical collapse, said William J. McDonough, chairman of the new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, created by Congress after corporate scandals at Enron and other companies. He said he found the willingness to sell faulty tax shelters and hide them from I.R.S. auditors "immensely and immorally repugnant" and warned that his board has told the firms they must change or face dire consequences.
"If they do not save themselves," Mr. McDonough said, "we will save them and it will not be pleasant."
The testimony by the unidentified leasing executive called Mr. Janet drew criticism from leasing industry experts who attended the hearing. They said that his testimony referred to garden-variety deals.
Local officials in New York, Washington and Chicago all said in interviews on Tuesday that their lease deals were routine. The transit deals were done with the express approval of the federal Department of Transportation, they said.
William A. Macan IV, a leasing specialist with Allen & Overy in New York, who attended the hearing, said that "these deals use tried-and-true principles of tax law going back at least for the 34 years I have been in this."
"I was highly offended at the treatment by witnesses and senators of those who do these transactions as liars and cheats," Mr. Macan added. 
Michael J. Fleming, president of the Equipment Leasing Association in Arlington, Va., a trade group for leasing companies, also said the leasing deals were well established in law.
Lee Sheppard, a tax critic, countered that there is a big difference between traditional leasing deals and the latest ones.
"In a traditional lease a city needs something like a rail car and it needs financing to buy it," said Ms. Sheppard, a lawyer who writes for the magazine Tax Notes. "That's a normal deal.
"But these are deals where the public agency already owns something and they're using it fine. The city just wants to collect a fee," she said. "So they make a lease deal with a service contract" that is intended to get around the Treasury rules banning leasing deals that are made purely for tax benefits. She characterized these new deals, sometimes called service leases, as shams in which "nothing happens" except divvying up bogus tax deductions.
The service provision obligates the company to operate the leased property eventually, something Ms. Sheppard said did not happen. That requirement is used by the company to justify accelerated depreciation of the asset, which means a big immediate tax break.
She and others said they had been unable to find out just how the tax breaks were split between the corporation and the municipality collecting the fee, but several people interviewed said they suspected the corporations received more than 90 percent of the benefits.
The hearing also exposed a split between Republicans and Democrats on how to enforce the law. Senator Grassley focused entirely on giving the I.R.S. better tools and said nothing about its work force of auditors and other experts. He has said previously that he was concerned with how the I.R.S. uses its enforcement resources. 
Some witnesses, and Democratic senators, said the new tools were not enough. Several witnesses said the I.R.S. was so short of auditors that neither accounting firms nor big businesses feared it.
The I.R.S. also hunts for small-scale tax cheating while ignoring others because many auditors lack sophisticated financial skills, said Robert V. Lally of Federman, Lally and Remis, an accounting firm in Farmington, Conn.
In 27 years of representing taxpayers, Mr. Lally said, he had never been asked by an I.R.S. auditor about such issues as abusive leases. Auditors, he said, focus most of their questions on two kinds of business deductions: lunches and cars.

HEADLINE: Governor of Florida Orders Woman Fed In Right-to-Die Case 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Adam Liptak contributed to this article.

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Six days after the feeding tube of a brain-damaged woman was removed in a case that pitted her husband against her parents, Gov. Jeb Bush ordered it reinserted on Tuesday after the Legislature empowered him to do so. The extraordinary step overrides years of court rulings. 
 The woman, Terri Schiavo, was to receive intravenous hydration on Tuesday evening, after a day of wrenching debate in the Legislature. Mrs. Schiavo was taken by ambulance from a hospice to a hospital in Clearwater, near Tampa, where doctors could not begin feeding her until she was adequately hydrated, her sister, Suzanne Carr, said. 
 "I'm overwhelmed, I'm grateful, I'm scared," Ms. Carr said. "I will sleep like a baby tonight, once I hear she's O.K. But we know this might not be over." 
Lawyers for Mrs. Schiavo's husband, Michael, promptly challenged the governor's stay, seeking an injunction in the Sixth Circuit Court. Late Tuesday, a judge denied the request for an immediate injunction, saying he needed time to review the law.
Mr. Schiavo has sought the removal of his wife's feeding tube since 1998, testifying that she told him she would never want to be kept alive artificially. But her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, fought Mr. Schiavo every step of the way, exhausting their legal options only last week. They have made videos of their daughter, now 39, appearing to smile, grunt and moan in response to her mother's voice and to follow a balloon with her eyes.
But most doctors say that people in vegetative states make such gestures involuntarily and that they have no cognitive function. 
In the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, an impassioned, often angry debate about whether the Legislature had the moral and legal authority to pass the measure sounded more like a group therapy session than a governmental dialogue. Many lawmakers drew on their own religious beliefs and experiences with death, sometimes choking up as they described the drawn-out illness of a parent or spouse. 
Senator James E. King Jr., the Republican who is Senate president, gave all the senators applications for living wills. He urged them to fill out the forms immediately and to circulate such forms among their constituents.
"I really do hope that we've done the right thing," Mr. King said after the Senate passed the measure, 23 to 15. "I keep on thinking, what if Terri didn't want this to happen at all? May God have mercy on all of us."
Other lawmakers said that the Legislature was blatantly violating the separation of the executive and legal branches, and that they were ashamed of the measure, especially because the Legislature had not heard evidence in the complicated case and many lawmakers were only learning details about it this week.
"This chamber is not the appropriate place to be the trier of fact on an issue that just came to us this morning," said Senator Steven A. Geller, a Democrat from Hallandale Beach. "You need to think of the precedent we are setting here."
Unlike most people at the center of right-to-die cases, Mrs. Schiavo is not elderly, comatose or hooked up to a respirator. Florida's so-called right-to-die law allows courts to consider testimony about the wishes of someone on life support if the person left no written directive. 
Although she can breathe on her own, Mrs. Schiavo has depended on the feeding tube for sustenance since 1990, when her heart stopped temporarily because of what some doctors diagnosed as a potassium deficiency. She was 26 and had not signed a living will. For the last few years, she has resided at Hospice House Woodside in Pinellas Park, about 20 miles southwest of Tampa.
On Monday, Mr. Schiavo, who has not granted interviews for months, released a long statement explaining why he wanted his wife to die and saying that he, like the Schindlers, was grieving. He said that he had sought a cure for Mrs. Schiavo for years, even experimenting with implanting electrodes in her brain to stimulate its function. 
Mr. Schiavo also said that his wife had been tested three times to see if she could swallow food on her own and had failed. When Mr. Bush submitted a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Schindlers a few weeks ago, he argued that Mrs. Schiavo should undergo such tests before being allowed to die. 
"I never wanted Terri to die," Mr. Schiavo said in the statement. "I was hiding behind my hope and selfishly ignoring Terri's wishes."
It was unclear who the prime mover behind the bill was: Mr. Bush, who has publicly sided with Mrs. Schiavo's parents and tried twice before to intervene on their behalf, or Johnnie B. Byrd Jr., the Republican speaker of the House, who is running for the United States Senate and courting conservative votes. Some supporters of the Schindlers said on Tuesday that Mr. Bush had approached Mr. Byrd about taking up the bill, but Mr. King, the Senate president, said it was all Mr. Byrd's doing.
Mr. Byrd was eager to claim credit for the measure, which passed the House 73 to 24. "I was chewing on his leg," he said of his 11th-hour efforts to get Mr. King to take up the legislation in the Senate. The Legislature was supposed to discuss only economic development in this week's special session, but Mr. Bush expanded the agenda on Monday to include the Schiavo case after Mr. Byrd expressed eagerness to take up the issue.
Legal scholars questioned the constitutionality of the bill, which was written to apply only to Mrs. Schiavo. Courts are often skeptical about legislation that benefits or burdens only one person, even when its impact is only prospective. Such legislation is often attacked as a denial of equal protection and due process. 
The legal situation becomes even more tangled, the scholars said, when the legislation is not only retroactive but seeks to undo a judicial action. That can give rise to a showdown between the legislative and judicial branches. Historically, the courts have tended to win those fights.
Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida who specializes in medical technology, said the new law was unconstitutional.
"The legislation interferes with the judicial power," he said. "The Legislature is not writing new rules. It's trying to unsettle a vested process."
The legislation authorizes Mr. Bush to issue a "one-time stay," but it does not specify what, precisely, he is staying, to whom he would issue the stay or what power he has to enforce it. For that reason, too, Professor Noah said the measure was problematic.
"This is going to perplex medical professionals who are trying to honor the patient's wishes as best they understand it," he said.
In a brief conversation with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Bush shied away from questions about whether the bill was constitutional, saying it was not for him to decide. 
"These are unique circumstances," he said. "I don't think you'll see me or the Legislature on a regular basis passing laws that deal with individuals or handfuls of people."
Mrs. Schiavo's parents have waged a public-relations war as well as a legal one, and tens of thousands of people around the world have joined their case, bombarding the governor and legislative leaders with e-mail messages and phone calls. Mr. Schiavo's lawyer, George Felos, said earlier this month that the governor was making an appeal to the right wing of his party, especially to religious conservatives, by inserting himself in the Schiavo case.
Randall Terry, a prominent anti-abortion advocate who founded Operation Rescue, has been at the Schindlers' side for much of the last week, holding prayer vigils in front of Mrs. Schiavo's hospice and comparing Mr. Bush to Pontius Pilate for not halting the death. 
Mr. Terry said he preferred an early version of the bill, which would have put a broader moratorium on deaths by starvation and dehydration. The Senate insisted that the original bill be amended so that only Mrs. Schiavo could be affected. The final bill allows the governor to step in only in cases in which a patient has no living will, is in a persistent vegetative state, has had a feeding tube removed and has a family member challenging the removal. 
Michael Vito, the fiance of Mrs. Schiavo's sister, Ms. Carr, said that Mrs. Schiavo's eyes had been open when the family visited her on Tuesday afternoon at Hospice Woodside in Pinellas Park, but that she looked gaunt. 
"She had very dark circles under her eyes and looked very drawn," Mr. Vito said. "The feeling is we are cautiously optimistic."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Developer Passes the Berkeley Acid Test

BYLINE:  By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
Completing the largest biotech-related lease of the last year in the area of Berkeley and Oakland, a research unit of Bayer HealthCare moved into a 180,000-square-foot building in the Aquatic Park Center here this year. The lease, as well as the story of the business park that surrounds the building, mirrors some of the tensions surrounding biotech development in a city notable both for its political activism and its resistance to development.
 Berkeley's industrial West End, filled with red-brick and corrugated-metal buildings dating back to the 1930's, was a logical place for the Nucleic Acids Diagnostics unit of Bayer HealthCare, which is a division of Bayer A.G. of Germany. With 1,700 employees, the drug maker is the city's largest nonpublic provider of jobs, the company said. 
 Although Bayer already owned a 45-acre research and manufacturing campus in Berkeley, a shortage of space prompted the company to place its Nucleic Acids unit a few blocks away, next to an existing building occupied by another of its divisions, Bayer Biotechnology. About 450 Bayer employees work in the research buildings.
"It made sense to build on the foundation that was already here," said Clelia Bauer, a spokeswoman for Bayer HealthCare.
The cost of the 10-year lease was not disclosed, although real estate executives with direct knowledge of the transaction said its value was in excess of $50 million.
If Berkeley was an easy choice for the drug company, however, developing biotech facilities within the city's small industrial zone has been anything but simple for the developer, Wareham Development of San Rafael.
In the course of the last two decades, which has been spent developing the 17-acre campus, Wareham's president, Richard Robbins, says he has been drowned out by jeers when trying to speak at public hearings and caricatured in a local newspaper. He has also been vilified as a "gentrifier" intent on displacing the jobs of working-class people with the highly paid employees of technology companies, an accusation he disputes, saying there are jobs for people of all income levels and skill levels in his developments.
"My wife no longer allows me to go to public hearings, because it gets so ugly," Mr. Robbins said. His presence at public hearings, he added puckishly, "tends to raise the temperature in the room."
As home to the University of California at Berkeley, which is a leader in biological research, the city might seem fertile soil for the kind of relationship between research institutions and private industry that has risen around Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., and around M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass.
But, Mr. Robbins and other real estate executives say, consistent opposition to development has stymied the full flowering of such relationships. Businesses that otherwise might have come to Berkeley have settled in neighboring Emeryville and other receptive Bay Area cities. 
Berkeley residents may have good reason to look askance at new development, according to one city official. In the 1950's and '60's, in the area immediately south of the university, "a number of a fine older buildings were replaced with ugly apartment buildings," said Ted Burton, an economic project coordinator for the city.
As a result, "the city has a very strong preservation movement," he said. Berkeley residents "do not want to become a location for suburban malls or big-box retail centers; they want to preserve the character of the city and its historic neighborhoods." The West Berkeley area, in particular, is of interest to preservationists because it was the site of the original settlement in the area in the mid-1800's.
Developers, however, argue that preservation has been used as a means to block development. Landmark status currently protects, among other things, an asphalt parking lot in the city that archaeologists believe covers ancient Indian artifacts.
In attempts to forestall development, Berkeley activists have spearheaded efforts to make buildings into historic landmarks. Landmark status protects properties from alteration without permission of the city's landmarks board.
The enthusiasm of Berkeleyites for preserving history extends to more recent structures, including five red-brick buildings now owned by Wareham and dating from the 1930's that formerly housed a plant of Durkee Spices. The developer preserved two of the structures, including an office building that is now a 17-unit apartment building.
To obtain a building permit for the Bayer buildings, the developer had to convince city officials that the facilities were part of a manufacturing process, rather than stand-alone research facilities. (Berkeley law seeks to protect industrial jobs by banning the conversion of industrial buildings to other purposes.)
Berkeley's concern with architecture extends to design review, even in industrial areas, which are often ignored by other cities. To pass muster with the city's design-review board, the architect, de Tienne Associates, has wrapped the new Bayer building in corrugated metal and glass, so that it closely resembles the older metal buildings that are its neighbors.
The design of the Bayer building includes a touch of Eastern philosophy. A fish-shaped profile at the roof line, with two round windows, is intended to represent yin-yang, the Chinese symbol of the dynamic interplay of male and female principles.
Mr. Robbins said his site planning for the Berkeley business park also reflected his interest in feng shui, the arcane Chinese discipline that seeks to harmonize architectural design with natural forces. Starting with the haphazard arrangement of the original buildings, de Tienne Associates has situated new buildings in relation to existing ones to frame new courtyards.
Perseverance has had its rewards for Wareham. With about 400,000 square feet of biotech space in a city with an inventory of such space of less than 800,000 square feet, Wareham has become the city's largest developer of specialized laboratory space for the biotech industry.
The Wareham properties have no vacancy, according to the developer. Throughout the Bay Area, according to Gregg Domanico, general manager of BT Commercial in Palo Alto, there is a 10 percent vacancy rate for biotech buildings. 
Mr. Robbins readily admits, however, that the high barriers around the Berkeley real estate market have created an advantage for companies like his, which can weather the approval process. He said he expected the values of his buildings to rise and that he would never sell the property. And despite his travails with the city, he sounded surprisingly gracious toward his opponents.
"They say some things that are not right," Mr. Robbins said, "but they are passionate about the city."
For Ms. Bauer, the Bayer spokeswoman, the advantage of Berkeley is one of views and environment. She said laboratory workers rarely worked in surroundings as impressive as those in Berkeley.
"You have a comprehensive view of the San Francisco Bay, with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background," she said. "It's a unique thing, the proximity to the bay and the feeling of being in the center of a small town, which Berkeley is."

Traders Worry, And Seat Price On Big Board Takes a Dip

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The value of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange plunged by $500,000 yesterday, providing a strong indication that traders are nervous about the Big Board's future.
 The exchange announced that two seats were sold for $1.35 million, down from the last sale of $1.85 million on Sept. 18, the day after Richard A. Grasso resigned under pressure as chairman and chief executive of the exchange. 
 The 27 percent decline is the largest between two sales in recent years and left the price at its lowest level since December 1998, when prices were depressed by the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a prominent American hedge fund.
There are just 1,366 seats on the exchange, and most never trade. To do business on the floor of the exchange, a trader must either own a seat or lease one. 
The price of a seat -- a misnomer because no chairs come with the purchase -- has long been an indicator of the perceived health of the Big Board and of the stock market. The more trading that investors expect, and the higher the share of it that they expect to take part on the Big Board, the higher the price a seatholder can expect. So far this year, only 13 seats have been sold, and the market is far from a liquid one. After yesterday's trades, the highest price being bid for a seat was $1.215 million, while the lowest price that one was being offered for was $1.8 million.
The recent decline in seat prices began in September, as the furor over Mr. Grasso's pay was escalating. Three seats sold on Sept. 5 for $2 million each, the highest price of the year. But three days later, two seats sold for $1.9 million, and on Sept. 18 one sold for $1.85 million. After that sale, the exchange said the highest bid for a seat was $1.7 million. Whoever was willing to pay that price obviously decided not to pay that much yesterday, however.
There is nothing new about seat price volatility. In 1970, seats sold for as much as $320,000, but by 1977 the price of a seat fell to a low of $35,000. That came during a period when public interest in the stock market declined sharply, thus reducing the volume of trading on the market. The end of fixed commissions in 1975 sharply reduced revenue for brokerage firms, and there was widespread speculation that the exchange would be unable to compete against newer competitors after Congress made it easier to trade Big Board stocks on other markets.
Those forecasts did not come to pass, and by 1987 the price of a seat topped $1 million, peaking at $1.15 million in September, weeks before the 1987 crash stunned Wall Street and sent seat prices into a slide that did not end until November 1990, the month after share prices hit their lows for that cycle after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and with the American economy in recession. The low was $250,000, a decline of 78 percent from the peak.
Now there is less worry about the future of stocks -- share prices are up sharply from the lows reached just more than a year ago -- but more worry about the future of the exchange and about the profits to be made from owning a seat on it.
Last week, it was disclosed that the exchange, spurred on by the Securities and Exchange Commission, wanted to levy substantial fines that could total $150 million on specialist firms, which own many of the seats and are assigned to make markets in each stock traded on the exchange. Those penalties came after investigators concluded that specialists had often stepped in to trade with investors when they could have matched public orders.
But the larger concern may be reminiscent of the worries of a quarter of a century ago. The S.E.C. is considering rule changes, sought by electronic markets, that could make it easier to take market share away from the Big Board. 
William H. Donaldson, the S.E.C. chairman, has made it clear that he intends to act on market structure issues in the relatively near future, but he has not disclosed what steps he may take. With the negative publicity from both Mr. Grasso's pay package and the specialist investigation hanging over the exchange, its ability to persuade Washington to adopt rules it likes may be reduced.
Still, it is worth noting that Big Board seat prices can rebound as rapidly as they fall. In February 1999, two months after a seat sold for $1.225 million, the next trade showed a 63 percent increase, to $2 million. A month later, the price hit $2.6 million, more than double the price of three months before.

HEADLINE: Powell Tries to Nudge Sudan Toward Peace 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, seeking to prod the talks to end the long civil war in Sudan, suggested Tuesday that the United States would lift sanctions if Sudan reached a peace accord and acted further against terrorism. 
 Arriving for a brief stop in Kenya on his way to a conference on Iraq's future to be held later in the week in Madrid, Mr. Powell met with Kenya's leaders and prepared to confer with Sudanese negotiators who have been involved in peace talks with rebel leaders. Kenya has been the host of the Sudan talks in recent years. 
 Mr. Powell said he was here "to keep the momentum going on these talks" after a period during the summer in which "things were lagging quite a bit."
"There's a lot of work ahead, but frankly we're getting closer," Mr. Powell said on his plane traveling here. "Now that we've come this far, let's finish it, let's kick it in, let's throw it into high gear. Let's not miss this opportunity."
A restoration of relations with Sudan would be an extraordinary development for a country that has embraced Islamic radicalism and been accused of sponsoring rebellions in neighboring countries and aiding militant groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In the 1990's, Sudan provided a haven to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. 
After attacks on American embassies in East Africa, the United States attacked a Khartoum factory with cruise missiles in 1998. 
More recently, however, the United States has praised Sudan for its negotiations with rebels in the south and for assisting the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan and against Al Qaeda. Sudan remains on Washington's list of countries sponsoring terrorists, however. 
Despite Sudan's recent cooperation, Mr. Powell said that improvement in ties would have to be preceded by further actions on terrorism, and that expulsion of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Khartoum "would be a nice step for them to take."
A little more than a year ago, the government of Sudan reached an accord with the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the main rebel group, to cease hostilities and allow aid.
Talks led by a retired Kenyan general, Lazaro Seumbeiywo, are directed toward allowing Islamic law in the north while letting the predominantly Christian south determine its future status in six years. An interim governing arrangement is also being negotiated, along with the sharing of Sudan's oil wealth. 
Sudan, a vast and impoverished country, has been plagued by military coups and internal tribal, racial and religious strife since its early years as a nation in the 1950's. 
War resumed in 1983 as the mostly Christian and animist groups in the South revolted against the increasingly radical Islamic rule of Khartoum in the north. Two million people have died and millions have been displaced since then.
The Bush administration, prodded in part by American Christian evangelical groups demanding that the United States get involved to protect Christians in Sudan, has taken an unusual interest in the Sudan civil war. 
Mr. Powell said he had been in touch with General Seumbeiywo, the mediator, and with the leaders of each side, the Sudanese vice president, Ali Osman Muhammad Taha, and the rebel leader, John Garang. 
If an agreement were to occur, Mr. Bush would "recognize the achievement in an appropriate manner," Mr. Powell said, hinting that that could involve a visit by the president or a ceremony at the White House. 
Other than expelling Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which the United States has also asked Syria to do without success, Mr. Powell did not specify what steps Sudan would have to take to get back into American good graces. "I must say that over the last several years, the Sudanese have shown an increasing level of cooperation on counterterrorism issues," he said. He said the United States would look at "the whole range of restrictions, sanctions, listings with respect to Sudan, and they are considerable," if Sudan cooperated further. 
A peace settlement, he said, would probably involve international monitors sponsored by the United Nations, and he promised that the United States would be actively involved in such a process.
Asked about what factors had come into play to lead to the possibility of an end to civil war, Mr. Powell spoke of two million dead, an economically collapsed nation and the possibility of tapping Sudan's oil wealth with international help that would not be available as long as the war continues. 
"After a while, people wonder why they continue to fight, when it's clear that neither side will ultimately prevail," he said. "A period of exhaustion sets in, and I hope that that will happen."
While in Nairobi, Mr. Powell met with President Mwai Kibaki, who thanked him for American support of the Sudan peace effort. Mr. Powell then visited the American embassy, which was built recently in a northern Nairobi suburb to replace the old embassy in the center of the city that was bombed by Al Qaeda in 1998.

HEADLINE: The Station Master; 
An Architect's Grand Vision for a Trade Center Transit Hub

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In hiring Santiago Calatrava to design the new transit hub at the World Trade Center, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey thought large. And in his first public words about the project, Mr. Calatrava made it clear that he, too, would think large -- on the scale of Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station. Old Pennsylvania Station.
 "Those places are gates to the city," he said in an interview on Monday, 10 days after signing a contract to design the $2 billion transit center, in partnership with the STV Group and DMJM & Harris. "New York City has a tradition of great stations. There are cities in the world that don't have that. New York has it." 
 While short on specifics, Mr. Calatrava described a structure that would have "the most universal character" of any at the site, something above and beyond a PATH terminal, though that function will be at its core. He envisions a civic gathering place that would be open 24 hours a day, pulsing with life and movement, sending people out into the city, greeting travelers from the airport, discharging commuters to nearby ferries and even sheltering visitors from the rain.
"Of all the buildings, this is more devoted to the everyday person," said Mr. Calatrava, 52, a Spanish citizen who lives part-time in Manhattan and sometimes walks through Grand Central just for the pleasure of it.
He deflected speculation about what the PATH terminal might look like, an inevitable question since his designs are renowned for sinuous curves, abstract monumentality and sometimes anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms. Because his buildings also tend to resemble freestanding sculptures, it would be perilous to guess how successfully Mr. Calatrava can cope with constriction.
"This station will be different than anything else I've done," he said. "I don't remember having had to work in such a dense, dense core of a city."
Asked whether his fluid and flowing style might be incongruent with the more crystalline forms of the master plan for the trade center site by Studio Daniel Libeskind, Mr. Calatrava said: "We will certainly work within the master plan. But you see, if you look at the city, it's always done from incongruence. Particularly New York illustrates that, more than any other city." For his part, Mr. Libeskind welcomed Mr. Calatrava. "I think he will bring in a very good dimension," he said yesterday. "There is plenty of capacity for expression in this station."
No matter how the design turns out, the terminal will be the architectural face that the new trade center presents to most New Yorkers, since it will be on Church Street, closer to the spine of Broadway and landmarks like the New York Stock Exchange. Freedom Tower and the memorial, by contrast, will be on the west side of the 16-acre site. And the office towers planned on Church Street may be many years distant.
Construction on the terminal could begin late next year or early in 2005, according to a draft document that is part of the environmental review, at the same spot where the temporary station stands now. Underground levels would be finished by the end of 2006, with the main terminal building and pedestrian network completed between 2007 and 2009.
The temporary station, designed by Robert I. Davidson of the Port Authority, is to open next month.
At the moment, the design team is studying transportation demands that may exist in 25 years to ensure that the terminal is flexible enough, said Dominick M. Servedio, the chairman and chief executive of STV Group. His firm, Mr. Calatrava and DMJM & Harris are allied as the Downtown Design Partnership, which has a $19.2 million contract from the authority. The project is being financed by the Federal Transit Administration and from insurance proceeds.
Mr. Servedio said the Downtown Design Partnership, the Port Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had been in a "dialogue" about the relation of the PATH terminal to the Fulton Street Transit Center, being designed by Nicholas Grimshaw & Partners and Ove Arup & Partners.
What is known about the trade center project is that it will include four passenger platforms for 10-car trains (the same length as those that existed before the attack), a vast mezzanine, lower and upper concourses and a street-level building, presumably under glass, with retail space.
There will be pedestrian passageways to the 1 and 9 subway station, the World Financial Center, the Fulton Street Transit Center, Liberty Plaza and other buildings on the trade center site.
"We have a goal to fulfill," Mr. Calatrava said, "creating interior spaces of high quality, welcoming people, having them get immediately in touch with the light, giving them from the moment in which they are on the platform the feeling they are in ground zero, they are arriving in the city."
"The sequence of spaces will be one of the most interesting things to explore," he said. Although the mezzanine is underground, Mr. Calatrava said he hoped a way might be found to bring daylight and views into the space.
Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan, applauded Mr. Calatrava's ambitious vision -- to a point.
"It's certainly wonderful that he wants to create the best possible indoor space," she said yesterday. "Obviously, we want to be as creative and visionary as possible. But we also want street life. We don't want to internalize the civic audience too much. We want them to be on the streets, shopping, visiting other parts of the area."
Though none of Mr. Calatrava's other stations are precisely analogous to the PATH terminal, he said his designs for the Lyon Airport Station and the Orient Station in Lisbon embodied the kind of monumentality that might be appropriate. The Stadelhofen Station in Zurich exemplifies integration into an existing context, he said, and the Liege-Guillemins TGV Station in Liege, Belgium, shows how stations can play a role in economic regeneration.
The only New York City project that Mr. Calatrava has yet completed is the five-foot, stainless-steel New York Times Capsule, installed outside the American Museum of Natural History in 2001 and not to be opened until 3000.
Five years ago, he was part of a team with Beyer Blinder Belle that bid unsuccessfully on a new concourse and ticketing area for Pennsylvania Station within the landmark General Post Office on Eighth Avenue.
"He really is the modern descendant in the great tradition of architect-engineers like Robert Maillart, Pier Luigi Nervi and Isambard Kingdom Brunel," said John Belle, when asked yesterday how he had come to choose Mr. Calatrava.
Nervi, who designed the George Washington Bridge Bus Station of 1963 for the Port Authority, is a hero of Mr. Calatrava's. So is Eero Saarinen, whose Trans World Airlines Flight Center of 1962 at Kennedy Airport may be revived as part of a new terminal being planned by JetBlue Airways and the Port Authority.
"It puts us in a tradition of the Port Authority as a client of grand buildings," Mr. Calatrava said.

PERSON: Dr. Elizabeth C. Stone 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
To Preserve and Protect Iraq's Treasure Trove

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: STONY BROOK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
ON this state university campus, she is just another brainy professor with an impressive resume, a laboratory crammed with old shards of rock, bone and crockery, and a fondness for cooking and hiking. Harmless stuff. Send her to Iraq and she morphs into academia's version of a superhero, minus the cape; Indiana Jones without the romantic complications. 
 Those amoral guys in mid-desert toting AK-47 rifles and backpacks jammed with stolen artifacts circa 2000 B.C. -- fellow antiquities buffs bent onpreserving Iraq's archaeological treasure trove, they surely are not -- don't intimidate Dr. Elizabeth C. Stone. On a trip to Iraq in May to survey the destructive handiwork of excavation-site looters, her Marine escort persuaded her to turn back at Larsa, just north of Ur. Maybe she wasn't worried about getting ambushed, but the soldiers were. 
 In July, on a trip sponsored by the Mellon Foundation and the State Department, she delivered $250,000 in office equipment, furniture and computers to the ravaged Iraq National Museum in Baghdad. No easy task. She estimates 10 percent of its collection, some of it supplied by her fieldwork, was stolen or destroyed. 
"The gulf war changed everything, and this second war has exacerbated a bad situation," she laments. "The theft of antiquities is a high-stakes market for the players involved, and some of it's the fault of my colleagues who sit around and say, 'Yes, that's genuine.' At the moment it's turning the countryside into something like Colombia. There's money laundering, there's corruption. And nobody's acting like the police."
Dr. Stone, one of five Americans permitted to do archaeological research in Iraq before the gulf war and the only American archaeologist to make two trips there last summer, has learned to sleep through the rat-a-tat of evening gunfire in Baghdad. She has learned to cope with desert working conditions so fiery that, if one feels sick, the thermometer has to be shaken down from a feverish 110 degrees before it is usable.
On her office wall she keeps a color photograph of her first find -- a tiny carved, doglike animal wearing a collar -- from the iconic site at ancient Mashkan-shapir in 1987, an object presumably stolen last spring during the museum looting.
So she is thrilled, not apprehensive, that the State University at Stony Brook has been awarded a $4.1 million grant, renewable over two years, from the United States Agency for International Development to support reconstruction efforts focusing on archaeology and environmental health at Iraqi universities. In addition, she will select six Iraqi students to come to Stony Brook next June and pursue master's degrees in archaeology, and Stony Brook's library will create a digital library of materials related to Mesopotamian culture that can be accessed by Iraqi researchers. 
"It totally changes my life for the next three years," she says. She and the project's other leader, Dr. Wajdy Hailoo, a professor of preventive medicine, leave for Iraq on Nov. 2. Dr. Stone has already decided that driving in from Kuwait is the safest path.
Not that it's fail-safe.
"I guess I think life isn't worth living if you don't take some risks for the things you believe in," she says. "I want to do whatever I can to help make things come out well there. If Iraq turns into Somalia, we're all in big trouble. If you lose Iraq, you lose the Middle East. Maybe the future of civilization doesn't depend on it, but let's just say it wouldn't be a great thing for the future of civilization to lose the cradle of civilization." 
Mesopotamia produced a galaxy of legal, civil and social firsts, even, she adds impishly, the world's first beer! At first, it was drunk from a communal pot with a communal straw; later it was drunk from -- what else -- the world's first beer mugs. When the subject is ancient civilization, there is no such thing as arcane knowledge.
SUCH a pistol, that Dr. Stone. Not that she gives that away at first glimpse.
She is 54, white-haired and often bespectacled. Your standard-issue professor of anthropology, made a tad more authoritative by the vestige of a British accent (she accompanied, unenthusiastically, her parents from Oxford to the United States at age 14). Her main complaint about the move? Nothing worth digging for here. Her own digging began in earnest at 6 in the backyard garden after she read a book about a mole that discovered a buried treasure. By 8, she had informed her father, a historian, that she wanted to be an archaeologist. He approved, and even provided her with utensils. 
The summer before college, she worked as a surveyor for the Pennsylvania Historical Salvage Council, checking the path of the I-95 highway, and through that she met Prof. Robert H. Dyson of the University of Pennsylvania. He specialized in Iran excavations, and at 19, she participated in one; it was the turning point in her academic career.
She is peeved by the looting of the Iraq National Museum, the burned libraries in Baghdad and Mosul, and the continued pillaging of the Mesopotamian excavation sites. They were dug up, she says, like so many potato fields. Scrap her Nov. 2 mission to Iraq in light of persistent hostilities there? Never! If she and her colleagues, including her spouse, Paul E. Zimansky, a professor at Boston University and a perennial field partner on various Middle East projects like this one, don't protect the artifacts, who will? Not the Marines.

HEADLINE: Competition Among the Well-to-Do Is Good Business for Tutors 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
Allan Schneider, 59, is a laid-off engineer, unlikely to find another job that commands $175,000 a year in this economy. Laura Inman, 42, is a stay-at-home mother dusting off a Ph.D. in English as a ticket back to the workplace. Addi Feinstein, 23, is a recent Yale graduate, scrambling to pay her share of a five-roommate apartment.
 All three have the same plan for making money: Tutoring the children of wealthy baby boomers. It is one of the few flourishing professions these days, a word-of-mouth business where the stars in New York City and its suburbs earn more than $200,000 a year and newcomers aim for $50,000. 
 Private tutoring, once dominated by retired or moonlighting teachers and performing artists who needed flexible audition time, was a rarity until the mid-1990's, when Ivy League admissions became an obsession at suburban public schools and New York City independent schools. As the demand for tutors has grown in this demographic, so has the cast of characters, including recent Ivy League graduates, faced with limited job prospects, who are popular because they are young, cool and aced the SAT's. 
Anxiety about college admission is one of the engines that has made the tutoring industry among "the fastest-growing sectors in education," according to Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University. The others are tutoring for children stuck in public schools deemed failing under the No Child Left Behind act and those with learning disabilities, also subsidized under federal law.
But tutoring only well-to-do children is realistic for freelancers without expertise diagnosing learning disorders or affiliation with companies under contract to school systems nationwide. In this niche, anybody can post a flier at a bus shelter or an ad on the Internet. Qualified or not, they offer tutoring for a calculus test, the Independent School Entrance Exam or the verbal portion of the SAT.
Mr. Schneider already has 10 hours a week booked, mostly in Scarsdale, where math and science tutors easily earn $100 an hour and the Jewish Community Center has hired him to teach test preparation classes. Ms. Inman placed an ad on a bulletin board in her pharmacy in Hastings-on-Hudson and is honing the writing skills of four students at $75 an hour. Ms. Feinstein joined one of the big tutoring companies, which assigned her two classes and three private clients and sends her home with $45 an hour, less taxes, which is one third the rate it charges clients.
"There's all kinds of room for independent people and it's bringing some wonderful tutors into the business," Mr. Levine said. "But there's also great disparity in quality, no way of really finding out who's good, unless you buy the brand names. I wouldn't be shocked if something like the Better Business Bureau isn't quickly developed."
Word of mouth is the key to developing a client list, even for tutors affiliated with national companies like Kaplan and Princeton Review, which have requirements for the people they hire (90th percentile on their SAT's and a five-minute teaching audition) and quality control (refunds if test scores do not improve). But the companies honor requests for private tutors, leading to higher pay for popular ones.
Since most prestigious high schools frown on tutoring, as a rebuke to their teachers and an imposition on overscheduled children, they are not usually a source of recommendations for parents. But affluent communities have grapevines, and private college counselors make referrals.
One counselor, Frank Leana, discourages tutor envy among parents who cannot afford the $400 an hour for Inspirica's top tutors or the $325 at Princeton Review. "They come to me and say, 'Should I mortgage the house?' " Mr. Leana said. "A master tutor by name is not necessarily a master tutor in practice."
Master tutors, the Frederic Fekkais of the Ivy League strivers set, command a following. Brendan Mernin, one of the three top tutors at Princeton Review, had 39 students, twice his usual load, in the weeks leading up to the October SAT's, keeping him on the run from 3 to 9 p.m. on weekdays and most weekends.
During 10 years in the business, he has watched the industry grow. "Stand at the corner of 88th and Park or 73rd and Park at 5 or 7 on a weeknight and see how many 30-somethings walk by carrying a backpack or a shoulder bag," Mr. Mernin said. "Or talk to the doormen. They must buzz in tutors all afternoon and evening."
The success of the city's top tutors, invited by clients to tag along on ski holidays at Vail or summers in Tuscany, makes newcomers starry-eyed. But for every master tutor, there are many more, like J. C. Whittaker, a bartender and aspiring actor, who posted his number on Internet sites, contacted college counselors for referrals, applied for a position with Princeton Review but can find no clients.
Ms. Feinstein has done better, perhaps because her background matches her students'. She grew up in Scarsdale, went to a Jewish day school, scored 1570 of a possible 1600 on her SAT's, studied literature at Yale and now is considering medical school. Instead of waitressing like her college roommate, Ms. Feinstein applied to Kaplan, auditioned for the classroom with a five-minute lesson on how to cook a tuna casserole, trained for 20 hours and now teaches two group classes and three private clients.
Students see her as a role model, Ms. Feinstein said. They ask if she applied early decision (no), what extracurricular activities would enhance their resume (only what you enjoy; do not tailor yourself to the application) and what she would do differently in choosing a school (read the course catalog and be less status conscious).
"I try to calm them down a little," Ms. Feinstein said. "It's easy to lose perspective when you're going through it."
Some college graduates start tutoring as a way station and wind up staying.
Nalini Saxena, 23, with an undergraduate degree from Columbia in neuroscience, had a job lined up as an epidemiologist at the New York City Health Department until the events of Sept. 11 led to a shift in financing, from lead poisoning, her speciality, to bioterrorism. At a job fair, she left a resume with a recruiter from Kaplan. She has been there since, teaching SAT classes in public schools, readying teachers for certifying exams and stockbrokers for business school admissions tests.
"I don't know where I'll be in five years," Ms. Saxena said. "But I'm moving up here and I'm not closing the door on that."
Josh Lewis, a Brown graduate with a law degree from New York University, practiced for a year and decided that he hated lawyering. He also wanted a job that would give him time to coach cycling in the Special Olympics and be a concert photographer. So he honed his tutoring skill at Princeton Review and gradually established an independent practice in Westchester.
Mr. Lewis, who cannot be more than 30, would not reveal his age: "I don't want to be perceived as out of touch. If you're younger, you bond more."
Mr. Schneider, whose children are grown, cannot depend on bonding. But he has made a brisk start in a new profession. Within a month of being laid off, a former high school principal and full-time English tutor asked him to help a student struggling in physics. The work was satisfying. He visited math and guidance departments in Westchester and Fairfield County districts, offering to tutor "the ones that are really difficult and whose parents are driving you crazy."
Each happy client became a reference. When one student's score went up 125 points on the math SAT, "that kid's mom became the star on my list." When another mother proposed auditioning two tutors to teach her son chemistry, Mr. Schneider did not let pride stand in his way. "The kid picked me," he said.
Last spring he taught Regents prep classes in math, chemistry and physics at the Jewish Community Center in Scarsdale, which produced several private clients. This fall he returned to the to the community center, teaching SAT and PSAT classes. He has eight private students, along with the classes.
Crisscrossing Westchester in a used S.U.V., and having his ads answered by what he calls "tire kickers," is not what Mr. Schneider intended at his age. But the work quickly yanked him from the depression of unemployment and his financial expectations are modest. "I'm not going to make a million dollars doing this," he said. "I'm not even going to make $100,000."
Still he ends an e-mail message with an entrepreneurial postscript: "If you know any kids that need a good math, chem or physics tutor pls give them my name and phone number."

HEADLINE: Business Goes On in Jakarta Despite Threatof Terrorism 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
While security concerns prompted President Bush's schedulers to limit his Indonesian visit on Wednesday to three hours, American companies continue to operate in the country despite the constant danger of terrorist attack.
 A year after the bombing in Bali and two months after the attack at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, security experts consider Indonesia as dangerous as ever. Terrorist groups are still said to be roving the country. The next attack, security experts and American officials agree, is a matter not of if, but of when. 
 The Ford Motor Company, for one, is undeterred. Last month, Ford introduced a seven-seat sport utility vehicle with full-page advertisements in Indonesia's largest daily newspaper, part of an effort to break into a fast-growing auto market dominated by Japanese manufacturers. "There's no thought of taking people out," said Will Angove, Ford Motor Indonesia's president, who is Australian. "Indonesia is strategically an important market."
American businesspeople in Indonesia say, dangerous or not, the country offers so much opportunity that they cannot allow themselves to be scared off. Since the bombing at the Marriott, businesses have battened down, and the hotels serving foreigners resemble military compounds. But few of the roughly 10,000 Americans in Indonesia are leaving.
"They've been here a long time and understand the risks," said Brian C. Watters, a principal at Assessments Group Indonesia, a security consulting firm in Jakarta.
Security problems and corruption have been significant drags on foreign investment in Indonesia for a long time. But this year, foreign interest actually appears to be rising. Government approvals of foreign projects increased 3.7 percent in the first nine months of this year, compared with the period in 2002, and foreign investors have poured more than half a billion dollars into the Jakarta stock market this year.
"If you want to be a player in Southeast Asia, you need to be here," said Stuart Dean, president of G.E. International's Southeast Asian operations.
Indonesia's tourist industry is in tatters, but its consumer economy has proved somewhat impervious to terrorist fears, economists say. "After Bali, we thought there'd be a big impact on economic growth," said Anton Gunawan, head of economic and market analysis at Citibank in Jakarta. But the effect proved to be muted: growth slowed to a 3.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2003, then bounced back to 3.8 percent in the second quarter.
But the economy is not growing fast enough to help defuse terrorism at its roots. Economists estimate that annual growth of at least 6 percent would be needed to produce enough jobs to absorb the growing ranks of unemployed young Indonesians, who form a pool of potential recruits for radical organizations.
The biggest threat is Jemaah Islamiyah, the group linked to Al Qaeda that is considered responsible for the Bali and Marriott bombings. Its operations chief has been captured and one of its bomb experts killed, but the two men who are said to have made the Bali bomb remain at large. Also at large are thousands of Indonesians who have trained at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.
The United States Embassy in Jakarta has warned Americans to expect more attacks on places like hotels, bars, restaurants and shopping malls. Yet most Westerners living in Jakarta appear nonchalant. Some have confidence in the government's ability to crack down; others say they have simply become inured to living in a violent country. 
"The community here is fairly battle-hardened," said Nick Duder, director for a local security consulting firm, Hill Konsultan Indonesia. "Many of those that were seriously concerned have left."
Most expatriates in Indonesia already live behind walls topped with barbed wire or broken glass. After the rioting of 1998 and the months of sectarian unrest that followed, most companies set up detailed evacuation procedures and telephone trees to notify employees of trouble. 
Some of the largest investors, Western oil companies, have learned to cope with almost daily threats. Exxon Mobil operates gas fields in Aceh Province at the northwest tip of Sumatra, where the Indonesian army has been trying to suppress a long-simmering separatist rebellion; after a spate of attacks against its employees two years ago, the company suspended operations for four months but did not pull out.
Some expatriates say they see no more chance of being bombed in Indonesia than, say, being hit by a bus at home. "If I go to New York or Los Angeles, I could get killed, too," said a longtime resident, Peter Steenbergen, as he sat in a Jakarta Starbucks recently.
Security experts agree that, statistically speaking, expatriates have more to fear in Jakarta from traffic than from terrorists. But the terrorist threat is real.
"The risk here is higher than people actually make out," said Ian Dunsmore, managing director of Pinkerton Indonesia. "Even during the riots, there was nothing really aimed at your ex-pat. Now there are people out there who basically want to kill Americans."
In response, many companies like Ford are trying to run their Indonesia operations with more unmarried expatriates, and transfer those with families to other countries. Warnings of a plan to bomb schools attended by the children of foreigners prompted the Jakarta International School to close briefly to tighten its security. About 1,000 of its students left after the 1998 riots, said the school's headmaster, Niall C.W. Nelson, but of the 2,400 remaining a year ago, only about 100 have withdrawn. 
Since the Marriott bombing, hotels in Jakarta and other cities have tried to turn heightened security into a selling point, with metal detectors, car and luggage searches and military police patrolling the grounds. But security experts say that many major hotels are made vulnerable by their proximity to major streets, and visiting executives now often prefer hotels on larger grounds set far back from the road. Others try to avoid the big hotels, along with anyplace else where foreigners congregate. Mr. Angove, for example, said he avoided malls and movie theaters. 
Most major American companies doing business in Indonesia said they had tightened security but would not give specifics. Still, some measures are discernible. Anyone entering the building that houses the Jakarta offices of Nike and General Electric must pass through a metal detector and submit to a bag search. Mr. Dean said G.E. did not hold many meetings outside the building.
And Mr. Watters, the security consultant, said people who planned functions for expatriates frequently kept the location secret until a day before the event. "A terrorist attack takes planning," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Meets Indonesian President in Bali 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: DENPASAR, Indonesia, Wednesday, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush landed Wednesday morning in the world's most populous Muslim nation, and immediately headed into a meeting with President Megawati Sukarnoputri, beginning a three-hour visit.
 His arrival here was intended to bolster President Megawati's weakened government as it battles Islamic fundamentalist groups and a terror movement linked to Al Qaeda. Not surprisingly, he landed amid extraordinary security, including a low, fast approach to the resort island of Bali, Asia's best-known resort island, aboard Air Force One. He was immediately moved into his armored limousine and whisked to his meeting at a small hotel facility on the edge of the airport, but far from the tourist centers. The island itself is 95 percent Hindu. 
 The president came here after successfully persuading Asia's largest economic group on Tuesday to adopt a series of commitments to crack down on terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, expanding its authority beyond trade.
At the close of the group's annual summit meeting, held this year in Bangkok, Mr. Bush and the other 20 leaders gathered in an ornate former palace of the Thai royal family. They declared that the annual agenda of trade and economic issues must now be merged with questions of security. In a joint statement, the nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum called that a "complementary mission" because terrorism and unconventional weapons threaten to undermine economies around Asia.
The declarations issued Tuesday marked the first time that the group of 21 countries -- hardly allies, and varying in size from Russia and China to tiny Papua New Guinea -- has focused so heavily on a political agenda. That was President Clinton's intent when he first gathered the Asia-Pacific leaders in Seattle in 1993, saying they needed an equivalent of the annual meeting of European heads of government. But for most of the past decade, the member countries have resisted, restricting themselves to economic issues.
On Tuesday, however, the group announced a set of goals that sounded more like an agenda for NATO than for a loose amalgamation of countries that depend on each other for commerce.
The declaration includes a commitment to "dismantle, fully and without delay, transnational terrorist groups," a reference to the groups linked to Al Qaeda that have been battling government forces in the Philippines and Indonesia. It also commits the countries -- which have never had a military alliance, and are unlikely to create one anytime soon -- to "confront other direct threats to the security of our region," and to "eliminate the severe and growing danger posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery." 
How they would enforce those commitments is unclear. Even in the economic realm, the group has a mixed record of executing its agreements: five years ago, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the countries promised to overhaul the international financial architecture. But there was no mention of that on Tuesday, and much of the job remains undone.
Conspicuously, many of the member countries did not join Mr. Bush's program to interdict ships suspected of carrying terrorist weapons or to have planes intercepted -- steps that several nations have begun to adopt under American pressure. Nor did Mr. Bush unveil what administration officials say will be a plan to replace the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with a pact that would allow for the forced disarmament of violators.
Though the meetings were closed and the public comments of the leaders highly scripted, Mr. Bush seemed to receive a warm welcome on Tuesday, and chatted comfortably with a number of leaders, including Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi.
Mr. Bush seemed deliberately to avoid crossing paths with Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, whom the president had criticized Monday for a speech in which he declared that Jews controlled the world. But Mr. Mahathir, still stung, declared Tuesday that reports that Mr. Bush had criticized him were wrong.
"Certainly, he did not rebuke me," Mr. Mahathir told a news conference on Tuesday. "All he said was that 'I regret today to have to use strong words against you.' " Yet, Mr. Mahathir has repeated a number of his statements in recent days, and he said Tuesday that American newspapers did not report his criticism of Muslim society because they were controlled by Jewish publishers.
On Tuesday night, Mr. Bush arrived in Singapore and dined with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who has been among his strongest supporters in Asia. Singapore has become an important base for American intelligence agencies tracking terrorrists. The two men said little of note after their dinner, other than to call for tougher antiterror steps, and to celebrate a free-trade agreement that the two countries signed a month ago.

HEADLINE: New Information May Bolster Questions on Halliburton 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
The head of an Iraqi oil agency said yesterday that his group had been trucking in gasoline and other fuel to Iraq for considerably less money than Halliburton, which has so far received more than $700 million from the Army Corps of Engineers to stave off shortages there.
 Separately, a report earlier this month by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan public policy research arm, warned that the Corps of Engineers might be paying too much to import fuel. 
 The disclosures support assertions by two senior House Democrats, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and John D. Dingell of Michigan, that Halliburton may be overcharging American taxpayers and Iraqis. The lawmakers sent a letter to the head of the Corps of Engineers yesterday asking it to look into the price disparity between the Iraqi agency's imports and Halliburton's. 
The letter also noted new information released by the corps that most of the money to buy the fuel had come from a fund established by the United Nations meant to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq. The fund is under American control.
"Although it initially appeared that Halliburton was gouging only American taxpayers," the lawmakers said in the letter to Lt. Gen. Robert B. Flowers, head of the Corps of Engineers, "it now seems that the company is overcharging the humanitarian Oil for Food program and the Iraqi people as well. This significantly compounds the implications of Halliburton's actions."
Halliburton, which is paid a fee of 2 percent of the cost of the fuel it delivers, has strongly denied the accusation of overcharging, if not the pricing cited by the lawmakers. It contends that it buys fuel by soliciting competitive bids and that the high cost stems from the price of transporting and distributing fuel in a volatile country. The Army Corps of Engineers and the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-led civil administration in Iraq, have so far stood by Halliburton.
But Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization is now importing fuel, too, and from the same countries nearby as Halliburton. An Oct. 16 fax from the agency to the House Committee on Government Reform, where Mr. Waxman is the ranking Democrat, indicates that the Iraqis are bringing in gasoline at a much lower price than is Halliburton.
Halliburton said in response to the Congressional letter last week that it charges $1.59 a gallon for its gasoline imports, which includes the 2 percent profit margin. In the fax, the Iraqi marketing organization's general manager, Mohammed al-Jibouri, said that gasoline from Turkey costs $347 a metric ton delivered to Baghdad, which he said translates to about 98 cents a gallon.
Halliburton did not dispute that the Iraqis were buying fuel for a much lower price, saying instead that the nature of the company's contracts with the Corps of Engineers made it harder to get a better price from suppliers. The corps did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the contract conditions.
Referring to a Halliburton unit working in Iraq, Wendy Hall, a Halliburton spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message from Houston that "contractually, KBR has been prevented from procuring fuel contracts for longer than a 30-day period."
"In addition," she said, "all services and their associated costs to execute the mission are subject to the same 30-day procurement limit, including trucks, trailers, depots and labor. Simple economics dictate that companies who are not bound by these guidelines, and are able to negotiate price on a long-term contract basis, can negotiate lower prices."
The Corps of Engineers has shown on its Web site that most of the money paid to Halliburton to import the petroleum products has until now come from the Development Fund for Iraq, established by the United Nations Security Council to give the American-led occupying authority control over money Iraq had earned under the Oil for Food program.
But in its supplemental financing package for Iraq, the Bush administration has asked Congress to approve $900 million for fuel imports.
The Congressional Research Service said in its memorandum, on Oct. 8, that the request for $900 million to import fuel to Iraq suggested that the Coalition Provisional Authority "is asking for substantially more money than is called for by current fuel prices in the Persian Gulf trading area."
Based in part on that memo, two other Democrats, Senators Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Ron Wyden of Oregon, have added an amendment to strip away $200 million for fuel imports from the Senate-passed version of the $20.3 billion supplemental finance bill. That would be in line with the $197 million to $249 million the Congressional Research Service memo says the government may be overpaying for fuel.
The memo includes a caveat that costs for delivery and particularly distribution could add greatly to the total price of fuel imports. And Halliburton has argued that the costs of its imports are high because it "incurs costs for transportation, storage, distribution, quality assurance and labor required to manage the operation." Halliburton also implied in its statement last week that security concerns contributed to the $1.59-a-gallon cost of gasoline.
American taxpayers foot most of the bill; Iraqis pay 4 cents to 15 cents a gallon at the pump.
"Based on the entire picture," Ms. Hall of Halliburton wrote in her e-mail message, "to allege that KBR is overcharging for this needed service insults the KBR employees who are performing this dangerous mission to help bring fuel to the people of Iraq. The drivers transporting the fuel face the real risk of being killed or wounded, and vehicles and contents being destroyed."
The 2 percent fee, she added, "is less than the markup for products at a local gas station or supermarket."
Yet in an e-mail message to staff members of the House committee, the Washington office of the Coalition Provisional Authority suggested that Halliburton and the Iraqi marketing agency do not seem to have different security and distribution costs.
The message quoted Larry Rogers, deputy for program management at Team Rio, the Corps of Engineers-led project to rebuild the Iraqi oil industry, as saying that Halliburton and the Iraqi agency's oil "are generally being delivered to the same depots and distribution systems." The message also says that "fuel truck convoys are required to be escorted by coalition military forces regardless of ownership."
But Mr. Jibouri, the Iraqi marketing group's chief, said by telephone from Baghdad that the 98 cents a gallon it pays for the priciest gasoline it imports "includes everything."
"The contractor we sign with is obliged to buy the gasoline and deliver it into our depots," he said. "There are no extra costs."
What explains the difference between the Halliburton and Iraqi prices? "They are not actually accustomed to this business," Mr. Jibouri said. "They probably don't know the region that well. We know the area very well. We used to sell petroleum products to the people we now buy from."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about fuel sales in Iraq referred incorrectly at one point to subsidies for gasoline sales. They come from the United Nations oil-for-food program, not from United States taxpayers. In an appropriations bill, the Bush administration is proposing that American taxpayers subsidize them.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Leaner City Must Still Invest in Economic Growth 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined his economic policies yesterday to business leaders and public officials, saying that despite the lean fiscal times he inherited, New York City simply could not afford to forgo investments in its future.
 The mayor's address to the Association for a Better New York, which was billed by his aides as a "major speech on economic development," sounded at times like a campaign kickoff. The mayor took credit for putting the city's finances in order, described his goal "to create the conditions that will generate a job for every single New Yorker who wants to work," and discussed projects planned in all five boroughs. 
As Mr. Bloomberg spoke, two giant screens, one on each side of him, flashed a series of colorful graphs, artists' renderings of future development projects, and vintage photographs of the construction of the Chrysler Building. In a State of the Union touch, the mayor referred in his speech to five real New Yorkers, who were all in the audience, who stand to benefit from the projects that are planned for each borough. 
The mayor did not describe any major new city policies or new large-scale projects in his speech. Later, he announced plans for a two-story building that will be built on a city-owned vacant lot just north of the Hub in the Bronx to house a new office for the Finance Department and a store or two. 
Speaking at a breakfast at the Hilton New York in Midtown, the mayor sought to weave all of the city's economic development projects together, and to describe them as part of one coherent strategy for planning for the city's future.
Mr. Bloomberg drew a sharp contrast between now and the 1970's, when the city pulled through another fiscal crisis by deferring maintenance and construction projects, a move that cost the city down the road when its infrastructure crumbled.
"The despairing days are gone, and we're not going to let them come back, ever," he said. "We are acting now to bring jobs, and hope, to communities throughout our city. And we will keep doing that, so that a hundred years from now, New Yorkers will look back on us and say, 'They passed on to us a city that was better, far better, than they found it.' "
Mr. Bloomberg said his administration "insisted on the responsible fiscal policy of paying as we go for the services the public wants, despite the political fallout." In fact, his first budget borrowed more than $1.5 billion to pay for services, a practice that is usually frowned upon but which was approved in light of the Sept. 11 attack. 
Mr. Bloomberg also said that the city had "essentially ended corporate welfare as we know it, by no longer paying companies -- who wouldn't have left anyways -- to stay in this great city." 
Under the Bloomberg administration, the city has awarded or announced plans to award roughly $75 million in tax incentives to private companies, said Michael Sherman, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Sherman said that the city has averaged two deals involving significant tax breaks a year, down from eight a year in the Giuliani administration. But business leaders note that since Sept. 11, 2001, federal money has been available for so-called job-retention grants.
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, praised the administration for moving away from an economic strategy that was often dictated in the past by individual real estate developers or by corporations threatening to leave the city. 
"This administration has, for the first time, tried to put together a comprehensive strategy," she said. 
City Councilman Eric Gioia, a Queens Democrat, said he saw the speech as an effort to shore up support among business leaders. "The mayor, sensing vulnerability, is trying to come out and reassure his base not to abandon him," said Mr. Gioia, who attended the breakfast. "If Mike Bloomberg can't win the C.E.O. crowd -- that's like me not being able to carry the Gioia household."

HEADLINE: The Mullahs and the Bomb 

BYLINE:  By Gary Milhollin; Gary Milhollin is director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With much fanfare, and the reluctant endorsement of the Bush administration, Iran has vowed to suspend its controversial effort to produce enriched uranium -- which can be used as fuel in nuclear weapons -- and to clear up a host of suspicions about its nuclear program. In exchange, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany promised new "cooperation" -- meaning trade -- in high technology with Tehran. While perhaps getting any concessions out of the mullahs should be seen as a step forward, this particular deal won't prevent Iran from making the bomb. It also risks having the same outcome as the deal North Korea made in 1994 and later violated, and threatens to drive a wedge between the United States and its European allies on Iran policy.
 The suspicions about Iran's nuclear aims are well founded. Leaving aside the question whether such an oil-rich country even needs nuclear power plants, America has long questioned why Iran is building a factory to enrich uranium, material for which there is no reasonable need in Iran's civilian power program. 
 Iran also plans to produce plutonium, another fuel for nuclear weapons, by building a 40-megawatt heavy water reactor at Arak. This type of reactor, too small for electricity and larger than needed for research, is now providing the fuel for atomic weapons programs in India, Israel and Pakistan. And Iran is developing a fleet of long-range missiles, which don't make sense as a way to deliver conventional warheads. The only logical purpose of such missiles is to carry nuclear ones. 
International suspicions about these programs led to the current crisis: the International Atomic Energy Agency has given Iran until Oct. 31 to explain how mysterious traces of bomb-grade uranium got into two Iranian nuclear sites. Iran says the traces arrived on contaminated imports; the other explanation is that Iran has been secretly enriching uranium in violation of its inspection agreement with the agency. The agency also wants to know how Iran developed such a high level of enrichment technology without secretly testing it with nuclear material, which is also forbidden. The agency's experts are convinced that the testing occurred. 
Under the new deal, Iran is supposed to explain all this. If it doesn't, it risks being condemned as a pariah by the Security Council and the European Union may have to shelve its trade agreement with Iran, which would cost all concerned a lot of money. Thus Britain, France and Germany, as well as Iran, have an interest in seeing Iran comply.
But the problem is, even if Iran does so, there will be little assurance that the deal will really dampen Iran's nuclear hopes. Consider what happened with the pact hammered out by the Clinton administration with North Korea in 1994, which had much in common with the present situation.
North Korea faced worldwide condemnation and a possible war with the United States after violating its inspection agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. By agreeing to suspend its effort to produce plutonium, North Korea avoided censure and got economic benefits from the West, and yet it preserved its nuclear potential intact. North Korea's 8,000 fuel rods -- containing five bombs' worth of plutonium -- never left the country. Like a sword poised over the world's head, they remained only months away from being converted into bomb fuel -- something that the North Koreans say was finally done this summer. The North Korean bomb program only shifted into neutral; now it is back in gear.
Under Tuesday's deal Iran, too, will shift into neutral, while keeping its nuclear potential intact. It won't -- for the time being -- operate its newly constructed centrifuges, which are needed to enrich uranium to weapon grade. But the deal won't stop Iran from building more centrifuges to augment the limited number it now has, thus adding to its future ability to enrich uranium. Nor does the agreement bar Iran from completing the factory that produces the uranium gas that goes into the centrifuges. Nor does it prevent the building of the heavy water reactor or, indeed, the resumption of enrichment in the future. Thus the agreement could insulate Iran from international censure without hampering its nuclear progress in any way. 
These defects won't be cured by Iran's acceptance of more rigorous inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The inspectors' new rights are still weaker than those that were enjoyed by their counterparts in Iraq -- and we all know that the Iraqis repeatedly foiled those efforts with delays and obfuscation. 
The only real solution is to convince Iran to dismantle all the plants that can make fuel for nuclear weapons. This would remove the threat that Iran could go back into the bomb business on a moment's notice, and the country could still benefit from the electricity generated by its Russian-supplied reactor at Bushehr, which should be sufficient if Iran truly wants only civilian nuclear power. 
This goal is what the Europeans hope to achieve in the long run. It would probably satisfy the United States as well. But the current agreement won't take us there, and it may lead to the same sort of bickering between the United States and its vital allies that fractured international action on North Korea and Iraq. 
The only chance for a solution to the Iran nuclear problem, short of war, is for a united West to apply relentless economic pressure. That means quickly closing any gap between Europe and the United States. It may be possible to convince Iran that the costs of building nuclear weapons exceed the benefit of having them. Unlike North Korea, Iran has large trade interests that really matter. However, unless the rest of the world is willing to put those interests at risk, it will probably soon have to live with a new nuclear power in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Rising productivity is a good thing, right? Tell that to the newly unemployed.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
RECENTLY productivity has been growing at a rate of about 4 percent a year. For the country as a whole, this means that each year we can work as much as we did last year and consume 4 percent more; or we can consume as much as we did last year and work 4 percent less.
 That's got to be a good thing, right? 
 Well, it depends on whom you ask. In truth, those productivity gains have resulted in some people's working 100 percent less, with the rest of us consuming 4.01 percent more. If you are one of the unemployed, chances are you are less enthusiastic about the productivity gains than are those who have enjoyed the increased consumption. 
Strangely, productivity growth is not getting much blame for the "jobless recovery." Criticizing technological progress is downright un-American. On the other hand, criticizing foreign trade is a traditional pastime here, as in every other country.
To economists, trade and productivity growth have a lot in common: each allows you to produce more with less.
James Ingram's economics text tells the story of how an entrepreneur built a factory that was significantly more productive than his competitors' plants, and was hailed far and wide for his brilliance.
But then his dirty little secret was revealed: all he was doing was importing goods from abroad through the back door.
In terms of impact on employment, trade is usually better than productivity growth; those dollars sent abroad eventually come back to purchase American products, and employ more workers. By contrast, jobs lost to productivity increases stay lost; try to find someone today who can make buggy whips.
Gains from trade or technology initially tend to accrue to owners of capital. When a company fires a computer programmer and shifts the job to India, the company captures the difference in wages.
It wouldn't have to work that way. Suppose the programmer found his doppelganger in India, and started exporting tasks on his own. "Dear Sanjay, please write a subroutine to sort these accounts and send it back to me by 5 p.m. (California time)." Each week the programmer could cash his $1,000 paycheck and send $100 to Sanjay.
This is only a thought experiment, not a policy proposal. But it illustrates the point that the controversy over trade and technology is not about whether or not they are good things -- of course they are -- but about who will capture their benefits and who will bear their costs.
There is little doubt who wins in the long run: consumers. Virtually all the gains in the standard of living in the last two centuries have come from technology. Trade has had a smaller but still significant effect on growth in per capita consumption.
Achieving the gains from technological advances can be tortuous. Back in 1886, when America's railroads standardized on one gauge, it became substantially cheaper to transport goods. A great boon for everyone, right? Well, tell that to the workers who unloaded and loaded freight at the cities where different-gauge railroads met. They rioted over the change, and understandably so -- the benefits from technological progress came at the expense of their jobs.
Eighty years later, the longshoremen's union was more farsighted. It saw new technology coming for unloading ships and negotiated lifetime employment at high wages. The result was that by 2002 a full-time longshoreman earned $80,000 to $107,000, depending on whether you ask the union or management.
The crucial issue in last year's West Coast port strike was not whether technology for managing shipyards would be introduced -- both sides were in favor -- but whether the new information-processing jobs went to union workers.
The longshoremen's union has tried to ensure that a significant part of the gains from productivity increases accrued to its members. But even the longshoremen recognize, though they might be loath to admit it, that there has to be something for both sides in the negotiation; if all the gains go to labor, there will be no incentive for capitalists to adopt more productive technology.
Capitalists have to get their piece, so they will have an incentive to pony up the money. How much labor ends up with depends on its bargaining power. If workers do not have much bargaining power, they get the short end of the deal.
In the long run, as the new technology becomes widely adopted, competition pushes prices down. The gains that originally accrued to the owners of capital are competed away, and consumers -- meaning workers for the most part -- end up with the benefits.
Look at travel agents. The Internet opened up a new channel for airlines to communicate directly to travelers. Intense competition for passengers meant that most of the gains from the new technology were passed along to consumers, with travel agents squeezed out of their jobs.
But once they find new jobs, those same travel agents will benefit from the lower prices that resulted from productivity gains elsewhere.
Workers who are at a stage of their life where they want to increase consumption, or accumulate assets, naturally resent labor-saving productivity growth or trade. But those who are about to retire, and consume more leisure, find cheaper goods attractive. It's unfortunate when trade or productivity growth causes a 50-year-old worker to lose his job; but the same economic changes can be a boon to a 62-year-old who can then afford to retire a few years early.
In the next decade, the baby boomers will start to retire and we will have to learn to produce more with less labor. Productivity growth and international trade will be important to making a successful transition to a labor-scarce economy.
But if these gains from technology and trade are to be politically palatable, we have to find a way to make sure that all can benefit from the increased opportunities they offer for consumption and leisure.

PERSON: Roy A. Anderson 

HEADLINE: Roy A. Anderson, 82, Chief Who Revived Lockheed Profit 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Roy A. Anderson, who as chairman and chief executive of the Lockheed Corporation steadied and rebuilt the floundering company in the late 1970's and early 1980's, died on Saturday at his home in California. He was 82.
 Mr. Anderson had been in failing health for several years, said Barbara Reinike, the director for community relations at Lockheed Martin, the successor to Lockheed. 
 Mr. Anderson began his career as an accountant at Lockheed and was named chairman and chief executive in 1977, when the company was mired in political and financial scandals that threatened its future. The company had already been forced to negotiate a federal loan guarantee, something with little precedent at the time. A company poll showed that the public associated it more with financial mismanagement than with any of the airplanes or military hardware that rolled off its assembly lines. 
But by the time Mr. Anderson retired as chief executive in 1985, Lockheed was reporting steady profit growth and had resumed paying dividends after a 15-year hiatus. The federal loan guarantee had been retired because Lockheed could obtain credit without the government's help. At the last annual meeting over which he presided, Mr. Anderson was able to describe winning more than $500 million in contracts for the federal government's Strategic Defense Initiative program, known as Star Wars, and was to predict that more than twice that amount was in the offing.
He continued as a director until 1990 and was named chairman emeritus in 1987.
Mr. Anderson became chief executive after several years of turbulence at Lockheed, much of it caused by reports that its senior executives had bribed government officials in at least 15 foreign countries. In Japan, the accusations of bribery eventually led to the ouster of the prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka.
Lockheed had also earned a reputation for overrunning, by millions of dollars, the cost of building the C-5A cargo plane. In addition, its attempt to enter the commercial aircraft business, with the three-engine L1011 Tristar jet, foundered after Rolls Royce, the manufacturer of the jet engines, went bankrupt.
As chief executive, Mr. Anderson eventually halted production of the jet, a crucial decision that took Lockheed out of the commercial aircraft business. Focusing on military hardware proved prescient after Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 and began a military buildup. Lockheed soon regained stature as a top Pentagon contractor, winning contracts for satellites, nuclear missiles, cargo jets, space shuttle maintenance and work on the stealth aircraft. 
After he retired, Mr. Anderson remained active in civic groups and causes, including the Los Angeles Music Center, the Salvation Army and various initiatives to strengthen police, schools and other public services in Los Angeles. When the Los Angeles-area United Way became embroiled in a financial scandal in 1986, he took over as its unpaid acting president and called for a more active board and greater diligence by the outside auditors.
Mr. Anderson was also a trustee of Stanford University and Occidental College. With his wife, who survives, he established the Roy and Betty Anderson professorship in economics at Stanford. In 1994, he became chairman of the Weingart Foundation.
Mr. Anderson was born in 1920 in Ripon, Calif., and served in the Navy during World War II and the Korean War. He studied accounting and economics at Stanford and earned a master's degree in business administration. He joined Lockheed in 1956 and became chief financial officer in 1971.
In addition to his wife, who lives in La Canada, Calif., he is survived by two sons, Ross and Jim; two daughters, Karyn Anderson and Debra White; two brothers, Eugene and Howard; two sisters, Elizabeth and Eleanor; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: DONORS; 
Envoys Gather In Madrid To Discuss Aid To Rebuild Iraq

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: MADRID, Thursday, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Envoys from more than 55 countries are to open a long-awaited international donors' conference on Iraq Thursday amid indications that commitments for at least $7 billion in loans and grants over the next four years have been won from various countries and from the World Bank and other institutions.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, arriving here for the conference, cautioned that, as expected, the sums to be raised in Madrid would fall considerably short of the target of $55 billion for Iraq's overall needs as assessed by the World Bank and American occupation officials. 
 "I have never approached this as a goal that has to be reached," Mr. Powell said of the $55 billion figure, $20 billion of which the administration wants to be met by Congress this year. "It's a goal to which we will always be striving." 
The largest commitment made so far has been about $4 billion in loans that the World Bank said it was prepared to make over four years when certain conditions were met. The sum of various commitments over one year or several years from Japan, South Korea, European nations and Canada is a little more than $3 billion.
The oil-rich Arab states have yet to be heard from, but Kuwait has promised to be "generous," an American official said. Mr. Powell said he had been in contact with the other nations in the region and had suggested what their contributions might be, but he did not go into details.
The World Bank estimates that Iraq would probably not be able to spend more than $6 billion in the first year because of the time needed to start projects.
Led by Mr. Powell, the American delegation is to include Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and L. Paul Bremer III, the administrator of the American occupation. Members of the Iraqi Governing Council, which was handpicked by the American authorities, will also attend, as will Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations.
Germany and France, which are not expected to contribute money to Iraq right now, have both highlighted the problem of Iraq's debt, some of which is owed to them, as an obstacle to any country making more loans to Iraq. What has to be worked out, they say, is a procedure to determine which of the many repayment obligations should get priority.
The sums being talked about on the eve of the Madrid conference represent a considerable increase over what was discussed even a few weeks ago. But Bush administration officials fear that even the sums mentioned now could represent commitments that may not turn into cash.
In January 2002, a conference on Afghanistan drew pledges of $4 billion to $5 billion over five years, and although the United States ended up contributing two or three times what it committed, some other countries failed to live up to their pledges.
Passage last week of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on nations around the world to aid Iraq helped encourage some donor countries to come forward, Mr. Powell said.

HEADLINE: Powell Says Sudanese Hope to Reach a Peace Accord This Year 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell won a commitment on Wednesday from Sudanese negotiators to reach agreement by the end of December to end the civil war in Sudan, and he invited the parties to the White House to celebrate a settlement with President Bush.
 After a morning of hearing updates on the Sudan talks at a lakeside resort near Nairobi, Kenya, Mr. Powell said that the government in Khartoum had reached an understanding on several issues with the rebels in the south, who have waged war on and off for half a century, but that a few critical issues remained. 
 "I think all of us are confident that they can be resolved in the weeks ahead," Mr. Powell said. "And now both parties have agreed to remain in the negotiation and conclude a comprehensive settlement no later than the end of December."
Later, however, a Sudanese government negotiator, Ghazi Salaheddine, cautioned that it might be difficult to move the talks that fast. Mr. Salaheddine, the peace adviser to Sudan's president, Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, said it was "impossible for anyone to dictate a date" for finishing the talks, Agence France-Presse reported.
Mr. Powell's overt prodding, not to mention the setting of a deadline and the offer of a White House ceremony, reflected what African experts say has been an extraordinary amount of attention by the Bush administration to a contentious African issue.
Many diplomats say that without American involvement, the talks might have foundered, just as they have many times in the past. 
Immediately after seeing the Sudan negotiators at a hotel on Lake Naivasha, Mr. Powell left for Sharm el Sheik, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea, to meet with President Hosni Mubarak.
The meeting here was scheduled at the last minute, when the secretary's aides learned Mr. Mubarak was going to be near Sharm el Sheik, Mr. Powell's refueling stop on his way to Madrid for a conference on the economic future of Iraq.
The Sudan civil war has taken a toll of two million dead, many from disease and starvation, and perhaps four million displaced since 1983, when the largely Christian and animist rebels in the south rose up against the Muslim government in Khartoum.
Talks to end the war have focused on granting the southern region more autonomy and not imposing Islamic law on its residents. In return for joining the Khartoum government, the Sudan rebels, led by Col. John Garang, agreed to wait six years and then hold a referendum to decide the south's status.
Reporting on the talks, Mr. Powell said the major breakthrough occurred last month when both sides agreed to separate their military forces. Now, he said, there must be agreement on matters like banking and the monetary system, shares in Sudan's potential oil wealth and government power-sharing.
The most contentious issue, the secretary said, was the boundary between north and south. Three regions in the center of the country, populated by both Muslims and Christians, are in contention: Abeiyie, which has great potential oil wealth; the Nuba Mountains, and the Blue Nile region, which controls vital water supplies that flow into northern Africa, including Egypt.

HEADLINE: A Farmer Kills Another and Town Asks, How Did It Come to This? 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: MILO, Iowa, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
On the cold evening that Tom Lyon's body was found dumped in an old well, hidden under two bales of hay, people here suspected an outsider had done it, maybe one of the drug dealers they had heard so much about lately, running methamphetamine around the rural Midwest.
 Soon, though, they learned that the sheriff had taken away Rodney N. Heemstra, who lived just down the road and had raised feeder pigs here since before he finished Southeast Warren High School. The news was scarcely imaginable: One longtime Milo farmer accused of killing another. The men had known each other for at least 30 years. 
 A growing season has come and gone since the killing, but the town of 839 people has not mended. People took sides. Some stopped speaking to the others. And even on Wednesday evening, as a jury found Mr. Heemstra guilty of first-degree murder, no one could really answer the most troubling question of all: How did it come to this? 
"Violence here is minimal anyway, but when it's one of your own, it's harder to understand," Gerald D. Judkins, the local veterinarian, said on a recent afternoon. "We're still trying to come to grips with it."
Somewhere at the heart of it all, though, is a piece of land: 315 acres, some of it the precious black dirt that grows corn and soybeans better than the clay found in other fields, and some of it pasture. The land went on sale. Both men wanted it.
Farmland is a treasured commodity, not just in Milo, not just in Iowa, and not just for the obvious reasons. In the complicated equation that is modern agriculture, the mere size of one's farm can mean the difference between prosperity and failure. The competition to snap up whatever acres become available -- the "land battle," as one farmer here called it -- can be fierce. Increasingly expensive tractors and combines and other mounting overhead costs in recent years have led some farmers, whose families once planted just a few hundred acres, to farm as much land as possible.
Mr. Heemstra explained his version of that notion this week to the jury that controlled his fate. "You have to spread these costs over more acres," Mr. Heemstra testified. "Every farmer feels the need to grow. That's just the way the business is."
Mr. Heemstra, 44, and Mr. Lyon, 52, were known to all here, known so well that the trial had to be moved to Sioux City, 200 miles away. Mr. Heemstra grew up here on his father's farm. Over the years, he had given up hogs and cows for corn and soybeans, and had bought or leased more than 1,000 acres over nearly a dozen spots around the county.
Mr. Lyon, who had cows and also grew a more moderate crop of corn and beans, had come to be known by some as the Mayor of Motor, a handful of houses and a church a few miles up the road from Milo. It was not an official title in the least, but a sign of his loyalty and permanence there.
He also lived just across the gravel road from another farm, known as the Rodgers Place, for the farmer who used to be there. Mr. Lyon rented the land for a few years, but by July of 2002, Lucille Rodgers had decided to sell and move away. Her asking price was $913,500.
Witnesses do not agree about everything that happened next, but one thing was certain: Mr. Lyon would have liked to be able to buy the place and felt he deserved the first crack at it. And Mr. Heemstra, who had driven past it and thought about buying it for years, wanted it, too.
Within a day of the listing, Mr. Heemstra had a signed contract for a little more than $800,000.
But the closing could not take place until March 2003, as is standard practice with farming leases. Mr. Lyon had the rights to the land from March to March. So for the fall and winter of 2002, Mr. Heemstra would be visiting the property to check up on conditions there, and Mr. Lyon would be farming there.
The tension between them began mounting.
According to Mr. Lyon's friends, he had gotten over losing out on the land, and had decided he was better off without it, but Mr. Heemstra said Mr. Lyon berated him over the issue every chance he got. Mr. Lyon accused Mr. Heemstra of "getting all the breaks" and "taking over everything," Mr. Heemstra claimed at trial. He said Mr. Lyon cussed him at every meeting, tried to run his car off the road, and finally pledged that, one way or another, Mr. Heemstra would not get the Rodgers Place.
Early on Jan. 13, before sunrise, Mr. Heemstra checked up on the Rodgers Place. As he drove out, he saw Mr. Lyon's truck. Mr. Lyon, he said, blocked part of the road and told him to get out of his truck. 
In the dark, the dispute continued. Mr. Heemstra said Mr. Lyon threatened him and told him he would never get that land. But prosecutors say Mr. Heemstra simply grew angry at the taunts and the continuing fight, and got even.
Mr. Heemstra pulled out a rifle and shot Mr. Lyon, who was unarmed, in the head. Mr. Heemstra admitted that he then strapped the body to the back of his pickup, drove to one of his fields and tossed Mr. Lyon, headfirst, into an old well. 
Before his jury this week, Mr. Heemstra said as he wept that he wished he could undo it all. Asked whether he had considered Mr. Lyon a foe in the business of farming, Mr. Heemstra said, "I would say all farmers in a farming community, unfortunately, are competitors." 
Despite what some farmers say about the bleak future of their work in general, land remains a central commodity. The number of farmers has shrunk in recent decades, Department of Agriculture statistics show. The size of their farms has grown. 
"They tend to be over-invested in equipment, so spreading your fixed costs over more acres is one way to solve that," said Robert W. Jolly, a professor of economics at Iowa State University. "You basically increase the amount of land you're operating."
More land can also mean more federal subsidy payments. All that, as well as a growing market of nonfarmers buying farmland as investments and even as hunting or camping properties, can lead to stiff bidding wars among a handful of people, Mr. Jolly said.
As Brandon Smith weighed truckloads of corn arriving at the South Central Co-op in Milo on a recent afternoon, he said he foresaw an ever-shrinking number of farmers owning all the land. He would like to run his own farm, too, he said, but between health insurance costs and land prices, who could?
"In 20 years, there's probably going to be 20 farmers in the whole county," Mr. Smith said. "It's really depressing."
Already, there are two farmers fewer.
Mr. Heemstra faces a mandatory life sentence in prison. In February, hundreds of farmers from Iowa and elsewhere came here to bid on Mr. Heemstra's farm equipment at an auction -- the bleak sign, most always, of a farmer giving up or passing away. Hundreds more gathered here again last month with Mr. Lyon's widow, Ronda, as his tractors, combines and mowers were auctioned away, too.

HEADLINE: Ikea Index Indicates the Euro Is Not a Price Equalizer Yet 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SYLVERS 

DATELINE: MILAN, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
That a storage chest sold by the Swedish home furnishing giant Ikea costs 59 percent more in Austria than in the United States is perhaps not surprising, considering the countries are on different continents and have different currencies, taxes, inflation, labor laws and interest rates.
 But that the same Moppe storage chest is 39 percent more expensive in Austria than in Germany, countries that share a border and a currency, is an indication that the introduction of the euro has yet to succeed in one of its basic missions: to create a single, transparent market where identical goods cost the same everywhere. 
 Just how elusive this goal has been was highlighted by some recently published research by Gabriel Thulin, a Swedish statistician. 
Mr. Thulin, whose fellow Swedes voted overwhelmingly last month against membership in the European single currency, works for the financial communications consulting firm of Hallvarsson & Halvarsson. He conducted his research on his own time. 
Following the lead of the Big Mac index, a comparison of the price of the McDonald's sandwich around the world that is published by The Economist, Mr. Thulin constructed the IKEA index, which compares a basket of 26 Ikea products, including the Moppe storage chest, across 15 countries: 8 in the euro zone, 3 non-euro European Union countries, 2 European countries not in the union, the United States and Canada. 
According to the report, consumers in the United States pay the least for Ikea products, and those in Finland, a euro country, pay the most. Among euro countries in the survey, people in the Netherlands pay the least for the full hypothetical basket -- 17 percent less than in Finland.
The cost and time involved in buying a bookcase in Germany and transporting it to Belgium will more than cancel out any potential savings for most consumers. So Ikea can still charge Belgians 33 percent more than Germans for the Billy bookcase, even though both are euro countries and there is a German Ikea store near the Belgian border.
Ikea, like many multinational companies, is also able to charge different prices in different countries because the company is adept at exploiting local market conditions, experts say. For example, here in Italy, the fourth-most-expensive Ikea country in the index, the local competition tends to be from smaller high-end furniture stores rather than large retailers as in the United States.
"At the end of the day it is a question of supply and demand, and prices will be higher where there is more demand," said Lorenzo Codogno, co-head of European economic research at the Bank of America in London. "There has been some convergence thanks to the euro, but not as much as initially expected."
Price convergence is not the only aspect of monetary integration that did not develop as quickly as expected, Mr. Codogno said. Trade between countries in the euro zone has grown since the introduction of the common currency, he said, but not by as much as policy makers had expected.
Ikea also capitalizes on its brand name by charging more where the brand is strongest, Mr. Thulin said.
According to Marianne Barner, Ikea's communications manager, "Each country sets its own prices, which depend on competition, wages and taxes."
"Our philosophy is to have the lowest price on comparable products in every country, compared with our competitors," she added.
While the United States is the cheapest Ikea country over all, some products in the survey are cheaper in Europe. For instance, though Finland is the most expensive country for the full basket of Ikea goods in Mr. Thulin's index, one item, the Sultan Skymning mattress, is 42 percent less expensive there than in the United States. This indicates that high local costs -- like taxes, wages or advertising -- are not the only reason for the price differentials, because if that were the case, the cost of all products would be higher in a higher-cost market.
"In due time something will have to give and there will be a trend toward having similar prices in all euro countries, but many factors that make price discrimination possible are destined to remain," said Fabrizio Onida, an economics professor at Bocconi University in Milan. "As long as there are differences between national markets, then price discrimination is possible." 
If the differences in pricing eventually disappear, it will be as much because of the Internet as from the introduction of the euro, because just as a Californian can go online to compare the price of a golf club sold in Nevada and New York, an Italian can see if a new stereo would cost less in Germany or France.
In fact, while the privately owned Ikea printed 131 million copies of the current catalog in 23 languages, it was the company's decision to put an increasing number of prices online that allowed Mr. Thulin to develop his index.
"The idea for the index was born five years ago, but when I tried to develop it back then it was impossible to get all the catalogs," Mr. Thulin said in a phone conversation from his office in Stockholm. "Prices weren't on the Internet and I couldn't get the catalogs sent to me from some countries."
He added that "eventually it became inevitable to have prices online. " Ikea has 186 stores in 31 countries, but the company will send online purchases to only 9 countries. And customers cannot buy from one nation's Ikea Web site and have the product sent to a different country, or receive a catalog for one country at an address in another. 
When calculating his index, Mr. Thulin used Oct. 14 exchange rates. But the catalog's prices, guaranteed until July 2004, were set when the dollar was stronger relative to the euro, and the dollar's recent fall in value played a role in making the United States the cheapest Ikea country in the survey.
Mr. Thulin said he chose Ikea for his study because, among other things, the store has many products that are exactly the same in every market; the goods are not perishable so they can, in theory, be easily transported from one country to another; and the goods for all countries are all made in the same factories so production costs are the same.
He also said he was planning to repeat the index next year, so it may be possible to see whether, at least according to some home furnishings, the single currency is leading to an alignment of prices in euro land.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "How Much for that Skymning?"The Ikea index, created by Gabriel Thulin, a Swedish statician, tracks the cost of a basket of 26 Ikea products across 15 countries. According to the index, the United States is the cheapest Ikea country over all, but some products in the index are cheaper elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Official Hints U.S. Could End Its Credit Line To Loan Giants 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
A senior Treasury official said on Wednesday that the Treasury Department was willing to consider the elimination of the credit line it extends to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry, as part of the effort in Congress to overhaul regulation of the two companies.
 The announcement, made by an assistant Treasury secretary, Wayne Abernathy, in response to a reporter's question after a speech this afternoon, briefly shook the stock prices and bond yields of the two companies. It also prompted other officials to emphasize that the administration was not making the proposal but was willing to consider it if proposed by a lawmaker. 
 The incident illustrated the deep political and financial sensitivities involved in overhauling the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are big buyers of home loans. The two companies, known as government-sponsored enterprises, have historically had enormous influence on Capitol Hill and, according to their critics, run circles around regulators. 
The companies have come under increasing political pressure after corporate missteps this year. A report by outside investigators in July concluded that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead investors, and critics have said Fannie Mae does not adequately hedge against rising interest rates.
After a speech in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Abernathy was asked whether the administration would support the elimination of the $2.25 billion in credit lines that each company has with the Treasury, and by extension, the implicit government guarantees of its debt. The guarantees are a vital implicit pledge that enable the companies to issue billions of dollars in debt each year at substantially lower yields than competitors.
He replied that if "Congress wants to take on that issue, we're open to having that discussion," according to Reuters and Bloomberg.
The Treasury Department later emphasized that the administration had not proposed eliminating the guarantees but was open to considering it and other options that might be proposed by legislators.
Last month, the administration recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings-and-loan crisis a decade ago. The plan has encountered some resistance in Congress, where the two companies have traditionally been formidable political forces. The companies have supported some changes but opposed others that they say could restrict their ability to offer new products.
Administration officials had hoped that Congress would be able to adopt legislation before going into recess as early as next month. But the measures have run into some difficulties, and it appears that they will be pushed aside until next year.
Two weeks ago, the administration found itself in a feud with the Republican-controlled leadership of the House Financial Services committee, which had scheduled a drafting session over a bill that was criticized by the Treasury Department. After Mr. Abernathy held a news briefing by phone that attacked the House measure, the committee abruptly canceled the markup session.
The companies said on Wednesday that there was no significant effort under way to alter their lines of credit with the Treasury.
"There has been no discussion of changing the G.S.E. charter in any way including the line of credit," said Sharon McHale, a spokeswoman at Freddie Mac. "The discussion has been centered on ways to strengthen the regulatory oversight of G.S.E.'s but not to change the line of credit in any way."
Chuck Greener, a Fannie Mae spokesman, said, "Our understanding is that Assistant Secretary Wayne Abernathy in subsequent comments today indicated that Treasury was not proposing eliminating Treasury's authority to purchase a limited amount of G.S.E. debt and he also noted that no U.S. lawmaker was proposing such a change."
"We at Fannie Mae also see no support for such a fundamental change to our charter," Mr. Greener said.
The comment by Mr. Abernathy was reminiscent of a similar statement made three years ago during Congressional testimony by Treasury Under Secretary Gary Gensler. The Clinton administration ultimately backed away from the proposal after an accusation by Fannie Mae that the comments had the effect of raising borrowing costs and disqualifying 206,000 familes from home loans. Fannie Mae later apologized for the accusation. 
Mr. Abernathy, a former top Republican aide on the Senate Banking Committee, has been the senior Treasury official overseeing the administration's efforts to overhaul the regulation of the so-called government-sponsored enterprises. The legislation, which administration officials had hoped could be approved this year, has run into some roadblocks in recent days and is likely to be pushed aside until next year.
The guarantees are among the most important subsidy granted to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, enabling the companies to issue debt at rates more favorable than others mortgage lenders. 
"The perception of government backing permits the G.S.E.'s to operate with much higher leverage than other companies," said Thomas H. Stanton, an authority on the companies, in his book "Government-Sponsored Enterprises." "Investors in G.S.E. obligations look to the government's guarantee rather than to the financial strength of a G.S.E. as the basis for repayment."
The guarantees have been criticized by rivals and by some policy makers, most notably Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has said that they distort markets and come at the expense of other federal and private sector initiatives.
The stocks in the two companies stumbled Wednesday afternoon but recovered slightly before closing down on a generally poor day for Wall Street. Shares of Fannie Mae fell $1.41, to $72.75. Freddie Mac shares fell $1.50, to $57.03. 
Mr. Abernathy's comment also appeared to affect the credit markets, as investors in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds traded more cautiously this afternoon. Prices in the debt instruments of the two companies did not move up as much as comparable Treasury securities.

HEADLINE: Everything Old Is Sold Again 

BYLINE:  By BRADFORD McKEE

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C. 

 BODY:
AS if furniture could match the mood of its makers, the fall edition of the semiannual International Home Furnishings Market, which ended here yesterday, looked back to the good old days and seemed ambivalent about the days to come.
 Martha Stewart staged a full-scale assault at the giant furniture trade show, with 117 pieces in her third line for the Bernhardt Furniture Company. Her furniture does not settle on a specific genre or mood, beyond a certain Yankee reserve. It consists of greatest hits from her own collection of furnishings, a mixture of pan-1800's connoisseurship and flea-market style -- with details construed as Ms. Stewart sees fit. But it is a formula that has served her well. 
 The new line, named Turkey Hill for Ms. Stewart's Connecticut house, arrives six months after her first two lines, Lily Pond and Skylands. While the Media Industry Newsletter says revenue from her television show is down and advertising pages are off 33 percent for the first 10 months of 2003 for her magazine Martha Stewart Living, her furniture is a bright spot for Bernhardt.
The release of the Turkey Hill line early next year, however, will closely coincide with Ms. Stewart's scheduled trial in federal court on securities-related charges over her having sold shares of ImClone Systems stock. Alex Bernhardt, who owns Bernhardt, said the timing doesn't worry him. "Not really," he said, "because the consumers like the furniture." Orders of Ms. Stewart's previous lines, he said, "have exceeded expectations," and he called reorders during the show excellent, though he would not estimate expectations or sales.
Ms. Stewart's Irvington bed ($1,499) derives from a 19th-century brass bed, but with posts plated in nickel. There is a kitchen island with an enamel top and pass-through drawers ($2,100), which looks right for a household in the days before plumbing. Other pieces are a chinoiserie tray table with bamboo legs ($450), low-rise couches and slipper chairs. Richard Broderson, president of Foremost Furniture of Manhattan, said, "I think Bernhardt got a bit of an education with those first two lines -- the third round is better."
But adding a third line also means alloting space more carefully. Some 250 stores have dedicated at least 2,000 square feet to the line. With more than 350 pieces, dealers will have to drop some. "You get only so many square feet out there," said Sharon L. Patrick, the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. "Dealer by dealer, they're going to have to pick and choose."
Furniture industry executives would like to take heart from economic news that showed the annual rate of consumer spending on furniture up 3.3 percent in August over the same month last year. "Part of the problem is that we're working off of some pretty low numbers from previous years," said Ken Smith, the national director of furniture industry services at the accounting firm BDO Seidman here. 
Gone were the days when furniture stores hoped to sell suites of bedroom furniture. Oscar de la Renta, appearing at Century Furniture's showroom to promote his signature line, said, "I don't think in sets -- I don't understand how people can buy in ensembles." His line juxtaposed a nacre-paneled, black-lacquered cabinet ($9,607) with a wood-frame poster bed bearing elaborate acanthus carvings on its posts and egg-and-dart details on its piers ($10,100).
Home Furnishings News, a trade publication, reported last week that sales growth among furniture retailers from January through August fell behind that of retailers generally. "The furniture industry is notorious for having a great Tuesday followed by a bad Wednesday," said Warren Shoulberg, its editor in chief. Furniture makers, he said, have been feeling pain since the invention of the credenza. 
The blanched and muddied fabric colors at this show echoed the mood. They flowed noncommittally in chalks, bones, creams, golds and greens from putty to pine. Where there was red, it was wine or blood. In a positive light, you might call them aristocratic or ascetic. 
The British interior designer Nina Campbell let craft speak for itself in a new line of 22 armchairs, wing chairs, sofas, benches and stools covered in toile or velvet. Ms. Campbell's Millais chair ($2,035, excluding fabric) indulges in a slight outward scroll of its firm back. 
The West Coast designer Barbara Barry pared down her rawhide-bound rattan armchairs and side chairs for McGuire ($1,590 and $1,550 respectively) to give the rattan its due -- the back becomes a tracery of individual canes. And Thomas O'Brien showed a preference for frankly macho lamps and sconces, made with machined metal forms ($159 to $599). But the show's most conspicuous collections came signed by celebrities like Ms. Stewart, Mr. de la Renta and Todd Oldham, who offered a 26-piece post-World War II pop collection for La-Z-Boy of chairs, couches and tables designed to please by failing to offend. 
Alternatively, furniture collections were tricked up with tie-ins. Pulaski offered a licensed line from "Antiques Roadshow" that sounds as if intended for fans who know both the value and price of a French neoclassical vitrine. Lane was offering the "National Geographic Explorer," buckling swashes from a West Indies dining room to a British colonial den.
Most surprisingly, there were overtures to the couch potato: one line is hoping to reach 70 million American Nascar fans, and another is reaching for young men with furniture licensed by Maxim magazine. It will sting indeed if those customers instead choose the Martha Stewart Norris chaise, with nailhead trim.

HEADLINE: Greeted Coolly, Bush Urges Indonesia to Bolster Democracy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: DENPASAR, Indonesia, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush injected himself directly on Wednesday into Indonesia's struggle between democratization and Islamic fundamentalism, saying during a lightning visit that both peace and economic growth in Asia depend on Indonesia's success "as a pluralistic and democratic state." Mr. Bush's three-hour stopover in the most populous Muslim nation was restricted for security reasons to Bali, the overwhelmingly Hindu resort island, and he traveled less than a mile from where Air Force One was parked on the tarmac. 
 But his goal was to show support for President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who faces an election next year, and to engage with Muslim moderates who, in nearly an hour of conversation with Mr. Bush, were sharply critical of his policies toward the Middle East and Iraq. 
 "There was kind of a sense that Americans believe that Muslims are terrorists," Mr. Bush said aboard Air Force One en route to Canberra, Australia, recounting the discussion for reporters. He said he made it "very clear that I didn't feel that way and Americans don't feel that way." 
Mr. Bush is deeply unpopular in Indonesia, and even President Megawati, while greeting him warmly, kept some political distance, noting in their televised joint appearance, "We do not always share common perspective."
The Indonesian government had first sought to have Mr. Bush visit Jakarta, the capital. That was rejected, but a senior Administration official said on Wednesday that "it would have been unwise, by every measure" to pass over Indonesia en route to Australia. 
"That would have sent the wrong message," the official said, "at a moment that the president knows we have a lot of work to do with the Islamic world."
So Mr. Bush tried to make the best of what many Indonesians seemed to regard as an awkward visit. In a short speech, he dwelled on what he called the common values of the United States and Indonesia: religious diversity and respect for liberty. 
"Your national motto, 'Unity in diversity,' sounds a lot like our own, 'Out of many, one,' " he said. "Americans hold a deep respect for the Islamic faith, which is professed by a growing number of my own citizens. We know Islam is fully compatible with liberty, tolerance and progress. We see the proof in your country." 
But a senior American official acknowledged that the administration is deeply concerned about the growing popularity of radical Islamic movements in Indonesia and their challenge to the secular government. 
"The people with more extreme, more exclusionary views have been making inroads," this official said.
Mr. Bush came armed with modest gifts, including $157 million in American support for education. American officials said the money would go chiefly to primary schools, including Islamic boarding schools. 
 Mr. Bush, speaking later on his plane, said Indonesians had expressed concern about how the money would be spent. "They wanted to make sure this wasn't America's education system," he said. "I said, 'It's not, it's money available for the Indonesian government to help basic education develop.' "
 But a senior administration official on the trip said, "The fundamentalists are pouring money into these schools, and we have to help counter them." 
Mr. Bush never explicitly mentioned Indonesia's role as the base for Jemaah Islamiyah, a terrorist group that has been held responsible by the United States for the attack on a Bali nightclub last year that killed more than 200 people. The attack took place, Mr. Bush noted, just a few miles from where the two presidents met on Wednesday. The same group is blamed by the United States for the suicide bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in August. 
With the battle with terrorists continuing here, American warships patrolled waters offshore from the airport meeting place. The pilots guiding Air Force One and a nearly identical backup plane made an unusual landing here, low and fast over the water, and Mr. Bush never came in contact with the Balinese in this crowded city.
The most interesting encounter was between Mr. Bush and the representatives of Muslim, Hindu and Christian groups here. They included Hasyim Muzadi, the chairman of the largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, which has a membership estimated at 40 million. He said he told Mr. Bush that his Middle East policy unfairly favored Israel. 
 Mr. Bush, recounting the same conversation aboard Air Force One, said he responded that "our policy is tilted toward peace" and discussed his thoughts about the formation of a Palestinian state. 
 "There wasn't a lot of debate," Mr. Bush said. One interlocutor accused him of deciding to invade Iraq long before the war, he said, and he responded that "a process had gone under way before I made the decision to use military force, that the world has spoken before about Saddam Hussein." 
Mr. Muzadi said he asked the president when American troops would leave Iraq to the Iraqis, and told Mr. Bush that the United States should stop seeing Indonesia as a "terrorists' nest, because Indonesia is a terror victim."

HEADLINE: Falls Survivor Says He Was Suicidal 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The unemployed man who walked away from a plunge over Niagara Falls two days earlier said on Wednesday that he had been suicidal but that the experience made him want to live.
 The authorities had suggested on Monday that the man, Kirk R. Jones, was simply a daredevil, the latest one to try to survive going over the falls. Mr. 
Jones, a resident of Canton, Mich., was released from the hospital into police custody on Wednesday at 7:20 p.m. 
 In a telephone interview with ABC News, he said he did not want to go on living when he climbed over a barricade and into the Niagara River, "but I can tell you now after hitting the falls I feel that life is worth living." 
In a note to another patient who was also released from the hospital, Mr. Jones said life had much to offer. "When you are feeling down, just remember the power of the Niagara," said the handwritten note, which the other patient, Brandon Steward, said was Mr. Jones's.
Mr. Jones's father, Raymond Jones, 80, of Keizer, Ore., told The Associated Press that his son sounded cheerful on Wednesday in a phone call from the psychiatric unit at Greater Niagara General Hospital.
"He feels peppy," the father said. "He fully expected to die. He was near death. He knew it. He thinks he was saved for a reason."
Inspector Paul Forcier said the plunge was not being treated as an attempted suicide, but he added that Mr. Jones was undergoing an evaluation. Inspector Forcier said the police were reviewing a videotape made by a friend. Mr. Jones will be charged with mischief and unlawfully performing a stunt and could be fined the United States equivalent of about $7,600, the inspector said.

HEADLINE: Donors Meet to Help Iraq 

 BODY:
Over the next two days in Madrid, the world's richer nations and financial institutions will announce contributions to the reconstruction of Iraq. They should be generous. Even those that opposed military action have a strong interest in making sure that the basic needs of the Iraqi people are met and that a secure and prosperous society emerges from the ruins of Saddam Hussein's tyranny. 
 Yet even a successful donors conference will not be enough to ensure early success because much of the country is too insecure for aid workers to operate. Care must be taken to choose appropriate projects and cost-efficient contractors, using as many Iraqis as possible. These decisions should involve Iraqis and development experts. Finally, Baghdad's foreign debt from the Hussein era -- more than $300 billion -- must be written off so Iraq can start moving away from dependency on aid. 
 Two important developments in the past week have greatly improved prospects for a successful Madrid meeting. Last Thursday, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved an American-backed resolution that, among other things, urged countries and international financial institutions to help rebuild Iraq, specifically through "substantial pledges" in Madrid. On Sunday, the White House agreed to let a new agency run by the World Bank and the U.N. oversee the spending of international donations. That assured donors that contracts paid for by their contributions will be independently monitored and competitively awarded.
Japan has already promised $1.5 billion, with more to follow. If Western nations, Persian Gulf oil states and others are equally forthcoming, $10 billion or more could be raised. Added to the $20 billion in American aid awaiting final Congressional approval, that could finance most of Iraq's short-term needs. President Bush is right to threaten a veto of the aid legislation if Congress insists on packaging some of the money as a loan instead of a grant. With Iraq already drowning in debt, Congress would be irresponsible to add more. In fact, the next step after Madrid should be an international conference to reduce Iraq's existing debts.
Unfortunately, there are no obvious solutions to the pervasive insecurity that keeps aid workers out of those parts of Iraq where they are most needed. Despite his boundless public optimism, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has acknowledged privately that progress is very slow. In a memo to the top Pentagon leadership, reported yesterday by USA Today, Mr. Rumsfeld says that stabilizing Iraq "will be a long, hard slog" and that while the military is focused on Iraq, the broader fight against terrorism is suffering. Until Iraq is secure enough to let reconstruction projects get fully under way, even the most generous donations will not bring adequate results.

HEADLINE: Clark Outlines Plan for Taxes And New Jobs 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark on Wednesday outlined his plan for the economy, which he said would save more than $2.3 trillion over 10 years by repealing some of President Bush's tax cuts, eliminating government waste and managing the war in Iraq better.
 General Clark said he would use the savings to create jobs in national security and health care, provide financial aid to states and incentives for businesses and reduce the deficit. He shied away from setting a goal for a balanced budget but asserted that "deficits do matter" and that there should be no new spending until money was available to pay for it. 
 "When you're in a hole, you should stop digging," he said. "And this country's in a deep hole, and I've got a plan to get us out."
General Clark, who once taught economics at West Point, spoke at the University of New Hampshire here in a weeklong visit to the state. This was his first major appearance since he was laid low by a viral infection and laryngitis. He seemed mostly recovered on Wednesday, making a quick detour to New York to raise money.
His economic plan, which his advisers sketched out after his speech, relied on these four main elements: 
*Repealing the Bush tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000, for a savings of $1.1 trillion over 10 years. As an alternative to repealing the cuts, advisers said, General Clark might restore the tax rates for people in the two top income brackets or alter the estate tax and taxes on dividends in ways that were not specified but that advisers said would shield small businesses, family farms and middle-class families. 
*Streamlining government to eliminate waste and inefficiency, for a savings of $225 billion. General Clark would consolidate the 70 federal offices that now analyze statistics into a single agency and require competitive bidding on Medicare contracts. He would also review the military budget. "I'm going to support every dime we need to keep America strong," he said, "but I'm not going to tolerate billions of dollars worth of waste or inefficiency just because somebody stamps a label 'secret' on it." 
*Eliminating corporate welfare and tax loopholes, for a savings of $300 billion. The energy bill working its way through Congress is riddled with such excess, General Clark said.
*Improving management of the war in Iraq, for a savings of $125 billion. His advisers, using numbers from House Democrats, said that in a worst-case scenario, President Bush could be expected to spend $418 billion in Iraq over the next decade. They said that General Clark would resolve the postwar situation more quickly, but did not say how, and that he would work with allies to share the costs and use competitive bidding for reconstruction contracts.
Also, as a result of reducing the deficit sooner, the Clark plan would save $600 billion in debt service, they said. But he would not start reducing the deficit until 2006, when the economy would presumably be stronger.
Most of the eight other Democratic presidential candidates laid out their economic plans some time ago, and many have similarities because, like General Clark's, they were formulated with the help some of the same advisers, like Robert Rubin, treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's chief economic adviser.
One issue on which Democrats differ is the Bush tax cut. 
Two candidates, Howard Dean, a former governor of Vermont, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, would rescind the tax cuts for all taxpayers.
General Clark has aligned himself with Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who support repealing the tax cuts only for the wealthiest taxpayers.
On Wednesday, Senator Lieberman criticized General Clark's plan, saying it "borrows spending limits I have already proposed but offers no hope or help for the middle class" because it offers no new tax cuts.
General Clark's economic speech was the second of four set pieces intended to define his candidacy. Last week, he described his national service plan. Next week, he is to discuss his health care plan and then his proposal for national security.
Shortly after he announced his candidacy, he laid out a $100 billion proposal over two years for creating jobs, and Wednesday's speech tried to put that in a broader context.

HEADLINE: Bolivian Leader's Ouster Seen As Warning on U.S. Drug Policy 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
On a visit to the White House last year, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told President Bush that he would push ahead with a plan to eradicate coca but that he needed more money to ease the impact on farmers. 
 Otherwise, the Bolivian president's advisers recalled him as saying, "I may be back here in a year, this time seeking political asylum." 
 Mr. Bush was amused, Bolivian officials recounted, told his visitor that all heads of state had tough problems and wished him good luck. 
Now Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, Washington's most stalwart ally in South America, is living in exile in the United States after being toppled last week by a popular uprising, a potentially crippling blow to Washington's anti-drug policy in the Andean region.
United States officials interviewed here minimized the importance of the drug issue in Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's downfall, blaming a "pent-up frustration" over issues ranging from natural gas exports to corruption. But to many Bolivians and analysts, the coca problem is intimately tied to the broader issues of impoverishment and disenfranchisement that have stoked explosive resentments here and fueled a month of often violent protests.
"The U.S. insistence on coca eradication was at the core of Sanchez de Lozada's problem," said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian scholar who is director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami.
Dr. Gamarra and others point to events in Bolivia as a warning that United States drug policy may sow still wider instability in the region, where anti-American sentiment is building with the failure of economic reforms that Washington has helped encourage here.
In Bolivia the backlash has strengthened the hand of the political figure regarded by Washington as its main enemy: Evo Morales, head of the coca growers' federation, who finished second in presidential election last year.
American officials have considered Bolivia such a success in the anti-drug campaign that they were looking to replicate their strategy in Peru. But there, too, signs of discontent are appearing, beginning with the re-emergence of the Shining Path, the guerrilla group that terrorized the country throughout the 1980's. "Right now Shining Path is strongest in coca growing areas," said Michael Shifter, who follows the Andean region for the Washington-based policy group Inter-American Dialogue. "To the extent that the U.S. pushes on eradication targets without any kind of flexibility, it makes people there much more amenable to turning to violent protest or insurgent groups like Shining Path."
In Colombia the eradication push has succeeded in substantially reducing coca acreage and is helping the government in its fight against leftist rebels. But such successes have often pushed cultivation farther south to Bolivia and Peru.
The eradication campaign is supposed to be coupled with an "alternative development" program to encourage farmers to grow crops like pineapples, bananas, coffee, black pepper, oregano and passion fruit on land once devoted to coca.
Though the United States has earmarked $211 million for such projects here in the last decade and helped raise the incomes of a growing number of peasant families, critics say the money is not nearly enough to compensate all of those whose livelihoods have been destroyed by eradication campaigns.
During his Washington visit last year, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada asked for $150 million in added emergency aid, meant among other things to help reduce a yawning government budget deficit that had severely limited spending on social programs.
He got $10 million, and that only after he was nearly toppled in a round of protests in February.
"These are derisory sums that are incommensurate with what is needed," said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist who is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and a long-time adviser to Bolivian governments. "The United States has constantly made demands on an impoverished country without any sense of reality or an economic framework and strategy to help them in development."
David N. Greenlee, the American ambassador here, in an interview on Monday, disagreed with the notion that added assistance from Washington would make much difference.
"It's too early to say whether we can provide additional resources," he said. "I think we currently provide substantial resources, and it is possible this new government can be more efficient."
He added, "A few million more from the U.S. isn't going to solve the problems of Bolivia."
At a news conference on Saturday night, less than 24 hours after he was sworn in, Bolivia's new president, Carlos Mesa, said coca eradication had created "a complicated scenario" and hinted that some changes might be in the works.
For Mr. Mesa, who heads a weak interim government, some moderation of the effort may be inevitable if he is to avoid his predecessor's fate and hold off the challenges of opposition figures like Mr. Morales, the leader of the coca growers.
Mr. Morales's position has been enhanced by recent events, despite the United States Embassy's efforts to isolate and discredit him.
In recent years American officials pushed to have Mr. Morales expelled from Congress and indicted for the murder of four policemen in the Chapare region, his political base and a center of coca cultivation. During last year's presidential campaign, the embassy suggested that Mr. Morales's election would be viewed by the United States as a hostile act and would provoke an end to aid to Bolivia.
"That has merely inflated Evo Morales even more and catapulted him into the position he is in now," Dr. Gamarra said, that of a power broker with the capacity to bring down the government. "He has used the coca issue to construct a national movement, with the coca growers as his praetorian guard."
The new government, political analysts and diplomats here said, is in a bind. It may be difficult to keep Mr. Morales at bay if Mr. Mesa does not declare a pause in the eradication effort, but such a move could jeopardize Bolivia's international assistance.
In an interview here on Monday, Dionisio Nunez, a coca grower, member of Congressional and key ally of Mr. Morales, said that their party, the Movement Toward Socialism, intended to demand that the new government modify the laws against coca cultivation, whether the United States likes it or not.
For starters, he said, the opposition wants a recalculation of the areas in which growing coca is legal, as well as an expansion of the places where it is legal to sell coca leaves.
"A new president can't return to a policy of repression and militarization" to combat drugs, Mr. Nunez warned. "There has to be a change, to a policy that is truly Bolivian, not one that is imposed by foreigners with the pretext that eradication will put an end to narcotics trafficking."
Despite Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's fall, the Bush administration seems committed to continuing the policy, with a modest budget in Bolivia.
"We think on balance that our policies and our emphasis on alternative development, together with Bolivian participation and their own policies regarding drugs, have been positive things for Bolivia," Ambassador Greenlee said. "We don't think it is a problem."

HEADLINE: Once at Arm's Length From Bush, Wall Street Is Now Biggest Donor 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Glen Justice, Patrick McGeehan and Landon Thomas Jr. and written by Mr. Justice.

 BODY:
A day after a chilly reception at the United Nations last month, President Bush received a warmer greeting from a New York group that he had been keeping at arm's length: about a dozen leaders of the biggest firms on Wall Street.
 That private meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria, to discuss the economy, is just one illustration of how the president and Wall Street seem to have grown on each other. 
 Two weeks before he was sworn into office, Mr. Bush held a business leaders forum in Texas with dozens of prominent executives, but with no chief executive from Wall Street. Likewise, such executives were absent from his economic summit in Waco, Tex., in August 2002. 
"There was some 'we're from Texas, we're not from Wall Street,' " said Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey, a Democrat who served as co-chairman at Goldman Sachs before taking office. "To their credit, they've moved away from that."
After winning Congressional approval for cuts in taxes on dividends, capital gains and for certain business investments, and after navigating a raft of corporate accounting scandals that shook the investment community, President Bush seems to have won over many financial executives, who are now strongly supporting his re-election campaign.
A study to be released today shows that the financial community has surpassed all other groups, including lawyers and lobbyists, as the top industry among Mr. Bush's elite fund-raisers. The list of those generating $100,000 and $200,000 now includes chief executives like Henry M. Paulson of Goldman Sachs, John J. Mack of Credit Suisse First Boston and Stanley O'Neal of Merrill Lynch, whose firm has already raised twice the amount for Mr. Bush's re-election that it did during the entire 2000 campaign cycle.
"It's really a question of policy, that's what's driving this," said Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, which represents more than 650 securities firms. "It's a pro-investor policy."
Executives say the support is fed by patriotism and other factors, including the administration's actions to fight terrorism after the Sept.11 attacks, which struck the country's financial nerve center. Financial executives are also providing money for the Republican convention, which is scheduled for New York next summer and will bring hundreds of business leaders to the city.
Finally, there is no clear leader among nine Democratic presidential candidates, some of whom have advocated repealing the administration's tax cuts, and Wall Street loves a winner.
Mr. Bush has long had support from the business community, but Wall Street has usually split its contributions between Democrats and Republicans and was supportive of President Bill Clinton and the presidential campaign of Al Gore. Whether the group will give as heavily to Democrats after a leader emerges from the primaries is yet to be seen.
A White House spokesman decline to characterize the president's relationship with Wall Street. But White House officials said that Mr. Bush had maintained regular contact with companies from all segments of the economy, from small businesses to the industrial sector, and that he had always appreciated Wall Street as an economic engine. When corporate scandals shook investor confidence, they noted, the president went to Wall Street to press for corporate accountability.
Campaign officials say the president has reached out to supporters nationwide, not just on Wall Street. "All of our volunteer fund-raisers are an important part of the campaign," said Scott Stanzel, a campaign spokesman.
Yet some executives say the early days of the Bush administration suggested a frosty relationship. When he took office, the markets were declining, and he chose few from the Wall Street world as top advisers.
His first Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, came from Alcoa and had a tempestuous relationship with the financial sector. The Bush administration may also have suffered from comparisons to the Clinton administration, which was known for its warm relations with Wall Street. The Bush administration was also rocked by several corporate scandals, including those at Enron and Worldcom.
Allen B. Morgan Jr., the chairman of Morgan Keegan & Company, a brokerage firm based in Memphis, said support from Wall Street executives had come in spite of Mr. Bush's decision to keep some distance from them.
"Bush has stayed clear of the big firms," said Mr. Morgan, a former chairman of the Securities Industry Association and a Bush fund-raiser. "But I think one of the reasons that people have raised money for him is they see him as a person who is cutting the size of government in the long run. They buy into that. And they think he can be re-elected."
Others like Mr. Lackritz say they never saw a problem, finding the administration "very receptive to ideas." Still others say it was Wall Street that woke up to Mr. Bush, not the other way around.
"Many people on Wall Street finally got it," said Steve Bartlett, a former member of Congress who is now president of the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents financial services companies. "The president hasn't changed," he said. "Wall Street has evolved to see that the president is doing what's right for the American people and the economy."
When Mr. Bush began raising money this year, one of his first stops was New York, where he collected $4 million at an event organized in part by Mr. Paulson and Mr. Mack. On Friday, a reception is scheduled on Ellis Island at which Vice President Dick Cheney will thank more than 200 donors.
The 2004 election is still more than a year away, but employees of securities and investment firms and their political action committees have contributed $3.8 million to the Bush campaign through September, just $159,000 less than they gave during the entire campaign cycle in 2000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance.
The president has raised more from the industry than all nine candidates in the Democratic field combined. While Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts counts the industry as his second-largest contributor, at about $1 million through September, others have not done as well. Howard Dean, the top fund-raiser in the field, raised about $302,000, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut raised about $639,000.
"All these guys are totally in Bush's camp," said a politically active executive, adding that "people are not hedging their bets at this point. There's not a lot of fund-raising being done for Democrats right now."
Mr. O'Neal of Merrill Lynch sent a series of letters to the homes of a few hundred of the firm's most senior executives in June, asking them to contribute to a fund-raising dinner in support of Mr. Bush. James E. Cayne, chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns & Company, also sent a letter asking his executives to donate to the campaign.
Joseph J. Grano, who runs the brokerage operations of UBS, the Swiss bank, has been an avid backer of President Bush and the Republican convention. Mr. Grano promised to raise at least $200,000 for the re-election campaign and to gather money for the convention, said executives at the firm, formerly known as UBS PaineWebber.
Mr. Paulson, of Goldman Sachs, was recruited by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York to collect cash from the Wall Street firms to finance the convention, an official at the firm said, and has gathered $5 million so far.
Part of Mr. Bush's fund-raising success on Wall Street can be attributed to the new campaign-finance law that doubled, to $2,000, the amount an individual can give to a primary campaign. Several industries have already matched what they gave in 2000.
Mr. Bush plans to raise a record-setting $170 million for next year's race. His largest fund-raisers are grouped as Pioneers, who raise at least $100,000, and Rangers, who raise at least $200,000. An increasing number in both programs are from the financial sector. 
Texans for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign money, examined Mr. Bush's fund-raising network and which industries it represents. Its study, to be released today, shows that 20 percent now come from the financial sector, up from 14 percent in the last presidential election. The industry -- defined broadly to include banks, finance companies, securities and investment firms and accounting and tax service firms -- has produced at least 38 new elite fund-raisers for the Bush campaign.
Executives who have signed on include Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns; Stephen M. Lessing, managing director at Lehman Brothers Holdings; and Henry Kravis, founding partner at Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts.
Over all, more of Mr. Bush's top fund-raisers come from the financial sector than any other, a change from the last presidential election when lawyers and lobbyists topped the list.
"The New York City financial district is doing much more than it did earlier," said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for Public Justice. "Wall Street has surpassed K Street."

HEADLINE: Speaker Urges $12.9 Billion For School Building Projects 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, proposed yesterday that New York City spend $12.9 billion on school construction, renovation and repairs over the next five years, issuing a direct challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who must propose his own education capital plan next month. 
 Mr. Miller, a Democrat who makes no secret of his own ambition to be mayor, did not explain how the city might pay for such an expensive plan, but anticipating the question, he quickly ripped a linefrom a speech by Mr. Bloomberg. 
 "The first question is going to be how can we afford to do this," Mr. Miller said at a news conference at City Hall. "And I think I'd just take a page out of the mayor's book from his economic development speech the other day, in which he said: 'How can we afford to do this?' And he said, 'We can't afford not to invest in our economy.' " 
Mr. Miller added, "We cannot afford to fail to invest in our schools."
In making his proposal, Mr. Miller and Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz, the chairwoman of the City Council Education Committee, released a report that detailed acute overcrowding and poor conditions in many of the city's schools.
They said the city needed to spend $3.4 billion to build 49 new schools; $7.1 billion for repair and maintenance of the existing 1,200 school buildings; and $2.4 billion to renovate and modernize schools, with updated science labs, computer equipment and networks, and other amenities.
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged the needs but said the city had to consider all its priorities in allocating limited funds. "Nobody questions the fact that we would like to have, and that we need more and better classrooms, more and better facilities for our teachers and our students," the mayor said. "The issue is where we can come up with the money and if you have to balance all the needs of this city. There are lots of infrastructure things that we have no choice, we have to do because of laws or court orders or just common sense. You have to, for example, continue to build the third water tunnel." 
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein was in Albany yesterday to testify before the State Legislature, and he did not issue a response to Mr. Miller's proposals. But some education officials suggested that Mr. Klein was privately cheering the speaker's plan, in hopes that it might push the mayor to increase capital spending on education. 
Mr. Klein's press secretary, Jerry Russo, said the Education Department would release its capital plan on Nov. 3. 
Education officials and City Hall have been in talks for some time over the scope of the education capital plan. Many officials said they expected that Mr. Bloomberg would want a striking "number" for total spending over five years, as evidence of his commitment to education, which he says is his signature issue.
The speaker's proposal far exceeds the $11.2 billion in school construction that Chancellor Rudy Crew initially proposed in 1998 and the $7.2 billion plan that was approved by the Board of Education in May 1999. Over time, the plan was further reduced by budget cuts, bringing it under $5 billion.
As huge as the $12.9 billion figure might seem, it is far less than what some experts have suggested the city needs. In 1998, a report by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said the city would have to spend $28.4 billion to meet capacity needs and repair and modernize school buildings. 
Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, applauded Mr. Miller's proposal, calling it "a serious comprehensive effort at overhauling the overcrowding and other infrastructure problems." She, too, echoed the mayor's remarks from earlier this week. "You can't afford not to figure out a way to spend it over a five-year capital plan," she said. 
Councilman David I. Weprin, the chairman of the City Council Finance Committee, said local lawmakers should have a stronger role in shaping the education capital budget now that Mr. Bloomberg has control of the school system. "The need is there," he said. "And it should be a major priority."

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
History on Every Mile, and Sometimes a Stone

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO 

 BODY:
A JOURNEY that begins among the Chinese storefronts and restaurant supply stores along the Bowery in New York City and that includes a pilgrimage to an Economy True Value Hardware store in suburban Boston more than 200 miles later may not sound like a road trip of much historical interest. (Or, to be frank, of any interest whatsoever.) But this road, which winds through the Bronx; Mamaroneck, N.Y.; and New Haven -- veering off to Springfield, Mass., and Providence, R.I., and changing names probably more than two dozen times along the way -- has an important pedigree.
 This artery, originally an Indian trail, became North America's first official mail route in 1673. A monthly postal service between New York and Boston was begun, with the road christened the Boston Post Road. (It was actually several roads in one. The road connected New York to New Haven, where it split in two; one artery went east along the coast through Rhode Island and the other north to Hartford, Conn., where it again split east and north.) 
 But it is not the road itself that makes this route worth a journey. There are certainly faster links between Boston and New York, like Interstate 95, and more picturesque thoroughfares, like U.S. 1A. 
Instead, its appeal is in the small stone markers placed along its path. According to the 1913 book "The Old Boston Post Road," by Stephen Jenkins, the markers were one of the improvements instituted by Benjamin Franklin when he was a postmaster general for the colonies from 1753 to 1774.
Though it is uncertain from which direction he started, historical accounts report that Franklin devised a mechanical odometer and attached it to a wheel on his wagon, marking each mile with wooden stakes. A second wagon followed him, replacing the stakes with the engraved markers.
Searching for the remaining markers on a leisurely drive between New York City and Boston can turn the typical leaf peeper into a historian-cum-archaeologist for a day. You will travel a lot of local roads -- some of them quaint, some not -- all of which only roughly parallel the original route. The exact route of the Boston Post Road is difficult to duplicate; some of it, in fact, is buried under U.S. 1. But you can get an approximation by starting on what is left of it and navigating its many name changes and detours along the way.
Some amateur historians, like Brian Hamill of Warren, Mass., have photographed the markers and tried to track down those that have been lost or stolen through the years. Mr. Hamill also has a Web site dedicated to these markers, www.samnet.net/esso/Fmm.htm, detailing one of the best stretches on the upper section of the route -- from Spencer to Warren -- on which to spot these artifacts.
"I am just a small-time guy interested in my town's history," said Mr. Hamill, a member of what he calls the Thief Detecting Society, an organization chartered more than a hundred years ago to prevent horses from being stolen.
Other Post Road sites include one maintained by Dan Moraseski, a senior at M.I.T. studying urban history who goes by the nickname Dr. Spui (pronounced SPOO-ee, meaning single-point urban interchange, an engineering term for a type of highway interchange), that locates markers in the greater Boston area. "Signs these days don't last that long," Mr. Moraseski said. "These have been here for a long time."
The site www.historicpelham.com pinpoints the two markers within the borders of Pelham, N.Y.; and freepages.genealogy .rootsweb.com/gentutor/boston.html is devoted to early American trails.
The stones are of different colors and types, with many observers often mistaking them for gravestones. (Oddly, the numbering system seems to have started in both Boston and New York, meaning that the sequences switch into reverse at points along the various routes that make up the road.) Many faded markers are cared for, repainted and supported in walls and concrete hutches. Some, like the one in Mamaroneck (in a square just south of the intersection of Boston Post Road and Barry Road), have been moved to more prominent spots. This one's original location, 256 yards away, is noted in a plaque at the marker.
There are not, of course, stones to mark each of the road's miles, and some stretches, such as Stamford through New Haven, are almost barren. One is said to have existed on 152nd Street in Harlem, but the first markers you are likely to find as you leave Manhattan are two in Pelham -- one behind a chain-link fence at Pelham Memorial High School on Colonial Avenue and one at the intersection of Boston Post Road and Esplanade. 
A S you head north into Connecticut, the search for stones can turn into a lesson in local history. On the corner of Cross and Main in Norwalk, one of the many towns along the route where the Post Road takes on the name Main Street, a marker reads, "Near this spot on June 17th, 1789, Jesse Lee preached the sermon which marked the official beginning of Methodism in New England. His text: Ye must be born again." 
For years after the markers were first placed, taverns and inns prided themselves on being located near them for the prestige they carried and the business they offered from riders measuring the distance they had traveled and rewarding themselves with rest, hot food and entertainment. 
Now, in Norwalk, and elsewhere, some businesses nod to this tradition with names like Post Road Diner (on what is now called Connecticut Avenue) and offer sustenance that surely would have puzzled our forebears, like the deep-fried hot dogs at Swanky Franks, 182 Connecticut Avenue.
Though the drive does feature other markers, rivers and scenic broken-down grain elevators, some areas are best served by driving through them about 20 times faster than Ben Franklin did. (Unless you are a fan of strip malls.) Getting to the markers themselves can take some ingenuity. In West Brookfield, Mass., on the south end of the common in a concrete hutch, is No. 68. Hidden in an almost full circle of shrubs in front of W. H. King Realty and Associates, barely legible, is No. 69. Marker No. 70 is near a large white house and red barn, amid a large clump of bushes. Marker No. 73, on heavily wooded Bay Path Road, is obscured by a clump of vegetation surrounding it. Get out of the car, hold the grass down, and watch the ants scurry away as you try to decipher the faded inscription.
Those who follow the Post Road to its conclusion will journey to Cambridge and to the Old Burying Ground, where a double-sided eight-mile marker stands at Garden Street and Massachusetts Avenue, next to the First Parish Church. 
As you approach Boston, the seven-mile marker is just past Rena Street, under a tree in a residential area. The six-mile stone is in front of Economy True Value Hardware on Harvard Avenue, near Commonwealth Avenue, listing slightly out of the sidewalk. (Watch the car door as you get out.) The five-mile stone is on Harvard Street, under a shrub in front of the United Parish Church in Brookline. After Harvard merges into Washington, take a left onto Huntington Avenue, just past Colburn Street. On the left side of the street, the four-mile marker is built into a wall of the Mission Park apartment complex. 
The end of the journey -- marker No. 1, or the Parting Stone -- comes, rather ingloriously, at the Foreign Car Specialists auto repair shop in Roxbury. But the store's owners, Tony and Myriam Diaz, insist that the humble stone saved their business.
Mr. Diaz said that a few years ago a car crashed into the stone, which is embedded in the sidewalk in front of his shop, demolishing the car and leaving the stone unhurt. "The whole building shook," he said. "I think the stone actually prevented the car from coming through into my office area."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Professors With No Flash and Shows With Too Much of It

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
For many years, as he was forging his reputation as a playwright, A. R. Gurney was also a college professor, and in recent plays like "Human Events" and "The Fourth Wall" he has portrayed campus denizens in not-so-flattering terms. The academic life he depicts is an insular one, the academics themselves self-absorbed and self-important. They behave almost as if they were performing for an audience. 
 Indeed, more than once Mr. Gurney has used the university setting to make arguments about the state of the theater, which he also finds insular and self-absorbed, increasingly marginalized and increasingly accepting of its marginalization. In "Strictly Academic," an evening of two one-acts directed by Paul Benedict and having its New York premiere Off Broadway at Primary Stages, Mr. Gurney is painting his direst portraits yet of both the campus and the theater. 
 The opening playlet, "The Problem," is a shrewd, sardonic bit of camp about the sex life of a mathematics professor (Keith Reddin) and his wife (Susan Greenhill). It begins with her tentative interruption of him as he works intently at his desk with a compass and a slide rule, and his noticing, evidently for the first time, that she shows all the signs of a pregnancy about to culminate. 
In a very funny dialogue, the level of their inability to communicate with each other is ratcheted up again and again as a discussion of "the problem," as they refer to the pregnancy, reveals the kinky predilections that each of them has evidently been hiding from the other. Mr. Reddin and Ms. Greenhill handle the farcical satire with a finely tuned ratio of hyperbole and restraint. 
In retrospect, there is a hole in the narrative logic -- it can't be explained without giving too much away -- though you can choose to overlook it (and you should) because the rewards of doing so are satisfyingly humorous. The story takes some imaginative swerves, and the twist at the end is just right. It's a slight piece, but deftly handled all around, and it gently makes a savage point about academics who live only in their own minds and not in the world.
In the concluding play, "The Guest Lecturer," Mr. Gurney has the same mischief in his heart but bigger things in mind. It takes place in a nonprofit theater, where Mona (Ms. Greenhill), the loopy artistic director, is introducing Hartley Carr (Remy Auberjonois), the young, idealistic scholar who is to speak to an audience of subscribers on the hifalutin topic of drama in America. 
It's another farce: Mona, who apparently has never had an unexpressedthought, won't let Hartley get started because she can't stop talking mindlessly about herself. And Hartley, it turns out, is another of Mr. Gurney's clueless academics; he has no idea what he's gotten himself into, though we figure it out long before he does. (Hint: Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery" comes to mind.) 
There is something terrifically sly and admirable about Mr. Gurney's idea here, for what he's constructed is an elaborate, plaintive allegory about what he sees as the strangulation of the theater in America. Mainly, of course, it's the forces of commerce that are lamented. (Mr. Reddin plays the greedy chairman of the theater board.) 
But Mr. Gurney has a lot of blame to pass around for the marginalization of theater art -- even to us, the audiences who are so uneducated and impatient that the only things we'll eagerly watch are spectacle, blood and guts, sex and people willing to humiliate themselves in public. And in his intertwining of slapstick black comedy and essayistic argument on behalf of the theater as a force for good in the world, he achieves something interesting and rare: a passionate cri de coeur delivered with a smile. 
That it doesn't quite work is too bad. Among other things, the character of Mona, who needs to be perceived as dull, pathetic and unbearable, is all those things. The pace flags, something that the director, Mr. Benedict, doesn't seem to have noticed. And there are several points in the unfolding plot where what's meant as a surprise has been long anticipated. 
This is at least partly because the particulars of Mr. Gurney's lament about the state of the theater are pretty familiar. But they also feel a little out of date. Admittedly, the theater doesn't haul in the mass audiences it once did. Admittedly, on Broadway, its most prominent site, theater art has taken a back seat to theater entertainment. Admittedly, economics are a reality with which the theater must cope, and admittedly, the tail, on occasion, wags the dog.
But any critic will tell you that you can go to the theater nightly and still not come close to keeping up with new work that rarely achieves but often aspires to the level of art. From that perspective, the theater is currently thriving. And Mr. Gurney himself is an example of it.

HEADLINE: JOURNEYS; 
Ranching 101: Hey, Dude, Where's My Herd?

BYLINE:  By HADAS DEMBO 

 BODY:
"A LOT of cowboys don't like dudes riding with their cattle," Bob Cochran, a cowboy who looks as if he just got off the set of a John Ford western, tells me somewhat delicately. We are moving a small herd up a mountainside, and my son and I have broken the first rule of cattle wrangling: don't ride too close to the cows.
 Now, instead of traveling in a nice, compact group, some are veering off toward the woods to the right, a few have chosen to go left, and the less adventuresome ones are plodding on straight ahead. With an almost imperceptible flick of his reins, Mr. Cochran signals his horse to take pursuit of the strays, and my husband, with slightly less aplomb, takes off after him. 
 Though my husband, Robert, and our two children, Elly, 12, and Jesse, 8, are Easterners, we at least like to think we can blend into new places gracefully, without instantly being branded as tourists. In our less-than-Western garb -- from my baseball cap to Jesse's nylon track pants -- we are clearly dudes at the Boulder Mountain Ranch, a small outfit in southern Utah run by Mr. Cochran and Sioux, his wife. 
We were hardly the first city slickers to head out West to play cowboy. Dude ranches have been around since the late 19th century, when the transcontinental railroad made a summer trip to the open range possible, and eager Easterners signed up to try their hands at roping and riding. Over time, many ranches opened up just to cater to the growing number of tourists and, more recently, started offering high-end touches -- from children's clubs to spas -- that might take cowpunchers by surprise. 
But the tough economics of small-time cattle ranching have led a growing number of working ranches to take in guests. According to Bill Bryan of Off the Beaten Path, a travel booking company, the number of these ranches in the northern Rockies and Southwest that accommodate visitors as a sideline doubled in the last decade, to about 160. Because ranching is still their primary business, they often have rustic accommodations, not much in the way of luxuries, and can take only a few guests at a time.
That sounded perfect to us. Besides, as is typical of overscheduled dudes, we were trying to fit a ranch vacation into just two days, around a hiking trip in the Escalante wilderness of Utah. Unlike many resort ranches, small operations like Boulder Mountain often have no minimum stay. So after checking out the Cochrans' Web site ("Grass-fed calves for sale. No implants, steroids or hormones. Delivery possible. . . . Cowboy Up.") and getting recommendations from a local outfitter, I signed us on for a late August visit. 
A half-day drive from Salt Lake City put us at the ranch in the late afternoon, ready for action. Sheri Catmull, who with her husband, Gary, manages the lodging portion of the operation, greeted us at the main house. We took a few minutes to gawk at a roadless expanse of Navajo sandstone canyons through the lodge's arched floor-to-ceiling windows, then headed out through the kitchen and followed a dirt path to our log cabin: a basic one-room structure with a small front porch. Our arrival attracted a herd of curious foals and horses to the door; we all went out to rub noses.
Though it was already 5 p.m., Mr. Cochran agreed to take us on an evening ride in the Dixie National Forest. We met him at the barn, about a quarter-mile from our cabin. There are 36 horses roaming around the ranch. Mr. Cochran caught five and saddled them up. After perfunctory introductions, we hit the trail. Pepper, the Cochrans' springer spaniel, led the way across a meadow -- but when some feisty jack rabbits in the tall grass sidetracked him, we decided it was probably best to follow Mr. Cochran, who was about the smoothest rider we had ever seen. His body was perfectly synchronized with his horse, whether in ascent or descent, canter or gallop; his torso never seemed to move (this in sharp contrast to the bouncing of the rest of us). 
The horses walked at a fast clip without breaking a sweat. "You ought to know," Mr. Cochran told us, "these horses can go as hard and fast as you want them to." When he talks, his mouth also barely moves, and his words come out slow and even-tempered. "Now, I have a whole collection of empty whiskey bottles on my mantel -- each one left behind by a rider who decided to let their horse go full out." Well, our children are not of drinking age, and my husband and I figured that we would very much like to live to see them into adulthood. We settled for a nice, easy gait on our way to watch the sun set over the canyons of the Escalante, then made our way back to the barn in contented silence.
THOUGH the Cochrans' ranch sits on 160 acres at the base of Boulder Mountain, they have permits to graze their herd of 80 cattle on public land, moving them between mountain meadows in the summer and the lower-elevation canyons in the fall. The next morning, we were going along to help as Bob and Sioux Cochran rounded up the cattle and moved them to greener pastures. 
After a serious breakfast in the main house (mounds of eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon) we arrived at the barn in time to watch Mr. Cochran outfit an unwilling horse with new shoes. After a brief struggle (he won, no contest) the rest of the horses were readied. In honor of the ride, Sioux, who was in the standard-issue cowboy garb of Wrangler jeans (cut straight and long on the leg), chaps, spurs and a leather belt with a decorative buckle, generously lent Jesse her favorite cowboy hat for the day. With a cry of "Yeee-ha!" he took off, transformed.
The journey began with a steep climb up Boulder Mountain. Mesmerized by the battalion of tall, spindly white aspens that flanked us, we momentarily forgot our task. Some mooing disrupted our reverie. Through the trees, we saw a few cows and their calves happily grazing.
The Cochrans' herd was on what is called a community allotment. This means that cows from other ranches were mixed on the lot, all grazing together. We asked how we were to separate out the Cochrans' brand. Apparently, cowboy etiquette dictates that when rounding up a herd, you help your fellow ranchers by moving along whatever you find.
Mr. Cochran warned us that cows understand only bad language. Still, the group we came upon seemed cooperative enough. As soon as they noticed us, they started moving in just the right direction, and as we rode on, a few from adjacent meadows joined in until a nice little group was assembled. We loped along, pleased with our accomplishment.
That's when the trouble started. As the Cochrans rode on the outskirts of the forest, Jesse and I went straight through the meadow, a bit too cozy with the herd. The cows dispersed. Though we did what we could to repair the damage, the Cochrans eventually parked Robert, the children and me under a tree while they went back to collect the strays. We felt somewhat guilty at having disrupted the roundup -- but it was also nice to get off our horses and stretch our legs. After singing a few rounds of "Home on the Range," we munched on cucumbers and tomatoes from Ms. Catmull's garden and tallied up the cows we had collected so far: a mere 26, and not one of them with the Cochrans' brand.
A sudden clap of thunder brought the Cochrans out of the woods at a full gallop. This was no time to be up on the mountain, they told us, and we all immediately headed back to the ranch. The Cochrans' three sons, ages 15, 13 and 11, would spend their weekend helping their parents finish up what we had started. 
By day's end, we had spent almost six hours in the saddle -- and we had the sore muscles, tender seats, and shins scraped raw by stray branches to show for it. While we had to move on the next morning, our brief taste of ranch life had left us wanting more. The Cochrans encouraged us to come back, with one caveat. As Mr. Cochran told Jesse, "Just next time, do something about those pants, cowboy." 

IF YOU GO
Ranch Life, Rustic or Not
 THE town of Boulder, Utah (population "250 give or take," according to the Escalante Chamber of Commerce), is 250 miles south of Salt Lake City and 320 miles northeast of Las Vegas. You will need a car.
Boulder Mountain Ranch (435-335-7480, www.boulderutah.com/bmr) is open year-round. It has five rooms in the lodge that sleep two to four, and three cabins for parties of four to six. Accommodations are rustic but comfortable and a variety of packages are available. Rooms are $55 to $82 a night. Breakfast is $7 and a packed lunch is $5 (dinner can be provided with advance notice). Riding and other ranch activities are $35 to $117 per person a day, whether or not you stay at the ranch.
Those who prefer a bit of pampering after a day on the range can stay in town at the Boulder Mountain Lodge (800-556-3446), which has a "Western eclectic-style" (sandstone walls, massive timbers, rusted metal roofs) plus luxury touches like a hot tub and massages. Rates start at $85 a night; dogs are an additional $8.
If you haven't arranged for dinner at the ranch, there are several options in town, though the restaurants are only open seasonally. At the Burr Trail Grill (435-335-7503), the menu has run to child-friendly basics (burgers and pizza sticks), plus grilled beef or fish for adults. At Boulder Mountain Lodge, the Hell's Backbone Grill (435-335-7464) offers more elaborate dishes, like spiced and seared filet mignon and pan-seared duck breast with rose-hip sauce, and locally grown organic vegetables. Rosemary limeade is garnished with pansies or nasturtiums. 
Boulder -- said to be the last place in the country to have its mail delivered by mule train, into the 1930's -- is also a good starting point for a trip to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Bryce Canyon National Park or Capitol Reef National Monument.
The Chamber of Commerce Web site (www.escalante-cc.com) has links to local outfitters offering hiking and riding excursions in the area.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Vibrant Simplicity With a Wink: A Design Revolt in Old Japan

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
A TSUNAMI in a tea bowl: that was Japan in the late 16th century, a time when people were thinking extra big and ultra small. The tempests of social and political change were very real. So were the tea bowls: funky, wild-style, fanatically valued little things in a world gone suddenly, thrillingly askew.
 During the brief Momoyama era (1573-1615), warlords torched cities and arranged flowers. Emperors and nouveau riche tradesmen rubbed shoulders. Dangerous young men of high ambition and thwarted dreams prowled the streets. Doors were flung open to the West, admitting a flood of Bibles, guns and gold. As for art, what was low became high; what was ugly became beautiful; what was new became everything. Modern Japan was born. 
 These topsy-turvy conditions are the background to "Turning Point: Oribe and the Arts of 16th-Century Japan" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a carefully shaped and focused show of modest-sized objects and cumulative weight. Agitation is not played out overtly here; in Japanese art, it seldom is. But it is there under the surface of decorative ceramics, paintings and textiles, fluttering like an arterial pulse. 
Indeed, as is the case in most elite cultures, blood was an essential ingredient of Momoyama art: the most violent figures in a violent time were art's most avid patrons. The first of the era's two ruling warlords, Oda Nobunaga, thought nothing of wiping out at a stroke 20,000 devotees of a resistant Buddhist sect. His successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, nearly destroyed Korea in his monomaniacal attempt to conquer China. The words on Nobunaga's official seal say it all: "Rule the empire by force."
Equally overreaching in political power, these two men were also alike in their aesthetic taste, which revolved around an intimate social event, the ritualistic serving of tea. The custom, imported from China, had a long history in Japan. But in the Momoyama, it became an epoch-changing fashion, a choreographed, almost sacramental art overseen by specialists.
The most famous of these was Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591), who served as tea master to Hideyoshi and is credited with perfecting the tea ceremony style described by the word wabi, or simplicity. Whether in response to the era's shaky economy or to the dematerializing ethos of Zen Buddhism, he moved tea drinking from the courtly parlor to the rustic garden hut. He exchanged fine Chinese porcelains for hand-molded Japanese ceramics, the models being those of the potter Raku Chojiro. Rikyu turned the preparation and savoring of tea into an exacting but egalitarian performance that, theoretically, anyone, of any class, could master.
The stripped-down visual style that resulted is still the one Westerners tend to think of as quintessentially Japanese. But the Met show, organized with the Museum of Fine Arts in Gifu Prefecture in Japan, proposes a somewhat different view. It suggests that the story of Momoyama art only begins with Rikyu, and that the period's most revolutionary trends emanated from another, younger tea master, Furuta Oribe (1543/44-1615).
Oribe (pronounced oh-REE-beh) studied under Rikyu when both men worked for Nobunaga. And after Rikyu's death -- he committed ritual suicide on orders from Hideyoshi, for reasons still mysterious -- his protege succeeded him. Oribe both preserved and altered the wabi style, creating a mannerist version of its classicism. Under his aegis, plain ceramics were jazzed up with all kinds of surreal, Mad Hatter twists. Foursquare tea bowls were squashed and stretched. Cracked pots that in another day might have been kiln rejects were cherished. Monochrome was replaced by a palette of rich greens and yellows.
The exhibition neatly catches the futuristic zaniness of the Oribe look right at the start. The entrance to the Japanese galleries has been lined with silvery bamboo screening that transforms it into the anteroom of a spaceship. At its far end sits a single magnetic object, a ceramic jar meant to hold water for tea. Shaped as a sagging stack of bulges and coils, blushy red and mossy green, it is at once organic and unearthly and embodies a novel concept of beauty for a tradition-flouting time.
Those traditions are succinctly illustrated in displays nearby. One offers a selection of antique Chinese porcelains favored for tea drinking before the Momoyama. The other has examples of Raku ware, including a hefty pitch-black bucket of a tea bowl said to have been owned by Rikyu himself. With the Chinese link established, the show moves on to document the first contact between Japan and the West.
This was a moment of intense culture shock for many Japanese, who had never seen anyone but other Asians. As depicted on a folding screen by Kano Naizen (1570-1616), visiting Portuguese merchants are truly otherworldly, buffoonish in their flaring pantaloons and unnaturally tall, like clowns on stilts.
They received a fascinated welcome. Hideyoshi gave personal tours of his castles to a group of proselytizing Jesuits. Japanese artisans whipped up Christian liturgical items from lacquerware inlaid with mother-of-pearl to send to Europe. Such work stood at a far remove from traditional Japanese art; at the same time, it had a certain consonance with the charged-up domestic styles developing under Oribe.
But did Oribe, in fact, take a hands-on role in formulating these styles? That's the big art-historical question this show addresses. The tea ceremony manuals and letters that he wrote deal with visual aesthetics only generally. But archaeologists have found ceramics in styles associated with him at the site of his house in Kyoto and in bulk in Mino Province, where he was born and kept a home.
None of this adds up to absolute proof of his active role as a cultural arbiter. And in the end the question is left open by the exhibition's curators: Miyeko Murase, special consultant for Japanese art at the Met, and Jun'ichi Takeuchi, director of the University Art Museum, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, assisted by Masako Watanabe, a senior research associate at the Met. But they also propose that his influence, if only atmospheric, is undeniable. Just by being there and saying, "I like this, or that," Oribe established a period aesthetic, one that balanced new-found assertiveness with old-style restraint.
A marvelous set of six-panel screens from the Cleveland Museum of Art, with an all-over image of pampas grass whispering over a neutral ground, is as visually subdued as anything in all of Japanese art. It actually dates from the pre-Momoyama half of the 16th century, but the same autumnal image, redolent of both resilience and evanescence, appears repeatedly on Momoyama ceramics, textiles and lacquerware, demonstrating how a single theme or idea, distributed over several media, could contribute to a unified style.
At another extreme is a busy, brightly colored narrative screen by Kano Naganobu (1577-1654). Titled "Cherry Blossom Viewing," it shows a group of spectators watching an outdoor Kabuki performance. This innovative theatrical form, with its ostentatious costumes, was a performance art counterpart to the flamboyant Oribe trend in the decorative arts.
With its topical references and reverse-gender casting, Kabuki was also politically loaded. The name derives from a word meaning slanted or, by extension, eccentric, and its plots were inspired by the exploits of so-called Kabukimono, urban youths who took a die-and-leave-a-beautiful-corpse attitude toward life and traveled in armed packs, harassing an increasingly bourgeois citizenry. Four of these rebels appear, like a punk band, on the screen. Dressed with rakish flair, they ape the performance in progress; one leans, with ostentatious nonchalance, on a long sword.
Oribe died by the sword -- his own -- at the command of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the warlord who succeeded Hideyoshi and brought the Momoyama storms to an end. He reinstated the old, top-down feudal order; banned Roman Catholicism; and had everyday life, including art, policed. Oribe is said to have been suspected of plotting against the Shogunate. But even if that wasn't true, maybe he was too closely associated with the Momoyama for comfort. (Among other things, he had Catholic friends.) Maybe he was too adventurous a cultural power broker for Ieyasu's censorious tastes. Anyway, he had to go.
But his decorative influence lived on into the new Edo era, initially through underground currents in theater and popular culture, but gradually resurfacing. Oribe style also enjoyed a major revival in 18th-century ceramics; work by a handful of 21st-century practitioners can be seen at Dai Ichi Arts in Manhattan through next Friday.
His subversive heat may also be felt in more cutting-edge contemporary art. The Oribe ceramics gathered toward the end of the Met exhibition are especially audacious, hilarious, magical: odd little rocket-shaped dishes; tea bowls so irregular they seem to have no place for lips to land. And over every surface float free-form images: star-bursts, pinwheels, balloonlike circles on strings, google-eyed animals, psychedelic flowers. Childlike and sophisticated, cute and gross, this is anime in the bud.
And the show's concluding entry, a famous piece from the Tokyo National Museum, is something else again. A square, low serving dish, suitable for the traditionally meager tea ceremony meal, it seems to be made of two separate parts, different in concept and mood, glued together.
Its right side is painted in a bold pattern of red and white nested boxes, cheery, simple, flat. On the left, however, the pattern is interrupted by a spill of viscous green glaze, as dark as deep-sea water, that appears to pour over the rim, pool up in one corner and advance across the rest of the dish. The effect is hypnotic and repellent in a visceral way, like seeing blood where you didn't expect it. It is also absolutely modern in its shocking, joking radical chic.

"Turning Point: Oribe and the Arts of 16th-Century Japan" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 11.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
When the Summer Crowds Ebb

BYLINE:  By AMY GUNDERSON 

 BODY:
VISITING Fire Island in late fall might seem like roughing it. Stores closed. Restaurants boarded up. And as few as two ferries a day traveling between the island and the mainland.
 But Scott Ahlborn and Jim Streacker, who share a three-bedroom home in the Pines, have learned some secrets to survival. For starters, the liquor-store owner synchronizes his hours with ferry arrivals. And the local butcher will, if given a spare set of house keys, deliver a frozen Thanksgiving turkey to your kitchen counter in advance of your arrival, to ensure plenty of thaw time. 
 "It is always good to get to know the important people," Mr. Streacker said. He and Mr. Ahlborn have not missed a weekend in the Pines since Easter, and they plan to celebrate Thanksgiving this year with a dinner for friends, just as they did in 2002. 
This time of year, Mr. Ahlborn said, their fellow residents are "people who really love the island."
"There is nothing commercial about it," he added. "We've been out there whole weekends and not seen a single person." 
For many of the summer communities along the Eastern Seaboard, like Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Fire Island and the Hamptons, Labor Day used to mean the end of the weekend crowds. When fall came, the summer residents returned to their city homes, and the locals reclaimed these resorts as their own. 
But recently, there seems to be an ever-increasing encroachment of summer well into the fall, with some people stretching the season as far as they can, even into the once-dormant days of late November. 
Which leads to the question: Is Thanksgiving becoming the new Labor Day? 
For some weekenders, fall has even replaced summer as the time when they hit the beach. Denise and Mike Mulica of Evanston, Ill., have virtually given up on getting to their Martha's Vineyard home during the summer, preferring the off-season. They have tried trips during June and July. But this year for the first time, Ms. Mulica took a long weekend in late September with 10 friends. "It was one of the best times I have ever been there," she said. "We were out on the beach in our bathing suits, and it wasn't cold at all. There were people on the beach but one-tenth of what the crowds are during the summer." Getting a table at a restaurant for 11 diners "wasn't a problem," Ms. Mulica said. "And the shopping was unbelievable. Everything was 50 percent off. The women went crazy." 
T HOUGH the evidence of the autumn popularity of summer resorts is mostly anecdotal, there are some signs of a trend. Ridership this fall on the high-speed ferry from Hyannis, Mass., to Nantucket has jumped. Cape Air reports that bookings on flights between Martha's Vineyard and Boston have remained steady into the fall; in past years, there would be a huge decline in passengers the weekend after Labor Day. 
The resorts have certainly tried to do their part to keep the tourists flowing. The Hamptons have the 11th annual International Film Festival, which runs through this weekend and now attracts 10,000 people. But even the more unusual festivals can attract throngs, like the one in West Cape May, N.J., that honors an underappreciated vegetable, the lima bean. Provincetown, Mass., just wrapped up its 19th annual Women's Week, which brings thousands of lesbians to the tip of Cape Cod in mid-October. Cape May added a fall film festival two years ago, and its 10-day Victorian Week in mid-October, which attracts some 30,000 visitors, coincides with the Lima Bean Festival, booking up most restaurants and inns.
"If you came here today, it looks like summertime," said Lynn Gleeson, an owner of Coldwell Banker Sol Needles Real Estate in Cape May.
But it is just such crowds that many beach-town visitors are attempting to avoid. Helen Cunneen, a financial services consultant in New York, and Harry Spillman, an actor, used to spend summer weekends at their five-bedroom house in Bridgehampton, but in recent years they have stopped, deterred by July and August crowds. With the prospect of casting for bluefish right off deserted stretches of beach and lounging in their heated pool, they have become fall regulars, often to their renters' chagrin.
"My renters would like as long a season as possible," Ms. Cunneen said. "This year I went a week after Labor Day. I've gone as long as two weeks into September, but that's it. I like to have it back this time of year." 
Other homeowners have made adjustments. "Most renters request a longer and longer season," said Dr. Ava Siegler, a 35-year Fire Island veteran who owns a house in Saltaire and another in Fair Harbor. "Now we rent out the houses through Sept. 30."
For Mr. Ahlborn and Mr. Streacker, fall weekends are generally free of charity events and parties, so they devote much of their time to projects in the yard, replacing a pine tree lost to a beetle invasion and raking the sand that surrounds their Japanese-inspired garden, or just taking walks around town. Mr. Streacker boasts of his knack for picking local flowers and putting together arrangements that "could cost you $300 in the city." 
Bob Howard, who owns a real estate agency in the Pines, reports that several post-Labor Day rentals stretch far into the fall this year. "I just had a call for a rental through the end of October," he said. "That's the first time I have had a rental extend that late." 
The house that was rented, a two-bedroom with a heated pool, goes for $1,750 a week. During the summer it would fetch as much as $5,000 a week, Mr. Howard said.
Real estate agents from Martha's Vineyard to Cape May report that the price of rentals can drop as much as 50 percent in September compared with August, and they fall again in October. The houses are not only less expensive but the rental requirements are more flexible. Homes that may require a two-week stay during the summer can now be rented for a long weekend. Real estate agents also note more requests for larger homes in the off-season, particularly as the holidays near and as they become more affordable. A six-bedroom house in Cape May, for instance, that would go for $1,000 a night in high summer drops by 40 percent in the off-season. 
Casey Crawford, who works for the New York City Finance Department, said he was tired of "mooching off friends" with homes on the East End, so he signed a lease for a two-bedroom weekend house in East Hampton, starting in early September. It is a yearlong lease and amounts to an "amazing deal," he said, once he factors in how much a summer rental could cost.
"It's much more economical than to do a summer rental in June, July and August," Mr. Crawford said. 
Of course, film festival or not, the Hamptons can still see their fair share of foot traffic, depending on the weekend. While one renter reports securing a table at a perennial East Hampton favorite, the Laundry, booking a reservation just 30 minutes earlier -- a coup "unheard of during the summer," he said -- others have reported some crowds and private events, like weddings, filling up restaurants. 
"The last few weekends, spots were booked," said Diane Saatchi, an East Hampton real estate broker, who notes that even with her connections she was unable to get a table at three restaurants.
Visitors to Fire Island don't face these sorts of problems now. For the most part, everything shuts down on Columbus Day. But that doesn't deter Jack and Eileen O'Neil, 30-year Fire Island visitors. They made sure to equip their three-year-old house in Fair Harbor for an everlasting summer. The key to an October full of weekends at the beach, Mr. O'Neil said, is a big freezer that allows them to stock up on food before the local market closes for the year. "You can't get a newspaper, milk or anything," Mr. O'Neil said. "You are pretty much on your own." 
The O'Neils generally head to Fair Harbor every weekend until the end of October. "The fall is the best time of year as far as I'm concerned," Mr. O'Neil said. "It is very peaceful. Once you get off the ferry, people walk slower." 
Unlike houses in the Hamptons or at the Jersey Shore, few on Fire Island are meant for winter living. Even if they do have heat, the pipes are most likely exposed to the elements. "I go out there mostly every weekend," said Fran Nelson, who has a house in Ocean Bay Park that is only partly winterized. 
Ms. Nelson said she didn't mind the isolation. "It gives me time to enjoy and reflect on my surroundings," she said. She lets the temperature dictate how late she extends her visits and tries to keep the house open for as long as possible. Her record? Mid-December. "I keep going out there," she said, "until there is a big freeze."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE RECONSTRUCTION; 
U.S. Is Confident Conference Will Produce Enough Donations to Rebuild Iraq

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials expressed growing confidence Thursday that they would raise large sums to reconstruct Iraq at a donors conference here. But they faced persistent questions about security troubles in Iraq and accountability for spending decisions that could put a damper on contributions from some countries. 
 On the first day of a long-anticipated meeting that has turned into a kind of international political fund-raiser, American officials held discussions with representatives of some of the 70 countries and organizations in attendance. But they refused to venture predictions about the final tally. 
 "It is too early to tell what the donations are going to be," said L. Paul Bremer III, administrator of the American-led Iraqi occupation. But there was "a lot of momentum behind the reconstruction of Iraq," he said, both from money to be raised here and from what he said was the imminent passage of a $20 billion aid package by Congress.
But others cautioned that many countries remain skeptical of contributing large amounts of money. Besides general concerns about security, the countries object to the American authorities' apparent reluctance to reveal how past money was spent and to guarantee openness on future expenditures. 
"You can't expect European taxpayers who felt pretty hostile to the military intervention to feel hugely enthusiastic about spending a large amount of money on Iraq," said Chris Patten, external affairs commissioner of the European Union. He added that security problems in Iraq "do not appear at the moment to be getting better." 
Despite the refusal of American officials to play the numbers game, that was precisely the game that many here were playing on the first day of the conference. Against a figure of $55 billion for Iraq's needs as assessed by both the World Bank and the American occupation, Mr. Patten said he was hoping that the sum to be raised in Madrid would approach the $5.6 billion for 2004 that the World Bank has said was all that could be spent, given the difficulties of getting big projects started. 
The first-year numbers were falling somewhat short of that, however. Japan has said it would contribute $1.5 billion. Mr. Patten said that the total of donations from the Europe Union and individual European countries for reconstruction in 2004 would be about $700 million. 
The Arab nations of the oil-rich Persian Gulf have yet to be heard from, but American officials said they were hoping for aid packages from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 
Last summer, planners of the Madrid conference were saying that it would focus on money to be raised only for 2004. More recently, as those numbers lagged, American officials say it is more important to judge the conference by multiyear pledges, and they have begun totaling these pledges against the $55 billion target. 
Administration officials also said the $55 billion would be reduced by the $20 billion from Washington and, after next year, by perhaps $5 billion a year in oil revenues. Oil revenues currently pay only for the day-to-day running of Iraqi ministries. 
The numbers were not the only issue drawing attention here, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Treasury Secretary John Snow made the rounds of meetings with delegates and with business leaders planning to make investments, and perhaps reap a profit, from a future capitalist democracy in Iraq. 
There were clear undercurrents of skepticism and even hostility toward American intentions, voiced by delegates and by some of the nongovernment organizations involved in aiding Iraq. A leading British charity, Christian Aid, presented a briefing paper asserting that $4 billion in oil revenues and seized Iraqi assets had "disappeared into opaque bank accounts" administered by the Coalition Provisional Authority, as the American occupation is called. 
Mr. Bremer said the assertion was unfounded and that his organization would soon post on its Web site a full accounting of the money it has spent on Iraq. 
Many diplomats also wanted to know why negotiations to set up a multinational trust fund for donations had not been completed. Many donors have demanded that the fund, not the occupation, determine how the money is to be spent. The United States has acceded to that demand but has not worked out the details. 
Until last week, there was also bickering about the establishment of an International Monitoring and Advisory Board that would audit how Iraqi oil revenues are spent. The United States opposed a European suggestion that the board verify whether the money was spent properly, even by inspecting bridges, irrigation canals and other projects on the ground. In the end, American officials said, the United States managed to rebuff the proposal.
Another issue is just how quickly the aid money can be spent. The World Bank recently estimated, based on past experience with development programs in war-torn countries, that only about $5.6 billion could be spent in Iraq next year. 
American officials who briefed reporters on Thursday disputed that assertion. One official said that at least two-thirds of the $20 billion about to be appropriated by Congress would be spent in the first year. 
Mr. Bremer disputed the idea that the security situation will slow the reconstruction, as many donor officials are warning. In five months, he said the occupation has embarked on 14,600 construction projects, from community centers to school playgrounds, or about 100 a day. 
Still another issue of concern here is what to do about the overhang of $120 billion in loans to Iraq that have been frozen but may have to be repaid, at least in part. Mr. Bremer said the debt service on the loans would cost Iraq $7 billion to $8 billion a year, taking up more than half its available oil income. 
"It's quite obvious they cannot service their existing debt, let alone pay down the principal," Mr. Bremer said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims at Lowest Level Since April 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level since April and initial jobless claims last week matched an eight-month low, the Labor Department said yesterday.
 Continuing claims declined 84,000 in the week ended Oct. 11, to 3.542 million, the lowest since April 5, the Labor Department said. 
First-time filings dropped to 386,000 last week from 390,000. 
 The decline is the latest signal that employers may be about to resume hiring. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. estimates the economy may have added 125,000 jobs this month after a gain of 57,000 in September, the first back-to-back increases in a year. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said on Monday that he expected job gains to accelerate to about 200,000 a month.
Last week's initial claims matched the number in the week ended Sept. 20, which was the lowest since 378,000 during the first week of February. Economists had forecast 385,000 new claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.

HEADLINE: Ailing Clark Carries On In a Whisper 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who is trying to get his five-week-old presidential campaign off the ground, has instead run himself into the ground.
 Too much talking, too much flying in planes with bad air and too little sleep combined a while back to leave the 58-year-old retired general with a bad cold, a viral infection and laryngitis, knocking him off the campaign trail for nearly a week and making a hash of his schedule. 
 And though he re-emerged on Tuesday in New Hampshire, roaming along Main Street in Nashua, he was more in mime than in campaign mode. The onetime commander of allied forces in Europe has been reduced to whispering, no longer campaigning but instead "listening."
His voice seemed better on Wednesday, when he gave an economic address in Manchester. "Bear with me," he told his audience. "My voice may be a little weak, but I think my message is pretty strong."
But his full-throated delivery of that speech caused dismay among his aides. He had been told that straining his weakened vocal cords could mean long-term damage. After the speech, while he was giving interviews, his voice cracked again. He flew to New York for a fund-raising event on Wednesday night and, after thanking contributors, lost his voice entirely.
By breakfast on Thursday morning, he was using pen and pad to communicate, and his aides were nursing him with hot water, honey and lemon. He flew back to New Hampshire, where his schedule was trimmed in hopes of restoring his voice enough for the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit on Sunday night. (His preparations for the debate have been reduced to reading.)
He did show up late Thursday morning at Concord High School, where, instead of giving a talk in the auditorium, he held a tiny "listening" session with about 10 students -- in the library, appropriately, where the discussion was so quiet that other students nearby were able to work undisturbed.
His students pulled their chairs into a small circle and talked about the war in Iraq. Instead of taking his little blue notebook out of his pocket to scribble down his answers, General Clark began to whisper, and the students leaned in even closer. His sotto voce references to military strategy gave the huddle the air not of a presidential campaign but of a top-secret planning session.
After 20 minutes of his lip-read questions -- "Who is taking physics?" and "What should I say to people who want to legalize marijuana?" -- General Clark got up to leave. "Thanks for sharing so much with me," he mouthed. "It really means a lot."
On his way out, he paused to autograph a sheet of paper.
"Wes Clark," he wrote silently, adding in big clear letters his most assertive statement of the day: "I shall return!"

HEADLINE: Farewell to Supersonic Flight 

 BODY:
The long but ultimately sterile era of commercial supersonic transportation will come to an end today, when the last scheduled Concorde flight, by British Airways, is scheduled to leave Kennedy International Airport for London. Neither snob appeal nor the allure of crossing the Atlantic in only three and a half hours could overcome the draining costs of trying to maintain the aging high-speed jets. 
 The elegant British-French Concordes were a technological and aesthetic triumph. But the slender, needle-nosed planes had limited passenger capacity, guzzled fuel rapaciously and caused sonic booms that made it impossible to fly supersonically over land. Even in subsonic flight, their engines set off car alarms and shook houses on the ground. 
 The economic prospects for the Concorde evaporated three decades ago when the United States dropped its own plans for a supersonic plane, prompting a mass defection from supersonic travel by the airlines. The coup de grace was administered when the recent global economic downturn left few customers willing to pay $12,800 for a round-trip ticket.
Now many of the existing Concordes are headed toward museum displays. It will be up to a future generation to decide whether there is room for a more advanced supersonic plane, perhaps on the long trans-Pacific flights that the Concorde could not handle. Or perhaps future engineers will leapfrog to even faster hypersonic aircraft, leaving the Concorde as a technological dead end with no direct successors.

HEADLINE: Rival Airports Seek the Elusive Passenger; 
As Oakland Thrives, San Francisco Cuts Fees and Courts Discounters

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
 Anyone who has spent time in Northern California knows that many people consider Oakland the region's ugly sister, spurned by suitors in favor of the more refined attractions of San Francisco. 
 Spurned, that is, except when it comes to airports.
The nation's two most profitable airlines -- Southwest and JetBlue -- operate out of Oakland, not San Francisco International. Oakland's airport has lower fees and better weather, and the population is growing faster on the east side of the bay. The influx of low-cost air service has meant that the number of passengers has been rising even as it has dropped at San Francisco and most other airports around the country. 
But San Francisco is fighting back, driving hard to woo airlines, especially low-cost carriers. Mayor Willie Brown is courting airline executives, and the airport is cutting landing fees by half on new routes.
These efforts seem to be paying off, for American Trans Air, or ATA, is starting its first transcontinental service -- nonstop flights between here and the New York area -- on Sunday, and a couple of other low-cost airlines also plan to fly new cross-country routes within two months. As low-cost carriers make inroads on a route, fares generally drop substantially. 
San Francisco's efforts, and counterpunches by Oakland, show how airports are stretching to accommodate fast-growing low-cost airlines, in many cases more than with traditional carriers like American and United, which have lost billions in recent years. And with the slump in travel, airports are under more financial pressure than ever to find new ways of bringing in passengers. 
"San Francisco International Airport has traditionally been dominated by large national carriers, particularly by United," said P. J. Johnston, a spokesman for Mayor Brown. "But we need to grow with the times. It's a very volatile industry and the discount airlines are filling a niche in the market, and San Francisco needs to be a part of that. Even the major airlines are refurbishing themselves to today's market, which in the last several years has gone the way of the discount carriers."
The discounters are particularly intent on keeping their costs down, which is why San Francisco is struggling to lower its fees. It is one of the most expensive airports in the country -- with an average cost for each passenger boarded, a standard industry measure, of $18. In Oakland, by contrast, it is just $3.72 a head, while in San Jose the figure is slightly higher than in Oakland.
Airport costs, which include landing fees and rent payments, generally make up 5 percent of an airline's operating expenses. That might seem small, but airline executives say the slim profit margins -- for those rare companies that do end up in the black -- require that airport costs be closely watched.
"We look at every single penny when we're planning," said Stan J. Hula, the vice president for planning at ATA. "It is something we do consider, and it has an impact on us."
With San Francisco airport having finished its big construction projects, including a cavernous $1 billion international terminal completed in 2000, it is trying to bring down costs to $12 for each passenger boarded, an airport spokesman, Mike McCarron, said.
Part of that effort includes offering a one-year 50 percent discount on landing fees for new routes. Airports usually increase fees when they have to finance construction projects, so Mr. McCarron said he hoped that San Francisco International's costs would become more competitive as Oakland starts a $425 million project to add five gates to Southwest's terminal and build a six-level parking garage.
ATA, which is based in Indianapolis and has been operating from San Francisco airport for 12 years, begins its first transcontinental flights on Oct. 26, between San Francisco and Newark. America West is starting San Francisco-Kennedy flights on Dec. 19, with service to Boston coming on March 1. 
AirTran, a profitable low-cost carrier, will enter the San Francisco market on Nov. 12, when it starts daily flights between San Francisco International and its Atlanta hub. It plans to adda second daily flight on March 4. After AirTran announced its new service in mid-August, at a City Hall news conference held by Mayor Brown, Delta Air Lines added two daily flights between its home base in Atlanta and San Francisco. Delta also matched AirTran's lower fares. JetBlue said on Thursday that it would end its two daily flights to California from Atlanta and use those planes on routes between Boston and Florida. 
Delta's competitive moves how the courtship of a low-cost airline can result not only in new flights, but also in its rival, a traditional airline, increasing service. The lower fares and higher frequency could translate to more passengers coming through the airports, which means more revenue from food sales and parking fees, and ultimately more for the city from tourism and business travel. Mr. McCarron estimated that the average San Francisco International passenger spent $7 at concessions. 
Southwest's departure was a severe blow, and Mayor Brown has begun a campaign to increase the presence of low-cost airlines. In April, he met with J. George Mikelsons, chairman of ATA, at a reception in San Francisco and discussed the bleak passenger figures. The mayor said he wanted to bring some low-cost passenger traffic back from San Jose and, in particular, Oakland, Mr. Hula of ATA said.
ATA talked with several big companies in San Francisco and found that they would fly their workers out of San Francisco International if they could get the same low fares they were being offered by the low-cost airlines in Oakland, Mr. Hula said. The market the companies were most interested in was New York. The popularity of low-fare travel between the Bay Area and New York had been made clear by JetBlue, which captured the largest share on any single route between the two regions with its half-dozen daily flights linking Oakland and Kennedy.
So with the landing-fee sale as an added incentive, ATA decided to start its first transcontinental flight from here. Mr. McCarron said the airline was already talking with airport officials about adding more coast-to-coast service.
In AirTran's case, executives took a hard look this summer at both airports before settling on San Francisco International. Late in July, Tad Hutcheson, AirTran's marketing director, and Kevin Healy, its vice president for planning, flew out to meet with officials from both airports. On a later trip, Mr. Healy met with Mayor Brown, who was "clearly courting airlines at San Francisco airport for economic development" and "promised us this airport would be accommodating to us," Mr. Hutcheson said.
In August, he added, AirTran decided to go with San Francisco for several reasons: It thought that part of its appeal came from operating at larger airports; San Francisco offered the use of a gate in its new international terminal; Oakland's space was constricted and might well inhibit new service; and San Francisco was offering the one-year reduction in landing fees.
"It was certainly a factor," Mr. Hutcheson said of the sale on fees. "It's a big portion of the costs, and San Francisco is an expensive airport to operate out of."
Several years ago, Southwest shut down service at El Paso International Airport because of what it said were the spiraling operating expenses there. A Southwest spokesman, Ed Stewart, said the company had three priorities: "costs, costs and costs." 
Low-cost airlines are not the only ones putting pressure on airports to reduce operating expenses. US Airways, which emerged from bankruptcy in March, has been feuding with Pittsburgh International Airport over costs there. The airport was built more than a decade ago at a cost around $670 million, much of it financed with bonds that are paid back through the fees charged to airlines and other airport businesses. US Airways, which has a hub at Pittsburgh and pays most of the debt obligation, has threatened to pull out unless the airport lowers the amount of debt passed on to operators by $500 million.
It submitted a proposal to a negotiating committee made up of state and local officials last month and is waiting to hear back. US Airways has said it will stay at the airport until September 2004.
In the Bay Area, officials at Oakland International are not about to cede airlines to San Francisco so easily. In their marketing appeals, they are quick to point to Oakland's big edge in the cost for each passenger boarded. They plan to keep that cost down to $4.50 to $5 even though they are about to start building a new parking garage and expand Southwest's terminal, a spokeswoman, Rosemary Barnes, said.
Oakland also gives airlines a 90-day landing-fee rebate on new routes, matching funds for advertising budgets to promote those routes, and free billboard space above the much-traveled Bay Bridge, which connects Oakland with San Francisco. Mr. McCarron, the San Francisco International spokesman, said his airport did not offer such incentives now but was looking at them.
While most airports have seen a drop both in flights and the number of passengers lately, Oakland's totals have grown. The number of daily departures there increased to an average of 205 in September from 173 in September 2000. The number of passengers grew to 12.7 million last year from 10.6 million in 2000.
Expansion of service, though, is constrained by the fact that the airport is operating at the limits of its capacity, an issue that the terminal expansion will partly address.
David Neeleman, chief executive of JetBlue, said that San Francisco airport officials had been lobbying with his airline to start service, but that he has no intention of doing so right now. He said he would probably go first into San Jose. The problem, he said, is that an airport can talk all it wants about reducing fees and offering more gate space, "but what is it going to do about the fog?"

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Raids By U.S. Aimed At Illegal Aliens 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Federal agents raided 60 Wal-Mart stores across the nation yesterday and said they arrested more than 250 illegal immigrants who worked as janitors for outside contractors used by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer.
 As part of the 21-state raid, the largest immigration crackdown in years, federal agents also searched the office of an executive at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., and removed boxes of documents, company and government officials said. 
 One federal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that a grand jury was investigating the matter and that the government believed that Wal-Mart officials knew about the widespread use of illegal immigrants. The official said the government had used wiretaps in the investigation and had recordings of conversations among Wal-mart executives and contractors. 
Wal-Mart officials were quick to acknowledge the raids and said that the arrested workers were employed by contractors and that Wal-Mart required those contractors to employ only legal workers.
Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said the raid and the allegations that illegal immigrants were used in its stores came as a surprise.
"We've seen no evidence from the Immigration Service that anyone in Wal-Mart was involved in any scheme involving illegal workers," Mr. Williams said.
He said he believed that the manager whose office was raided worked in Wal-Mart's building services division.
The workers who were arrested were finishing the night shift before dawn, said Garrison Courtney, a spokesman for the division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Most are from Eastern Europe or Latin America.
Mr. Courtney said federal officials had originally sought to arrest 300 of the janitorial workers when the raids began around 4 a.m. yesterday, but were able to arrest slightly more than 250. The employees now face deportation.
Immigration experts said the arrests of so many illegal immigrants at Wal-Marts across the country demonstrated that these workers have come to play a significant role in the American economy. They often take the low-end, low-paying jobs shunned by not just American workers, but also legal immigrants.
Yesterday's arrests came after a five-year period that saw federal immigration authorities greatly scale back the number of company raids. Particularly since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, federal officials have focused their immigration arrests on facilities, like airports, that might be terrorist targets.
"This is the biggest raid in a few years," Mr. Courtney said. "This is the result of almost a four-year investigation. We're a law enforcement agency, and we're going to enforce the laws."
Federal law enforcement officials said the investigation grew out of earlier raids in 1998 and 2001 when about 100 illegal immigrants were arrested working at Wal-Mart stores in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Missouri. These officials said that after those arrests, 13 Wal-Mart cleaning contractors pleaded guilty to knowingly employing illegal immigrants.
Mona Williams, Wal-Mart's vice president for communications, said: "These federal officials are referring to third-party suppliers that we entrusted to hire legal workers. For them to say that it strains credibility that we're surprised about what happened today, those other actions happened years ago."
Mr. Courtney said that if federal officials found substantial evidence that the cleaning contractors or Wal-Mart officials knowingly employed illegal immigrants, they could face criminal charges, including fines up to $10,000 per illegal worker. He said he did not know the name of Wal-Mart's cleaning contractors or of the Wal-Mart executive whose office was searched.
In a statement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said, "The investigation is ongoing," and said the arrests were part of "ongoing efforts to ensure that U.S. companies do not employ individuals who are unauthorized to work in the United States."
Wal-Mart officials said the company used about 100 contractors to clean about 1,000 of its American stores. They said they did not know whether one contractor or many employed the arrested workers.
Wal-Mart is not the first company to face immigration issues. A three-year-old lawsuit against several California supermarkets asserts that the supermarkets and their cleaning subcontractors violated minimum wage and overtime laws in using illegal immigrants to clean their floors.
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which filed that lawsuit, asserted that some workers were paid less than the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage and that many were never paid overtime even after working 55-hour weeks.
The cleaning contractors involved in that case often asserted that those workers were independent contractors and not employees and thus were not covered by minimum wage or overtime laws. 
Mr. Courtney said he did not know whether Wal-Mart's cleaning contractors had violated wage laws. He said the Department of Labor had not participated in the investigation.
Wal-Mart has 1.4 million employees worldwide and had $245 billion in revenues last year. Each week 138 million shoppers visit Wal-Mart's 4,750 stores. 
In recent years, Wal-Mart has frequently been accused of skirting various federal employment laws.
Class-action suits have been filed in more than 30 states charging Wal-Mart supervisors with pressuring employees to work off the clock. In California, lawyers have filed a lawsuit accusing Wal-Mart of discriminating against female employees in its promotions. The lawyers have asked a federal judge in San Francisco to allow the lawsuit to proceed as a class action, potentially creating a class of 1.6 million current and former Wal-Mart employees.
Wal-Mart denies pressuring employees to work off the clock and asserts that it has an aggressive program to hire and promote women.
The raids yesterday were carried out in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. 
Immigration officials said their investigation focused on forms, known as I-9's, that employers are required to use to determine the eligibility of their workers. 
Ms. Williams said the company was assessing the situation.
"We first learned about the raids when store managers at affected stores began calling us," she said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Few Latinos in Financial Services 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Latinos in the United States remain underrepresented in management and ownership positions in the financial services industry despite the rapid expansion of the Latino population in recent years, according to a study expected to be released today in New York.
 The study found that only 30 asset management firms, 5 private equity funds and 15 brokerage firms are owned by Latinos, and Latinos are the majority owners or managers of only a handful of the nation's 9,000 banks and savings and loans. 
 The study was done by the New America Alliance, a Washington group that promotes the advancement of Latinos in business and finance. It will be made public at a conference on increasing the presence of Latinos in the securities industry. 
The study compared the small percentage of Latino ownership and management of financial companies with Latino representation in the population. The United States Census Bureau estimates that Latinos are 14 percent of the population and projects that to grow to 25 percent by 2050. The number of Latinos grew 9.8 percent in the first two years of the decade, to 38.8 million nationwide, the Census Bureau said, making Latinos the country's largest minority.
"As a group that represents the future growth of the American economy, we're beginning to gain access to a financial network based on kinship and relationships that has long been closed to us," said Moctesuma Esparza, chairman of the New America Alliance. "Unfortunately it's not happening fast enough. The heights of the financial world are still not within our reach."
The study suggested that one way to encourage financial service companies to hire and promote more Latinos was pressuring public pension funds to do so. Mr. Esparza also called for public funds to invest in more Latino small- and medium-size ventures in the United States.
The alliance uses a relatively new term, American Latinos, to describe people of Hispanic descent who were born in the United States or have residency here. Wealthy Latin American financiers whose main base of operations is outside the United States but who may still operate investment funds in New York, for example, were not included in the study.
The study cited the private equity industry as an area where Latino-owned firms are "grossly underrepresented." 
It found that the six or so Latino-controlled private equity companies in the United States had only $500 million of combined capital for investments, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of the funds available for investments in the private equity industry.

HEADLINE: 'Happy to Be Alive,' Survivor Of Falls Plunge Is Released 

BYLINE:  By DAVID STABA

DATELINE: ST. CATHARINES, Ontario, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
The man who survived plunging more than 170 feet from the brink of Niagara Falls to the deep whirlpools and jagged rocks of the gorge below emerged from police custody on Thursday, saying the experience snapped him out of the depression that drove him to it.
 "I'm feeling very happy to be alive," the man, Kirk R. Jones, said outside the Ontario Court of Justice here, moments after his older brother posted bail of $1,000 in Canadian money. "I ask that no one ever try such a terrible stunt again," he said. "Depression is a terrible thing." 
 His family, though, said that Mr. Jones, 40 -- unemployed since his parents closed the family business selling measuring tools to automakers and moved to Oregon earlier this month -- had discussed going over the cataracts for weeks and thought he could profit from surviving.
"He was talking about it, but nobody believed him," said his brother, Keith Jones, 45, who shares a house with him in Canton, Mich., near Detroit. "I think he was reaching out for attention."
In court, a prosecutor, Richard Ely, said that Kirk Jones told his brother "that he would return to Niagara Falls, go over the falls, survive and make money off of it" after he had returned from a trip to the Niagara area with their parents last month. 
Kirk Jones was arraigned Thursday morning on charges of mischief and performing an unlawful stunt in the provincial park adjacent to the Horseshoe Falls.
After Mr. Jones drove to Niagara Falls, Ontario, on Saturday with a friend, Bobby Krueger, 52, they spent the weekend partying at bars and strip joints with $300 that Mr. Jones's parents had wired from Oregon, Mr. Krueger told The Buffalo News.
On Monday morning, "they consumed an unknown quantity of vodka and Coke and checked out of their motel," Mr. Ely said in court.
Mr. Krueger said the two first went to Table Rock, at the brink of the Horseshoe Falls, on Monday morning but left to recharge the battery in his video camera before returning.
About 12:45 p.m. Monday, tourists taking in a view of the natural wonder saw Mr. Jones, wearing only street clothes and a parka, climb a wrought-iron barricade, slide into the Niagara River a few feet from the edge and float over it, feet-first.
Mr. Krueger's attempt to videotape the drop failed, but enough witnesses told the same story to convince the police that Mr. Jones's explanation for being on a rock at the bottom of the gorge was not a hoax.
The justice of the peace, Meg Belcastro, admonished Mr. Jones before ordering him to stay out of Canada except for visits to court or his lawyer's office, to keep out of parks around Niagara Falls and to refrain from alcohol or nonprescription drugs until his next court appearance, scheduled for Nov. 26.
"You're lucky to be standing here," Justice Belcastro said. "Do you understand that?"
"Yes, your honor," Mr. Jones said in the only statement of his brief court appearance.
He was more loquacious during a brief session with reporters after his release.
"After Monday, I feel that I have reached out and touched the face of God," Mr. Jones said. "And he smiled."
Mr. Jones declined to comment when asked why he would ask Mr. Krueger, a friend of more than 20 years, to videotape a suicide attempt.
"The story takes a long time to explain," Mr. Jones said as he, his brother and his 14-year-old niece were escorted into a waiting vehicle by employees of the syndicated television program "Inside Edition."
Mr. Jones is believed to be the first person to survive intentionally going over Niagara Falls without a barrel or protective container. A 7-year-old boy wearing a life preserver lived after being thrown from a capsized boat in 1960. A daredevil named Sam Patch jumped from a platform near the Bridal Veil Falls on the American side of the river in 1829.
Annie Edson Taylor, a 63-year-old Michigan schoolteacher, rode a wooden barrel over the Horseshoe Falls in 1901. Nine others have successfully followed her in containers made of various materials, the most recent in 1995.

HEADLINE: Durst Calls A Shooting An Accident, Not Murder 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Robert A. Durst, the New York real estate heir who is on trial for shooting and dismembering a neighbor, told a jury on Thursday that the victim was killed accidentally after the two struggled over a gun and it went off in the victim's face.
 Mr. Durst said that he then tried in vain to find help for the man, Morris Black, 71, and later found himself sitting on the seawall of Galveston Beach trying to figure out what to do next. 
 "I kept going over the situation in my mind," he said during four hours of testimony in the Galveston County Courthouse. "Morris was shot in the face with my gun in my apartment that I rented disguised as a woman." 
He ruled out calling the police in the early-morning hours of Sept. 28, 2001. "I just didn't think that anyone would ever believe me."
Mr. Durst said he returned to the $300-a-month apartment he rented across the hallway from Mr. Black. He said he decided to make it look as if Mr. Black, a former merchant seaman, had left town.
"I realized there was no way I would carry Morris Black out of the apartment. I went to Economy Liquor and a bought a fifth of Jack Daniel's. I started drinking. Just about finished it."
"I got the idea that the body rolled up in the drop cloth, I was going to cut it in half."
Over the next 18 hours, Mr. Durst testified, he sawed off Mr. Black's head -- which is still missing -- and his arms and legs. He wrapped the torso and body parts in plastic bags, he said, and drove to a pier on the north side of Galveston Island, where he dumped them in the channel. He returned again and again to the pier, he said, only to find that the bags had not sunk to the bottom of the channel, but were floating toward the rocky shore. Then on one visit he saw police cars, and knew that the body had been discovered. 
Mr. Durst said the following days were blurred by a combination of liquor, marijuana and Halcion sleeping pills.
He said his recollections were "not precise, not crisp and not clear."
But he and his lawyers maintain that he is not guilty of murder. The death of Mr. Black, he has pleaded, was the result of an accident or self- defense.
Prosecutors, however, contend that it was a "cold, calculated murder," after which, Mr. Durst sliced up Mr. Black "like a side of beef." And where Mr. Durst described himself as dazed and confused after the shooting, prosecutors said he took shrewd steps to evade detection and led investigators on a 45-day nationwide manhunt. At one point, Mr. Durst testified, he had accumulated $500,000 to $600,000 in cash, and shipped the money to his wife, Debrah Lee Charatan, in New York.
On Monday, the prosecution will begin cross-examining Mr. Durst.
The prosecution has not described a motive for the killing of Mr. Black, who by most accounts was cantankerous. But while Mr. Durst characterized him as a potentially violent person, the prosecution has depicted Mr. Black as a harmless crank.
In his testimony, Mr. Durst said he met Mr. Black not long after moving into hisapartment in 2000. They became fast friends. "Both of us are loners," Mr. Durst said. "Neither of us had much of a relationship with our families." 
"We both enjoyed standing on the outside looking in," he added.
"We both liked to target-shoot," he said.
Mr. Durst said he was so comfortable with Mr. Black that he gave him a key to his apartment so the older man could watch television.
But after the attack on the World Trade Center, Mr. Durst said, Mr. Black "became speedier, more frantic, more unable to make sense of anything."
To Mr. Durst's dismay, he said that on two occasions Mr. Black fired Mr. Durst's .22-caliber target pistol in the apartment. Mr. Durst said he demanded that Mr. Black return his apartment key.
Early on Sept. 28, 2001, he said, he returned to find Mr. Black in his apartment watching television. Mr. Durst said he dashed into the kitchen and discovered that the gun was no longer in its hiding place.
He said he turned to see Mr. Black reaching for the gun underneath a jacket and starting to turn toward him. "I was concerned that Morris was going to shoot the gun, most likely at my face." Mr. Durst said he raced forward, grabbing the handgun's barrel. The two struggled. As they fell to the floor, Mr. Durst testified, the gun went off, with the bullet hitting Mr. Black in the face.
"Morris was dead," he said. "I sat down and put my head in my hands."
Prosecutors have suggested that Mr. Durst was standing over Mr. Black when he shot him.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Recoup Early Losses Despite Dive in Asian Shares

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded from early losses yesterday as a plunge in Asian shares did not dent optimism that profit growth was accelerating. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly led the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher after reporting an increase in quarterly earnings.
 Yesterday's trading showed "this market's continuing resilience and positive reaction in general to earnings," said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer for Deutsche Asset Management Americas in New York, which oversees about $300 billion. "Given how many of us expected the market to react today, the markets are behaving very well." 
The S.&P. 500 rose 3.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,033.77, after dropping as much as 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 14.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,613.13.
 Computer-related shares fell, pulling the Nasdaq composite index down 12.56 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,885.51. The index sank as much as 1.3 percent in early trading after the sell-off in Asia. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average sank 5.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 4.1 percent.
 Almost seven stocks fell for every six that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.59 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 21 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 A government report yesterday showed the number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits fell to the lowest since April and initial jobless claims last week matched an eight-month low, suggesting that people are finding work as the economy strengthens.
 "We'll probably have another strong earnings quarter," said Kurt Wolfgruber, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds Inc., which oversees $140 billion in New York. "A lot of the pieces that have been put into place to help the economy, including dividend tax cuts and lower rates, are favorable for stocks."
 An index of drug shares had the biggest gain among 23 industry groups in the S.&P. 500.
 Bristol-Myers added 85 cents, to $25.10, after saying that third-quarter profit more than doubled and that revenue climbed 18 percent, to $5.34 billion. Eli Lilly added $4.32, to $65.10, after it said third-quarter net income rose 4.5 percent. Sales jumped 13 percent to $3.14 billion.
 Computer Associates fell $2.13, to $23.02, as its second-quarter loss widened to 15 cents a share from 9 cents because of legal costs. The company forecast sales for this period that will miss analysts' estimates.
 Concord EFS Inc. fell $2.58, to $11, after the Justice Department challenged First Data Corporation's proposed $6.9 billion acquisition, saying the combination of the two automated teller machine networks would hurt competition.
 AT&T Wireless Services Inc., the biggest publicly traded United States cellphone carrier, shed 89 cents, to $7.37. Customer additions in the United States were 229,000, below the analyst forecast of 384,000. The company's churn, or average monthly pace of customer defections, rose to 2.7 percent from 2.2 percent in the second quarter. Analysts surveyed expected a rate of 2.4 percent.
 Sprint Corporation's PCS Group fell 91 cents to $4.41. The wireless unit of Sprint lost more customers than expected. Net customer additions, the difference between the number of customers added and those who cut off service, totaled 184,000 in the third quarter. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Newswas for net additions of 358,000.
 The S.&P. 500 has gained 29 percent since this year's low on March 11, while the Nasdaq is up 48 percent and the Dow has rallied 28 percent.
 In Asia, Japanese stocks sank, led by exporters including Nissan Motor. Benchmark indexes had their biggest declines since the day after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
 Sony American depositary receipts fell $2.66, to $34.49, after it reported that second-quarter profit dropped 25 percent as demand slowed for its PlayStation 2 videogames.

Treasury Prices Slide
By Reuters
 Treasuries retreated yesterday as the latest snapshot of employment revealed just enough strength to stop a four-day rally in its tracks.
 A lack of economic reports this week allowed investors to forget a recent flurry of growth-slanted data and push yields lower.
 The unemployment claims numbers, while not particularly robust, were enough to suggest that the October payrolls report might show another modest rise in jobs, and bring a swift end to the week's increase in bond prices.
 By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped 16/32, to 99 15/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 4.32 percent from 4.25 percent. And the 30-year bond lost 29/32, to 102 19/32; its yield rose to 5.20 percent from 5.14 percent.
 J.P. Marra, managing director for government bond trading at Lehman Brothers, said, "We're back near the middle of the trading range now and that's not a place to take big positions."

HEADLINE: Syria, Long Ruthlessly Secular, Sees Fervent Islamic Resurgence 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: ALEPPO, Syria, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Two decades after Syria ruthlessly uprooted militant Islam, killing an estimated 10,000 people, this most secular of Arab states is experiencing a dramatic religious resurgence.
 Friday Prayers draw overflowing crowds. More heavily veiled women and bearded men jostle unharried among city pedestrians. Family restaurants on the outskirts of Damascus do not serve alcohol, and one fashionable boutique even sports a sign advertising Islamically modest bathing suits. 
 Syrian experts on religious matters and others attribute the phenomenon -- more creeping than confrontational -- to various factors. Islam is proving appealing through much of the Arab world, including Syria, as a means to protest corrupt, incompetent and oppressive governments. 
The widespread sense that the faith is being singled out for attack by Washington has invigorated that appeal, at a time when the violence fomented by radicals had tarnished political Islam.
In Syria, some experts attribute the sudden openness of the phenomenon to a far more local fear. 
The hasty collapse of the Baath government next door in Iraq stunned Syria's rulers, particularly the fact that most Iraqis reacted to the American onslaught as if they were bored spectators. 
In the face of threats from the United States and Israel, Syria seeks to forge nationalist sentiment with any means possible, experts believe, including fostering the very brand of religious fundamentalism that it once pruned so mercilessly.
"This is an attempt at mobilization," said Abdul Razzak Eid, a well-known political writer in this historic city, the country's second largest, 210 miles north of Damascus. "They want to create an aggressive feeling against the Americans."
It is, he and others note, a dangerous game. Experiments at fostering fundamentalist movements to counter some perceived threat can backfire. 
"There is no overt political Islam," Mr. Eid said, "but they are building a base, and the moment they have the chance, they will act to become fanatic, extremist movements."
Syria, of course, knows about extremist movements. Increasingly violent skirmishes with the Muslim Brotherhood prompted President Hafez al-Assad to move against them in 1982, sending troops to kill at least 10,000 people and smashing the old city of Hama. 
Hundreds of fundamentalist leaders were jailed, many never seen alive again.
Syria's various secret services then tracked radical militants around the world -- one reason the government could provide so much helpful information to the United Stataes about Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Domestically, though, Hafez al-Assad did two things that helped foster the current resurgence. He built hundreds of mosques, trying to counter the sense among Syria's Sunni Muslims that his minority Alawite sect was religiously suspect. 
He also founded myriad schools to study the Koran, which Syrians say in recent years dropped the gentle Sufi Islam once prevalent here, replacing it with the more intolerant Wahhabi Islam of Saudi Arabia.
The official face of Islam in Syria nevertheless appears particularly benign. The country's grand mufti, Sheik Ahmad Kuftaro, who is nearly 90, rarely meets reporters, using his son Salah as his spokesman.
Salah wears a tie and no beard, greeting visitors from behind a desk whose most prominent picture shows his father meeting Pope John Paul II.
"Extremism does not exist unless there is a kind of longstanding oppression against religious people," he said. "This kind of oppression does not exist here."
He acknowledged that there was jockeying in the Muslim world over what form of Islam might prevail, but pronounced Syria free of that. "Our religious community in Syria is always under surveillance by the government," he said, and I support that so no extremists sneak in among us."
Some Syrian intellectuals say militant Islam has peaked. They say the government manipulates the religious resurgence as a safety valve, periodically loosening the restraints to see who is involved so they can be monitored.
"The regime on this issue continues to put the question ina very drastic way, 'It's either us or a Taliban government,' " said one Syrian intellectual.
Such experts say the government opened the doors to jihad in Iraq to see who would go, detaining those who made it back alive. Islamic activists make up the biggest block of political prisoners, human rights activists say.
Syrian observers also attribute a heavy government hand to the fatwa that the grand mufti issued last spring sanctioning suicide attacks against the American forces in Iraq, a ruling that his son now describes as a mistake.
Yet questions linger about just what kind of influence the extremists might have. 
Some of the thousands of foreign students who studied in Syria have ended up as suspects in various cases, the most prominent in the United States being Capt. James J. Yee, the chaplain for the Guantanamo prisoners accused of spying for Syria. The younger Mr. Kuftaro says no records have been found of Mr. Yee formally enrolling here.
In Aleppo, Sheik Souheb el-Chami, director of the Ministry of Islamic Endowments office, says that he offers periodic guidance on the content of Friday sermons, but that otherwise the prayer leaders write their own. 
He called it "only natural" that a sermon would reflect the mood in the street about America's role in the region. 
In discussions with him and other officials, questions about political Islam in Syria veered off into conversation about extremism being inspired by Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
Virulent sermons delivered by young mullahs like Sheik Mahmoud al-Ghassi, who leads a mosque in the working-class district of Saqhour, provide the most startling example of the careful line negotiated by the politically inclined. 
In his sermon last Friday, he attacked the "atheist dogs" waging war in the region. He painted economic sanctions threatened by the United States Congress as part of an Israeli plot to control all from the Nile to the Euphrates. He even offered mild criticism of his own government for relying on international organizations like the United Nations to rescue Syria.
Islam is the only weapon required, he said.
"The Koran is stronger than America," shouted the tall, thin, bearded sheik, his voice rising to fevered pitch. "Be prepared with all your strength so that the enemy of God shall be intimidated."
By the time he finished the hourlong sermon cataloging the multiple evils facing Syria, many of the hundreds of worshipers in his rough concrete mosque were weeping.
Sheik Ghassi -- known as Abul Qaqa, the name of one of the early followers of the Prophet Muhammad and the Arabic word for the sound of clashing swords -- demurred when asked directly whether he would like to see an Islamic state in Syria. But in the course of an interview, he suggested that Islamic rule here would be something organic once everyone realized that the faith can solve the country's problems.
"You leaders and presidents," he said in his sermon, which also included praise for President Bashar al-Assad, "be worried about your thrones and your financial assets, because Islam will stay forever and no power on earth, whatever it does, whatever it mobilizes, can touch Islam."
In the call and response segment at the end of the prayers, when the sheik called for freeing the prisoners from Guantanamo, he was answered with a resounding "O Lord!" When he called on God to preserve Syria's rulers, the volume diminished considerably.
The problem with the Americans in Iraq, he said, quoting an Arabic proverb, is that "they are like the mascara man who says he will make you look more beautiful and then pokes out your eyes."
A few of the young men around the sheik sport military fatigues, and he has distributed various videotapes in this heavily Sunni Muslim city -- something impossible in Syria without government approval -- that show them going through calisthenics and paramilitary training exercises.
The fatigues "are a symbol of their readiness to defend the nation anytime, when there is any aggression by any state," he said, adding: "We shall not let history record that any power came here without facing resistance. We shall resist even with our fingernails, and we shall repel the aggressor."

HEADLINE: Iraqis on the Sidelines 

BYLINE:  By Susan E. Rice; Susan E. Rice, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In pressing their request for nearly $20 billion for reconstructing Iraq, Bush administration officials have been invoking the Marshall Plan, as President Bush himself did when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly last month. L. Paul Bremer III, who heads the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, did the same when testifying before Congress. In fact, however, such invocations are highly misleading, and the Congressional conferees who are shaping the final version of the Iraq appropriation bill would do well to review what made the Marshall Plan a success -- and how the Bremer plan may be headed for failure.
 The Marshall Plan's hallmark was the requirement that European countries work together to devise a plan for postwar reconstruction. Remember George C. Marshall's words in 1947: "It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe." 
 The goal was not only to rebuild Europe but also to encourage former adversaries to form partnerships that could endure after United States assistance ended. The plan succeeded so well that Europe has followed the road of cooperation all the way to the European Union.
But Marshall's central insight is missing in the proposal before Congress. Under the Bremer plan, Iraqis need not do much of anything except sit back and watch American occupiers and contractors decide how to rebuild their country. There is no requirement that Iraqis -- Sunni, Shiite, Kurdish, Turkmen -- resolve their differences and together plan to rebuild. That means there is no opportunity to improve Iraqis' capacity for standing the country on its own feet.
The Bremer plan recalls the cold war era, when the United States pumped billions into corrupt dictators' coffers and asked questions later. A return to this failed approach is odd in an administration that promised last year to revolutionize foreign assistance through the Millennium Challenge Account. To get Millennium Challenge money, a country's government and its nongovernmental organizations will have to work together, will have to relate their program requests to their larger national development strategies, and will be held accountable for the results. 
The Millennium Challenge philosophy should be applied to Iraq's reconstruction. The Iraqi Governing Council, and the Iraqis themselves, would decide where the money was needed most. Iraqi businesses would be in a better position to compete directly for contracts, and hiring local companies through transparent bidding procedures would help control costs. Instead, under the current plan, Mr. Bremer and the coalition authority will dole out contracts worth almost double what the American government spends annually on all foreign assistance, and the United States will be no closer to establishing a united and self-sufficient Iraqi government.
The Marshall Plan was also devised to be finite in cost and duration. Congress authorized and appropriated the money after careful review each year. The goal was to give Europeans a limited window of opportunity, not a limitless gravy train, and to give the American people a clear voice in the plan's operation. In contrast, the $20.3 billion proposal for Iraq and Afghanistan is a multiyear request masquerading as an "emergency" supplemental, meaning that lawmakers get to vote only once, and after a relatively hurried period of consideration.
More important, the money is but a small fraction of what will be needed to rebuild Iraq. Last month, the Bush administration estimated the cost of reconstructing Iraq could be as much as $75 billion. Bush officials say, optimistically, that $12 billion of that could come from Iraqi oil revenues, and hope American allies will provide the balance. Yet only a little more than $3 billion in grants had been pledged by yesterday, the start of donors' conference in Madrid. Shouldn't lawmakers know where the balance of reconstruction funds will come from before they approve the first installment? That doesn't mean, however, that they should bend to pressure to transform some of the proposed grants into loans, which would further cripple an Iraq that already has more than $100 billion in debt.
We cannot afford to fail in Iraq. Congress has a responsibility to examine the president's request thoroughly -- and it should heed the central lesson of the Marshall Plan and use Mr. Bremer's billions to help unite Iraqis in rebuilding their country.

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
On High-Speed Trip, Bush Glimpses a Perception Gap

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Minutes after President Bush finished an hourlong meeting with moderate Islamic leaders on the island of Bali on Wednesday, he approached his staff with something of a puzzled look on his face.
 "Do they really believe that we think all Muslims are terrorists?" he asked, shaking his head. He was equally distressed, he told them, to hear that the United States was so pro-Israel that it was uninterested in the creation of a Palestinian state living alongside Israel, despite his frequent declarations calling for exactly that. 
 It was a revealing moment precisely because the president was so surprised. 
In his six-day dash from Tokyo to the Philippines to Singapore, Indonesia and Australia, rarely did the searing suspicions of America's intentions -- and the intentions of Mr. Bush himself -- pierce the president's fearsome security bubble. But when they did, they revealed a huge gulf between how the president views himself, and how Asians view George W. Bush's America.
By and large the encounters were painfully polite, even when Mr. Bush decided to take on directly Malaysia's cantankerous prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, who declared that Jews run the world, and run it from the United States. More boisterous in their anti-Bush enthusiasm were the members of the Australian Parliament who heckled him during a speech, shouting that the United States had no right to become the world's sheriff. 
White House officials wrote off the first to the anti-Semitic mutterings of a soon-to-be-retired autocrat, and the second to the local traditions of parliamentary decorum here, which bear a close resemblance to Australian rugby rules. But beneath both incidents lay uncomfortable realities for Mr. Bush: Mr. Mahathir's speech drew a standing ovation from world leaders at a major Islamic conference last week -- including American allies -- and polls show that Mr. Bush's approach to the world is deeply unpopular among Australians. 
Yet for his part, Mr. Bush seemed determined to show that Iraq was a special case and to dispel the impression held in many parts of the world that he is impatient, trigger-happy and uninterested in building alliances. He sounds like a man who believes himself genuinely misunderstood. 
"I've been saying all along that not every policy issue needs to be dealt with by force," Mr. Bush insisted in the conference room of Air Force One as he left Bali and headed here to Australia's capital. 
He invited reporters to look at how he is now handling North Korea. Mr. Bush spent most of his visit whipping South Korea, Japan, Russia and China into a common approach -- telling North Korea that some form of written guarantee of the country's security, in return for full disarmament of its nuclear programs, is the best deal it will ever get. 
Similarly, he welcomed Europe's intervention to get Iran to stop its nuclear program, saying he was happy to have someone else play the heavy. "It's the same approach," he said, "the kind of approach we're taking in North Korea as well, a collective voice trying to convince a leader to change behavior." 
But even some of Mr. Bush's aides concede that Mr. Bush has only begun to discover the gap between the picture of a benign superpower that he sees, and the far more calculating, self-interested, anti-Muslim America the world perceives as he speeds by behind dark windows. 
"On a trip like this he can get a glimpse of it, but only a glimpse," one senior official who sat in on several meetings said. "Of course, when you are moving at warp speed, there isn't a lot of time to think about what you are hearing."
Notably missing from this trip were the big crowds that have almost always turned out for a glimpse of the world's most powerful leader. To some extent, that was planned: Thailand, where Mr. Bush stayed the longest for the annual Asian economic forum, gave workers a holiday and made it clear that protests would not be tolerated. 
In Indonesia, the Secret Service would not let the president get more than a mile off the grounds of the airport in Bali -- the overwhelmingly Hindu island of the world's largest Islamic nation. The result was that only ordinary Indonesians to see the first American president to to visit their country in more that a decade were selling Coke from a stand outside the airport fence. 
Similarly, in Australia Mr. Bush visited only this prim-and-proper capital, where few Australians without government business ever step. (Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, was beginning to take a much more extensive tour of the country as Mr. Bush was leaving.)
All this is in sharp contrast to the last presidential tour of the region, when President Bill Clinton visited Vietnam at the end of 2000, talking to mayors about housing and health care, touring ancient temples and new factories, his car weaving through streets packed five- and six-deep with Vietnamese who said America, once an enemy, was now the path to prosperity.
That, of course, was a different time, and Mr. Bush's aides say Mr. Clinton viewed Southeast Asia through the cheery glasses of economic globalization, while Mr. Bush is forcing governments that would rather turn the other way to face the threats brewing in their own villages. 
It is an unpleasant message, and the risk facing Mr. Bush is that important parts of it get lost in translation. In Indonesia and the Philippines, one American official with long experience in Asia noted during the president's tour, "people are tired of hearing that they are the front line of terrorism, and over time they come to blame the messenger."
Mr. Bush, in his exchange with reporters on Air Force One, expressed some regret that he did not have the time to explain himself better. "There was kind of a sense that American believe that Muslims are terrorists," he said, and he tried to defuse that by assuring them that "Americans know that these terrorists are hiding behind Islam in order to create fear and chaos and death." And he tried to explain his Middle East policy, he said, but seemed to acknowledge that his message probably did not sink in.
"I didn't really have time to go in further than that," he said.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES EASING OF CURBS ON CUBA TRAVEL 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
In a firm rebuke to President Bush over Cuba policy, the Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly voted to ease travel restrictions on Americans seeking to visit the island.
 The 59-to-38 vote came two weeks after Mr. Bush, in a Rose Garden ceremony, announced that he would tighten the travel ban on Cuba in an attempt to halt illegal tourism there and to bring more pressure on the government of Fidel Castro. 
 The House of Representatives has repeatedly passed legislation to ease the travel ban, including a vote of 227 to 188 last month approving virtually identical language. But in previous efforts, the House leadership has been able to use back-room maneuvers to bottle it up. Thursday's vote was the first time the Senate had acted to loosen the ban, which is in the form of a prohibition on spending more than a token amount of money in Cuba. 
The Senate vote placed the president and Republican Congressional leaders on a collision course, leaving an angry White House threatening to veto an important spending bill that contained the provision easing the travel restrictions and a growing number of lawmakers from both parties demanding an overhaul of the American sanctions against Havana.
In the final dash to approve sweeping appropriations bills, it remains uncertain whether the White House threat is a negotiating ploy and whether supporters of looser travel restrictions could muster a two-thirds majority to override a veto.
The vote also highlighted a widening split between two important Republican constituencies: farm-state Republicans, who oppose trade sanctions in general or are eager to increase sales to Cuba, and Cuban-American leaders, who want to curb travel and trade to punish Mr. Castro. The White House views Cuban-Americans as essential to Mr. Bush's re-election prospects in Florida. 
The Senate last rejected an easing of travel restrictions in 1999, by a vote of 43 to 55. But in an indication of how much the political and policy pendulum has swung, 13 senators who voted against easing the curbs four years ago switched sides and voted for it on Thursday.
Several influential Republican senators voted against the president, including John W. Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee; and Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the intelligence committee; as did many conservatives from farming states, including James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Sam Brownback of Kansas and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
Senator Michael B. Enzi, a Wyoming Republican who co-sponsored the amendment, criticized what he called an American "stranglehold" on Cuba, a country of 11 million people less than 100 miles from the United States. The decades-old travel ban, he said, merely deepens Cubans' misery without providing fresh ideas to the Marxist-led nation.
"Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of goods, but the flow of ideas," Mr. Enzi said. "Ideas of freedom and democracy are the keys to positive change in any nation."
The White House countered that allowing unfettered travel to Cuba would provide Mr. Castro's government with an economic bonanza, allowing him to cover up his shortcomings as a repressive dictator.
On Oct. 10, Mr. Bush defended tight restrictions, saying American tourist dollars go to the Cuban government, which "pays the workers a pittance in worthless pesos and keeps the hard currency to prop up the dictator and his cronies."
"Illegal tourism perpetuates the misery of the Cuban people," he said. 
Mr. Bush pledged to step up enforcement of the travel ban, by increasing inspections of travelers and shipments to and from Cuba. The Department of Homeland Security immediately announced that it would direct "intelligence and investigative resources" to identify travelers or businesses that circumvent the sanctions against Cuba.
The president's statement represented the first substantive response to a mounting outcry among some Cuban exile groups over Mr. Castro's imprisonment of about 75 Cuban dissidents last spring.
But Mr. Bush's adherence to a hard-line policy identified with the most conservative exile groups has increasingly left him at odds with Congress. In 2000, lawmakers, under pressure from the farm lobby, approved the limited sale of food and medicines to the island; since then, Cuba has bought $282 million in agricultural goods, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.
The Senate vote was on an amendment to the $90 billion spending bill for the Treasury and Transportation Departments. A senior administration official said the president's advisers would recommend that he veto the bill if it emerges from a House-Senate conference committee with the amendment still in it.
Advocates of easing restrictions said they had taken steps to prevent the travel measure from being stripped away again in conference committee. They cited the lopsided Senate vote supporting it.
With food and medical sales authorized on a case-by-case basis, the travel ban is one of the last remaining pillars of the trade embargo, which was first imposed by President Kennedy in 1962. 
Before then, Cuba's sandy beaches and Spanish colonial architecture had made it a popular tourist spot for Americans. In recent years, it has become so again, to the chagrin of administration officials. As many as 25,000 Americans visited Cuba without authorization from the Treasury Department last year, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. About 140,000 Americans, mostly Cuban exiles on family visits, traveled to the island legally, the council said.
The legislation approved by the House last month and the Senate today does not officially legalize travel to the island. Rather, it strips the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control of its ability to enforce the travel restrictions.

HEADLINE: Too Low A Bar 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
John Snow, the Treasury secretary, told The Times of London on Monday that he expected the U.S. economy to add two million jobs before the next election -- that is, almost 200,000 per month. His forecast was higher than those of most independent analysts; nothing in the data suggests that jobs are being created at that rate. (New claims for unemployment insurance are running at slightly less than 400,000 a week, the number that corresponds to zero job growth. If jobs were being created as rapidly as Mr. Snow forecasts, the new claims number would be closer to 300,000.)
 Still, Mr. Snow may get lucky, and the job market may pick up. But his prediction was a huge climb-down from administration predictions earlier this year, when the White House insisted that it expected the economy to add more than five million jobs by next November. 
 And even if Mr. Snow's forecast comes true, that won't vindicate the administration's economic policy. In fact, while private analysts are criticizing Mr. Snow for being overly optimistic, I think the stronger criticism is that he's trying to lower the bar: to define as success a performance that, even if it materializes, should really be considered a dismal failure. 
Bear in mind that the payroll employment figure right now is down 2.6 million compared with what it was when George W. Bush took office. So Mr. Snow is predicting that his boss will be the first occupant of the White House since Herbert Hoover to end a term with fewer jobs available than when he started. This is what he calls success?
Bear in mind also that just increasing the number of jobs isn't good enough. If we want to improve the dismal prospects of job seekers -- currently, 75 percent of those who lose jobs still haven't found new jobs when their unemployment benefits run out -- the number of jobs must grow faster than the number of people who want to work. Indeed, because the working-age population of the United States is steadily growing, the economy must add about 130,000 jobs each month just to prevent the labor market from deteriorating. 
Mr. Snow thinks the economy will, finally, start to do better than that -- but it's not happening yet. In September, employment rose for the first time since January, but the increase was only 57,000 jobs. And to have kept up with the population growth since Mr. Bush took office, the economy would have to add not two million, but seven million jobs by next November.
Mr. Bush's employment policies would truly have been a success if he had left the job market no worse than he found it. In fact, even his own Treasury secretary thinks he'll fall five million or so jobs short of that mark.
I know, I know, the usual suspects will roll out the usual explanations. It is, of course, Bill Clinton's fault. (Just for the record, the average rate of job creation during the whole of the Clinton administration was about 225,000 jobs a month. Mr. Clinton presided over the creation of 11 million jobs during each of his two terms.) Or maybe Osama bin Laden did it. 
But surely there must be a statute of limitations on these excuses. By the time of the election, Mr. Bush will have had almost four years to deal with the legacy of the technology bubble, and more than three years to deal with the economic fallout from 9/11.
And Congress has given him everything he has wanted in terms ofeconomic policy, even though that has led to a frightening explosion in federal debt: in the current fiscal year the Bush tax cuts will account for almost $300 billion of a deficit expected to top $500 billion. (If that $300 billion had been used to employ workers directly -- a new W.P.A., anyone? -- it would have created six million jobs.)
Yet Mr. Bush's own Treasury secretary has, in effect, admitted that despite the administration's unimpeded efforts, and all that debt, the job market will still be in poor shape a year from now. 
Mr. Bush's handlers have often managed to have small achievements hailed as triumphs by persuading people to set the bar very low. Now his officials are trying to convince the public that if, after several years of dismal performance, they can achieve one year of job creation at a rate below the average rate Bill Clinton achieved over eight years, this will constitute a great economic victory.

HEADLINE: Thailand Sets Path to a Better Economy 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Having trained as a police officer in Texas, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand should have found President Bush an easy guest to accommodate this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Bangkok. 
 They share a mistrust of their national news media and they are interested in talking about removing trade barriers between their countries. 
 The only awkward moment would have come when Mr. Bush urged Asian nations to let free markets play a greater role in their economies, particularly in determining the value of their currencies. Here, Mr. Thaksin, like his Asian counterparts, turned a cold shoulder. 
 Taking a page from his southern neighbor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed of Malaysia, Mr. Thaksin has cut his own economic path, casting away many cherished market-oriented nostrums while pursuing a classic fiscal-stimulus strategy to stimulate domestic spending until the United States export engine could pick back up. Now, Thailand's economy is accelerating, unemployment is falling and "Thaksinomics" appears to be a success.
 "You have to credit him," said Supavud Saicheua, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Bangkok. "He's willing to take risks and I think his bet is paying off." 
 But Thaksinomics has little room for free-market theories, economists say. Had Mr. Bush been in Bangkok on Aug. 1, he could have seen Mr. Thaksin go on national television to declare Thailand's independence from the International Monetary Fund and its free-market gospel after Thailand made the last payment on the $3.4 billion the fund lent it during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.
 "Today we paid off the last batch of I.M.F. loans, lifting the commitment to the I.M.F. from our shoulders," Mr. Thaksin told the nation. Mr. Thaksin's office did not respond to requests for an interview.
 Compared with the Thailand that went hat in hand to the I.M.F. in 1997, Mr. Thaksin's Thailand is a nation transformed: its foreign debt has dropped by two-thirds, the economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and the stock market in his country has soared 69 percent this year.
 Mr. Thaksin wagered that generous government spending sweetened with low interest rates would keep the economy busy churning out new homes and cars for Thai consumers long enough for the United States economy to recover and revive the country's crucial export engine. It did, and more -- the extra dollars from selling to the United States enabled Thailand to pay back the I.M.F. ahead of time.
 And to make certain Thailand continues to ride the export tide, Mr. Thaksin has held on to one important attribute of the Thailand that the I.M.F. bailed out: its exchange rate. The Thai baht, which traded at about 25 to the dollar before the crisis, now trades at around 40.
 Thailand's central bank has managed to limit the baht's recovery to 5 percent so far this year, and the strategy is working. After declining for three consecutive quarters, Thailand's exports picked up in the second half of last year and have been climbing to new highs ever since.
 "Thaksin doesn't want the baht to lose its competitiveness," said David L. Cohen, director of macroeconomic at MMS International in Singapore.
 Mr. Thaksin is due to call elections some time from now to early 2005. His nationalist rhetoric is, analysts say, part of an effort to publicize the success of Thaksinomics to raise his already high popularity before his "Thais Love Thais" party goes back to the campaign trail. "He could enter a lamppost and the lamppost would win," Mr. Supavud said.
 After studying criminology in Texas in his youth, Mr. Thaksin built a fortune by winning lucrative government telecommunications concessions. After several failed political efforts, Mr. Thaksin swept to power in 2001 on a populist platform promising to make life easier for the average Thai as the rest of the world was sliding into recession.
 Mr. Thaksin embarked on an economic policy he called dual track. While talking up Thailand to investors abroad, he preached economic self-reliance at home, and imposed restrictions on the hiring of foreigners or use of foreign consultants. Foreign holdings in telecommunications companies were capped at 25 percent.
 He imposed a moratorium on $1.6 billion in debt owed by the country's farmers, lent $23,000 to each of Thailand's 70,000 villages and introduced record-setting budgets that sent the debt soaring again. This year he unveiled even more off-budget pump-priming measures, like new housing, pension payments and medical benefits.
 So far, economists say, Thailand's debt load is still manageable, especially since the economic growth it has stimulated is increasing tax revenue. But economists say Thaksinomics is hardly groundbreaking: any student of classical economics knows that governments can alleviate a downturn by opening the purse strings. Now, they say, Mr. Thaksin is getting credit for a cyclical upturn, as some say Bill Clinton did when he presided over a recovering American economy after the first President George Bush.
 Some of Mr. Thaksin's early economic proposals were more unorthodox. He once flew by helicopter to help search a cave for Japanese gold rumored to be stashed there, saying the gold might pay off the national debt. There was none. He later suggested moving Thailand's clocks ahead an hour, arguing that it would help rekindle foreign interest in Bangkok's stock market.
 Mr. Thaksin has since devised a different plan for keeping stock prices up: two government-run mutual funds, worth 100 billion baht ($2.5 billion) each, to invest in companies the government regards as strategic. The funds will begin raising money next month. Some economists say the funds are a good way of channeling the public's savings into investment. Others worry that the funds will give the government a tool for manipulating the market.
 With the economy weak, Mr. Thaksin first raised, then began lowering interest rates in late 2001. Within a year, low rates, easier consumer credit and fiscal spending had turned Thailand into Asia's star economy. Booming consumer demand for cars and homes led to an explosion of personal finance.
 Economists say the levels of personal debt are still under control, but just in case, the central bank has moved to restrict the issuing of more credit cards.
 Analysts warn that Mr. Thaksin's stimulus policies can only delay the eventual need for the kind of corporate and financial-sector restructuring the I.M.F. was promoting in 1997-98. As companies hold back on investing in new factories, Thailand risks become less productive and losing more jobs to China.
 Rather than push forward, Mr. Thaksin often appears to be moving backward, economists say. His privatization program has suffered from long delays and Thailand is now considering rolling back some of the legal changes made at the behest of the I.M.F.
 At a point when deficit spending and loose credit might have snowballed into a crisis, Mr. Thaksin has been lucky, economists say. The United States, its economy on the mend, has come to the rescue in the nick of time and now the Thai government is working hard to keep the baht from appreciating, matching the Federal Reserve's interest rate decreases cut for cut to keep the exports rolling out.
 But with Thailand's foreign debts dwindling and money from exports and investors pouring in, the battle to keep the baht from rising is getting more difficult, economists say. The central bank has bought so many dollars, they say, that Thailand's foreign reserves have swollen to nearly $40 billion.
 With the baht thus pinned down, foreign investors have been pouring money into Thai stocks, to the consternation of Mr. Thaksin and other officials who condemn the influx of what they call hot money. In the first eight months of this year, foreigners pumped more than $400 million into Bangkok's stock market.
 Thai authorities have responded by imposing restrictions on capital flows. The latest came this month, when the Bank of Thailand ruled that nonresidents could hold no more than 300 million baht ($7.5 million) and must keep their funds in a Thai bank for at least six months.
 Investors have pulled almost $400 million out of the market since late July, but most strategists and investors still say the Thai stock exchange will continue to rise.
 "You have a currency people think is cheap and is being kept artificially cheap, so putting capital controls and so on may physically make it harder for people to invest," said Ian McLellan, an equity strategist at UBS in Hong Kong. "But that doesn't detract from the fact that people think this is an exchange they want exposure to."

HEADLINE: A Cultural Scorecard Says West Is Ahead 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

DATELINE: BURKITTSVILLE, Md. 

 BODY:
"I do not set out to write controversial books," Charles Murray says with an easy laugh. "I don't know whether part of the attraction might be the forbidden," he adds earnestly. "If it is, it's not very much." 
 It is tempting to believe him. Dressed in blue jeans, tennis shoes and a flannel shirt, his hands clasped confidently behind his head, he reclines in a swivel chair surrounded by books in his elegant study here overlooking a grove of weeping willows and a murky pond. At home in this rural Maryland village, about 70 miles from Washington and the policy circles in which his pronouncements are invariably debated, Mr. Murray -- affable, gently weather-beaten but still ruggedly handsome at 60 -- more plausibly suggests a gentleman farmer than America's most notorious social scientist. 
 But his record is hard to ignore. As the author of "Losing Ground" (1984), which argued that social programs do more harm than good, and then, with Richard J. Herrnstein, of "The Bell Curve" (1994), which theorized a genetic basis for class and IQ differences between blacks and whites, Mr. Murray has repeatedly managed what for a scholar is too rare a feat to be entirely accidental: to capture the national spotlight by arousing public ire. Is it any surprise that his latest book seems intended to inflame passions once again? 
Published on Oct. 21 by HarperCollins and accompanied by a publicity release optimistically anointing it "his most ambitious and controversial work yet," "Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950" is well timed to stir debate. At a moment of considerable East-West tension, when the phrase "clash of civilizations" has rarely had greater currency, Mr. Murray has issued what he says is a mathematically precise global assessment of human achievement, a "resume" of the species in which Europeans like Shakespeare, Beethoven andEinstein predominate and in which Christianity stands out as a crucial spur to excellence. Equally provocative, he maintains that the rate of Western accomplishment is currently in decline. 
"As I write, it appears Europe's run is over," he asserts. "In another few hundred years, books will probably be exploring the reasons why some completely different part of the world became the locus of great human accomplishment. Now is a good time to stand back in admiration. What the human species is today it owes in astonishing degree to what was accomplished in just half a dozen centuries by the peoples of one small portion of the northwestern Eurasian land mass."
Mr. Murray, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, says touting Western superiority is not his goal. He notes that he began work on the book six years ago, well before the current conflict in Iraq, and that as a former Peace Corps worker in Thailand who was married for 14 years to a Thai Buddhist, he has great respect for Eastern cultures. He says he conceived of the book as an exercise in "honest multiculturalism." 
"I thought that in this regard I would come out saying, 'Look, I'm not being politically correct when I say that China, Japan and some other places have made incredible contributions to human world culture,' " he said. "And I still say that, but it is also true that I was surprised by the extent to which Europe dominated."
Still, if his book does not get a warm reception from scholars, it may be less for political reasons than a technical one: its assumption that human achievement can be reduced to a number and tabulated by a computer. Experts have long sought to explain disparate rates of development in the East and West, from Max Weber, who attributed the economic transformation of early modern Europe to a Protestant work ethic, to Jared Diamond, who linked regional advances to geography and the environment. But while most use qualitative techniques to analyze people and events -- making observations and arguments about the past -- Mr. Murray takes a largely quantitative approach, relying on a relatively obscure statistical method known as historiometry.
"I'm not aware of anyone in my profession who uses these methods," said John R. McNeil, a historian at Georgetown University and the author, with his father, the historian William H. McNeil, of "The Human Web: A Bird's-Eye View of World History" (Norton, 2003), after hearing a description of the book. "Many use quantitative methods, but some things are more susceptible to numbers than others." 
Kenneth Pomeranz, a historian at the University of California at Irvine and the author of "The Great Divergence, China, Europe and the Making of the Modern World Economy" (Princeton, 2000), was equally skeptical. "It seems like a pretty shaky enterprise, especially if you're going to spread it over 800 B.C. to 1950," he said. "For hundreds and hundreds of years the innovations that made people's lives better were to some extent anonymous. Before we start making general judgments about individual creativity, we have to be careful about what kinds of innovations matter to ordinary people."
Historiometry was introduced in the early 19th century by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician who analyzed the relationship between age and achievement by studying the careers of prominent French and English playwrights. But it was Francis Galton, an English scientist and pioneering eugenicist, who brought the method into scholarly fashion.
For his 1869 study, "Hereditary Genius," Galton hit upon the idea of using obituaries and entries in a biographical dictionary to show a correlation between reputation, intelligence and heredity. Other studies of eminence followed, but by the late 1930's the approach had fallen from vogue as the social sciences came under the sway of behaviorism. 
Today just a handful of scholars routinely use historiometric techniques, most prominent among them Dean Keith Simonton, a psychologist at the University of California at Davis and a respected expert on genius and creativity. Borrowing the techniques of Mr. Simonton and other social scientists, Mr. Murray developed inventories of 4,002 significant figures in the arts and sciences by calculating the amount of space allotted to them in standard reference works and assigning them scores on a 100-point scale. 
For the sciences, at any rate, the results suggest a contest of David-and-Goliath proportions. Using 34 reference works in four languages, Mr. Murray produced inventories for eight fields -- astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, physics, mathematics, medicine and technology -- as well as a combined index ranking scientists from all disciplines. In all, Europeans and North Americans account for 97 percent of scientific accomplishment.
For literature, philosophy and visual art, however, Mr. Murray decided that unbiased global inventories were not feasible: the reference works were too skewed toward their national traditions. So he created separate indexes by culture instead. He also produced a single music inventory devoted to Western composers.
Even so, he argues, the multiple lists should not disguise Western dominance in the arts. As he explains it, "Non-Western figures had to compete for recognition only within their individual countries, whereas Western figures had to compete with everyone else in the West." As for the near total absence of women -- they represent a mere 2 percent of the inventories -- the reason is clear, Mr. Murray writes. Until the 19th century, laws and social convention severely restricted their vocational pursuits. 
Mr. Simonton, who read early versions of some chapters, said he thought Mr. Murray's application of historiometric techniques was sound. As a means of measuring eminence, he stressed, the method meets social science standards for both reliability (meaning there is strong agreement across sources and across cultures) and validity (meaning the scores correlate closely with independent measures of eminence like the number of prizes a figure won). Nevertheless, he added, he typically avoids cross-cultural comparisons of the sort Mr. Murray is making. 
"He's talking about things that could be sensitive," Mr. Simonton said. "It's a value judgment to say science is the greatest form of creativity and to emphasize that. Each culture has its own emphasis." 
That has not stopped Mr. Murray from using his data to venture some bold claims. According to his statistics, a whopping 72 percent of the significant figures in the arts and sciences between 1400 and 1950 came from just four European countries: Britain, France, Germany and Italy. But after weighing a number of possible explanations, including the effects of war, civil unrest, economic growth, cities and political freedom on achievement rates, Mr. Murray still was not satisfied. 
Why, he wondered, when he factored in population growth, did the achievement rate in Europe appear to plummet beginning in the mid-19th century, a period when peace, prosperity, cities and political freedom were steadily increasing? In the sciences, he decided, thedecline was largely benign, reflecting the fact that in many fields the most important breakthroughs have already been made. But for the arts his diagnosis was grim: a collapse of social values and the advent of nihilism. 
In a word, what modern Europe lost was Christianity. While other major religions, like Buddhism and Daoism preached humility, acceptance and passivity, Mr. Murray writes, Christianity fostered intellectual independence and drive. In his account it was Thomas Aquinas who "grafted a humanistic strain onto Christianity," by arguing that "human intelligence is a gift from God, and that to apply human intelligence to understanding the world is not an affront to God but is pleasing to him." And where post-Aquinas Christianity thrived -- in Europe between 1400 and the Enlightenment -- so, too, according to Mr. Murray, did human excellence. 
Even Jews, he insists, owe something of their creative success to Christian culture. Noting that 158 -- more than 12 percent -- of the significant figures from 1870-1950 are Jews despite the comparatively small size of their population, he argues that Jews attained their greatest achievements after the Diaspora, when they were in contact with European Christians. "The implication," he writes, "is that the culture fostered by Christianity was as instrumental in unleashing accomplishment among Jews as among Christians -- once that same culture got around to relieving the suppression it had imposed on Jews in the first place."
For Mr. Murray, an agnostic libertarian, Christianity's appeal is largely pragmatic. In his view it provided all the incentives people need to achieve: not only a sense of autonomy and purpose but a coherent vision of what he calls "the transcendental goods" -- truth, beauty and the good -- as well. A culture lacking such vision tends to produce art that is shallow, vulgar and sterile, he said, describing it as the difference between "Macbeth" and "Kill Bill."
"It's only by being infused with that moral vision that 'Macbeth' is 'Macbeth,' " he said. "Otherwise it's just people killing each other." 
More than his calculations of Western accomplishment, it is his view of contemporary cultural deficits that marks Mr. Murray's book as a conservative one.
Politics aside, however, the scholarly objection to the book may come down to the notion that quantifying human achievement, whether feasible or not, is in the end an exercise of dubious intellectual value.
"It explains everything about these fields except the most interesting questions," said Howard Gardner, the Harvard professor of education who has written extensively about creativity. "Einstein may score better or worse than Darwin, but it doesn't begin to tell you anything newly revealing about Einstein or Darwin."

HEADLINE: In the Democracy Of Design, Even Bad Taste Is O.K. 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
It is tempting to mock the makeover efforts of the Fab Five, but they've already taken care of that job themselves. As chronicled on Bravo's hit television series, these five gay fashionistas begin their adventures in superhero fashion, responding to bat-signals beamed to their cellphones. They leap into their pumped-up S.U.V. and race to the scene of a crime against taste, teaching hapless heteros about the evils of matted back hair, two-button sport jackets and dirty bath tubs.
 Such is, of course, the premise of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," which is full of teasing innuendos and voyeuristic post-mortems. But whatever the sexual orientations, there's no competition or consummation. It's safe sex all around. The show is even a tutorial in the safe sex of consumerism and design. 
 That is, after all, what the heroes' clueless beneficiaries gradually learn. They are inducted into the semiotics of New York stores, one catering to the laid-back, beachy look, another proclaiming "casual urban professional," a third selling funky fake antiques. Surface rules, and a match is made. 
The show may also be a perfect reflection of the phenomenon that Virginia Postrel celebrates in her new book, "The Substance of Style" (HarperCollins, $24.95). Ms. Postrel, the former editor of Reason magazine, who writes an economics column for The New York Times, argues that for too long emphasis on surface attractions and style has been attacked as manipulative, vulgar and inauthentic.
Now, Ms. Postrel proposes, it is time to recognize style's importance and celebrate the "aesthetic abundance" that can be found in the design of ordinary objects. Even museums, she points out, have recently honored sneakers (in San Francisco), guitars (in Boston) and motorcycles (in New York). Everywhere in American culture, from motel rooms to bathrooms, design reigns triumphant.
Until recently, she suggests, this was not the case. Design was less a badge of honor than a sign of phoniness. Style was sneered at as mere surface, a cosmetic mask disguising matters of substance. This was, she argues, the heritage of intellectual modernism, with its severity and absolutist prescriptions. The scorn of popular design was also enshrined by the Marxists of the Frankfurt School like Theodor Adorno, who saw a "circle of manipulation and retroactive need" in every commercial success; these postwar high-brows, like their anti-globalization contemporaries, proclaimed that such attractions were a false front, satanically seducing the unwary.
All true enough. But Ms. Postrel is so eager to celebrate design that she exaggerates its denigration. After all, there were also strong strands of modernism that focused on ordinary design. The Museum of Modern Art honored commercial style long before the Guggenheim lured biker fans to its ramps. The love of style is not really new; it is just that now it seems to have a different character. The question is, what? 
Of course, something profound has indeed changed, as Ms. Postrel demonstrates. In 1975 Holiday Inn could advertise itself by promising a negative: "The best surprise is no surprise." Now hotel chains, coffee bars and office-copy businesses have teams of designers and decorators who work with marketing consultants to promise something else. In the last five years, Ms. Postrel points out, the number of employed industrial designers in the United States has gone up 32 percent. Membership in the American Institute of Graphic Arts, a professional organization, has doubled to 15,000 since 1995. Internationally since 1995 more than 40 design and architecture magazines have begun publication. Design schools have opened in places where they were once unknown, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea.
Ms. Postrel argues that it took centuries for basic human needs to be addressed; now aesthetics can come into its own. Style has become so important it is considered a social value. Ms. Postrel discusses Styleworks, a New York-based nonprofit company that uses volunteer hairstylists, makeup artists and image consultants to create a "fresh new look for a fresh new start" for women coming off welfare and looking for a job.
All this is more than just a triumph of design over denigration. It is actually a triumph of democratic opportunity: everyone has access to objects that display "style." What else do the Fab Five represent but the possibility of bringing design to all?
But Ms. Postrel is not celebrating just design gone democratic; she is also, in libertarian fashion, celebrating democratic design, the liberation of style from elitist scolds and from arbiters of taste. "The issue is not what style is used," she writes, 'but rather that style is used."
Actually, though, that is the very style Ms. Postrel celebrates: the style of postmodern eclecticism, in which surface pleasure is the main point and the meaning of a design is less important than the simple declaration, "I like it." Ms. Postrel is not alone. This is a suitable description of popular taste.
But here is also where the Fab Five would break with Ms. Postrel and perhaps with the pop culture they emerge from. Never for a moment do they doubt the superiority of their judgment. This makes them a bit of a novelty. They recognize the existence of bad taste.
One problem with the belief that anything goes is that style is not mere surface. It has meanings. It invokes historical eras, sentiments, beliefs. It is a way of ordering the world. If dreadlocks, for example, have made their way from the social fringe to the center of fashion, as Ms. Postrel mentions, it is not just because they offer aesthetic pleasure. They also invoke rebellion, racial imagery, the mythic claims of outsiders who are also seers. So style and design deserve judgment as much as celebration.
There are also more decisive verdicts to be rendered. Does a stylized object even work? In another recent book, Henry Petroski's "Small Things Considered: Why There Is No Perfect Design" (Knopf, $25), Mr. Petroski, an engineer, conducts almost archaeological excavations into the origins and design of objects. He sees in their surfaces traces of compromises, needs, demands, limits. A beautiful glass is a wondrous thing, he suggests, but if it has a square top, it is a dribbling failure. Even a beautiful toilet brush had better be able to clean under the rim.
The simple Dixie cup, for example, he traces to the early-20th-century discovery that public drinking cups at water fountains could spread disease. He cites a 1908 medical report that analyzed a shared cup used for drinking water in a public school in Easton, Pa.: "It was estimated that the cup contained over 20,000 human cells or bits of skin," the report read, claiming to discover 100,000 bacteria in every square inch of the glass. This may have helped make the first paper cups a sight for sore eyes, even if without aesthetic claims.
Every design also includes imperfections and compromises, Mr. Petroski argues. Even the sturdy illumination of the much-praised Maglite flashlight is flawed, he points out, by the spot in the middle of the beam, the unavoidable shadow left by the bulb as the parabolic reflectors project its light.
Ordinary objects, then, must be subject to intricate forms of analysis, their economic, cultural, utilitarian and aesthetic characteristics all coming into play. A well-designed object offers more than just aesthetic pleasure, which is why it succeeds, although some objects fail in all respects and still survive. When Mr. Petroski asks his engineering students which common objects they would redesign, many, he says, mention the CD jewel box. Its easily cracked hinge, cranky release mechanism and stubborn wrapping may be beyond fixing even by the Fab Five. But one reason for their popular success is that they still seem to care.

HEADLINE: Companies Everywhere Seek Role in Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DALE FUCHS

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
A DaimlerChrysler vice president described himself as "eager" to do business there. And the leader of a Spanish construction consortium dismissed concerns for safety with a shrug.
 "Sure there's lack of security, but it's no worse than working in some Latin American countries or Africa," Pedro Gonzalez-Haba, foreign affairs director of the Spanish Builders' Association, said. 
 To hear their enthusiasm, one might not guess that they were talking about risking money in Iraq. But the two executives were among the roughly 200 representatives of oil, gas, financial and other companies from 47 countries -- including 17 American corporations like Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, General Electric and ChevronTexaco -- that traveled to Madrid to explore investment opportunities in Iraq. 
The closed meeting was billed as a sideline to coincide with the international donors' conference to raise money for the reconstruction of Iraq. But the delegates focused on private-sector investment at the conference's conclusion Friday.
Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said the Iraqi economy could transform itself as quickly as those in Eastern Europe did, with abundant "latent talent" that would begin to flourish by 2005, with the help of investment, privatization and loans. He also said that he expected that within a year oil revenues would pay for the cost of government and food imports.
The American administrator of Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, meanwhile, stressed reforms already in place to attract cash to Iraq, like laws that "permit foreign firms to establish wholly owned companies or to purchase 100 percent of Iraqi firms" other than those dedicated to natural resources. Foreign businesses, he added, "will receive national treatment and may remit profits and capital freely."
Yoriko Kawaguchi, Japan's foreign minister, called for the restructuring of Iraq's $120 billion debt by 2004, which she said would build investor confidence.
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow of the United States concluded, "Ultimately it is the private capital moving energy to the private sector that will create prosperity." He congratulated the more than 340 private-sector entities that sent people to the conference, including 16 British, 13 Australian, 9 Japanese and 8 Chinese corporations.
Twenty-one companies from countries that opposed the war -- Germany, France and Russia -- also attended including Deutsche Bank, Total and Lukoil.
"We hope and trust that we will not be punished for our position on the war in the awarding of contracts," Russia's deputy foreign minister, Yuri Fedotov, said in a phone interview. Oil companies and other corporations from Russia are prepared to invest $4 billion "if there is fair competition, and clear rules for companies," he added.
The Danish government, a supporter of the war effort, was more concerned about financial losses. To encourage investment, it passed a $158 million loan program, which would act as insurance to minimize risk, the Danish secretary of state for foreign affairs, Friis Petersen, said.
Fifteen Iraqi ministers and members of the interim governing council tried to court the foreign investors in a daylong meeting, focusing on agriculture, retail, infrastructure, energy and financial services.
Some business leaders received the Iraqi overtures coolly.
"You can't have investment until there's a solution to the debt problem and a legitimate government in place," said Jean-Louis Salas, managing director of energy, exports and projects in Iraq for BNP Paribas, the French investment bank. Paribas has not yet decided whether to try for fast-track entry as one of five financial institutions in Iraq.
But others were optimistic, despite the continuing violence. Timothy McBride, vice president for corporate strategy at DaimlerChrysler, said that the company had "plans to re-establish there" despite the hostile environment.
"We want to be a partner in difficult times," he said. "We're in Afghanistan, and it's not clear what the payoff will be. I came here to sort out the ways to get contracts. We're eager to have a chance to compete."
The private-sector side meeting to the donors conference, organized by the Institute of Foreign Commerce of Spain, was not meant to be a "contracts fair," said Fernando Diez Moreno, the Spanish secretary of state for defense. Country donations, he added, will not be linked to the awarding of contracts.
Nonetheless, that was on the minds of some participants, who grumbled that American companies had already gobbled up billions of dollars in contracts.
"The United States has the biggest slice, but we're confident there's enough of the pie to go around for everyone," Manuel Valencia, vice president at Tecnicas Reunidas, said. His is one of 13 Spanish companies that met with the Iraqi officials, including Cespa, the Spanish oil company, and the BSCH bank.
To give companies a chance against American multinationals, the Spanish government Web site on the donors' conference contains contact information for United States businesses, like Bechtel and Skylink Air, that are expected to subcontract work.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Plant's Courtship of Its Neighbors Pays Off 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: FORKED RIVER, N.J. 

 BODY:
Given the eventful history of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, people who live near the plant might be excused for the occasional case of the jitters.
 While Oyster Creek has amassed an improving safety record during the past decade, it did have its own brush with disaster in 1979, just five weeks after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania. An error by engineers allowed the water level in Oyster Creek's reactor to drop 10 feet, leaving the radioactive core alarmingly close to being exposed. Only an emergency shutdown of the plant averted the release of dangerous levels of radiation. 
 Yet today, while other plants, most notably the Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County in New York, have generated widespread concern and opposition, New Jersey residents near thisplant in Ocean County seem at peace with the fact that they live near the nation's oldest nuclear power plant. 
That relationship will be tested in the coming months, because the plant's owners must decide by Dec. 31, 2004, whether to apply for renewal of the reactor's 40-year license or shut down by 2009. But Oyster Creek is a reminder that for many nuclear plants -- perhaps most of them -- economic and political issues can be potent forces for marshaling support.
Ernest J. Harkness, a manager at the plant, said Oyster Creek has earned that good will because it has made contributions to schools, charities and community groups and has a better than average safety record.
Opponents of nuclear power contend that other factors have induced nearby residents to minimize the possible dangers of the 650-megawatt reactor: Oyster Creek's influence with political leaders has allowed it to quell protests, and its out-of-the-way location has permitted the plant to operate without intense or sustained attention from the news media. Residents on the Jersey Shore, meanwhile, have had to contend with an assortment of environmental problems, like a cancer cluster in Toms River, which have diverted public attention.
But both opponents and supporters of the plant agree that Oyster Creek has won much of its grudging acceptance from the community because it provides hundreds of solid, high-paying jobs in an area with few other major employers.
John C. Parker, the deputy mayor of Lacey Township, which includes Forked River, lobbied to bring the plant to town 40 years ago and remains one of its most fervent supporters. "People don't want to say anything bad about the plant because they're worried that the people they're talking to may work there," he said. "It would be like you're trying to take food off of their table."
Oyster Creek has not always coexisted quite as peacefully with communities along the Jersey Shore. After Jersey Central Power and Light announced its intention to build a nuclear plant in Ocean County in the early 1960's, federal officials suggested that the location was ideal because its sparse population would limit the potential human toll of any nuclear accident. Some of the county's 50,000 residents took offense.
"It was like we were expendable," said Leonard T. Connors Jr., a state senator who was then an Ocean County freeholder.
The most intense protests came after the near-accident in 1979, when many nuclear power opponents warned that the plant had come close to a meltdown. But local officials rallied behind the plant owners to ease the fears of the community. Oyster Creek soon underwent a $100 million overhaul to address concerns raised by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Lacey Township residents were reminded, again and again, that the millions of dollars the plant paid each year in taxes helped give their community a quality of life that was the envy of many other shore communities -- a low crime rate, low property taxes and excellent municipal services.
Oyster Creek continued to suffer the kind of periodic malfunctions that might incite a more excitable community: cracks in containment walls, leaks of iodine gas. But by 1992, when the owners announced plans to build an above-ground storage facility for nuclear waste, there was virtually no organized opposition and a sense that it was futile to fight the plant, said William DeCamp, an advocate who unsuccessfully opposed its construction.
Owners of the plant say that Ocean County residents do not need to battle, because Oyster Creek poses little threat. AmerGen Energy, which bought the plant two years ago, is quick to point out that Oyster Creek has improved its safety performance during the past two decades. David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group that has been critical of many nuclear plants, agrees that Oyster Creek's safety record in recent years compares favorably to many younger reactors.
But there are also signs that business and community leaders are careful not to stoke any uneasiness about the plant's potential dangers. An emergency preparedness leaflet distributed by the Ocean County sheriff lists 12 possible reasons for an evacuation. Nuclear accident is ninth -- after blizzard, flood and fire.
That low-key approach is just fine with Lacey Township residents like Glenda Knobe. "The people in the plant and the government have done their job so far," she said, scooping ice cream at a shop two miles south of the generating station. "So it's better to just not think about it."
In the months since the Sept. 11 hijackers flew their commandeered jetliners perilously close to Indian Point, Westchester County and Ocean County have been a study in contrasts.
In the Westchester town of Buchanan, where Indian Point is, officials have made the same economic arguments heard in Lacey Township. But residents of surrounding towns and villages in Westchester -- and a celebrity-funded group led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- have complained that the Indian Point evacuation plan is unworkable and have made the slogan "Close Indian Point" a familiar sight.
In New Jersey, the State Police anticipate that it would take 9 hours 28 minutes to evacuate the 244,000 people who live within 10 miles of Oyster Creek during the summer -- nearly the same evacuation time as Indian Point. But even supporters of Oyster Creek concede that it could take far longer, especially if the problems occurred on a weekend when the Jersey Shore is jammed.
Since 9/11, the turnout at meetings about Ocean County's evacuation plan have been relatively sparse, and last year, when federal officials offered potassium iodide pills to people in 18 towns near the plant, only 4,000 of the 100,000 doses were claimed by residents.
A succession of security lapses at Oyster Creek this year has also done little to rouse public concern. Gov. James E. McGreevey's aides -- most notably Gerald Nicholls, a nuclear expert in the state's Department of Environmental Protection -- have argued that the evacuation plan is sound and that the state does not need to hire an outside consulting firm to evaluate it, like Gov. George E. Pataki did in New York.
As the deadline nears for Oyster Creek to apply to renew its license, Edith Gbur, director of Jersey Shore Nuclear Watch, said she sees an opportunity to engage and mobilize the public. But with little money and no celebrities involved -- Bruce Springsteen, who starred in the "No Nukes" concerts in the late 1970's, lives 30 miles from the plant but has remained silent on the issue -- nuclear opponents are focusing on rallying locally elected officials. So far, eight communities have passed resolutions asking that the plant be shut down when the license expires, and the county freeholders are considering a similar move.
Emily Rusch, the energy advocate for New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, said the organization plans to begin a community outreach program to warn residents about both the aging reactor and the radioactive waste it produces.
Mr. Parker, Lacey Township's deputy mayor, predicts that they will have a hard task ahead of them. "These protesters are always from outside," he said. "We've seen them come and we've seen them go. But the public is pretty smart when it comes to their pocketbooks. So I think the plant is going to be around."

HEADLINE: Caviar, Pfft. Now When You Cross the Atlantic, You'd Better Have Cucumber Slices. 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: ON BOARD THE CONCORDE, over the Atlantic, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Flight attendants waltzed down the aisle with glasses of Champagne just as the Concorde broke the sound barrier on Friday morning.
 In the front cabin, Christie Brinkley leafed through Vogue. At the rear, corporate executives squeezed past each other to reach two tiny lavatories. It seemed at times as crowded as a third-class car on a night train to Calcutta. 
 That was how the era of supersonic air travel wound to an end -- a meeting of the sublime and the banal, commercial aviation's golden past meeting its ragged present. Even the most well-heeled of passengers took off their shoes at the security checkpoint at Kennedy International Airport and submitted on board to eating caviar and Scottish smoked salmon with plastic forks and knives. But an undeniable thrill rippled through the 100-seat cabin as the London-bound British Airways flight took off from Kennedy at 7:38 a.m., its wings shuddering while golden light bathed the city behind it.
"That takeoff was unbelievable, wasn't it?" said David Hayes, a businessman from Ohio who paid $60,300 earlier this week in a charity auction for the last two tickets to the world's highest party. "It made your heart race. I started crying, and my heart was racing at the same time. I held onto my wife and told her how much I loved her."
With the exception of Mr. Hayes, his wife, Patty, and one other man, all the passengers on Friday -- including Sir David Frost and Joan Collins, both Concorde stalwarts -- flew free, by invitation of British Airways.
Models, former actors, executives and journalists eagerly filed on board to take part in the paradox of the Concorde. It was the world's most technologically advanced commercial aircraft, capable of going twice the speed of sound and flying to heights where the blue sky begins to meld into the darkness of space. But it also harked back to an almost-forgotten era of luxury flight.
Concorde service took a big blow in 2000, when one crashed near Paris, killing 113 people. Then came the economic downturn, and passengers defected in droves. Last April, British Airways and Air France said the flights were no longer financially sustainable, even though it cost $6,336 for a one-way trip between New York and London and about $5,000 for a trip between New York and Paris. The last Air France flight to Paris was on May 31. At the height of Concorde service, which began in 1976, the airlines together operated 14 jets.
The inevitable farewell arrived before dawn on Friday at Kennedy, as bleary-eyed travelers filed out of limos and Town Cars and strolled through security into the wood-paneled Concorde waiting room and the gaze of news cameras.
"I got up five minutes before we had to leave at 4; it's always last minute with me," said Jodie Kidd, a British model who had stayed overnight at Soho House and picked out a beige Burberry cashmere sweater for the flight. "Too much red wine last night."
A Concorde regular, Ms. Kidd said she had resigned herself to a future of red-eye flights and "lots of cucumbers on the eyes." Unless, she added with a giggle, "you get very friendly with the Air Force."
Ms. Kidd, who is 6-foot-1 and blond, attracted an amount of attention from reporters that seemed out of proportion to her name recognition. The only competing photo opportunity at that moment was a group of five older men in dark suits who had taken some of the first Concorde flights. Then Ms. Brinkley and Ms. Collins sauntered in with their husbands, and the cameras started flashing.
"It just made the world so much smaller, and I just feel we're going back to the olden days, where you have to make yourself comfortable on the long flights," said Ms. Brinkley, who estimated she had flown by Concorde 10 times.
"I think the major advantage of the Concorde was that Europe became so accessible," she said. "You'd think, 'Why not, let's hop over!' "
That was another Concorde paradox. For all the pampering on board, the steaming towels and free-flowing Champagne and hot English breakfasts, the real appeal was that the flight would end sooner: it shaved three hours off a trans-Atlantic crossing that took six and a half to seven hours on lesser jets. Air travel was still air travel, and the best thing was getting back on the ground.
As dawn began to break, the passengers buckled in and listened to the safety lecture. Then the jet began its slow crawl to takeoff position as police escorts with flashing lights raced alongside.
"If you've flown Concorde before, welcome back," said Mike Bannister, the pilot.
Fifteen minutes after takeoff, the plane, named Alpha Golf, reached Mach 1, the speed of sound. Out came the Champagne and caviar. Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Bannister announced that the Concorde had reached the speed for which it was designed -- Mach 2, or 1,350 miles an hour, twice the speed of sound. Loud clapping. Passengers began flooding the aisle to take each other's photos, and flight attendants muscled through to serve lobster fishcakes and truffle omelets. The line for the toilets grew longer.
People waxed nostalgic. Ms. Brinkley talked of Andre Agassi praising her daughter Alexa on one flight. Ms. Collins recalled being "very scared" during her first flight in the mid-1980's. Sir Kenneth Warren, a businessman who helped build the Concorde's flight control system, told a first-time passenger to touch the windows, warm with the friction from the high speed.
Some passengers fell silent as the plane reached its cruising altitude of 56,600 feet, nearly two-thirds higher than other jets'. They stared out at the slight curvature of the earth. They knew that in a couple of hours, the plane would taxi to a stop among cheering throngs at Heathrow Airport and their feet would touch the ground. But for now, that world of gravity seemed as distant as a dream that fades on waking, and the stars much, much closer.
